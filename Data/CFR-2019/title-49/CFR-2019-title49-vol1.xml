      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

            <P>(a) Rules that the Secretary judges to be noncontroversial and unlikely to result in adverse public comment may be published as direct final rules. These include noncontroversial rules that:</P>
            <P>(1) Affect internal procedures of the Office of the Secretary, such as filing requirements and rules governing inspection and copying of documents,</P>
            <P>(2) Are nonsubstantive clarifications or corrections to existing rules,</P>
            <P>(3) Update existing forms,</P>
            <P>(4) Make minor changes in the substantive rules regarding statistics and reporting requirements,</P>
            <P>(5) Make changes to the rules implementing the Privacy Act, and</P>
            <P>(6) Adopt technical standards set by outside organizations.</P>
            <P>(b) The <E T="04">Federal Register</E> document will state that any adverse comment or notice of intent to submit adverse comment must be received in writing by the Office of the Secretary within the specified time after the date of publication and that, if no written adverse comment or written notice of intent to submit adverse comment is received, the rule will become effective a specified number of days after the date of publication.</P>

            <P>(c) If no written adverse comment or written notice of intent to submit adverse comment is received by the Office of the Secretary within the specified time of publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> the Office of the Secretary will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> indicating that no adverse comment was received and confirming that the rule will become effective on the date that was indicated in the direct final rule.</P>

            <P>(d) If the Office of the Secretary receives any written adverse comment or written notice of intent to submit adverse comment within the specified time of publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> a notice withdrawing the direct final rule will be published in the final rule section of the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and, if the Office of the Secretary decides a rulemaking is warranted, a notice of proposed rulemaking will be published in the proposed rule section of the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(e) An “adverse” comment for the purpose of this subpart means any comment that the Office of the Secretary determines is critical of the rule, suggests that the rule should not be adopted, or suggests a change that should be made in the rule. A comment suggesting that the policy or requirements of the rule should or should not also be extended to other Departmental programs outside the scope of the rule is not adverse.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose of these rules.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called “the Act” in this part), provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative proceedings (called “adversary adjudications”) before government agencies, such as the Department of Transportation or any of its operating administrations. The rules in this part describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that this agency will use to make them. The use of the term “Department”, in this rule, will be understood to mean the Department of Transportation or any of its operating administrations, unless otherwise specified. The term “agency counsel” will be understood to mean counsel for the Department of Transportation or any of its operating administrations.</P>

            <P>Section 6.9(a) applies to any adversary adjudication pending before the Department on or after October 1, 1981. In addition, applicants for awards must also meet the standards of § 6.9(b) for any adversary adjudication commenced on or after March 29, 1996.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Proceedings covered.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The Act applies to adversarial adjudications conducted by the Department of Transportation. These are adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of the Department is represented by an attorney or other representative who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding. Coverage of the Act begins at designation of a proceeding or issuance of a charge sheet. Any proceeding in which the Department may prescribe or establish a lawful present or future rate is not covered by the Act. Proceedings to grant or renew licenses are also excluded, but proceedings to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses are covered if they are otherwise “adversary adjudications.” For the Department of Transportation, the types of proceedings covered include, but may not be limited to: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) automotive fuel economy enforcement under 49 CFR part 511; Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) enforcement of motor carrier safety regulations under 49 CFR 386; and the Department's aviation economic enforcement proceedings conducted by its Office of Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings pursuant to 14 CFR Chapter II. Also covered is any hearing conducted under Chapter 38 of title 31 of the U.S. Code or the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
            <P>(b) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include only fees and expenses related to covered issues.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Eligibility of applications.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses under the Act, the applicant must be a party to an adversary adjudication for which it seeks an award. The term “party” is defined in 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(B). The applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart and in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;</P>
            <P>(2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business interests, and not more than 500 employees.</P>
            <P>(3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization as described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 employees;</P>
            <P>(4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with a net worth of not more than $5 million and not more than 500 employees.</P>
            <P>(5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, or public or private organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million and not more than 500 employees.</P>
            <P>(6) For the purposes of § 6.9(b), eligible applicants include small entities as defined in 5 U.S.C. 601.</P>
            <P>(c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the proceeding was designated.</P>
            <P>(d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered an “individual” rather than a “sole owner of an unincorporated business” if the issues on which the applicant prevails are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business interests.</P>
            <P>(e) The number of employees of an applicant includes all persons who regularly perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis.</P>
            <P>(f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this part, unless the administrative law judge determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the administrative law judge may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.</P>
            <P>(g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.</P>
            <P>(h) An applicant who appears <E T="03">pro se</E> in a proceeding is ineligible for award of attorney fees. However, eligibility for other expenses is not affected by <E T="03">pro se</E> representation.</P>
            <CITA>[48 FR 1070, Jan. 10, 1983, as amended at 62 FR 19234, Apr. 21, 1997]</CITA>

            <SECTNO>§ 6.9</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Standards for awards.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) An eligible applicant may receive an award for fees and expenses incurred by that party in connection with a decision in favor of the applicant in a proceeding covered by this Part, unless the position of the Department over which the applicant has prevailed was substantially justified or special circumstances make the award sought unjust. The burden of proof that an award should not be made to an eligible applicant is on the Department where it has initiated the proceeding. No presumption arises that the Department's position was not substantially justified simply because the Department did not prevail. Whether or not the position of the Department was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the administrative record, as a whole, in the adversary adjudication <PRTPAGE P="58"/>for which fees and other expenses are sought. The “position of the Department” means, in addition to the position taken by the agency in the adversary adjudication, the action or failure to act by the Department upon which the adversary adjudication may be based.</P>
            <P>(b) In the context of a Departmental proceeding to enforce a party's compliance with a statutory or regulatory requirement, if the demand by the Department is substantially in excess of the amount awarded to the government pursuant to the decision of the adjudicative officer and is unreasonable when compared with such decision, under the facts and circumstances of the case, the adjudicative officer shall award to an eligible applicant party the fees and expenses related to defending against the excessive demand, unless the applicant party has committed a willful violation of law or otherwise acted in bad faith, or special circumstances make an award unjust. Fees and expenses awarded under this paragraph shall be paid only as a consequence of appropriations provided in advance. As used in this section, “demand” means the express demand of the Department which led to the adversary adjudication, but does not include a recitation by the Department of the maximum statutory penalty</P>
            <P>(i) In the administrative complaint, or</P>
            <P>(ii) Elsewhere when accompanied by an express demand for a lesser amount.</P>
            <P>(c) The decision of the Department on the application for fees and other expenses shall be the final administrative decision under this section.</P>
            <P>(d) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly or unreasonably protracted the proceeding.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 6.11</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Allowable fees and expenses.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents or expert witnesses.</P>
            <P>(b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules may exceed $125.00 per hour. This amount shall include all other expenses incurred by the attorney or agent in connection with the case. No award to compensate an expert witness may exceed the highest market rate at which the Department pays expert witnesses, or $24.09 per hour, whichever is less.</P>
            <P>(c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent or expert witness, the administrative law judge shall consider the following:</P>
            <P>(1) If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or her customary fee for similar services, or, if an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;</P>
            <P>(2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily performs services;</P>
            <P>(3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;</P>
            <P>(4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and</P>
            <P>(5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services provided.</P>
            <P>(d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.</P>
            <P>(e) Fees may be awarded only for work performed after designation of a proceeding.</P>

            <P>(a) Each applicant except a qualified tax-exempt organization or cooperative association must provide with its application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as defined in this part) when the proceeding was designated. If any individual, corporation, or other entity directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of the applicant, or if the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest of any corporation or other entity, the exhibit must include a showing of the net worth of all such affiliates or of the applicant including the affiliates. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this subpart. The administrative law judge may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.</P>
            <P>(b) The net worth exhibit shall describe any transfers of assets from, or obligations incurred by, the applicant or any affiliate, occurring in the one-year period prior to the date on which the proceeding was initiated, that reduced the net worth of the applicant and its affiliates below the applicable net worth ceiling.

            <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This part implements the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, and prescribes rules governing the public availability of Department of Transportation (DOT) records.</P>
            <P>(b) Subpart B of this part contains the DOT regulations concerning the public availability of:</P>

            <P>(1) Records and indices that DOT is required to publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1) (described in § 7.11(a)); and</P>
            <P>(2) Records and indices that DOT is required to make available to the public in a reading room without need for a specific request, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) (described in § 7.12(a)).</P>

            <P>(c) Subpart C of this Part contains the DOT regulations concerning records that may be requested from DOT under the FOIA, namely, records that DOT is not required to publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or make publicly available in a reading room under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(A), (B), (C), and (E) and frequently requested records even if DOT has made them publicly available as required under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(D). Because DOT and its components make many of these records available on their Web pages (<E T="03">http://www.dot.gov</E> or <E T="03">http://www.dot.gov/foia</E>), requesters may find it preferable to obtain such records directly from the Web pages instead of submitting a FOIA request, if the Web pages contain records that meet their needs.</P>
            <P>(d) Subpart D of this part contains the DOT regulations concerning time limits applicable to processing requests for records under subpart C.</P>
            <P>(e) Subpart E of this part contains the DOT regulations concerning processing fees applicable to records made available under subpart B or requested under subpart C.</P>

            <P>Whenever DOT determines it to be necessary to prevent the disclosure of information required or authorized to be withheld by FOIA or another Federal statute (such as, to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy), DOT redacts such information from any record covered by this subpart that is published or made available.

            <P>(c) One or more Public Liaisons are designated by the Chief FOIA Officer for each DOT FOIA Requester Service Center listed in § 7.27. Public Liaisons assist requesters in reducing delays and resolving disputes, as described in 5 U.S.C. 552(k)(6).</P>
            <P>(d) Authority to administer this subpart and to issue determinations with respect to initial requests and appeals of initial denials has been delegated as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) To the General Counsel for the records of the Office of the Secretary by 49 CFR 1.27.</P>
            <P>(2) To the Inspector General for records of the Office of Inspector General by 49 CFR 1.74.</P>

            <P>(5) Any such final determination by an Administrator or an Administrator's designee (following an appeal of an initial denial) is subject to concurrence by the General Counsel or the General Counsel's designee, if the final determination is not to disclose a record or portion of a record under this part, or not to grant a request for a fee waiver or reduction.</P>
            <P>(6) The Inspector General or the Inspector General's designee must consult with the General Counsel or the General Counsel's designee before issuing a final determination following an appeal of an initial denial, if the final determination is not to disclose a record or portion of a record under this part, or not to grant a request for a fee waiver or reduction.</P>

            <P>(a) Each person desiring access to or a copy of a record covered by this subpart must make a written request (via paper, facsimile or electronic mail) for the record. The request should—</P>
            <P>(1) Indicate that it is being made under FOIA;<PRTPAGE P="67"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) Display the word “FOIA” prominently on the envelope or on the subject line of the email or facsimile;</P>
            <P>(3) Be addressed to the appropriate FOIA Requester Service Center as set forth in § 7.27;</P>
            <P>(4) State the format (e.g., paper, compact disc) in which the information is sought, if the requester has a preference (see § 7.26(c)); and</P>
            <P>(5) Describe the record or records sought to the fullest extent possible. In this regard, the request should describe the subject matter of the record and, if known, indicate the date when it was made, the place where it was made, and the individual or office that made it. If the description does not enable the office handling the request to identify or locate the record sought, that office will contact the requester for additional information. So that the office may contact the requester for additional information, the request should provide the requester's complete contact information, including name, address, telephone number, and email address, if any.</P>
            <P>(b) With respect to fees, the request must—</P>
            <P>(1) Specify the fee category (commercial use, news media, educational institution, noncommercial scientific institution, or other; see § 7.42(g)) in which the requester claims the request falls and the basis of this claim (see subpart E of this Part for fees and fee waiver requirements);</P>
            <P>(2) Support any request for fee waiver by addressing, to the fullest extent possible, how the criteria set out in § 7.43(c) for establishing that the request is in the public interest have been met, if relevant;</P>
            <P>(3) State the maximum amount of fees that the requester is willing to pay and/or include a request for a fee waiver or reduction (if a maximum amount is not stated by the requester, DOT will assume the requester is willing to pay up to US $25);</P>
            <P>(c) If the requester seeks expedited processing at the time of the initial request, the request must include a statement supporting expedited processing, as set forth in § 7.31(c);</P>
            <P>(d) A request is not considered to be a FOIA request if the record or records sought are insufficiently described such that DOT is unable to respond as required by FOIA. The twenty Federal working day limit for responding to requests, described in § 7.31(a)(2), will not start to run until the request is determined by DOT to be sufficiently understood to enable DOT to respond as contemplated under FOIA (or would have been so determined with the exercise of due diligence by an employee of DOT) and is considered received (see paragraph (e)); and</P>
            <P>(e) Provided the request is considered to be a FOIA request (see paragraph (d)), the request is considered received when it is first received by the FOIA office to which it should have been originally sent, as shown in § 7.27, but in any event not later than ten Federal working days after it is first received by any DOT FOIA Requester Service Center identified in § 7.27.</P>
            <P>(f) As provided in § 7.35, DOT's time limit for responding to a FOIA request as set forth in subpart D may be tolled one time to seek additional information needed to clarify the request and as often as necessary to clarify fee issues with the requester.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How does DOT handle first-party requests?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) DOT processes FOIA requests from first-party requesters in accordance with this regulation. DOT also processes such requests in accordance with the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) if the records reside in a Privacy Act system of records (defined in 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(5) as a system from which information is retrieved by the individual's name or some other personal identifier). Whichever statute provides greater access is controlling.</P>
            <P>(b) First party requesters must establish their identity to DOT's satisfaction before DOT will process the request under the Privacy Act. DOT may request that first party requesters authenticate their identity to assist with our evaluation of the application of FOIA exemptions, such as FOIA Exemption 6, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6), to the requested records. Acceptable methods of authenticating the requester's identity include those outlined in DOT's Privacy Act regulations at 49 CFR 10.37.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 7.26</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>To what extent and in what format are records searched and made available?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Existing records.</E> A request may seek only records that are in existence at the time of the request. In determining which records are responsive to a request, DOT ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date it begins its search for them. If any other date is used, DOT will inform the requester of that date. DOT considers records created after the beginning of the search to be non-responsive to a request. A request made under this subpart may not require that new records be created in response to the request by, for example, combining or compiling selected items from manual files, preparing a new computer program, or calculating proportions, percentages, frequency distributions, trends, or comparisons. DOT may, in its discretion, create a new record as an alternative to disclosing existing records, if DOT determines that creating a new record will be less burdensome than disclosing large volumes of unassembled material and if the requester consents to accept the newly-created record in lieu of the existing records.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Electronic records.</E> DOT makes a reasonable effort to search electronic records without significantly interfering with the operation of the affected information system.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Format of production.</E> DOT provides records in the form or format sought by the requester, if the records are readily reproducible in that form or format.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Photocopying of records.</E> Original records ordinarily are copied except where, in DOT's judgment, copying would endanger the quality of the original or raise the reasonable possibility of irreparable harm to the record. Original records are not released from DOT custody. DOT may make records requested under this subpart available for inspection and copying during regular business hours at the place where the records are located.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">If no responsive record is located.</E> If DOT cannot locate a requested record in agency files after a reasonable search (e.g., because the record was never created or was disposed of), DOT so notifies the requester.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How does DOT handle requests that concern more than one Government agency?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If the release of a DOT-created record covered by this subpart would be of concern to DOT and one or more other Federal agencies, the determination as to release is made by DOT, but only after consultation with the other concerned agency.</P>
            <P>(b) If the release of a DOT-created record covered by this subpart would be of concern to DOT and a State, local, or tribal Government, a territory or possession of the United States, or a foreign Government, the determination as to release is made by DOT, but only after consultation with the other concerned Governmental jurisdiction.</P>
            <P>(c) DOT refers a request for a non-DOT-created record covered by this subpart (or the relevant portion thereof) for decision by the Federal agency that is best able to determine the record's exemption status (usually, this is the agency that originated the record), but only if that agency is subject to FOIA. DOT makes such referrals expeditiously and notifies the requester in writing that a referral has been made. DOT informs the requester that the Federal agency to which DOT referred the request will respond to the request, unless DOT is precluded from attributing the record in question to that agency.</P>
            <P>(d) DOT components will handle all consultations and referrals they receive from other agencies or DOT components according to the date the FOIA request initially was received by the first agency or DOT component, not any later date.</P>

            <SUBJECT>When and how does DOT consult with submitters of commercial information?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If DOT receives a request for a record that includes information designated by the submitter of the information as confidential commercial information, or that DOT has some other reason to believe may contain information of that type (see § 7.23(c)(4)), DOT notifies the submitter expeditiously and asks the submitter to submit any written objections to release (unless paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section apply). At the same time, DOT notifies the requester that notice and an opportunity to comment are being provided to the submitter. To the extent permitted by law, DOT affords the submitter a reasonable period of time to provide a detailed statement of any such objections. The submitter's statement must specify all grounds for withholding any of the information. The burden is on the submitter to identify with specificity all information for which exempt treatment is sought and to persuade the agency that the information should not be disclosed.</P>

            <P>(b) The responsible DOT component, to the extent permitted by law, considers carefully a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to determining whether to disclose commercial information. Whenever DOT decides to disclose such information over the objection of a submitter, the office responsible for the decision provides the submitter with a written notice of intent to disclose, which is sent to the submitter a reasonable number of days prior to the specified date upon which disclosure is intended. The written notice to the submitter includes:<PRTPAGE P="70"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) A statement of the reasons for which the submitter's disclosure objections were not accepted;</P>

            <P>(3) A specific disclosure date.</P>
            <P>(c) The notice requirements of this section do not apply if:</P>
            <P>(1) DOT determines that the information should not be disclosed;</P>
            <P>(2) The information lawfully has been published or otherwise made available to the public; or</P>
            <P>(3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552).</P>
            <P>(d) The procedures established in this section do not apply in the case of:</P>
            <P>(1) Information submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and addressed in 49 CFR part 512.</P>
            <P>(2) Information contained in a document to be filed or in oral testimony that is sought to be withheld pursuant to Rule 12 of the Rules of Practice in Aviation Economic Proceedings (14 CFR 302.12).</P>
            <P>(3) Information submitted to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and addressed in 49 CFR 389.9.</P>
            <P>(e) Whenever a requester brings suit seeking to compel disclosure of confidential commercial information, the responsible DOT component promptly notifies the submitter.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> (1) DOT ordinarily responds to requests according to their order of receipt.</P>
            <P>(2) DOT makes an initial determination whether to release a record requested pursuant to subpart C of this Part within twenty Federal working days after the request is received by the appropriate FOIA Requester Service Center designated in § 7.27, except that DOT may extend this time limit by up to ten Federal working days, or longer, in accordance with § 7.34. In addition, DOT may toll this time limit one time to seek additional information needed to clarify the request and as often as necessary to clarify fee issues with the requester (see § 7.35).</P>
            <P>(3) DOT notifies the requester of DOT's initial determination. If DOT decides to grant the request in full or in part, DOT makes the record (or the granted part) available as promptly as possible and provides the requester with written notification of DOT's determination, the reasons for the determination, and the right of the requester to seek assistance from the FOIA Public Liaison. If DOT denies the request in full or in part, because the record (or the denied part) is subject to an exemption, is not within DOT's custody and control, or was not located following a reasonable search, DOT notifies the requester of the denial in writing and includes in the notice the reason for the determination, the right of the requester to appeal the determination, the name and title of each individual responsible for the initial determination to deny the request, and the requester's right to seek dispute resolution services from the FOIA Public Liaison or the Office of Government Information Services. The denial letter includes an estimate of the volume of records or information withheld, in number of pages or other reasonable form of estimation. This estimate does not need to be provided if the volume is otherwise indicated through deletions on records disclosed in part, or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. DOT marks or annotates records disclosed in part to show both the amount and location of the information deleted whenever practicable (see § 7.23(d)).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Multi-track processing of initial requests.</E> (1) A DOT component may use two or more processing tracks by distinguishing between simple and more complex requests based on the amount of work and/or time needed to process the request, or based on the number of pages involved.<PRTPAGE P="71"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) A DOT component using multi-track processing may provide requesters in its slower track(s) with an opportunity to limit the scope of their requests in order to qualify for faster processing within the specified limits of the component's faster track(s). In that event, the component contacts the requester either by telephone, letter, facsimile, or electronic mail, whichever is most efficient in each case.</P>
            <P>(3) Upon receipt of a request that will take longer than ten days to process, a DOT component shall assign an individualized tracking number to the request and notify the requester of the assigned number. Requesters may contact the appropriate DOT component FOIA Requester Service Center to determine the status of the request.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Expedited processing of initial requests.</E> (1) Requests are processed out of order and given expedited treatment whenever a compelling need is demonstrated and DOT determines that the compelling need involves:</P>
            <P>(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</P>
            <P>(ii) A request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, with a time urgency to inform the public of actual or alleged Federal Government activity.</P>
            <P>(2) A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of the initial request for records or at any later time. For a prompt determination, the request for expedited processing must be received by the FOIA office for the component that maintains the records requested, as identified in § 7.27.</P>
            <P>(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that individual's knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing. A requester within the category in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the Government activity involved in the request, beyond the public's right to know about Government activity generally.</P>
            <P>(4) Within ten calendar days of receipt of a request for expedited processing, the proper component decides whether to grant it and notifies the requester of the decision. If DOT grants a request for expedited treatment, the request is given priority and is processed as soon as practicable. If DOT denies a request for expedited processing, any appeal of that denial is acted on expeditiously.</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Right to administrative appeal.</E> Any requester to whom a record has not been made available within the time limits established by § 7.31 and any requester who has been provided a written determination pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section may appeal to the responsible DOT official.<PRTPAGE P="72"/>
            </P>

            <P>(1) Each appeal must be made in writing to the appropriate DOT appeal official and postmarked or, in the case of electronic or facsimile transmissions transmitted, within ninety calendar days from the date the initial determination is signed and should include the DOT file or reference number assigned to the request and all information and arguments relied upon by the person making the request. The contact information for all DOT component appeal officials is identified in the DOT FOIA Reference Guide available at <E T="03">https://www.transportation.gov/foia.</E> The envelope in which a mailed appeal is sent or the subject line of an appeal sent electronically or by facsimile should be prominently marked: “FOIA Appeal.” The twenty Federal working day limit described in § 7.33(a) will not begin to run until the appeal has been received by the appropriate office and identified as an appeal under FOIA, or would have been so identified with the exercise of due diligence, by a DOT employee.</P>
            <P>(2) Whenever the responsible DOT official determines it is necessary, the official may require the requester to furnish additional information, or proof of factual allegations, and may order other proceedings appropriate in the circumstances. DOT's time limit for responding to an appeal may be extended as provided in § 7.34. The decision of the responsible DOT official as to the availability of the record, the appropriateness of a fee waiver or reduction, or the appropriateness of expedited processing, constitutes final agency action for the purpose of judicial review.</P>
            <P>(3) The decision of the responsible DOT official to deny a record request, to deny a request for a fee waiver or reduction, or to deny a request for expedited processing is considered to be a denial by the Secretary for the purpose of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(B).</P>
            <P>(4) When the responsible DOT official denies an appeal, the requester is informed in writing of the reasons for the denial of the request and the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the determination, and that judicial review of the determination is available in the United States District Court for the judicial district in which the requester resides or has his or her principal place of business, the judicial district in which the requested records are located, or the District of Columbia.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Right to judicial review.</E> Any requester who has not received an initial determination on his or her request within the time limits established by § 7.31 can seek immediate judicial review, which may be sought without the need to first submit an administrative appeal. Any requester who has received a written determination denying his or her administrative appeal or who has not received a written determination of his or her administrative appeal within the time limits established by § 7.33 can seek judicial review. A determination that a record request is denied, that a request for a fee waiver or reduction is denied, and/or that a request for expedited processing is denied does not constitute final agency action for the purpose of judicial review unless it is made by the responsible DOT official. Judicial review may be sought in the United States District Court for the judicial district in which the requester resides or has his or her principal place of business, the judicial district in which the requested records are located, or the District of Columbia.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> (1) DOT ordinarily processes appeals according to their order of receipt.</P>

            <P>(2) DOT issues a determination with respect to any appeal made pursuant to § 7.32(d) within twenty Federal working days after receipt of such appeal, except that in unusual circumstances DOT may extend this time limit by up to ten Federal working days in accordance with § 7.34(a) or for more than ten Federal working days in accordance with § 7.34(b). DOT notifies the requester making the appeal immediately, in writing, if the agency takes an extension of time. DOT may inform the requester making the appeal, at any time, of exceptional circumstances delaying the processing of the appeal (see § 7.34(c)).<PRTPAGE P="73"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Multi-track processing of appeals.</E> (1) A DOT component may use two or more processing tracks by distinguishing between simple and more complex appeals based on the amount of work and/or time needed to process the appeal, or based on the amount of information involved.</P>
            <P>(2) A DOT component using multi-track processing may provide persons making appeals in its slower track(s) with an opportunity to limit the scope of their appeals in order to qualify for faster processing within the specified limits of the component's faster track(s). A component doing so will contact the person making the appeal either by telephone, letter, facsimile, or electronic mail, whichever is most efficient in each case.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Expedited processing of appeals.</E> (1) An appeal is processed out of order and given expedited treatment whenever a compelling need is demonstrated and DOT determines that the compelling need involves:</P>
            <P>(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</P>
            <P>(ii) A request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, with a time urgency to inform the public of actual or alleged Federal Government activity.</P>
            <P>(2) A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of the appeal or at a later time. For a prompt determination, a request for expedited processing must be received by the component that is processing the appeal for the records requested.</P>
            <P>(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that individual's knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing. A requester within the category in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section must establish a particular time urgency to inform the public about the Government activity involved in the request, beyond the public's right to know about Government activity generally. A person granted expedited processing under § 7.31(c) need merely certify that the same circumstances apply.</P>
            <P>(4) Within ten calendar days of receipt of a request for expedited processing, the proper component will decide whether to grant it and will notify the requester of the decision. If a request for expedited treatment is granted, the appeal will be given priority and will be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing of an appeal is denied, no further administrative recourse is available.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 7.34</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>When and how are time limits applicable to DOT extended?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In unusual circumstances as specified in this section, DOT may extend the time limits prescribed in §§ 7.31 and 7.33 by written notice to the person making the request or appeal, setting forth the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be issued. Such notice may not specify a date that would result in a cumulative extension of more than ten Federal working days without providing the requester an opportunity to modify the request as noted in this section. As used in this paragraph, “unusual circumstances” means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request:</P>
            <P>(1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;</P>
            <P>(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are demanded in a single request; and/or</P>
            <P>(3) The need for consultation, which will be conducted with all practicable speed, with any other agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more DOT components having substantial interest therein.</P>

            <P>(b) When the extension is for more than ten Federal working days, the written notice provides the requester with an opportunity to either modify the request (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> by narrowing the record types or date ranges) so that it may be processed within the extended time limit, or arrange an alternative time period with the DOT component for processing the request (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> by <PRTPAGE P="74"/>prioritizing portions of the request). The written notice also will notify the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.</P>
            <P>(c) The DOT component may inform the requester, at any time, of exceptional circumstances that apply to the processing of the request or appeal (e.g., if the component is reducing a backlog of requests or appeals in addition to processing current requests, or is experiencing an unexpected deluge of requests or appeals), as provided in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(C).</P>
            <P>(d) When a DOT component reasonably believes that multiple requests submitted by a requester, or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances, and the requests involve clearly related matters, DOT may aggregate the requests for the purposes of fees and processing activities, which may result in an extension of the processing time. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters are not aggregated.</P>

            <SUBJECT>When and how are processing fees imposed for records that are made available under subpart B or processed under subpart C of this part?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) DOT imposes fees for services that DOT performs for the public under subparts B and C of this part. Fees apply to all required and special services performed by DOT employees, including employees of non-appropriated fund activities, and contractors, if utilized.</P>
            <P>(b) DOT may assess a fee for time spent searching for records requested under subpart C even if the search fails to locate records or the records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure. In addition, if records are requested for commercial use, DOT may assess a fee for time spent reviewing any responsive records located to determine whether they are exempt from disclosure.</P>
            <P>(c) When a request is made under subpart C by a first-party requester and DOT processes the request under both FOIA and the Privacy Act, DOT determines the fees for records in DOT Privacy Act systems of record in accordance with the Privacy Act (as implemented by DOT regulations at 49 CFR part 10) rather than the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(d) When DOT aggregates requests made under subpart C (see § 7.34(d)), DOT apportions fees as set forth in § 7.43(b).</P>

            <P>(e) As a special service, DOT may certify copies of records made available under subpart B or released under subpart C, upon request and payment of the applicable fee: with the DOT seal (where authorized)—US $10; or true copy, without seal—US $5. Certified copies can be requested by contacting the applicable FOIA Requester Service <PRTPAGE P="75"/>Center (see § 7.27) or the DOT Dockets Office identified in § 7.12(b)(1).</P>
            <P>(f) DOT makes transcripts of hearings or oral arguments available for inspection only. If transcripts are prepared by a nongovernmental contractor and the contract permits DOT to handle the reproduction of further copies, DOT assesses duplication fees as set forth in § 7.42(d). If the contract for transcription services reserves the sales privilege to the reporting service, any duplicate copies must be purchased directly from the reporting service.</P>
            <P>(g) In the interest of making documents of general interest publicly available at as low a cost as possible, DOT arranges alternative sources whenever possible. In appropriate instances, material that is published and offered for sale may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402-0001; U.S. Department of Commerce's National Technical Information Service (NTIS), Springfield, VA 22151; or National Audio-Visual Center, National Archives and Records Administration, Capital Heights, MD 20743-3701.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What is DOT's fee schedule for records requested under subpart C of this part?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) DOT calculates the hourly rates for manual searching, computer operator/programmer time, and time spent reviewing records, when performed by employees, based on the grades and rates in the General Schedule Locality Pay Table for the Locality of Washington-Baltimore-Northern Virginia, DC-MD-VA-WV-PA, or equivalent grades, plus 16% to cover fringe benefits, as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) GS-1 through GS-8 (or equivalent)—Hourly rate of GS-5 step 7 plus 16%;</P>
            <P>(2) GS-9 through GS-12 (or equivalent)—Hourly rate of GS-10 step 7 plus 16%;</P>
            <P>(3) GS-13 through GS-14 (or equivalent)—Hourly rate of GS-13 step 7 plus 16%; and</P>
            <P>(4) GS-15 and above (or equivalent)—Hourly rate of GS-15 step 7 plus 16%.</P>
            <P>(b) DOT determines the standard fee for a manual or electronic search to locate records by multiplying the searcher's hourly rate as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section by the time spent conducting the search.</P>
            <P>(c) DOT's standard fee for review of records is the reviewer's rate set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, multiplied by the time the reviewer spent determining whether the located records are responsive to the request and whether the responsive records or segregable portions are exempt from disclosure, as explained in paragraphs (h), (i), and (j) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) DOT determines the standard fee for duplication of records as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) Per copy of each page (not larger than 8.5 × 14 inches) reproduced by photocopy or similar means (includes costs of personnel and equipment)—US $0.10.</P>
            <P>(2) Per copy prepared by any other method of duplication—actual direct cost of production.</P>
            <P>(e) If DOT utilizes a contractor to perform any services described in this section, the standard fee is based on the equivalent hourly rate(s). DOT does not utilize contractors to discharge responsibilities that only DOT may discharge under the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(f) In some cases, depending upon the category of requester and the use for which the records are requested, the fees computed in accordance with the standard fee schedule in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section are either reduced or not charged, as prescribed by other provisions of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(g) For purposes of fees only, there are four categories of FOIA requests:</P>
            <P>(1) Requests submitted by a commercial entity and/or for a commercial use;</P>
            <P>(2) Requests submitted by an educational or noncommercial scientific institution whose purpose is scholarly or scientific research (and not for a commercial use);</P>
            <P>(3) Requests submitted by a representative of the news media; and</P>
            <P>(4) All other requests.</P>
            <P>(h) When records are requested by a commercial requester and/or for a commercial use, the fees assessed are reasonable standard charges for document search, duplication, and review.</P>

            <P>(i) When records are requested by an educational or noncommercial scientific institution whose purpose is scholarly or scientific research or by a representative of the news media (i.e., <PRTPAGE P="76"/>for a non-commercial use), fees are limited to reasonable standard charges for document duplication.</P>
            <P>(j) For any request not described in paragraph (h) or (i) of this section, fees are limited to reasonable standard charges for document search and duplication.</P>
            <P>(k) Fees under this subpart do not apply to any special study, special statistical compilation, table, or other record requested under 49 U.S.C. 329(c). The fee for the performance of such a service is the actual cost of the work involved in compiling the record. All such fees received by DOT in payment of the cost of such work are deposited in a separate account administered under the direction of the Secretary, and may be used for the ordinary expenses incidental to providing the information.</P>

            <SUBJECT>When are fees waived or reduced for records requested under subpart C of this part?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) DOT does not charge fees to any requester making a request under subpart C of this part for the following services:</P>
            <P>(1) Services for which the total amount of fees that could be charged for the particular request (or aggregation of requests) is less than US $20, after taking into account all services that must be provided free of charge or at a reduced charge.</P>
            <P>(2) The first two hours of search time, unless the records are requested for commercial use.</P>
            <P>(3) Duplication of the first 100 pages (standard paper, not larger than 8.5 × 14 inches) of records, unless the records are requested for commercial use.</P>
            <P>(4) Review time spent determining whether a record is exempt from disclosure, unless the record is requested for commercial use. DOT does not charge for review time except with respect to an initial review to determine the applicability of a particular exemption to a particular record or portion of a record. DOT does not charge for review at the administrative appeal level. However, when records or portions of records withheld under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply are reviewed again to determine the applicability of other exemptions not previously considered, this is considered an initial review for purposes of assessing a review charge.</P>
            <P>(b) When DOT aggregates requests as provided in § 7.34(d), DOT charges each requester a ratable portion of the fees charged for combined services rendered on behalf of all requesters.</P>
            <P>(c) DOT waives or reduces the fees described in § 7.42(i) and (j) when the requester makes a fee waiver or reduction request as provided in § 7.24(b) and establishes that disclosure of the information is in the public interest as provided in 5 U.S.C. 552 and this paragraph, and the DOT official having initial denial authority determines that disclosure of the information is in the public interest and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The requester must establish all of the following factors to DOT's satisfaction to show that the request is in the public interest:</P>
            <P>(1) That the subject matter of the requested records concerns the operations or activities of the Federal Government;</P>
            <P>(2) That the disclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of Federal Government operations or activities;</P>
            <P>(3) That disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the understanding of the individual requester or a narrow segment of interested persons (to establish this factor, the requester must show an intent and ability to disseminate the requested information to a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject);</P>
            <P>(4) That the contribution to public understanding of Federal Government operations or activities will be significant; and</P>
            <P>(5) That the requester does not have a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure or that the magnitude of any identified commercial interest to the requester is not sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure to render the disclosure one that is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>

            <P>(d) DOT furnishes documents without charge or at a reduced charge when the <PRTPAGE P="77"/>official having initial denial authority determines that the request concerns records related to the death of an immediate family member who was, at the time of death, a DOT employee.</P>
            <P>(e) DOT furnishes documents without charge or at a reduced charge when the official having initial denial authority determines that the request is by the victim of a crime who seeks the record of the trial at which the requester testified.</P>
            <P>(f) Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section, DOT does not assess search fees otherwise chargeable under § 7.42(h) and (j) or duplication fees otherwise chargeable under § 7.42(i) when DOT fails to comply with the time limits under § 7.31 or § 7.33.</P>
            <P>(1) If DOT has determined that unusual circumstances apply (as defined in § 7.34(a)), 5,000 pages or less are necessary to respond to the request, and DOT has provided a timely written notice to the requester in accordance with § 7.34(a), a failure to comply with the time limits under § 7.31 or § 7.33 is excused for an additional 10 days. If DOT does not comply with the extended time limit, DOT does not assess search fees otherwise chargeable under § 7.42(h) and (j) or duplication fees otherwise chargeable under § 7.24(i);</P>
            <P>(2) If DOT has determined that unusual circumstances apply (as defined under § 7.34(a)) and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, DOT may charge search fees under § 7.42(h) and (j) or duplication fees under § 7.42(j) if DOT has provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with § 7.34(a) and (b), and DOT has discussed with the requester via written mail, electronic mail, or telephone (or made not less than three good faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request.</P>
            <P>(3) If a court determines that exceptional circumstances exist (as that term is defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(C)), failure to comply with time limits under § 7.31 or § 7.33 shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.</P>

            <P>Fees typically should be paid online, using a credit card, debit card, or electronic check. The DOT FOIA page (<E T="03">http://www.dot.gov/foia</E>) has direct links to the electronic payment site. Any fees paid with a paper check, draft, or money order must be made payable to the U.S. Treasury and delivered as directed by the applicable FOIA Requester Service Center identified in § 7.27 (if the fees are for records made available under subpart C) or the DOT Dockets Office identified in § 7.12(b)(1) (if the fees are for records made available under subpart B).</P>

            <SUBJECT>When are pre-payments required for records requested under subpart C of this part, and how are they handled?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) When DOT estimates that the search charges, review charges, duplication fees, or any combination of fees that could be charged to the requester will likely exceed US $25, DOT notifies the requester of the estimated amount of the fees, unless the requester has previously indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. In cases where DOT notifies the requester that actual or estimated fees may amount to more than US $25, the time limit for responding to the request is tolled until the requester has agreed to pay the anticipated total fee (see § 7.35). The notice also informs the requester how to consult with the appropriate DOT officials with the object of reformulating the request to meet his or her needs at a lower cost.</P>
            <P>(b) DOT may require payment of fees prior to actual duplication or delivery of any releasable records to a requester. However, advance payment, i.e., before work is commenced or continued on a request, is not required unless:</P>
            <P>(1) Allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed US $250; or</P>
            <P>(2) The requester has failed to pay within 30 days of the billing date fees charged for a previous request to any part of the U.S. Government.</P>

            <P>(c) When paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies, DOT notifies the requester <PRTPAGE P="78"/>of the estimated cost. If the requester has a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees, the requester must furnish satisfactory assurance of full payment of the estimated charges. Otherwise, the requester may be required to make advance payment of any amount up to the full estimated charges.</P>
            <P>(d) When paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies, DOT requires the requester to either demonstrate that the fee has been paid or pay the full amount owed, including any applicable interest, late handling charges, and penalty charges as discussed in § 7.46. DOT also requires such a requester to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before DOT begins processing a new request or continues processing a pending request.</P>
            <P>(e) In the event that a DOT component is required to refund a prepayment, the processing of the refund may necessitate collection of the requester's Taxpayer Identification Number or Social Security Number and direct deposit information (bank routing number and bank account number) under 31 U.S.C. 3325, 31 U.S.C. 3332, and 31 CFR Part 208.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 7.46</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How are late payments handled?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) DOT assesses interest on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the day on which the notice of the amount due is first mailed to the requester. Interest accrues from the date of the notice of amount due at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717. Receipt by DOT of a payment for the full amount of the fees owed within 30 calendar days after the date of the initial billing stops the accrual of interest, even if the payment has not been processed.</P>
            <P>(b) If DOT does not receive payment of the fees charged within 30 calendar days after the date the initial notice of the amount due is first mailed to the requester, DOT assesses an administrative charge to cover the cost of processing and handling the delinquent claim. In addition, DOT applies a penalty charge with respect to any principal amount of a debt that is more than 90 days past due. Where appropriate, DOT uses other steps permitted by Federal debt collection statutes, including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and use of collection agencies, to encourage payment of amounts overdue.</P>

            <P>(2) The information has not been reviewed for declassification within the prior two years. If the information has been reviewed within the prior two years, or the information is the subject of pending litigation, the requestor will be informed of this fact, and of the Department's decision not to declassify the information and of his/her right to appeal the Department's decision not to declassify the information to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP);</P>

The information will then be released unless withholding is otherwise authorized and warranted under applicable law.</P>
            <P>(d) Mandatory declassification review requests for information that has been classified by the Department of Transportation may be addressed to the Director of Security, U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, Washington, DC 20590. The Director will forward the request to the appropriate Departmental Original Classification Authority for processing.</P>
            <P>(e) Denied requests may be appealed to the DOT Information Security Review Committee (DISRC) through the Director of Security within 60 days of receipt of the denial. If the DISRC upholds the denial, it will inform the requestor of his or her final appeal rights to the ISCAP.</P>

            <P>(a) Authorized holders of information classified by the Department of Transportation who, in good faith, believe <PRTPAGE P="82"/>that its classification status is improper are encouraged and expected to challenge the classification status of the information before the Original Classification Authority (OCA) having jurisdiction over the information. A formal challenge must be in writing, but need not be any more specific than to question why information is or is not classified, or is classified at a certain level.</P>
            <P>(b) Classification challenges to DOT information must be addressed to the DOT Original Classification Authority (OCA) who is responsible for the information. If unsure of the OCA, address the challenge to the DOT Director of Security.</P>

            <P>(b) Classified information in the custody of the Department originated by another department or agency that has ceased to exist and for whom there is no successor agency will be deemed to have been originated by the Department. This information may be declassified or downgraded by the Department after consultation with any other agency that has an interest in the subject matter of the information. Such agency will be allowed 30 calendar days in which to express an objection, if it so desires, before action is taken. A difference of opinion that cannot be resolved at a lower level will be referred to the Departmental Information Security Review Committee, which will consult with its counterpart committee for the other agency.</P>
            <P>(c) Classified information transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) will be declassified or downgraded by the Archivist of the United States in accordance with Executive Order 13526, directives issued pursuant to Executive Order 13526, Departmental classification guides, and any existing procedural agreement between NARA and the Department. The Department will take all reasonable steps to declassify information contained in records determined to have permanent historical value before they are accessioned into the National Archives .</P>
            <P>(d) To the extent practicable, the Department will adopt a system of records management that will facilitate the public release of documents at the time such documents are declassified under the provisions for automatic declassification in section 3.3 of Executive Order 13526 and its implementing directives. To the maximum extent possible without destroying the integrity of the Department's files, all such material will be segregated or set aside for public release upon request. The Department will cooperate with the Archivist in efforts to establish a Government-wide database of information that has been declassified.</P>

            <P>(a) It is a fundamental policy of the Department to make information available to the public to the maximum extent permitted by law. Information that is declassified for any reason loses its status as material protected in the interest of national security. Accordingly, declassified information will be handled in every respect on the same basis as all other unclassified information. Declassified information is subject to the Departmental public information policies and procedures, with particular reference to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and implementing Departmental regulations (49 CFR Part 7).</P>
            <P>(b) In furtherance of this policy, all classified material produced after June 1, 1972 that is of sufficient historical or other value to warrant preservation as permanent records in accordance with appropriate records administrative standards, and that becomes declassified, will be systematically reviewed prior to the end of each calendar year for the purpose of making the material publicly available. To the maximum extent possible without destroying the integrity of the Department's files, all such material will be segregated or set aside for public release upon request.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) This part sets forth procedures governing the testimony of an employee in legal proceedings in which the United States is a party. It also sets forth procedures to be followed when an employee is issued a subpoena, order or other demand (collectively referred to in this part as a “demand”) by a court or other competent authority, or is requested by a private litigant, to provide testimony or produce records concerning information acquired in the course of performing official duties or because of the employee's official status. It also prescribes the policies and procedures of the Department with respect to the acceptance of service of legal process and pleadings in legal proceedings involving the Department.</P>
          <P>(b) The purposes of this part are to:</P>
          <P>(1) Conserve the time of employees for conducting official business;</P>
          <P>(2) Minimize the possibility of involving the Department in controversial issues not related to its mission;</P>
          <P>(3) Maintain the impartiality of the Department among private litigants;</P>
          <P>(4) Avoid spending the time and money of the United States for private purposes; and</P>
          <P>(5) To protect confidential, sensitive information and the deliberative processes of the Department.</P>
          <P>(c) Agency counsel, in his or her discretion, may permit an exception from any requirement in this part. The exception may be granted only when the deviation will not interfere with matters of operational or military necessity, and when agency counsel determines that:</P>
          <P>(1) It is necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice;</P>
          <P>(2) The Department has an interest in the decision that may be rendered in the legal proceeding; or</P>
          <P>(3) The exception is in the best interest of the Department or the United States.</P>
          <FP>For Office of Inspector General employees and documents, the Inspector General, in conjunction with the General Counsel of the Department, may permit an exception from any requirement of this part if the Inspector General determines, based on the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, that application of the requirement would be inappropriate.</FP>

It also applies in legal proceedings between private litigants to requests or demands for testimony or records concerning information acquired in the course of an employee performing official duties or because of the employee's official status. This part does not apply to any legal proceeding in which an employee is to testify as to facts or events that are in no way related to the employee's official duties or the functions of the Department. Nor does it apply to Congressional demands for testimony or documents.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Legal proceedings between private litigants: General rules.</SUBJECT>
          <P>In legal proceedings between private litigants:</P>
          <P>(a) The proper method for obtaining testimony or records from an employee is to submit a request to agency counsel as provided in §§ 9.13 and 9.15 of this part, not to serve a demand on the employee. Whenever, in a legal proceeding between private litigants, an employee is served with a demand, or receives a request, to testify in that employee's official capacity or produce records, the employee shall immediately notify agency counsel.</P>
          <P>(b) If authorized to testify pursuant to these rules, an employee may testify only as to facts within that employee's personal knowledge with regard to matters arising out of his or her official duties.</P>
          <P>(1) When the proceeding arises from an accident, an employee may testify only as to personally known facts, not reasonably available from other sources, observed by the employee or uncovered during the employee's investigation of the accident or observed by the employee even if he or she did not investigate the accident. The employee shall decline to testify regarding facts beyond the scope of his or her official duties.</P>
          <P>(2) The employee shall not testify to facts that are contained in a report, or any part of a report, unless the employee has obtained permission from agency counsel to disclose the information.</P>
          <P>(3) The employee shall not disclose confidential or privileged information unless the employee has obtained permission from agency counsel to disclose the information.</P>
          <P>(4) The employee shall not testify as to facts when agency counsel determines that the testimony would not be in the best interest of the Department or the United States if disclosed.</P>
          <P>(c) An employee shall not testify as an expert or opinion witness with regard to any matter arising out of the employee's official duties or the functions of the Department. An employee who is asked questions that call for expert or opinion testimony shall decline to answer on the grounds that it is forbidden by this part. Agency counsel shall advise the employee on how to proceed if the presiding officer directs the employee to provide expert or opinion testimony.</P>
          <P>(d) An employee shall not provide testimony at a trial or hearing. An employee's testimony shall be limited to a single deposition, affidavit, or set of interrogatories, concerning the circumstances (e.g. an accident) from which the proceeding arose. Where multiple legal proceedings concerning those circumstances are pending, or can occur, it shall be the duty of the private litigant seeking the testimony to ascertain, to the extent feasible, the identities of all parties, or potential parties, to those proceedings and notify them that a deposition has been granted and that they have the opportunity to participate. The private litigant shall submit an affidavit or certification describing the extent of the search for parties and potential parties and listing the names of the parties and potential parties notified.</P>
          <P>(e) Where an employee has already provided testimony, any party wishing to obtain further testimony from that employee concerning the same matter or occurrence, whether in the same or a different private legal proceeding, may submit a request to agency counsel to waive the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. The request shall, in addition to meeting the requirements of § 9.15 of this part, state why the requester should be permitted to gather additional information despite not having previously requested the information when it had an opportunity to do so, and why the additional testimony is now required and the prior testimony or previously supplied documents are insufficient.</P>

          <P>(a) If an employee receives a demand that has not been validly issued or served, agency counsel may instruct the employee not to comply with the demand.<PRTPAGE P="87"/>
          </P>
          <P>(b) If an employee receives a demand (validly issued and served) to testify or produce records, agency counsel, in his or her discretion, may grant the employee permission to testify or produce records only if the purposes of this part are met or agency counsel determines that an exception is appropriate.</P>
          <P>(c) If a demand is issued to an employee, agency counsel shall contact the requester of the demand, inform that person of the requirements of this part, and may, in agency counsel's discretion, ask that the demand be withdrawn.</P>
          <P>(d) If the requester of the demand refuses to have it withdrawn or fails to comply with this part, the Department may seek to quash the demand.</P>
          <P>(e) If the court or other competent authority declines to grant the Department's motion to quash, agency counsel shall instruct the employee whether to testify or produce documents pursuant to the demand. Agency counsel may permit the testimony under § 9.1(c) of this part. If response to a demand is required before the court or other competent authority rules on the motion to quash and the court fails to stay the demand, the employee must appear at the stated time and place, produce a copy of this part, and respectfully refuse to provide any testimony or produce any documents. Agency counsel shall take steps to arrange for legal representation for the employee. Agency counsel shall advise the employee how to respond, including not to testify, if the court or other competent authority rules that the demand must be complied with irrespective of these regulations.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Legal proceedings between private litigants: Procedures to request records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) In a legal proceeding between private litigants, a party who wishes to obtain records from the Department shall submit to agency counsel a request for the records. The request will ordinarily be handled in accordance with the Department's procedures concerning requests for records found at 49 CFR part 7. If the party does not follow the procedures specified in that part, the request must be accompanied by a statement setting forth the relevance of the records to the proceeding. The request should be resolved before any request for testimony under § 9.15 is submitted. Where a request for testimony includes a request for additional records, it shall indicate precisely how this new request differs in scope from any previous request in order to avoid agency duplication of effort. Agency counsel shall notify the requester of the approval or denial of the request.</P>

          <P>(a) Any party seeking the testimony of an employee in a legal proceeding between private litigants, concerning facts within the employee's personal knowledge with regard to matters arising out of the employee's official duties, shall, rather than serving a demand for the testimony, request the testimony at least 30 days before it is intended to be taken or received. The request must be submitted to agency counsel and must include:</P>
          <P>(1) The title of the case, docket number, and the court, or otherwise clearly identify the legal proceeding involved;</P>
          <P>(2) A statement setting forth the basic facts in the proceeding, such as the type, date, and location of an accident;</P>
          <P>(3) A summary of the unresolved issues applicable to the testimony sought;</P>
          <P>(4) A summary of the testimony sought and its relevant to the proceeding;</P>
          <P>(5) A certification with support, that the information desired is not reasonably available from other sources, including Departmental documents;</P>
          <P>(6) Pursuant to § 9.9(d) of this part, an affidavit or certification describing the extent of a search of parties and potential parties and listing the names of the parties and potential parties notified; and</P>
          <P>(7) A declaration that the party will not seek expert or opinion testimony from the witness or seek the testimony of the witness at a hearing or trial in the proceeding.</P>

          <FP>The request shall specify which form of testimony (deposition, affidavit, declaration, or answers to interrogatories) <PRTPAGE P="88"/>is desired and the date by which it is desired; however, only one form, the one least burdensome to the Department that will provide the needed information, will be permitted for each witness.</FP>
          <P>(b) The party seeking the testimony shall include with its request for testimony a copy of any prior request(s) made by the same requester to the Department or other agency of the United States for records pertaining to the matter being litigated and of the response (not including the records themselves) to the request(s). The party seeking the testimony shall also comply with any agency counsel request that copies of the records previously disclosed by the Department, or a list of those records, be furnished.</P>
          <P>(c) In accordance with the requirement of this section and the general provisions of this part, agency counsel shall notify the requester of the approval or denial of the request. Agency counsel may attach special conditions to its approval.</P>

            <P>(1) To those officers and employees of the Department who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties;</P>
            <P>(2) Required under part 7 of this title which implements the Freedom of Information Act;</P>
            <P>(3) For a routine use as defined in § 10.5 and described pursuant to § 10.21(d)(4);</P>
            <P>(4) To the Bureau of the Census for purposes of planning or carrying out a census or survey or related activity pursuant to the provisions of title 13, United States Code;</P>
            <P>(5) To a recipient who has provided the Department with advance adequate written assurance that the record will be used solely as a statistical research or reporting record, and the record is to be transferred in a form that is not individually identifiable;</P>
            <P>(6) To the National Archives of the United States as a record which has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued preservation by the U.S. Government, or for evaluation by the Administrator of General Services or his designee to determine whether the record has such value;</P>
            <P>(7) To another agency or to an instrumentality of any governmental jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a civil or criminal law enforcement activity if the activity is authorized by law, and if the head of the agency or instrumentality has made a written request to the agency which maintains the record specifying the particular portion desired and the law enforcement activity for which the record is sought;</P>
            <P>(8) To a person pursuant to a showing of compelling circumstances affecting the health or safety of an individual if upon such disclosure notification is transmitted to the last known address of such individual;</P>
            <P>(9) To either House of the Congress, or to the extent of matters within its jurisdiction, any committee or subcommittee thereof, any joint committee of the Congress or subcommittee of any such joint committee;</P>

            <P>(12) To a consumer reporting agency in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711(f).</P>

            <P>(b) Any individual requesting access to his or her record or to any information pertaining to that individual which is contained within a system of records within the Department has access to that record or information unless the system of records within which the record or information is contained is exempted from disclosure in accordance with subpart G, provided, however, that nothing in this part is deemed to require that an individual be given access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding. No exemption contained in subpart G of part 7 of the regulations of the Office of the Secretary is relied upon to withhold from an individual any record which is otherwise accessible to such individual under the provisions of this part. Any individual who is given access to a record or information pertaining to him is permitted to have a person of his or her own choosing accompany him and to have a copy made of all or any portion of the record or information in a form comprehensible to the individual. When deemed appropriate, the individual may be required to furnish a written statement authorizing discussion of his record in the accompanying person's presence.<PRTPAGE P="94"/>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Medical records.</E> Where requests are for access to medical records, including psychological records, the decision to release directly to the individual, or to withhold direct release, shall be made by a medical practitioner. Where the medical practitioner has ruled that direct release will do harm to the individual who is requesting access, normal release through the individual's chosen medical practitioner will be recommended. Final review and decision on appeals of disapprovals of direct release will rest with the General Counsel.</P>
            <P>(d) Any person requesting access to records or to any information pertaining to other individuals is not granted such access unless that person can show that he or she has obtained permission for such access from the individual to whom the record pertains, unless the request comes within one of the exceptions of paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

For requests by mail, the unique identifier used in the system should be included if known. Responses to mail requests are normally sent only to the name and address listed in the system of records. In the case of particularly sensitive records, additional identification requirements may be imposed. In such cases, these additional requirements are listed in the public notice for the system.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Each officer or employee of the Department who, upon a request by a member of the public for a record under this part, makes a determination that access is not to be granted or who determines not to amend a record in a requested manner, gives a written statement of the reasons for that determination to the person making the request and indicates the name and title or position of each person responsible for the denial of such request and the procedure for appeal within the Department.</P>
            <P>(b) Any person:</P>
            <P>(1) Who has been given a determination pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, that access will not be granted; or</P>
            <P>(2) Who has been informed that an amendment to a requested record will not be made; may apply to the Administrator concerned, or in the case of the Office of the Secretary, to the General Counsel for review of that decision. A determination that access will not be granted or a record amended is not administratively final for the purposes of judicial review unless it was made by the Administrator concerned or his or her delegee, or the General Counsel or his or her delegee, as the case may be. Upon a determination that an appeal will be denied, the requester is informed in writing of the reasons for the determination, and the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the determination, and that the determination may be appealed to the District Court of the United States in the district in which the complainant resides, or has his or her principal place of business, or in which the records are located, or in the District of Columbia.</P>
            <P>(c) Each application for review must be made in writing and must include all information and arguments relied upon by the person making the request, and be submitted within 30 days of the date of the initial denial; exceptions to this time period are permitted for good reason.</P>
            <P>(d) Upon a determination that a request for the correction of a record will be denied, the requester is informed that he may file a concise statement in accordance with § 10.45.</P>
            <P>(e) Each application for review must indicate that it is an appeal from a denial of a request made under the Privacy Act. The envelope in which the application is sent should be marked prominently with the words “Privacy Act.” If these requirements are not met, the time limits described in § 10.43 do not begin to run until the application has been identified by an employee of the Department as an application under the Privacy Act and has been received by the appropriate office.</P>
            <P>(f) The Administrator concerned, or the General Counsel, as the case may be, may require the person making the request to furnish additional information, or proof of factual allegations, and may order other proceedings appropriate in the circumstances. The decision of the Administrator concerned, or the General Counsel, as the case may be, as to the availability of the record or whether to amend the record is administratively final.</P>

            <P>(g) The decision by the Administrator concerned, or the General Counsel, as the case may be, not to disclose a record under this part is considered a <PRTPAGE P="96"/>determination for the purposes of section 552a(g) of title 5, United States Code, “Civil Remedies.”</P>
            <P>(h) Any final decision by an Administrator or his/her delegate not to grant access to or amend a record under this part is subject to concurrence by the General Counsel or his or her delegate.</P>

            <P>Those portions of the following systems of records that consist of (a) Information compiled for the purpose of identifying individual criminal offenders and alleged offenders and consisting only of identifying data and notations of arrests, the nature and disposition of criminal charges, sentencing, confinement, release, and parole and probation status; (b) information compiled for the purpose of a criminal investigation, including reports of informants and investigators, and associated with an identifiable individual; or (c) reports identifiable to an individual compiled at any stage of the process of enforcement of the criminal laws from arrest or indictment through release from supervision, are exempt from all parts of 5 U.S.C. 552a except subsections (b) (Conditions of disclosure); (c) (1) and (2) (Accounting of certain disclosures); (e)(4) (A) through (F) (Publication of existence and character of system); (e)(6) (Ensure records are accurate, relevant, timely, and complete before disclosure to person other than an agency and other than pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request), (7) (Restrict recordkeeping on First Amendment rights), (9) (Rules of conduct), (10) (Safeguards), and (11) (Routine use publication); and (i) (Criminal penalties):<PRTPAGE P="99"/>
            </P>
            <P>A. The Investigative Records System maintained by the Assistant Inspector General for Investigations, Office of the Inspector General, Office of the Secretary (DOT/OST 100).</P>
            <P>B. Police Warrant Files and Central Files maintained by the Federal Aviation Administration (DOT/FAA 807).</P>
            <P>C. The Investigative Records System maintained by the Federal Aviation Administration regarding criminal investigations conducted by offices of Investigations and Security at headquarters and FAA Regional and Center Security Divisions (DOT/FAA 815).</P>
            <P>D. General Investigations Record System, maintained by the Office of Investigations and Security, Office of the Secretary (DOT/OST 016).</P>
            <P>These exemptions are justified for the following reasons:</P>
            <P>1. From subsection (c)(3), because making available to a record subject the accounting of disclosures from records concerning him/her would reveal investigative interest by not only DOT but also the recipient agency, thereby permitting the record subject to take appropriate measures to impede the investigation, as by destroying evidence, intimidating potential witnesses, fleeing the area to avoid the thrust of the investigation, etc.</P>
            <P>2. From subsections (d), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (f), and (g), because granting an individual access to investigative records, and granting him/her rights to amend/contest that information, interfere with the overall law enforcement process by revealing a pending sensitive investigation, possibly identify a confidential source, disclose information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of another individual's personal privacy, reveal a sensitive investigative technique, or constitute a potential danger to the health or safety of law enforcement personnel.</P>
            <P>3. From subsection (e)(1), because it is often impossible to determine relevancy or necessity of information in the early stages of an investigation. The value of such information is a question of judgement and timing: what appears relevant and necessary when collected may ultimately be evaluated and viewed as irrelevant and unnecessary to an investigation. In addition, DOT may obtain information concerning the violation of laws other than those within the scope of its jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, DOT should retain this information because it may aid in establishing patterns of unlawful activity and provide leads for other law enforcement agencies. Further, in obtaining evidence during an investigation, information may be provided to DOT that relates to matters incidental to the main purpose of the investigation but that may be pertinent to the investigative jurisdiction of another agency. Such information cannot readily be identified.</P>
            <P>4. From subsection (e)(2), because in a law enforcement investigation it is usually counterproductive to collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject of the information. It is not always feasible to rely upon the subject of an investigation as a source for information that may implicate him/her in illegal activities. In addition, collecting information directly from the subject could seriously compromise an investigation by prematurely revealing its nature and scope, or could provide the subject with an opportunity to conceal criminal activities, or intimidate potential sources, in order to avoid apprehension.</P>
            <P>5. From subsection (e)(3), because providing such notice to the subject of an investigation, or to other individual sources, could seriously compromise the investigation by prematurely revealing its nature and scope, or could inhibit cooperation, permit the subject to evade apprehension, or cause interference with undercover activities.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Part II. Specific Exemptions</HD>
            <P>A.

            <P>2. From subsections (d), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f), because granting an individual access to investigative records, and granting him/her access to investigative records with that information, could interfere with the overall law enforcement process by revealing a pending sensitive investigation, possibly identify a confidential source, disclose information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of another individual's personal privacy, reveal a sensitive investigative technique, or constitute a potential danger to the health or safety of law enforcement personnel.</P>

            <P>These exemptions are justified for the following reasons:</P>
            <P>1.

            <P>2. From subsection (d), because granting an individual access to investigative records could interfere with the overall law enforcement process by revealing a pending sensitive investigation, possibly identify a confidential source, disclose information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of another individual's personal privacy, reveal a sensitive investigative technique, or constitute a potential danger to the health or safety of law enforcement personnel.</P>
            <P>C. The system of records known as the Alaska Railroad Examination of Operating Personnel, maintained by the Alaska Railroad, Federal Railroad Administration (DOT/FRA 100), is exempt from the provisions of subsection (d) of 5 U.S.C. 552a. The release of these records would compromise their value as impartial measurement standards for appointment and promotion within the Federal Service.</P>
            <P>D. Those portions of the following systems of records consisting of investigatory material compiled for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal civilian employment, military service, or access to classified information or used to determine potential for promotion in the armed services, are exempt from sections (c)(3) (Accounting of Certain Disclosures), (d) (Access to Records), (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules) of 5 U.S.C. 552a to the extent that disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who provided information to the Government under an express or, prior to September 27, 1975, an implied promise of confidentiality (5 U.S.C. 552a(k) (5) and (7)):</P>
            <P>1. Investigative Records System, maintained by the Assistant Inspector General for Investigations in the Office of the Inspector General (DOT/OST 100).</P>
            <P>2.

          <SUBJECT>Assuring compliance with this policy—research conducted or supported by any Federal department or agency.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Each institution engaged in research that is covered by this policy, with the exception of research eligible for exemption under § 11.104, and that is conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency, shall provide written assurance satisfactory to the department or agency head that it will comply with the requirements of this policy. In lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, individual department or agency heads shall accept the existence of a current assurance, appropriate for the research in question, on file with the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office, and approved for Federal-wide use by that office. When the existence of an HHS-approved assurance is accepted in lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, reports (except certification) required by this policy to be made to department and agency heads shall also be made to the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office. Federal departments and agencies will conduct or support research covered by this policy only if the institution has provided an assurance that it will comply with the requirements of this policy, as provided in this section, and only if the institution has certified to the department or agency head that the research has been reviewed and approved by an IRB (if such certification is required by § 11.103(d)).</P>
          <P>(b) The assurance shall be executed by an individual authorized to act for the institution and to assume on behalf of the institution the obligations imposed by this policy and shall be filed in such form and manner as the department or agency head prescribes.</P>
          <P>(c) The department or agency head may limit the period during which any assurance shall remain effective or otherwise condition or restrict the assurance.</P>
          <P>(d) Certification is required when the research is supported by a Federal department or agency and not otherwise waived under § 11.101(i) or exempted under § 11.104. For such research, institutions shall certify that each proposed research study covered by the assurance and this section has been reviewed and approved by the IRB. Such certification must be submitted as prescribed by the Federal department or agency component supporting the research. Under no condition shall research covered by this section be initiated prior to receipt of the certification that the research has been reviewed and approved by the IRB.</P>

Paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section may not be applied to research subject to subpart D.</P>
          <P>(c) [Reserved]</P>
          <P>(d) Except as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the following categories of human subjects research are exempt from this policy:</P>
          <P>(1) Research, conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings, that specifically involves normal educational practices that are not likely to adversely impact students' opportunity to learn required educational content or the assessment of educators who provide instruction. This includes most research on regular and special education instructional strategies, and research on the effectiveness of or the comparison among instructional techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods.</P>
          <P>(2) Research that only includes interactions involving educational tests (cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview procedures, or observation of public behavior (including visual or auditory recording) if at least one of the following criteria is met:</P>
          <P>(i) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;</P>
          <P>(ii) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or</P>
          <P>(iii) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 11.111(a)(7).</P>
          <P>(3)(i) Research involving benign behavioral interventions in conjunction with the collection of information from an adult subject through verbal or written responses (including data entry) or audiovisual recording if the subject prospectively agrees to the intervention and information collection and at least one of the following criteria is met:</P>
          <P>(A) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;</P>
          <P>(B) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or</P>
          <P>(C) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 11.111(a)(7).</P>

          <P>(ii) For the purpose of this provision, benign behavioral interventions are brief in duration, harmless, painless, <PRTPAGE P="108"/>not physically invasive, not likely to have a significant adverse lasting impact on the subjects, and the investigator has no reason to think the subjects will find the interventions offensive or embarrassing. Provided all such criteria are met, examples of such benign behavioral interventions would include having the subjects play an online game, having them solve puzzles under various noise conditions, or having them decide how to allocate a nominal amount of received cash between themselves and someone else.</P>
          <P>(iii) If the research involves deceiving the subjects regarding the nature or purposes of the research, this exemption is not applicable unless the subject authorizes the deception through a prospective agreement to participate in research in circumstances in which the subject is informed that he or she will be unaware of or misled regarding the nature or purposes of the research.</P>
          <P>(4) Secondary research for which consent is not required: Secondary research uses of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, if at least one of the following criteria is met:</P>
          <P>(i) The identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are publicly available;</P>
          <P>(ii) Information, which may include information about biospecimens, is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, the investigator does not contact the subjects, and the investigator will not re-identify subjects;</P>
          <P>(iii) The research involves only information collection and analysis involving the investigator's use of identifiable health information when that use is regulated under 45 CFR parts 160 and 164, subparts A and E, for the purposes of “health care operations” or “research” as those terms are defined at 45 CFR 164.501 or for “public health activities and purposes” as described under 45 CFR 164.512(b); or</P>

          <P>(iv) The research is conducted by, or on behalf of, a Federal department or agency using government-generated or government-collected information obtained for nonresearch activities, if the research generates identifiable private information that is or will be maintained on information technology that is subject to and in compliance with section 208(b) of the E-Government Act of 2002, 44 U.S.C. 3501 note, if all of the identifiable private information collected, used, or generated as part of the activity will be maintained in systems of records subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and, if applicable, the information used in the research was collected subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <E T="03">et seq.</E>

          <SUBJECT>IRB membership.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Each IRB shall have at least five members, with varying backgrounds to promote complete and adequate review of research activities commonly conducted by the institution. The IRB shall be sufficiently qualified through the experience and expertise of its members (professional competence), and the diversity of its members, including race, gender, and cultural backgrounds and sensitivity to such issues as community attitudes, to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. The IRB shall be able to ascertain the acceptability of proposed research in terms of institutional commitments (including policies and resources) and regulations, applicable law, and standards of professional conduct and practice. The IRB shall therefore include persons knowledgeable in these areas. If an IRB regularly reviews research that involves a category of subjects that is vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, consideration shall be given to the inclusion of one or more individuals who are knowledgeable about and experienced in working with these categories of subjects.</P>
          <P>(b) Each IRB shall include at least one member whose primary concerns are in scientific areas and at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas.</P>
          <P>(c) Each IRB shall include at least one member who is not otherwise affiliated with the institution and who is not part of the immediate family of a person who is affiliated with the institution.</P>
          <P>(d) No IRB may have a member participate in the IRB's initial or continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB.</P>

          <P>(e) An IRB may, in its discretion, invite individuals with competence in special areas to assist in the review of issues that require expertise beyond or in addition to that available on the <PRTPAGE P="110"/>IRB. These individuals may not vote with the IRB.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Expedited review procedures for certain kinds of research involving no more than minimal risk, and for minor changes in approved research.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) The Secretary of HHS has established, and published as a Notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> a list of categories of research that may be reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure. The Secretary will evaluate the list at least every 8 years and amend it, as appropriate, after consultation with other federal departments and agencies and after publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for public comment. A copy of the list is available from the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office.</P>
          <P>(b)(1) An IRB may use the expedited review procedure to review the following:</P>
          <P>(i) Some or all of the research appearing on the list described in paragraph (a) of this section, unless the reviewer determines that the study involves more than minimal risk;</P>
          <P>(ii) Minor changes in previously approved research during the period for which approval is authorized; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Research for which limited IRB review is a condition of exemption under § 11.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), and (d)(7) and (8).</P>
          <P>(2) Under an expedited review procedure, the review may be carried out by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the chairperson from among members of the IRB. In reviewing the research, the reviewers may exercise all of the authorities of the IRB except that the reviewers may not disapprove the research. A research activity may be disapproved only after review in accordance with the nonexpedited procedure set forth in § 11.108(b).</P>
          <P>(c) Each IRB that uses an expedited review procedure shall adopt a method for keeping all members advised of research proposals that have been approved under the procedure.</P>
          <P>(d) The department or agency head may restrict, suspend, terminate, or choose not to authorize an institution's or IRB's use of the expedited review procedure.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Criteria for IRB approval of research.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) In order to approve research covered by this policy the IRB shall determine that all of the following requirements are satisfied:</P>
          <P>(1) Risks to subjects are minimized:</P>
          <P>(i) By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk, and</P>
          <P>(ii) Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes.</P>

          <P>(2) Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge <PRTPAGE P="112"/>gained in the research (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the possible effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility.</P>
          <P>(3) Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons.</P>
          <P>(4) Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and to the extent required by, § 11.116.</P>
          <P>(5) Informed consent will be appropriately documented or appropriately waived in accordance with § 11.117.</P>
          <P>(6) When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.</P>
          <P>(7) When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.</P>
          <P>(i) The Secretary of HHS will, after consultation with the Office of Management and Budget's privacy office and other Federal departments and agencies that have adopted this policy, issue guidance to assist IRBs in assessing what provisions are adequate to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.</P>
          <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>
          <P>(8) For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review required by § 11.104(d)(7)), the IRB need not make the determinations at paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section, and shall make the following determinations:</P>
          <P>(i) Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained in accordance with the requirements of § 11.116(a)(1)-(4), (a)(6), and (d);</P>
          <P>(ii) Broad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of documentation is appropriate, in accordance with § 11.117; and</P>
          <P>(iii) If there is a change made for research purposes in the way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are stored or maintained, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.</P>
          <P>(b) When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, additional safeguards have been included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Documentation of informed consent.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, informed consent shall be documented by the use of a written informed consent form approved by the IRB and signed (including in an electronic format) by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. A written copy shall be given to the person signing the informed consent form.</P>
          <P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the informed consent form may be either of the following:</P>

          <P>(1) A written informed consent form that meets the requirements of § 11.116. The investigator shall give either the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative adequate opportunity to read the informed consent form before it is signed; alternatively, this form may be read to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.<PRTPAGE P="118"/>
          </P>
          <P>(2) A short form written informed consent form stating that the elements of informed consent required by § 11.116 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, and that the key information required by § 11.116(a)(5)(i) was presented first to the subject, before other information, if any, was provided. The IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the legally authorized representative. When this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of the summary shall be given to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in addition to a copy of the short form.</P>
          <P>(c)(1) An IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed informed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds any of the following:</P>
          <P>(i) That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the informed consent form and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject (or legally authorized representative) will be asked whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the research, and the subject's wishes will govern;</P>
          <P>(ii) That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context; or</P>
          <P>(iii) If the subjects or legally authorized representatives are members of a distinct cultural group or community in which signing forms is not the norm, that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and provided there is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.</P>
          <P>(2) In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects or legally authorized representatives with a written statement regarding the research.</P>

          <P>(f) <E T="03">Obligation to protect information.</E> When an individual receives SSI pursuant to paragraph (d) or (e) of this section that individual becomes a covered person under § 15.7 and is subject to the obligations of a covered person under this part.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">No release under FOIA.</E> When DOT discloses SSI pursuant to paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section, DOT makes the disclosure for the sole purpose described in that paragraph.

          <P>(b) <E T="03">Other covered persons</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A covered person must destroy SSI completely to preclude recognition or reconstruction of the information when the covered person no longer needs the SSI to carry out transportation security measures.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Professional and technical services.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 20.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>
            <P>(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.</P>
            <P>(c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.</P>

            <P>(b) The reporting requirements in § 20.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.</P>

            <P>(e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances.

          <P>The purpose of this part is to effectuate the provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (hereafter referred to as the Act) to the end that no person in the United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from the Department of Transportation.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Application of this part.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) This part applies to any program for which Federal financial assistance is authorized under a law administered by the Department, including the types of Federal financial assistance listed in appendix A to this part. It also applies to money paid, property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance extended after the effective date of this part pursuant to an application approved before that effective date.

          <P>(4) Any employment practice, under any such program, of any employer, employment agency, or labor organization, except to the extent described in § 21.5(c).</P>
          <FP>The fact that a type of Federal financial assistance is not listed in appendix A to this part shall not mean, if title VI of the Act is otherwise applicable, that a program is not covered. Other types of Federal financial assistance under statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to appendix A to this part.</FP>
          <P>(b) In any program receiving Federal financial assistance in the form, or for the acquisition, of real property or an interest in real property, to the extent that rights to space on, over, or under any such property are included as part of the program receiving that assistance, the nondiscrimination requirement of this part shall extend to any facility located wholly or in part in that space.</P>

          <P>(2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program, or the class of person to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will be provided under any such program, or the class of persons to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program; may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting persons to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program with respect to individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.</P>
          <P>(3) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient or applicant may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding persons from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this part.</P>
          <P>(4) As used in this section the services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial assistance include any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal financial assistance.</P>
          <P>(5) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in this paragraph does not limit the generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
          <P>(6) Examples demonstrating the application of the provisions of this section to certain types of Federal financial assistance administered by the Department of Transportation are contained in appendix C of this part.</P>

          <P>(7) This part does not prohibit the consideration of race, color, or national origin if the purpose and effect are to remove or overcome the consequences of practices or impediments which have restricted the availability of, or participation in, the program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin. Where prior discriminatory practice or usage tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to which this part applies, the applicant or recipient must take affirmative action to remove or overcome the effects of the prior discriminatory practice or usage. Even in the absence of prior discriminatory practice or usage, a recipient in administering a program or activity to which this part applies, is expected to take affirmative action to assure that no person is excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of the program or activity on the <PRTPAGE P="143"/>grounds of race, color, or national origin.</P>
          <P>(c) Employment practices:</P>
          <P>(1) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance to a program to which this part applies is to provide employment, a recipient or other party subject to this part shall not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, subject a person to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under such program (including recruitment or recruitment advertising, hiring, firing, upgrading, promotion, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, rates of pay or other forms of compensation or benefits, selection for training or apprenticeship, use of facilities, and treatment of employees). Such recipient shall take affirmative action to insure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, color, or national origin. The requirements applicable to construction employment under any such program shall be those specified in or pursuant to Part III of Executive Order 11246 or any Executive order which supersedes it.</P>
          <P>(2) Federal financial assistance to programs under laws funded or administered by the Department which have as a primary objective the providing of employment include those set forth in appendix B to this part.</P>
          <P>(3) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall apply to the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation, to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory treatment of, beneficiaries.</P>
          <P>(d) A recipient may not make a selection of a site or location of a facility if the purpose of that selection, or its effect when made, is to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to which this rule applies, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin; or if the purpose is to, or its effect when made will, substantially impair the accomplishment of the objectives of this part.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Every application for Federal financial assistance to which this part applies, except an application to which paragraph (b) of this section applies, and every application for Federal financial assistance to provide a facility shall, as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application, contain or be accompanied by, an assurance that the program will be conducted or the facility operated in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part. Every awardof Federal financial assistance shall require the submission of such an assurance. In the case where the Federal financial assistance is to provide or is in the form of personal property, or real property or interest therein or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits, or for as long as the recipient retains ownership or possession of the property, whichever is longer. In all other cases the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended to the program. The Secretary shall specify the form of the foregoing assurances, and the extent to which like assurances will be required of subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other <PRTPAGE P="144"/>participants. Any such assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.</P>
          <P>(2) In the case where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property, structures, or improvements thereon, or interest therein, from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property or interest therein from the Federal Government is involved, but property is acquired or improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. When the property is obtained from the Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Department to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the Secretary, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In such event if a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the Secretary may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as he deems appropriate, to subordinate such right of reversion to the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Continuing Federal financial assistance.</E> Every application by a State or a State agency for continuing Federal financial assistance to which this part applies (including the types of Federal financial assistance listed in appendix A to this part) shall as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application: (1) Contain or be accompanied by a statement that the program is (or, in the case of a new program, will be) conducted in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part, and (2) provide or be accompanied by provision for such methods of administration for the program as are found by the Secretary to give reasonable guarantee that the applicant and all recipients of Federal financial assistance under such program will comply with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part.</P>

In the case in which a primary recipient extends Federal financial assistance to any other recipient, such other recipient shall also submit such compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations under this part.

Such other means may include, but are not limited to: (1) A reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or other contractual undertaking, and (2) any applicable proceeding under State or local law.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Noncompliance with § 21.7.</E> If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 21.7 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a <PRTPAGE P="146"/>requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section, Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The Department shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph. However, subject to § 21.21, the Department shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application approved prior to the effective date of this part.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance.</E> No order suspending, terminating, or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until:</P>
          <P>(1) The Secretary has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means;</P>
          <P>(2) There has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part;</P>
          <P>(3) The action has been approved by the Secretary pursuant to § 21.17(e); and</P>

          <FP>Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.</FP>

          <P>(3) The expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person.

This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either: (1) Fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of the Secretary that the matter be scheduled for hearing or (2) advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this paragraph or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act and § 21.13(c) and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Time and place of hearing.</E> Hearings shall be held at the offices of the Department in Washington, D.C., at a time fixed by the Secretary unless he determines that the convenience of the applicant or recipient or of the Department requires that another place be selected.

          <P>(2) Technical rules of evidence do not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Consolidated or joint hearings.</E> In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this part with respect to two or more Federal statutes, authorities, or other means by which Federal financial assistance is extended and to which this part applies, or noncompliance with this part and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under title VI of the Act, the Secretary may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies, where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules or procedures not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this regulation is concerned, shall be made in accordance with § 21.17.</P>

Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the Secretary determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he shall restore such eligibility.</P>
          <P>(3) If the Secretary denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying who it believes such official to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record in accordance with rules or procedures issued by the Secretary. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Nondiscrimination on Federally Assisted Projects</HD>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Examples.</E> The following examples, without being exhaustive, illustrate the application of the nondiscrimination provisions of this part on projects receiving Federal financial assistance under the programs of certain Department of Transportation operating administrations:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Federal Aviation Administration.</E> (i) The airport sponsor or any of his lessees, concessionaires, or contractors may not differentiate between members of the public because of race, color, or national origin in furnishing, or admitting to, waiting rooms, passenger holding areas, aircraft tiedown areas, restaurant facilities, restrooms, or facilities operated under the compatible land use concept.</P>
          <P>(ii) The airport sponsor and any of his lessees, concessionaires, or contractors must offer to all members of the public the same degree and type of service without regard to race, color, or national origin. This rule applies to fixed base operators, restaurants, snack bars, gift shops, ticket counters, baggage handlers, car rental agencies, limousines and taxis franchised by the airport sponsor, insurance underwriters, and other businesses catering to the public at the airport.</P>
          <P>(iii) An aircraft operator may not be required to park his aircraft at a location that is less protected, or less accessible from the terminal facilities, than locations offered to others, because of his race, color, or national origin.</P>
          <P>(iv) The pilot of an aircraft may not be required to help more extensively in fueling operations, and may not be offered less incidental service (such as windshield wiping), than other pilots, because of his race, color, or national origin.</P>
          <P>(v) No pilot or crewmember eligible for access to a pilot's lounge or to unofficial communication facilities such as a UNICOM frequency may be restricted in that access because of his race, color, or national origin.</P>
          <P>(vi) Access to facilities maintained at the airport by air carriers or commercial operators for holders of first-class transportation tickets or frequent users of the carrier's or operator's services may not be restricted on the basis of race, color, or national origin.</P>
          <P>(vii) Passengers and crewmembers seeking ground transportation from the airport may not be assigned to different vehicles, or delayed or embarrassed in assignment to vehicles, by the airport sponsor or his lessees, concessionaires, or contractors, because of race, color, or national origin.</P>
          <P>(viii) Where there are two or more sites having equal potential to serve the aeronautical needs of the area, the airport sponsor shall select the site least likely to adversely affect existing communities. Such site selection shall not be made on the basis of race, color, or national origin.</P>
          <P>(ix) Employment at obligated airports, including employment by tenants and concessionaires shall be available to all regardless of race, creed, color, sex, or national origin. The sponsor shall coordinate his airport plan with his local transit authority and the Federal Transit Administration to assure public transportation, convenient to the disadvantaged areas of nearby communities to enhance employment opportunities for the disadvantaged and minority population.</P>
          <P>(x) The sponsor shall assure that the minority business community in his area is advised of the opportunities offered by airport concessions, and that bids are solicited from such qualified minority firms, and awards made without regard to race, color, or national origin.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Federal Highway Administration.</E> (i) The State, acting through its highway department, may not discriminate in its selection and retention of contractors, including without limitation, those whose services are retained for, or incidental to, construction, planning, research, highway safety, engineering, property management, and fee contracts and other commitments with person for services and expenses incidental to the acquisition of right-of-way.</P>
          <P>(ii) The State may not discriminate against eligible persons in making relocation payments and in providing relocation advisory assistance where relocation is necessitated by highway right-of-way acquisitions.</P>
          <P>(iii) Federal-aid contractors may not discriminate in their selection and retention of first-tier subcontractors, and first-tier subcontractors may not discriminate in their selection and retention of second-tier subcontractors, who participate in Federal-aid highway construction, acquisition of right-of-way and related projects, including those who supply materials and lease equipment.</P>

          <P>(iv) The State may not discriminate against the traveling public and business users of the federally assisted highway in their access to and use of the facilities and services provided for public accommodations (such as eating, sleeping, rest, recreation, <PRTPAGE P="152"/>and vehicle servicing) constructed on, over or under the right-of-way of such highways.</P>
          <P>(v) Neither the State, any other persons subject to this part, nor its contractors and subcontractors may discriminate in their employment practices in connection with highway construction projects or other projects assisted by the Federal Highway Administration.</P>
          <P>(vi) The State shall not locate or design a highway in such a manner as to require, on the basis of race, color, or national origin, the relocation of any persons.</P>
          <P>(vii) The State shall not locate, design, or construct a highway in such a manner as to deny reasonable access to, and use thereof, to any persons on the basis of race, color, or national origin.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Federal Transit Administration.</E> (i) Any person who is, or seeks to be, a patron of any public vehicle which is operated as a part of, or in conjunction with, a project shall be given the same access, seating, and other treatment with regard to the use of such vehicle as other persons without regard to their race, color, or national origin.</P>
          <P>(ii) No person who is, or seeks to be, an employee of the project sponsor or lessees, concessionaires, contractors, licensees, or any organization furnishing public transportation service as a part of, or in conjunction with, the project shall be treated less favorably than any other employee or applicant with regard to hiring, dismissal, advancement, wages, or any other conditions and benefits of employment, on the basis of race, color, or national origin.</P>
          <P>(iii) No person or group of persons shall be discriminated against with regard to the routing, scheduling, or quality of service of transportation service furnished as a part of the project on the basis of race, color, or national origin. Frequency of service, age and quality of vehicles assigned to routes, quality of stations serving different routes, and location of routes may not be determined on the basis of race, color, or national origin.</P>
          <P>(iv) The location of projects requiring land acquisition and the displacement of persons from their residences and businesses may not be determined on the basis of race, color, or national origin.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Obligations of the airport operator</E>—(1) <E T="03">Tenants, contractors, and concessionaires.</E> Each airport operator shall require each tenant, contractor, and concessionaire who provides any activity, service, or facility at the airport under lease, contract with, or franchise from the airport, to covenant in a form specified by the Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration, that he will comply with the nondiscrimination requirements of this part.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Notification of beneficiaries.</E> The airport operator shall: (i) Make a copy of this part available at his office for inspection during normal working hours by any person asking for it, and (ii) conspicuously display a sign, or signs, furnished by the FAA, in the main public area or areas of the airport, stating that discrimination based on race, color, or national origin is prohibited on the airport.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Reports.</E> Each airport owner subject to this part shall, within 15 days after he receives it, forward to the Area Manager of the FAA Area in which the airport is located a copy of each written complaint charging discrimination because of race, color, or national origin by any person subject to this part, together with a statement describing all actions taken to resolve the matter, and the results thereof. Each airport operator shall submit to the area manager of the FAA area in which the airport is located a report for the preceding year on the date and in a form prescribed by the Federal Aviation Administrator.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Loan terms and conditions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Amount.</E> The maximum face amount for an individual STLP loan may not exceed seven hundred and fifty thousand ($750,000) dollars, unless the requested increased amount is authorized by the OSDBU Director.</P>

            <P>(1) <E T="03">Initial Interest Rate.</E> The base rate guideline for STLP loans is the prime rate in effect on the first business day of the month in which the STLP loan guarantee is approved by DOT OSDBU. The prime rate is the rate printed in a national financial newspaper published each business day. The Participating Lender may increase the base rate by the maximum allowable percentage points currently allowed by STLP policies and procedures and as communicated in subsequent DOT OSDBU notices.<PRTPAGE P="155"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Frequency of Change.</E> The first change may occur on the first calendar day of the month following the initial loan disbursement, using the above base rate in effect on the first business day of the month. Subsequent interest rate changes may occur no more than monthly.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Loan Structure and Term.</E> A STLP loan shall be set up as a revolving line of credit. The line permits the borrower to request principal advances, pay them back, and then re-borrow, not to exceed the face value of the line of credit. Participating Lenders are required to provide DOT OSDBU written notification of the activation date of each line of credit under the STLP. The term of the Federal guarantee of the line of credit commences on the activation date.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Repayment.</E> Interest payments must be made monthly. The principal of the loan is repaid as payment from approved accounts receivable are received by the Participating Lender through a joint payee check system. The assigned contract supporting the STLP loan is the primary source of repayment.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Use of Loan Proceeds.</E> STLP loans must be used to finance short-term working capital needs, specifically direct costs generated by the assigned contract. Proceeds may not be used for the following purposes:</P>
            <P>(1) For long term working capital;</P>
            <P>(2) To repay delinquent State or Federal withholding taxes, local taxes, sales taxes or similar funds that should be held in trust or escrow; and/or</P>
            <P>(3) To provide funds for the distribution or payment to the owners, partners or shareholders of the business; and/or</P>
            <P>(4) To retire short or long-term debt.</P>
            <P>(f) Non-compliance by the DBE in using the STLP loan for purposes not consistent with these regulations will result in a non-renewal of the STLP loan and in forfeiture of the STLP loan guarantee to the PL on any ineligible principal advances requested by the borrower and made by the PL.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Disbursements.</E> STLP funds may only be released to an eligible borrower upon the submission and verification of a valid written accounts receivable invoice, showing labor and/or materials amounts due for completed work on the contract. The Participating Lender must verify the accuracy of the invoice with the paying transportation government agency, if the borrower is a prime contractor, and/or with the prime contractor, if the borrower is a subcontractor. This verification must be obtained by the Participating Lender prior to advancing funds. No more than 85% of an approved accounts receivable invoice shall be advanced to the borrower by the Participating Lender.</P>
            <P>(1) Processing time. Disbursement of STLP funds to the borrower should be accomplished within three (3) business days of an accounts receivable invoice approval by the paying agency and/or prime contractor.</P>
            <P>(2) Electronic funds transfer. If the disbursement of STLP funds is being sent to the borrower through a local Participating Lender, the disbursement should be made by electronic funds transfer with the preferred method of payment being the Automated Clearing House (ACH) system.</P>
            <P>(3) Wire transfers. Wire transfers can be used if the ACH system is not available or if a same day disbursement is required.</P>
            <P>(4) Joint payee check system. A two-party payee check system is required in which the Participating Lender and the borrower will be the co-payees of any checks paid to the borrower for performance under the assigned contract. Alternative payment methods must have prior written approval by DOT OSDBU.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Personal Guarantees.</E> Individuals who own at least a 20% ownership interest in the borrower shall personally guarantee the STLP loan. DOT OSDBU, in its discretion and in consulting with the Participating Lender, may require other appropriate guarantees for the loan as well.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Collateral.</E> All advances under the STLP loan must be secured, at a minimum, by the assignment of the proceeds due under the transportation-related contract(s) being funded with loan proceeds (the Assigned Contract). The Participating Lender must have first lien position on the Accounts Receivable generated by the Assigned Contract. The Participating Lender <PRTPAGE P="156"/>and/or DOT OSDBU may request additional collateral on any loan request or loan guarantee request in order to mitigate the credit risk and reduce potential defaults and loan losses.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Key Person Life Insurance.</E> The assignment of existing life insurance policies of personal guarantors or other individuals critical to the borrower's operations may be required by the Participating Lender and/or DOT OSDBU in certain instances; and it is encouraged for those business applicants that do not have a management succession plan clearly in place or where a personal guarantee provides nominal financial strength to the credit.</P>

            <P>(a) The Participating Lender must bring to the immediate attention of the Director any delinquent STLP loans. The Participating Lender and DOT OSDBU are jointly responsible for establishing collection procedures and must exercise due diligence with respect to collection of delinquent debt. The Participating Lender is responsible for initiating actions to recover such debt. DOT OSDBU must approve any compromise of a claim, resolution of a dispute, suspension or termination of collection action, or referral for litigation. A work-out solution will only be considered if it is expected to minimize the cost to the federal government in resolving repayment delinquencies and/or loan default. They must only be used when the borrower is likely to be able to repay the loan under the terms of the work-out, and if the cost of establishing the work-out plan is less than the costs of loan default and/or foreclosure.</P>
            <P>(b) In an appropriate situation, DOT OSDBU may authorize the Participating Lender to undertake legal action deemed necessary to collect delinquent loans and DOT will reimburse the Participating Lender on a pro rata basis in proportion to the loan guarantee percentage for the associated fees and costs, with prior authorization from the Director. Penalties and late fees are not eligible for reimbursement. Any legal action undertaken by the Participating Lender without OSDBU authorization will not be eligible for a pro rata basis reimbursement of the associated fees and costs. Net recoveries applicable to accrued interest must be applied on a pro rata basis in proportion to the formula used during the term of the loan.</P>

            <P>After reasonable efforts have been exhausted to collect on a delinquent debt, the Participating Lender may demand in writing that DOT OSDBU honor its loan guarantee, provided however that the maximum liability of DOT OSDBU shall not at any time exceed the guaranteed amount. The borrower must be in default for no less than thirty (30) days, and the Participating Lender must have made written demand for payment from the borrower, in accordance with the guarantee agreement.</P>

            <P>This part seeks to achieve several objectives:</P>
            <P>(a) To ensure nondiscrimination in the award and administration of opportunities for concessions by airports receiving DOT financial assistance;</P>
            <P>(b) To create a level playing field on which ACDBEs can compete fairly for opportunities for concessions;</P>
            <P>(c) To ensure that the Department's ACDBE program is narrowly tailored in accordance with applicable law;</P>
            <P>(d) To ensure that only firms that fully meet this part's eligibility standards are permitted to participate as ACDBEs;</P>
            <P>(e) To help remove barriers to the participation of ACDBEs in opportunities for concessions at airports receiving DOT financial assistance; and</P>
            <P>(f) To provide appropriate flexibility to airports receiving DOT financial assistance in establishing and providing opportunities for ACDBEs.</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">Affiliation</E> has the same meaning the term has in the Small Business Administration (SBA) regulations, 13 CFR part 121, except that the provisions of SBA regulations concerning affiliation in the context of joint ventures (13 CFR § 121.103(f)) do not apply to this part.</P>

            <P>(1) Except as otherwise provided in 13 CFR part 121, concerns are affiliates of <PRTPAGE P="163"/>each other when, either directly or indirectly:</P>
            <P>(i) One concern controls or has the power to control the other; or</P>
            <P>(ii) A third party or parties controls or has the power to control both; or</P>
            <P>(iii) An identity of interest between or among parties exists such that affiliation may be found.</P>
            <P>(2) In determining whether affiliation exists, it is necessary to consider all appropriate factors, including common ownership, common management, and contractual relationships. Affiliates must be considered together in determining whether a concern meets small business size criteria and the statutory cap on the participation of firms in the ACDBE program.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Airport Concession Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (ACDBE)</E> means a concession that is a for-profit small business concern—</P>
            <P>(1) That is at least 51 percent owned by one or more individuals who are both socially and economically disadvantaged or, in the case of a corporation, in which 51 percent of the stock is owned by one or more such individuals; and</P>
            <P>(2) Whose management and daily business operations are controlled by one or more of the socially and economically disadvantaged individuals who own it.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Alaska Native Corporation (ANC)</E> means any Regional Corporation, Village Corporation, Urban Corporation, or Group Corporation organized under the laws of the State of Alaska in accordance with the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 <E T="03">et seq.</E>)</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Car dealership</E> means an establishment primarily engaged in the retail sale of new and/or used automobiles. Car dealerships frequently maintain repair departments and carry stocks of replacement parts, tires, batteries, and automotive accessories. Such establishments also frequently sell pickup trucks and vans at retail. In the standard industrial classification system, car dealerships are categorized in NAICS code 441110.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Concession</E> means one or more of the types of for-profit businesses listed in paragraph (1) or (2) of this definition:</P>
            <P>(1) A business, located on an airport subject to this part, that is engaged in the sale of consumer goods or services to the public under an agreement with the recipient, another concessionaire, or the owner or lessee of a terminal, if other than the recipient.</P>

            <P>(2) A business conducting one or more of the following covered activities, even if it does not maintain an office, store, or other business location on an airport subject to this part, as long as the activities take place on the airport: Management contracts and subcontracts, a web-based or other electronic business in a terminal or which passengers can access at the terminal, an advertising business that provides advertising displays or messages to the public on the airport, or a business that provides goods and services to concessionaires.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example to paragraph (2):</HD>
              <P>A supplier of goods or a management contractor maintains its office or primary place of business off the airport. However the supplier provides goods to a retail establishment in the airport; or the management contractor operates the parking facility on the airport. These businesses are considered concessions for purposes of this part.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>(3) For purposes of this subpart, a business is not considered to be “located on the airport” solely because it picks up and/or delivers customers under a permit, license, or other agreement. For example, providers of taxi, limousine, car rental, or hotel services are not considered to be located on the airport just because they send shuttles onto airport grounds to pick up passengers or drop them off. A business is considered to be “located on the airport,” however, if it has an on-airport facility. Such facilities include in the case of a taxi operator, a dispatcher; in the case of a limousine, a booth selling tickets to the public; in the case of a car rental company, a counter at which its services are sold to the public or a ready return facility; and in the case of a hotel operator, a hotel located anywhere on airport property.</P>

            <P>(4) Any business meeting the definition of concession is covered by this subpart, regardless of the name given to the agreement with the recipient, concessionaire, or airport terminal owner or lessee. A concession may be <PRTPAGE P="164"/>operated under various types of agreements, including but not limited to the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Leases.</P>
            <P>(ii) Subleases.</P>
            <P>(iii) Permits.</P>
            <P>(iv) Contracts or subcontracts.</P>
            <P>(v) Other instruments or arrangements.</P>

            <P>(5) The conduct of an aeronautical activity is not considered a concession for purposes of this subpart. Aeronautical activities include scheduled and non-scheduled air carriers, air taxis, air charters, and air couriers, in their normal passenger or freight carrying capacities; fixed base operators; flight schools; recreational service providers (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> sky-diving, parachute-jumping, flying guides); and air tour services.</P>
            <P>(6) Other examples of entities that do not meet the definition of a concession include flight kitchens and in-flight caterers servicing air carriers, government agencies, industrial plants, farm leases, individuals leasing hangar space, custodial and security contracts, telephone and electric service to the airport facility, holding companies, and skycap services under contract with an air carrier or airport.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Concessionaire</E> means a firm that owns and controls a concession or a portion of a concession.</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">Indian tribe</E> means any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community of Indians, including any ANC, which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, or is recognized as such by the State in which the tribe, band, nation, group, or community resides.

            <SUBJECT>What measures must recipients include in their ACDBE programs to ensure nondiscriminatory participation of ACDBEs in concessions?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) You must include in your ACDBE program a narrative description of the types of measures you intend to make to ensure nondiscriminatory participation of ACDBEs in concession and other covered activities.</P>
            <P>(b) Your ACDBE program must provide for setting goals consistent with the requirements of Subpart D of this part.</P>
            <P>(c) Your ACDBE program must provide for seeking ACDBE participation in all types of concession activities, rather than concentrating participation in one category or a few categories to the exclusion of others.</P>
            <P>(d) Your ACDBE program must include race-neutral measures that you will take. You must maximize the use of race-neutral measures, obtaining as much as possible of the ACDBE participation needed to meet overall goals through such measures. These are responsibilities that you directly undertake as a recipient, in addition to the efforts that concessionaires make, to obtain ACDBE participation. The following are examples of race-neutral measures you can implement:</P>

            <P>(4) Providing technical assistance to ACDBEs in overcoming limitations, such as inability to obtain bonding or financing;</P>
            <P>(5) Ensuring that competitors for concession opportunities are informed during pre-solicitation meetings about how the recipient's ACDBE program will affect the procurement process;</P>
            <P>(6) Providing information concerning the availability of ACDBE firms to competitors to assist them in obtaining ACDBE participation; and</P>
            <P>(7) Establishing a business development program (<E T="03">see</E> part 26, § 26.35); technical assistance program; or taking other steps to foster ACDBE participation in concessions.</P>
            <P>(e) Your ACDBE program must also provide for the use of race-conscious measures when race-neutral measures, standing alone, are not projected to be sufficient to meet an overall goal. The following are examples of race-conscious measures you can implement:</P>
            <P>(1) Establishing concession-specific goals for particular concession opportunities.</P>
            <P>(i) If the objective of the concession-specific goal is to obtain ACDBE participation through a direct ownership arrangement with a ACDBE, calculate the goal as a percentage of the total estimated annual gross receipts from the concession.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the goal applies to purchases and/or leases of goods and services, calculate the goal by dividing the estimated dollar value of such purchases and/or leases from ACDBEs by the total estimated dollar value of all purchases to be made by the concessionaire.</P>
            <P>(iii) To be eligible to be awarded the concession, competitors must make good faith efforts to meet this goal. A competitor may do so either by obtaining enough ACDBE participation to meet the goal or by documenting that it made sufficient good faith efforts to do so.</P>
            <P>(iv) The administrative procedures applicable to contract goals in part 26, § 26.51-53, apply with respect to concession-specific goals.</P>
            <P>(2) Negotiation with a potential concessionaire to include ACDBE participation, through direct ownership arrangements or measures, in the operation of the concession.</P>
            <P>(3) With the prior approval of FAA, other methods that take a competitor's ability to provide ACDBE participation into account in awarding a concession.</P>

            <P>(f) Your ACDBE program must require businesses subject to ACDBE goals at the airport (except car rental companies) to make good faith efforts to explore all available options to meet goals, to the maximum extent practicable, through direct ownership arrangements with DBEs.<PRTPAGE P="170"/>
            </P>

This mechanism must include a written certification that you have reviewed records of all contracts, leases, joint venture agreements, or other concession-related agreements and monitored the work on-site at your airport for this purpose. The monitoring to which this paragraph refers may be conducted in conjunction with monitoring of concession performance for other purposes.</P>

            <P>(a) As a recipient, you must use, except as provided in this subpart, the procedures and standards of part 26, §§ 26.61-91 for certification of ACDBEs to participate in your concessions program. Your ACDBE program must incorporate the use of these standards and procedures and must provide that certification decisions for ACDBEs will be made by the Unified Certification Program (UCP) in your state (<E T="03">see</E> part 26, § 26.81).</P>
            <P>(b) The UCP's directory of eligible DBEs must specify whether a firm is certified as a DBE for purposes of part 26, an ACDBE for purposes of part 23, or both.</P>
            <P>(c) As an airport or UCP, you must review the eligibility of currently certified ACDBE firms to make sure that they meet the eligibility standards of this part.</P>
            <P>(1) You must complete these reviews as soon as possible, but in no case later than April 21, 2006 or three years from the anniversary date of each firm's most recent certification, whichever is later.</P>
            <P>(2) You must direct all currently certified ACDBEs to submit to you by April 21, 2006, a personal net worth statement, a certification of disadvantage, and an affidavit of no change.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What size standards do recipients use to determine the eligibility of ACDBEs?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As a recipient, you must, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, treat a firm as a small business eligible to be certified as an ACDBE if its gross receipts, averaged over the firm's previous three fiscal years, do not exceed $56.42 million.</P>
            <P>(b) The following types of businesses have size standards that differ from the standard set forth in paragraph (a) of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Banks and financial institutions:</E> $1 billion in assets;</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Car rental companies:</E> $75.23 million average annual gross receipts over the firm's three previous fiscal years, as <PRTPAGE P="171"/>adjusted by the Department for inflation every two years from April 3, 2009.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Pay telephones:</E> 1,500 employees;</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Automobile dealers:</E> 350 employees.</P>

            <P>(c) The Department adjusts the numbers in paragraphs (a) and (b)(2) of this section using the Department of Commerce price deflators for purchases by State and local governments as the basis for this adjustment. The Department publishes a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> document informing the public of each adjustment.</P>

            <P>The personal net worth standard used in determining eligibility for purposes of this part is $1.32 million. Any individual who has a personal net worth exceeding this amount is not a socially and economically disadvantaged individual for purposes of this part, even if the individual is a member of a group otherwise presumed to be disadvantaged.</P>

            <P>(a) You must presume that a firm that is certified as a DBE under part 26 is eligible to participate as an ACDBE. By meeting the size, disadvantage (including personal net worth), ownership and control standards of part 26, the firm will have also met the eligibility standards for part 23.</P>
            <P>(b) However, before certifying such a firm, you must ensure that the disadvantaged owners of a DBE certified under part 26 are able to control the firm with respect to its activity in the concessions program. In addition, you are not required to certify a part 26 DBE as a part 23 ACDBE if the firm does not do work relevant to the airport's concessions program.</P>

            <P>(a) The provisions of part 26, §§ 26.83 (c)(2) through (c)(6) do not apply to certifications for purposes of this part. Instead, in determining whether a firm is an eligible ACDBE, you must take the following steps:</P>
            <P>(1) Obtain the resumes or work histories of the principal owners of the firm and personally interview these individuals;</P>
            <P>(2) Analyze the ownership of stock of the firm, if it is a corporation;</P>
            <P>(3) Analyze the bonding and financial capacity of the firm;</P>
            <P>(4) Determine the work history of the firm, including any concession contracts or other contracts it may have received;</P>
            <P>(5) Obtain or compile a list of the licenses of the firm and its key personnel to perform the concession contracts or other contracts it wishes to receive;</P>
            <P>(6) Obtain a statement from the firm of the type(s) of concession(s) it prefers to operate or the type(s) of other contract(s) it prefers to perform.</P>
            <P>(b) In reviewing the affidavit required by part 26, § 26.83(j), you must ensure that the ACDBE firm meets the applicable size standard in § 23.33.</P>
            <P>(c) For purposes of this part, the term prime contractor in part 26, § 26.87(i) includes a firm holding a prime contract with an airport concessionaire to provide goods or services to the concessionaire or a firm holding a prime concession agreement with a recipient.</P>
            <P>(d) With respect to firms owned by Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs), the provisions of part 26, § 26.73(i) do not apply under this part. The eligibility of ANC-owned firms for purposes of this part is governed by § 26.73(h).</P>

            <P>(e) When you remove a concessionaire's eligibility after the concessionaire has entered a concession agreement, because the firm exceeded the small business size standard or because an owner has exceeded the personal net worth standard, and the firm in all other respects remains an eligible DBE, you may continue to count the concessionaire's participation toward DBE goals during the remainder of the current concession agreement. However, you must not count the concessionaire's participation toward DBE goals beyond the termination date for the concession agreement in effect at the time of the decertification (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, in <PRTPAGE P="172"/>a case where the agreement is renewed or extended, or an option for continued participation beyond the current term of the agreement is exercised).</P>
            <P>(f) When UCPs are established in a state (see part 26, § 26.81), the UCP, rather than individual recipients, certifies firms for the ACDBE concession program.</P>
            <P>(g) You must use the Uniform Application Form found in appendix F to part 26. However, you must instruct applicants to take the following additional steps:</P>
            <P>(1) In the space available in section 2(B)(7) of the form, the applicant must state that it is applying for certification as an ACDBE.</P>
            <P>(2) With respect to section 4(C) of the form, the applicant must provide information on an attached page concerning the address/location, ownership/lease status, current value of property or lease, and fees/lease payments paid to the airport.</P>
            <P>(3) The applicant need not complete section 4(I) and (J). However, the applicant must provide information on an attached page concerning any other airport concession businesses the applicant firm or any affiliate owns and/or operates, including name, location, type of concession, and start date of concession.</P>
            <P>(h) Car rental companies and private terminal owners or lessees are not authorized to certify firms as ACDBEs. As a car rental company or private terminal owner or lessee, you must obtain ACDBE participation from firms which a recipient or UCPs have certified as ACDBEs.</P>
            <P>(i) You must use the certification standards of this part to determine the ACDBE eligibility of firms that provide goods and services to concessionaires.</P>

            <P>(a) If you are a recipient who must implement an ACDBE program, you must, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, establish two separate overall ACDBE goals. The first is for car rentals; the second is for concessions other than car rentals.</P>
            <P>(b) If your annual car rental concession revenues, averaged over the three-years preceding the date on which you are required to submit overall goals, do not exceed $200,000, you are not required to submit a car rental overall goal. If your annual revenues for concessions other than car rentals, averaged over the three years preceding the date on which you are required to submit overall goals, do not exceed $200,000, you are not required to submit a non-car rental overall goal.</P>
            <P>(c) Each overall goal must cover a three-year period. You must review your goals annually to make sure they continue to fit your circumstances appropriately. You must report to the FAA any significant adjustments that you make to your goal in the time before your next scheduled submission.</P>
            <P>(d) Your goals established under this part must provide for participation by all certified ACDBEs and may not be subdivided into group-specific goals.</P>
            <P>(e) If you fail to establish and implement goals as provided in this section, you are not in compliance with this part. If you establish and implement goals in a way different from that provided in this part, you are not in compliance with this part. If you fail to comply with this requirement, you are not eligible to receive FAA financial assistance.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What are the requirements for submitting overall goal information to the FAA?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) You must submit your overall goals to the appropriate FAA Regional Civil Rights Office for approval. Your first set of overall goals meeting the requirements of this subpart are due on the following schedule:</P>
            <P>(1) If you are a large or medium hub primary airport on April 21, 2005, by January 1, 2006. You must make your next submissions by October 1, 2008.</P>
            <P>(2) If you are a small hub primary airport on April 21, 2005, by October 1, 2006.</P>
            <P>(3) If you are a nonhub primary airport on April 21, 2005, by October 1, 2007.</P>
            <P>(b) You must then submit new goals every three years after the date that applies to you.</P>
            <P>(c) Timely submission and FAA approval of your overall goals is a condition of eligibility for FAA financial assistance.</P>
            <P>(d) In the time before you make your first submission under paragraph (a) of this section, you must continue to use the overall goals that have been approved by the FAA before the effective date of this part.</P>
            <P>(e) Your overall goal submission must include a description of the method used to calculate your goals and the data you relied on. You must “show your work” to enable the FAA to understand how you concluded your goals were appropriate. This means that you must provide to the FAA the data, calculations, assumptions, and reasoning used in establishing your goals.</P>

            <P>(f) Your submission must include your projection of the portions of your overall goals you propose to meet through use of race-neutral and race-conscious means, respectively, and the basis for making this projection (<E T="03">see</E> § 23.51(d)(5))</P>

            <P>(g) FAA may approve or disapprove the way you calculated your goal, including your race-neutral/race-conscious “split,” as part of its review of your plan or goal submission. Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, the FAA does not approve or disapprove the goal itself (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the number).</P>
            <P>(h) If the FAA determines that your goals have not been correctly calculated or the justification is inadequate, the FAA may, after consulting with you, adjust your overall goal or race-conscious/race-neutral “split.” The adjusted goal represents the FAA's determination of an appropriate overall goal for ACDBE participation in the recipient's concession program, based on relevant data and analysis. The adjusted goal is binding on you.</P>
            <P>(i) If a new concession opportunity, the estimated average annual gross revenues of which are anticipated to be $200,000 or greater, arises at a time that falls between normal submission dates for overall goals, you must submit an appropriate adjustment to your overall goal to the FAA for approval no later than 90 days before issuing the solicitation for the new concession opportunity.</P>

            <P>Except in the case where you use the alternative goal approach of § 23.51(c)(5)(ii), the base for your goal is the total gross receipts of car rental operations at your airport. You do not include gross receipts of other concessions in this base.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 23.51</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How are a recipient's overall goals expressed and calculated?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Your objective in setting a goal is to estimate the percentage of the base calculated under §§ 23.47-23.49 that would be performed by ACDBEs in the absence of discrimination and its effects.</P>
            <P>(1) This percentage is the estimated ACDBE participation that would occur if there were a “level playing field” for firms to work as concessionaires for your airport.</P>
            <P>(2) In conducting this goal setting process, you are determining the extent, if any, to which the firms in your market area have suffered discrimination or its effects in connection with concession opportunities or related business opportunities.</P>
            <P>(3) You must complete the goal-setting process separately for each of the two overall goals identified in § 23.41 of this part.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) Each overall concessions goal must be based on demonstrable evidence of the availability of ready, willing and able ACDBEs relative to all businesses ready, willing and able to participate in your ACDBE program (hereafter, the “relative availability of ACDBEs”).</P>
            <P>(2) You cannot simply rely on the 10 percent national aspirational goal, your previous overall goal, or past ACDBE participation rates in your program without reference to the relative availability of ACDBEs in your market.</P>
            <P>(3) Your market area is defined by the geographical area in which the substantial majority of firms which seek to do concessions business with the airport are located and the geographical area in which the firms which receive the substantial majority of concessions-related revenues are located. Your market area may be different for different types of concessions.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Step 1.</E> You must begin your goal setting process by determining a base figure for the relative availability of ACDBEs. The following are examples of approaches that you may take toward determining a base figure. These examples are provided as a starting point for your goal setting process. Any percentage figure derived from one of these examples should be considered a basis from which you begin when examining the evidence available to you. These examples are not intended as an exhaustive list. Other methods or combinations of methods to determine a base figure may be used, subject to approval by the FAA.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Use DBE Directories and Census Bureau Data.</E> Determine the number of ready, willing and able ACDBEs in your market area from your ACDBE directory. Using the Census Bureau's County Business Pattern (CBP) data base, determine the number of all ready, willing and able businesses available in your market area that perform work in the same NAICS codes. (Information about the CBP data base may be obtained from the Census Bureau at their Web site, <E T="03">http://www.census.gov/epcd/cbp/view/cbpview.html.</E>) Divide the number of ACDBEs by the number of all businesses to derive a base figure for the relative availability of ACDBEs in your market area.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Use an Active Participants List.</E> Determine the number of ACDBEs that have participated or attempted to participate in your airport concessions program in previous years. Determine the number of all businesses that have participated or attempted to participate in your airport concession program in previous years. Divide the number of ACDBEs who have participated or attempted to participate by the number for all businesses to derive a base figure for the relative availability of ACDBEs in your market area.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Use data from a disparity study.</E> Use a percentage figure derived from data in a valid, applicable disparity study.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Use the goal of another recipient.</E> If another airport or other DOT recipient in the same, or substantially similar, <PRTPAGE P="175"/>market has set an overall goal in compliance with this rule, you may use that goal as a base figure for your goal.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Alternative methods.</E> (i) You may use other methods to determine a base figure for your overall goal. Any methodology you choose must be based on demonstrable evidence of local market conditions and be designed to ultimately attain a goal that is rationally related to the relative availability of ACDBEs in your market area.</P>
            <P>(ii) In the case of a car rental goal, where it appears that all or most of the goal is likely to be met through the purchases by car rental companies of vehicles or other goods or services from ACDBEs, one permissible alternative is to structure the goal entirely in terms of purchases of goods and services. In this case, you would calculate your car rental overall goal by dividing the estimated dollar value of such purchases from ACDBEs by the total estimated dollar value of all purchases to be made by car rental companies.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Step 2.</E> Once you have calculated a base figure, you must examine all relevant evidence reasonably available in your jurisdiction to determine what adjustment, if any, is needed to the base figure in order to arrive at your overall goal.</P>
            <P>(1) There are many types of evidence that must be considered when adjusting the base figure. These include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(i) The current capacity of ACDBEs to perform work in your concessions program, as measured by the volume of work ACDBEs have performed in recent years; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Evidence from disparity studies conducted anywhere within your jurisdiction, to the extent it is not already accounted for in your base figure.</P>
            <P>(2) If your base figure is the goal of another recipient, you must adjust it for differences in your market area and your concessions program.</P>
            <P>(3) If available, you must consider evidence from related fields that affect the opportunities for ACDBEs to form, grow and compete. These include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(i) Statistical disparities in the ability of ACDBEs to get the financing, bonding and insurance required to participate in your program;</P>
            <P>(ii) Data on employment, self-employment, education, training and union apprenticeship programs, to the extent you can relate it to the opportunities for ACDBEs to perform in your program.</P>
            <P>(4) If you attempt to make an adjustment to your base figure to account for the continuing effects of past discrimination, or the effects of an ongoing ACDBE program, the adjustment must be based on demonstrable evidence that is logically and directly related to the effect for which the adjustment is sought.</P>

            <P>(5) Among the information you submit with your overall goal (<E T="03">see</E> 23.45(e)), you must include description of the methodology you used to establish the goal, including your base figure and the evidence with which it was calculated, as well as the adjustments you made to the base figure and the evidence relied on for the adjustments. You should also include a summary listing of the relevant available evidence in your jurisdiction and an explanation of how you used that evidence to adjust your base figure. You must also include your projection of the portions of the overall goal you expect to meet through race-neutral and race-conscious measures, respectively (<E T="03">see</E> §§ 26.51(c)).</P>

            <P>(e) You are not required to obtain prior FAA concurrence with your overall goal (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, with the number itself). However, if the FAA's review suggests that your overall goal has not been correctly calculated, or that your method for calculating goals is inadequate, the FAA may, after consulting with you, adjust your overall goal or require that you do so. The adjusted overall goal is binding on you.</P>
            <P>(f) If you need additional time to collect data or take other steps to develop an approach to setting overall goals, you may request the approval of the FAA Administrator for an interim goal and/or goal-setting mechanism. Such a mechanism must:</P>
            <P>(1) Reflect the relative availability of ACDBEs in your local market area to the maximum extent feasible given the data available to you; and</P>
            <P>(2) Avoid imposing undue burdens on non-ACDBEs.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How do car rental companies count ACDBE participation toward their goals?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As a car rental company, you may, in meeting the goal the airport has set for you, include purchases or leases of vehicles from any vendor that is a certified ACDBE.</P>
            <P>(b) As a car rental company, if you choose to meet the goal the airport has set for you by including purchases or leases of vehicles from an ACDBE vendor, you must also submit to the recipient documentation of the good faith efforts you have made to obtain ACDBE participation from other ACDBE providers of goods and services.</P>
            <P>(c) While this part does not require you to obtain ACDBE participation through direct ownership arrangements, you may count such participation toward the goal the airport has set for you.</P>
            <P>(d) The following special rules apply to counting participation related to car rental operations:</P>
            <P>(1) Count the entire amount of the cost charged by an ACDBE for repairing vehicles, provided that it is reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services.</P>
            <P>(2) Count the entire amount of the fee or commission charged by a ACDBE to manage a car rental concession under an agreement with the concessionaire toward ACDBE goals, provided that it is reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services.</P>
            <P>(3) Do not count any portion of a fee paid by a manufacturer to a car dealership for reimbursement of work performed under the manufacturer's warranty.</P>
            <P>(e) For other goods and services, count participation toward ACDBE goals as provided in part 26, § 26.55 and § 23.55 of this part. In the event of any conflict between these two sections, § 23.55 controls.</P>

            <P>(f) If you have a national or regional contract, count a pro-rated share of the amount of that contract toward the goals of each airport covered by the contract. Use the proportion of your applicable gross receipts as the basis for making this pro-rated assignment of ACDBE participation.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example to paragraph (f):</HD>
              <P>Car Rental Company X signs a regional contract with an ACDBE car dealer to supply cars to all five airports in a state. The five airports each account for 20 percent of X's gross receipts in the state. Twenty percent of the value of the cars purchased through the ACDBE car dealer would count toward the goal of each airport.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 23.55</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How do recipients count ACDBE participation toward goals for items other than car rentals?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) You count only ACDBE participation that results from a commercially useful function. For purposes of this part, the term commercially useful function has the same meaning as in part 26, § 26.55(c), except that the requirements of § 26.55(c)(3) do not apply to concessions.</P>
            <P>(b) Count the total dollar value of gross receipts an ACDBE earns under a concession agreement and the total dollar value of a management contract or subcontract with an ACDBE toward the goal. However, if the ACDBE enters into a subconcession agreement or subcontract with a non-ACDBE, do not count any of the gross receipts earned by the non-ACDBE.</P>
            <P>(c) When an ACDBE performs as a subconcessionaire or subcontractor for a non-ACDBE, count only the portion of the gross receipts earned by the ACDBE under its subagreement.</P>
            <P>(d) When an ACDBE performs as a participant in a joint venture, count a portion of the gross receipts equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the concession that the ACDBE performs with its own forces toward ACDBE goals.</P>

            <P>(e) Count the entire amount of fees or commissions charged by an ACDBE firm for a <E T="03">bona fide</E> service, provided that, as the recipient, you determine this amount to be reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services. Such services may include, but are not limited to, professional, technical, consultant, legal, security systems, advertising, building cleaning and maintenance, computer programming, or managerial.</P>

            <P>(f) Count 100 percent of the cost of goods obtained from an ACDBE manufacturer. For purposes of this part, the <PRTPAGE P="177"/>term manufacturer has the same meaning as in part 26, § 26.55(e)(1)(ii).</P>
            <P>(g) Count 100 percent of the cost of goods purchased or leased from a ACDBE regular dealer. For purposes of this part, the term “regular dealer” has the same meaning as in part 26, § 26.55(e)(2)(ii).</P>
            <P>(h) Count credit toward ACDBE goals for goods purchased from an ACDBE which is neither a manufacturer nor a regular dealer as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) Count the entire amount of fees or commissions charged for assistance in the procurement of the goods, provided that this amount is reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services. Do not count any portion of the cost of the goods themselves.</P>
            <P>(2) Count the entire amount of fees or transportation charges for the delivery of goods required for a concession, provided that this amount is reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services. Do not count any portion of the cost of goods themselves.</P>
            <P>(i) If a firm has not been certified as an ACDBE in accordance with the standards in this part, do not count the firm's participation toward ACDBE goals.</P>
            <P>(j) Do not count the work performed or gross receipts earned by a firm after its eligibility has been removed toward ACDBE goals. However, if an ACDBE firm certified on April 21, 2005 is decertified because one or more of its disadvantaged owners do not meet the personal net worth criterion or the firm exceeds business size standards of this part during the performance of a contract or other agreement, the firm's participation may continue to be counted toward ACDBE goals for the remainder of the term of the contract or other agreement (but not extensions or renewals of such contracts or agreements).</P>
            <P>(k) Do not count costs incurred in connection with the renovation, repair, or construction of a concession facility (sometimes referred to as the “build-out”).</P>
            <P>(l) Do not count the ACDBE participation of car rental companies toward your ACDBE achievements toward this goal.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What happens if a recipient falls short of meeting its overall goals?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) You cannot be penalized, or treated by the Department as being in noncompliance with this part, simply because your ACDBE participation falls short of your overall goals. You can be penalized or treated as being in noncompliance only if you have failed to administer your ACDBE program in good faith.</P>
            <P>(b) If the awards and commitments shown on your Uniform Report of ACDBE Participation (found in Appendix A to this Part) at the end of any fiscal year are less than the overall goal applicable to that fiscal year, you must do the following in order to be regarded by the Department as implementing your ACDBE program in good faith:</P>
            <P>(1) Analyze in detail the reasons for the difference between the overall goal and your awards and commitments in that fiscal year;</P>
            <P>(2) Establish specific steps and milestones to correct the problems you have identified in your analysis and to enable you to meet fully your goal for the new fiscal year;</P>
            <P>(3) (i) If you are a CORE 30 airport or other airport designated by the FAA, you must submit, within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year, the analysis and corrective actions developed under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section to the FAA for approval. If the FAA approves the report, you will be regarded as complying with the requirements of this section for the remainder of the fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(ii) As an airport not meeting the criteria of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, you must retain analysis and corrective actions in your records for three years and make it available to the FAA, on request, for their review.</P>
            <P>(4) The FAA may impose conditions on the recipient as part of its approval of the recipient's analysis and corrective actions including, but not limited to, modifications to your overall goal methodology, changes in your race-conscious/race-neutral split, or the introduction of additional race-neutral or race-conscious measures.</P>

            <P>(5) You may be regarded as being in noncompliance with this part, and <PRTPAGE P="178"/>therefore subject to the remedies in § 23.11 of this part and other applicable regulations, for failing to implement your ACDBE program in good faith if any of the following things occur:</P>
            <P>(i) You do not submit your analysis and corrective actions to FAA in a timely manner as required under paragraph (b)(3) of this section;</P>
            <P>(ii) FAA disapproves your analysis or corrective actions; or</P>
            <P>(iii) You do not fully implement:</P>
            <P>(A) The corrective actions to which you have committed, or</P>
            <P>(B) Conditions that FAA has imposed following review of your analysis and corrective actions.</P>
            <P>(c) If information coming to the attention of FAA demonstrates that current trends make it unlikely that you, as an airport, will achieve ACDBE awards and commitments that would be necessary to allow you to meet your overall goal at the end of the fiscal year, FAA may require you to make further good faith efforts, such as modifying your race-conscious/race-neutral split or introducing additional race-neutral or race-conscious measures for the remainder of the fiscal year.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What is the role of the statutory 10 percent goal in the ACDBE program?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The statute authorizing the ACDBE program provides that, except to the extent the Secretary determines otherwise, not less than 10 percent of concession businesses are to be ACDBEs.</P>
            <P>(b) This 10 percent goal is an aspirational goal at the national level, which the Department uses as a tool in evaluating and monitoring DBEs' opportunities to participate in airport concessions.</P>
            <P>(c) The national 10 percent aspirational goal does not authorize or require recipients to set overall or concession-specific goals at the 10 percent level, or any other particular level, or to take any special administrative steps if their goals are above or below 10 percent.</P>

            <P>(b) You may enter into a long-term, exclusive concession agreement only under the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(1) Special local circumstances exist that make it important to enter such agreement, and</P>
            <P>(2) The responsible FAA regional office approves your plan for meeting the standards of paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

            <P>(2) A copy of the draft and final leasing and subleasing or other agreements. This long-term, exclusive agreement must provide that:</P>
            <P>(i) A number of ACDBEs that reasonably reflects their availability in your market area, in the absence of discrimination, to do the types of work required will participate as concessionaires throughout the term of the agreement and account for at a percentage of the estimated annual gross receipts equivalent to a level set in accordance with §§ 23.47 through 23.49 of this part.</P>
            <P>(ii) You will review the extent of ACDBE participation before the exercise of each renewal option to consider whether an increase or decrease in ACDBE participation is warranted.</P>
            <P>(iii) An ACDBE concessionaire that is unable to perform successfully will be replaced by another ACDBE concessionaire, if the remaining term of the agreement makes this feasible. In the event that such action is not feasible, you will require the concessionaire to make good faith efforts during the remaining term of the agreement to encourage ACDBEs to compete for the purchases and/or leases of goods and services to be made by the concessionaire.</P>
            <P>(3) Assurances that any ACDBE participant will be in an acceptable form, such as a sublease, joint venture, or partnership.</P>

            <P>(b) You must clearly identify any State or local law, regulation, or policy pertaining to minority, women's, or disadvantaged business enterprise concerning airport concessions that adds to, goes beyond, or imposes more stringent requirements than the provisions of this part. FAA will determine whether such a law, regulation, or policy conflicts with this part, in which case the requirements of this part will govern.</P>
            <P>(c) If not deemed in conflict by the FAA, you must write and administer such a State or local law, policy, or regulation separately from the ACDBE program.</P>

            <P>2. Provide the name and contact information (phone, fax, e-mail) for the person FAA should contact with questions about the report.</P>

            <P>3a. Provide the annual reporting period to which the report pertains (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> October 2005-September 2006).</P>
            <P>3b. Provide the date on which the report is submitted to FAA.</P>
            <P>4. This block and blocks 5 and 6 concern <E T="03">non-car rental</E> goals and participation only. In this block, provide the overall non-car rental percentage goal and the race-conscious (RC) and race-neutral (RN) components of it. The RC and RN percentages should add up to the overall percentage goal.</P>

            <P>5. For purposes of this block and blocks 6, 8, and 9, the participation categories listed at the left of the block are the following: “Prime Concessions” are concessions who have a direct relationship with the airport (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a company who has a lease agreement directly with the airport to operate a concession). A “subconcession” is a firm that has a sublease or other agreement with a prime concessionaire, rather than with the airport itself, to operate a concession at the airport. A “management contract” is an agreement between the airport and a firm to manage a portion of the airport's facilities or operations (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> manage the parking facilities). “Goods/services” refers to those goods and services purchased by the airport itself or by concessionaires and management contractors from certified DBEs.</P>
            <P>Block 5 concerns <E T="03">all</E> non-car rental concession activity covered by 49 CFR part 23 during the reporting period, both new or continuing.</P>
            <P>In Column A, enter the total concession gross revenues for concessionaires (prime and sub) and purchases of goods and services (ACDBE and non-ACDBE combined) at the airport. In Column B, enter the number of lease agreements, contracts, etc. in effect or taking place during the reporting period in each participation category for all concessionaires and purchases of goods and services (ACDBE and non-ACDBE combined).</P>
            <P>Because, by statute, non-ACDBE management contracts do not count as part of the base for ACDBE goals, the cells for total management contract participation and ACDBE participation as a percentage of total management contracting dollars are not intended to be filled in blocks 5, 6, 8, and 9.</P>
            <P>In Column C, enter the total gross revenues in each participation category (ACDBEs) only. In Column D, enter the number of lease agreements, contracts, etc., in effect or entered into during the reporting period in each participation category for all concessionaires and purchases of goods and services (ACDBEs only).</P>
            <P>Columns E and F are subsets of Column C: break out the total gross revenues listed in Column C into the portions that are attributable to race-conscious and race-neutral measures, respectively. Column G is a percentage calculation. It answers the question, what percentage of the numbers in Column A is represented by the corresponding numbers in Column C?</P>
            <P>6. The numbers in this Block concern only <E T="03">new</E> non-car rental concession opportunities that arose during the current reporting period. In other words, the information requested in Block 6 is a subset of that requested in Block 5. Otherwise, this Block is filled out in the same way as Block 5.</P>
            <P>7. Blocks 7-9 concern car rental goals and participation. In Block 7, provide the overall car rental percentage goal and the race-conscious (RC) and race-neutral (RN) components of it. The RC and RN percentages should add up to the overall percentage goal.</P>
            <P>8. Block 8 is parallel to Block 5, except that it is for car rentals. The instructions for filling it out are the same as for Block 5.</P>

            <P>9. Block 9 is parallel to Block 6, except that it is for car rentals. The information requested in Block 9 is a subset of that requested in Block 8. The instructions for filling it out are the same as for Block 6.<PRTPAGE P="181"/>
            </P>
            <P>10. Block 10 instructs recipients to bring forward the cumulative ACDBE participation figures from Blocks 5 and 8, breaking down these figures by race and gender categories. Participation by non-minority women-owned firms should be listed in the “non-minority women” column. Participation by firms owned by minority women should be listed in the appropriate minority group column. The “other” column should be used to reflect participation by individuals who are not a member of a presumptively disadvantaged group who have been found disadvantaged on a case-by-case basis.</P>
            <P>11. This block instructs recipients to attach five information items for each ACDBE firm participating in its program during the reporting period. If the firm's participation numbers are reflected in Blocks 5-6 and/or 8-9, the requested information about that firm should be attached in response to this item.</P>

            <P>(i) Had average annual gross receipts of at least $5,000; or</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Assurances.</E> (1) Before a Federal Agency may approve any grant to, or contract, or agreement with, a State Agency under which Federal financial assistance will be made available for a project which results in real property acquisition or displacement that is subject to the Uniform Act, the State Agency must provide appropriate assurances that it will comply with the Uniform Act and this part. A displacing Agency's assurances shall be in accordance with section 210 of the Uniform Act. An acquiring Agency's assurances shall be in accordance with section 305 of the Uniform Act and must contain specific reference to any State law which the Agency believes provides an exception to §§ 301 or 302 of the Uniform Act. If, in the judgment of the Federal Agency, Uniform Act compliance will be served, a State Agency may provide these assurances at one time to cover all subsequent federally-assisted programs or projects. An Agency, which both acquires real property and displaces persons, may combine its section 210 and section 305 assurances in one document.</P>
            <P>(2) If a Federal Agency or State Agency provides Federal financial assistance to a “person” causing displacement, such Federal or State Agency is responsible for ensuring compliance with the requirements of this part, notwithstanding the person's contractual obligation to the grantee to comply.</P>
            <P>(3) As an alternative to the assurance requirement described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a Federal Agency may provide Federal financial assistance to a State Agency after it has accepted a certification by such State Agency in accordance with the requirements in subpart G of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Monitoring and corrective action.</E> The Federal Agency will monitor compliance with this part, and the State Agency shall take whatever corrective action is necessary to comply with the Uniform Act and this part. The Federal Agency may also apply sanctions in accordance with applicable program regulations. (Also see § 24.603, of this part).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Prevention of fraud, waste, and mismanagement.</E> The Agency shall take appropriate measures to carry out this part in a manner that minimizes fraud, waste, and mismanagement.</P>

In the unlikely event that agreement among the Agencies cannot be reached as to which Agency shall be the cognizant Federal Agency, then the Lead Agency shall designate one of such Agencies to assume the cognizant role. <PRTPAGE P="190"/>At a minimum, the agreement shall set forth the federally-assisted activities which are subject to its terms and cite any policies and procedures, in addition to this part, that are applicable to the activities under the agreement. Under the agreement, the cognizant Federal Agency shall assure that the project is in compliance with the provisions of the Uniform Act and this part. All federally-assisted activities under the agreement shall be deemed a project for the purposes of this part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Applicability of acquisition requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Direct Federal program or project.</E> (1) The requirements of this subpart apply to any acquisition of real property for a direct Federal program or project, except acquisition for a program or project that is undertaken by the Tennessee Valley Authority or the Rural Utilities Service. (<E T="03">See</E> appendix A, § 24.101(a).)</P>

            <P>(2) If a Federal Agency (except for the Tennessee Valley Authority or the Rural Utilities Service) will not acquire a property because negotiations fail to result in an agreement, the owner of the property shall be so informed in writing. Owners of such properties are not displaced persons, (<E T="03">see</E> §§ 24.2(a)(9)(ii)(E) or (H)), and as such, are not entitled to relocation assistance benefits. However, tenants on such properties may be eligible for relocation assistance benefits. (<E T="03">See</E> § 24.2(a)(9)).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Programs and projects receiving Federal financial assistance.</E> The requirements of this subpart apply to any acquisition of real property for programs and projects where there is Federal financial assistance in any part of project costs except for the acquisitions described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section. The relocation assistance provisions in this part are applicable to any tenants that must move as a result of an acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section. Such tenants are considered displaced persons. (<E T="03">See</E> § 24.2(a)(9).)</P>
            <P>(1) The requirements of Subpart B do not apply to acquisitions that meet all of the following conditions in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv):</P>

            <P>(i) No specific site or property needs to be acquired, although the Agency may limit its search for alternative sites to a general geographic area. Where an Agency wishes to purchase more than one site within a general geographic area on this basis, all owners are to be treated similarly. (<E T="03">See</E> appendix A, § 24.101(b)(1)(i).)<PRTPAGE P="192"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) The property to be acquired is not part of an intended, planned, or designated project area where all or substantially all of the property within the area is to be acquired within specific time limits.</P>
            <P>(iii) The Agency will not acquire the property if negotiations fail to result in an amicable agreement, and the owner is so informed in writing.</P>

            <P>(iv) The Agency will inform the owner in writing of what it believes to be the market value of the property. (<E T="03">See</E> appendix A, § 24.101(b)(1)(iv) and (2)(ii).)</P>
            <P>(2) Acquisitions for programs or projects undertaken by an Agency or person that receives Federal financial assistance but does not have authority to acquire property by eminent domain, provided that such Agency or person shall:</P>
            <P>(i) Prior to making an offer for the property, clearly advise the owner that it is unable to acquire the property if negotiations fail to result in an agreement; and</P>

            <P>(ii) Inform the owner in writing of what it believes to be the market value of the property. (<E T="03">See</E> appendix A, § 24.101(b)(1)(iv) and (2)(ii).)</P>
            <P>(3) The acquisition of real property from a Federal Agency, State, or State Agency, if the Agency desiring to make the purchase does not have authority to acquire the property through condemnation.</P>
            <P>(4) The acquisition of real property by a cooperative from a person who, as a condition of membership in the cooperative, has agreed to provide without charge any real property that is needed by the cooperative.</P>
            <P>(5) Acquisition for a program or project that receives Federal financial assistance from the Tennessee Valley Authority or the Rural Utilities Service.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Less-than-full-fee interest in real property.</E> (1) The provisions of this subpart apply when acquiring fee title subject to retention of a life estate or a life use; to acquisition by leasing where the lease term, including option(s) for extension, is 50 years or more; and to the acquisition of permanent and/or temporary easements necessary for the project. However, the Agency may apply these regulations to any less-than-full-fee acquisition that, in its judgment, should be covered.</P>
            <P>(2) The provisions of this subpart do not apply to temporary easements or permits needed solely to perform work intended exclusively for the benefit of the property owner, which work may not be done if agreement cannot be reached.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Federally-assisted projects.</E> For projects receiving Federal financial assistance, the provisions of §§ 24.102, 24.103, 24.104, and 24.105 apply to the greatest extent practicable under State law. (<E T="03">See</E> § 24.4(a).)</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 24.102</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Basic acquisition policies.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Expeditious acquisition.</E> The Agency shall make every reasonable effort to acquire the real property expeditiously by negotiation.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice to owner.</E> As soon as feasible, the Agency shall notify the owner in writing of the Agency's interest in acquiring the real property and the basic protections provided to the owner by law and this part. (<E T="03">See</E> § 24.203.)</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Appraisal, waiver thereof, and invitation to owner.</E> (1) Before the initiation of negotiations the real property to be acquired shall be appraised, except as provided in § 24.102 (c)(2), and the owner, or the owner's designated representative, shall be given an opportunity to accompany the appraiser during the appraiser's inspection of the property.</P>
            <P>(2) An appraisal is not required if:</P>
            <P>(i) The owner is donating the property and releases the Agency from its obligation to appraise the property; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The Agency determines that an appraisal is unnecessary because the valuation problem is uncomplicated and the anticipated value of the proposed acquisition is estimated at $10,000 or less, based on a review of available data.</P>
            <P>(A) When an appraisal is determined to be unnecessary, the Agency shall prepare a waiver valuation.</P>
            <P>(B) The person performing the waiver valuation must have sufficient understanding of the local real estate market to be qualified to make the waiver valuation.</P>

            <P>(C) The Federal Agency funding the project may approve exceeding the <PRTPAGE P="193"/>$10,000 threshold, up to a maximum of $25,000, if the Agency acquiring the real property offers the property owner the option of having the Agency appraise the property. If the property owner elects to have the Agency appraise the property, the Agency shall obtain an appraisal and not use procedures described in this paragraph. (See appendix A, § 24.102(c)(2).)</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Establishment and offer of just compensation.</E> Before the initiation of negotiations, the Agency shall establish an amount which it believes is just compensation for the real property. The amount shall not be less than the approved appraisal of the fair market value of the property, taking into account the value of allowable damages or benefits to any remaining property. An Agency official must establish the amount believed to be just compensation. (<E T="03">See</E> § 24.104.) Promptly thereafter, the Agency shall make a written offer to the owner to acquire the property for the full amount believed to be just compensation. (<E T="03">See</E> appendix A, § 24.102(d).)</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Summary statement.</E> Along with the initial written purchase offer, the owner shall be given a written statement of the basis for the offer of just compensation, which shall include:</P>
            <P>(1) A statement of the amount offered as just compensation. In the case of a partial acquisition, the compensation for the real property to be acquired and the compensation for damages, if any, to the remaining real property shall be separately stated.</P>
            <P>(2) A description and location identification of the real property and the interest in the real property to be acquired.</P>

            <P>(3) An identification of the buildings, structures, and other improvements (including removable building equipment and trade fixtures) which are included as part of the offer of just compensation. Where appropriate, the statement shall identify any other separately held ownership interest in the property, <E T="03">e.g.</E>, a tenant-owned improvement, and indicate that such interest is not covered by this offer.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Basic negotiation procedures.</E> The Agency shall make all reasonable efforts to contact the owner or the owner's representative and discuss its offer to purchase the property, including the basis for the offer of just compensation and explain its acquisition policies and procedures, including its payment of incidental expenses in accordance with § 24.106. The owner shall be given reasonable opportunity to consider the offer and present material which the owner believes is relevant to determining the value of the property and to suggest modification in the proposed terms and conditions of the purchase. The Agency shall consider the owner's presentation. (<E T="03">See</E> appendix A, § 24.102(f).)</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Updating offer of just compensation.</E> If the information presented by the owner, or a material change in the character or condition of the property, indicates the need for new appraisal information, or if a significant delay has occurred since the time of the appraisal(s) of the property, the Agency shall have the appraisal(s) updated or obtain a new appraisal(s). If the latest appraisal information indicates that a change in the purchase offer is warranted, the Agency shall promptly reestablish just compensation and offer that amount to the owner in writing.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Coercive action.</E> The Agency shall not advance the time of condemnation, or defer negotiations or condemnation or the deposit of funds with the court, or take any other coercive action in order to induce an agreement on the price to be paid for the property.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Administrative settlement.</E> The purchase price for the property may exceed the amount offered as just compensation when reasonable efforts to negotiate an agreement at that amount have failed and an authorized Agency official approves such administrative settlement as being reasonable, prudent, and in the public interest. When Federal funds pay for or participate in acquisition costs, a written justification shall be prepared, which states what available information, including trial risks, supports such a settlement. (<E T="03">See</E> appendix A, § 24.102(i).)</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Payment before taking possession.</E> Before requiring the owner to surrender possession of the real property, the Agency shall pay the agreed purchase price to the owner, or in the case of a condemnation, deposit with the court, for the benefit of the owner, an <PRTPAGE P="194"/>amount not less than the Agency's approved appraisal of the fair market value of such property, or the court award of compensation in the condemnation proceeding for the property. In exceptional circumstances, with the prior approval of the owner, the Agency may obtain a right-of-entry for construction purposes before making payment available to an owner. (<E T="03">See</E> appendix A, § 24.102(j).)</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Uneconomic remnant.</E> If the acquisition of only a portion of a property would leave the owner with an uneconomic remnant, the Agency shall offer to acquire the uneconomic remnant along with the portion of the property needed for the project. (<E T="03">See</E> § 24.2(a)(27).)</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Inverse condemnation.</E> If the Agency intends to acquire any interest in real property by exercise of the power of eminent domain, it shall institute formal condemnation proceedings and not intentionally make it necessary for the owner to institute legal proceedings to prove the fact of the taking of the real property.</P>
            <P>(m) <E T="03">Fair rental.</E> If the Agency permits a former owner or tenant to occupy the real property after acquisition for a short term, or a period subject to termination by the Agency on short notice, the rent shall not exceed the fair market rent for such occupancy. (<E T="03">See</E> appendix A, § 24.102(m).)</P>
            <P>(n) <E T="03">Conflict of interest.</E> (1) The appraiser, review appraiser or person performing the waiver valuation shall not have any interest, direct or indirect, in the real property being valued for the Agency.</P>
            <P>Compensation for making an appraisal or waiver valuation shall not be based on the amount of the valuation estimate.</P>
            <P>(2) No person shall attempt to unduly influence or coerce an appraiser, review appraiser, or waiver valuation preparer regarding any valuation or other aspect of an appraisal, review or waiver valuation. Persons functioning as negotiators may not supervise or formally evaluate the performance of any appraiser or review appraiser performing appraisal or appraisal review work, except that, for a program or project receiving Federal financial assistance, the Federal funding Agency may waive this requirement if it determines it would create a hardship for the Agency.</P>

            <P>(3) An appraiser, review appraiser, or waiver valuation preparer making an appraisal, appraisal review or waiver valuation may be authorized by the Agency to act as a negotiator for real property for which that person has made an appraisal, appraisal review or waiver valuation only if the offer to acquire the property is $10,000, or less.

                <SU>2</SU> The “Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions” is published by the Interagency Land Acquisition Conference. It is a compendium of Federal eminent domain appraisal law, both case and statute, regulations and practices. It is available at <E T="03">http://www.usdoj.gov/enrd/land-ack/toc.htm</E> or in soft cover format from the Appraisal Institute at <E T="03">http://www.appraisalinstitute.org/econom/publications/Default.asp</E> and select “Legal/Regulatory” or call 888-570-4545.</P>
            </FTNT>

            <P>(1) The Agency acquiring real property has a legitimate role in contributing to the appraisal process, especially in developing the scope of work and defining the appraisal problem. The scope of work and development of an appraisal under these requirements depends on the complexity of the appraisal problem.<PRTPAGE P="195"/>
            </P>

            <P>(2) The Agency has the responsibility to assure that the appraisals it obtains are relevant to its program needs, reflect established and commonly accepted Federal and federally-assisted program appraisal practice, and as a minimum, complies with the definition of appraisal in § 24.2(a)(3) and the five following requirements: (<E T="03">See</E> appendix A, §§ 24.103 and 24.103(a).)</P>

            <P>(i) An adequate description of the physical characteristics of the property being appraised (and, in the case of a partial acquisition, an adequate description of the remaining property), including items identified as personal property, a statement of the known and observed encumbrances, if any, title information, location, zoning, present use, an analysis of highest and best use, and at least a 5-year sales history of the property. (<E T="03">See</E> appendix A, § 24.103(a)(1).)</P>

            <P>(ii) All relevant and reliable approaches to value consistent with established Federal and federally-assisted program appraisal practices. If the appraiser uses more than one approach, there shall be an analysis and reconciliation of approaches to value used that is sufficient to support the appraiser's opinion of value. (<E T="03">See</E> appendix A, § 24.103(a).)</P>
            <P>(iii) A description of comparable sales, including a description of all relevant physical, legal, and economic factors such as parties to the transaction, source and method of financing, and verification by a party involved in the transaction.</P>
            <P>(iv) A statement of the value of the real property to be acquired and, for a partial acquisition, a statement of the value of the damages and benefits, if any, to the remaining real property, where appropriate.</P>
            <P>(v) The effective date of valuation, date of appraisal, signature, and certification of the appraiser.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Influence of the project on just compensation.</E> The appraiser shall disregard any decrease or increase in the fair market value of the real property caused by the project for which the property is to be acquired, or by the likelihood that the property would be acquired for the project, other than that due to physical deterioration within the reasonable control of the owner. (<E T="03">See</E> appendix A, § 24.103(b).)</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Owner retention of improvements.</E> If the owner of a real property improvement is permitted to retain it for removal from the project site, the amount to be offered for the interest in the real property to be acquired shall be not less than the difference between the amount determined to be just compensation for the owner's entire interest in the real property and the salvage value (defined at § 24.2(a)(24)) of the retained improvement.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Qualifications of appraisers and review appraisers.</E> (1) The Agency shall establish criteria for determining the minimum qualifications and competency of appraisers and review appraisers. Qualifications shall be consistent with the scope of work for the assignment. The Agency shall review the experience, education, training, certification/licensing, designation(s) and other qualifications of appraisers, and review appraisers, and use only those determined by the Agency to be qualified. (<E T="03">See</E> appendix A, § 24.103(d)(1).)</P>

            <P>(2) If the Agency uses a contract (fee) appraiser to perform the appraisal, such appraiser shall be State licensed or certified in accordance with title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) (12 U.S.C. 3331 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Review of appraisals.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The Agency shall have an appraisal review process and, at a minimum:</P>
            <P>(a) A qualified review appraiser (<E T="03">see</E> § 24.103(d)(1) and appendix A, § 24.104) shall examine the presentation and analysis of market information in all appraisals to assure that they meet the definition of appraisal found in 49 CFR 24.2(a)(3), appraisal requirements found in 49 CFR 24.103 and other applicable requirements, including, to the extent appropriate, the UASFLA, and support the appraiser's opinion of value. The level of review analysis depends on the complexity of the appraisal problem. As needed, the review appraiser shall, prior to acceptance, seek necessary <PRTPAGE P="196"/>corrections or revisions. The review appraiser shall identify each appraisal report as recommended (as the basis for the establishment of the amount believed to be just compensation), accepted (meets all requirements, but not selected as recommended or approved), or not accepted. If authorized by the Agency to do so, the staff review appraiser shall also approve the appraisal (as the basis for the establishment of the amount believed to be just compensation), and, if also authorized to do so, develop and report the amount believed to be just compensation. (<E T="03">See</E> appendix A, § 24.104(a).)</P>

            <P>(b) If the review appraiser is unable to recommend (or approve) an appraisal as an adequate basis for the establishment of the offer of just compensation, and it is determined by the acquiring Agency that it is not practical to obtain an additional appraisal, the review appraiser may, as part of the review, present and analyze market information in conformance with § 24.103 to support a recommended (or approved) value. (<E T="03">See</E> appendix A, § 24.104(b).)</P>

            <P>(c) The review appraiser shall prepare a written report that identifies the appraisal reports reviewed and documents the findings and conclusions arrived at during the review of the appraisal(s). Any damages or benefits to any remaining property shall be identified in the review appraiser's report. The review appraiser shall also prepare a signed certification that states the parameters of the review. The certification shall state the approved value, and, if the review appraiser is authorized to do so, the amount believed to be just compensation for the acquisition.

            <SUBJECT>Acquisition of tenant-owned improvements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Acquisition of improvements.</E> When acquiring any interest in real property, the Agency shall offer to acquire at least an equal interest in all buildings, structures, or other improvements located upon the real property to be acquired, which it requires to be removed or which it determines will be adversely affected by the use to which such real property will be put. This shall include any improvement of a tenant-owner who has the right or obligation to remove the improvement at the expiration of the lease term.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Improvements considered to be real property.</E> Any building, structure, or other improvement, which would be considered to be real property if owned by the owner of the real property on which it is located, shall be considered to be real property for purposes of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Appraisal and Establishment of Just Compensation for a Tenant-Owned Improvement.</E> Just compensation for a tenant-owned improvement is the amount which the improvement contributes to the fair market value of the whole property, or its salvage value, whichever is greater. (Salvage value is defined at § 24.2(a)(23).)</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Special conditions for tenant-owned improvements.</E> No payment shall be made to a tenant-owner for any real property improvement unless:</P>
            <P>(1) The tenant-owner, in consideration for the payment, assigns, transfers, and releases to the Agency all of the tenant-owner's right, title, and interest in the improvement;</P>
            <P>(2) The owner of the real property on which the improvement is located disclaims all interest in the improvement; and</P>
            <P>(3) The payment does not result in the duplication of any compensation otherwise authorized by law.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Alternative compensation.</E> Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to deprive the tenant-owner of any right to reject payment under this subpart and to obtain payment for such property interests in accordance with other applicable law.</P>

            <P>(b) Whenever feasible, the Agency shall pay these costs directly to the billing agent so that the owner will not have to pay such costs and then seek reimbursement from the Agency.</P>

            <P>These requirements apply to the relocation of any displaced person as defined at § 24.2(a)(9). Any person who qualifies as a displaced person must be fully informed of his or her rights and entitlements to relocation assistance and payments provided by the Uniform Act and this regulation.

            <SUBJECT>Relocation notices.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General information notice.</E> As soon as feasible, a person scheduled to be displaced shall be furnished with a general written description of the displacing Agency's relocation program which does at least the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Informs the person that he or she may be displaced for the project and generally describes the relocation payment(s) for which the person may be eligible, the basic conditions of eligibility, and the procedures for obtaining the payment(s);</P>
            <P>(2) Informs the displaced person that he or she will be given reasonable relocation advisory services, including referrals to replacement properties, help in filing payment claims, and other necessary assistance to help the displaced person successfully relocate;</P>
            <P>(3) Informs the displaced person that he or she will not be required to move without at least 90 days advance written notice (see paragraph (c) of this section), and informs any person to be displaced from a dwelling that he or she cannot be required to move permanently unless at least one comparable replacement dwelling has been made available;</P>
            <P>(4) Informs the displaced person that any person who is an alien not lawfully present in the United States is ineligible for relocation advisory services and relocation payments, unless such ineligibility would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying spouse, parent, or child, as defined in § 24.208(h); and</P>

            <P>(5) Describes the displaced person's right to appeal the Agency's determination as to a person's application for assistance for which a person may be eligible under this part.<PRTPAGE P="198"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of relocation eligibility.</E> Eligibility for relocation assistance shall begin on the date of a notice of intent to acquire (described in § 24.203(d)), the initiation of negotiations (defined in § 24.2(a)(15)), or actual acquisition, whichever occurs first. When this occurs, the Agency shall promptly notify all occupants in writing of their eligibility for applicable relocation assistance.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Ninety-day notice</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> No lawful occupant shall be required to move unless he or she has received at least 90 days advance written notice of the earliest date by which he or she may be required to move.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Timing of notice.</E> The displacing Agency may issue the notice 90 days or earlier before it expects the person to be displaced.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Content of notice.</E> The 90-day notice shall either state a specific date as the earliest date by which the occupant may be required to move, or state that the occupant will receive a further notice indicating, at least 30 days in advance, the specific date by which he or she must move. If the 90-day notice is issued before a comparable replacement dwelling is made available, the notice must state clearly that the occupant will not have to move earlier than 90 days after such a dwelling is made available. (<E T="03">See</E> § 24.204(a).)</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Urgent need.</E> In unusual circumstances, an occupant may be required to vacate the property on less than 90 days advance written notice if the displacing Agency determines that a 90-day notice is impracticable, such as when the person's continued occupancy of the property would constitute a substantial danger to health or safety. A copy of the Agency's determination shall be included in the applicable case file.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice of intent to acquire.</E> A notice of intent to acquire is a displacing Agency's written communication that is provided to a person to be displaced, including those to be displaced by rehabilitation or demolition activities from property acquired prior to the commitment of Federal financial assistance to the activity, which clearly sets forth that the Agency intends to acquire the property. A notice of intent to acquire establishes eligibility for relocation assistance prior to the initiation of negotiations and/or prior to the commitment of Federal financial assistance.

            <SUBJECT>Availability of comparable replacement dwelling before displacement.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> No person to be displaced shall be required to move from his or her dwelling unless at least one comparable replacement dwelling (defined at § 24.2 (a)(6)) has been made available to the person. When possible, three or more comparable replacement dwellings shall be made available. A comparable replacement dwelling will be considered to have been made available to a person, if:</P>
            <P>(1) The person is informed of its location;</P>
            <P>(2) The person has sufficient time to negotiate and enter into a purchase agreement or lease for the property; and</P>
            <P>(3) Subject to reasonable safeguards, the person is assured of receiving the relocation assistance and acquisition payment to which the person is entitled in sufficient time to complete the purchase or lease of the property.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Circumstances permitting waiver.</E> The Federal Agency funding the project may grant a waiver of the policy in paragraph (a) of this section in any case where it is demonstrated that a person must move because of:</P>
            <P>(1) A major disaster as defined in section 102 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5122);</P>
            <P>(2) A presidentially declared national emergency; or</P>
            <P>(3) Another emergency which requires immediate vacation of the real property, such as when continued occupancy of the displacement dwelling constitutes a substantial danger to the health or safety of the occupants or the public.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Basic conditions of emergency move.</E> Whenever a person to be displaced is required to relocate from the displacement dwelling for a temporary period because of an emergency as described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Agency shall:<PRTPAGE P="199"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) Take whatever steps are necessary to assure that the person is temporarily relocated to a decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling;</P>
            <P>(2) Pay the actual reasonable out-of-pocket moving expenses and any reasonable increase in rent and utility costs incurred in connection with the temporary relocation; and</P>
            <P>(3) Make available to the displaced person as soon as feasible, at least one comparable replacement dwelling. (For purposes of filing a claim and meeting the eligibility requirements for a relocation payment, the date of displacement is the date the person moves from the temporarily occupied dwelling.)</P>

            <SUBJECT>Relocation planning, advisory services, and coordination.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Relocation planning.</E> During the early stages of development, an Agency shall plan Federal and federally-assisted programs or projects in such a manner that recognizes the problems associated with the displacement of individuals, families, businesses, farms, and nonprofit organizations and develop solutions to minimize the adverse impacts of displacement. Such planning, where appropriate, shall precede any action by an Agency which will cause displacement, and should be scoped to the complexity and nature of the anticipated displacing activity including an evaluation of program resources available to carry out timely and orderly relocations. Planning may involve a relocation survey or study, which may include the following:</P>
            <P>(1) An estimate of the number of households to be displaced including information such as owner/tenant status, estimated value and rental rates of properties to be acquired, family characteristics, and special consideration of the impacts on minorities, the elderly, large families, and persons with disabilities when applicable.</P>
            <P>(2) An estimate of the number of comparable replacement dwellings in the area (including price ranges and rental rates) that are expected to be available to fulfill the needs of those households displaced. When an adequate supply of comparable housing is not expected to be available, the Agency should consider housing of last resort actions.</P>
            <P>(3) An estimate of the number, type and size of the businesses, farms, and nonprofit organizations to be displaced and the approximate number of employees that may be affected.</P>
            <P>(4) An estimate of the availability of replacement business sites. When an adequate supply of replacement business sites is not expected to be available, the impacts of displacing the businesses should be considered and addressed. Planning for displaced businesses which are reasonably expected to involve complex or lengthy moving processes or small businesses with limited financial resources and/or few alternative relocation sites should include an analysis of business moving problems.</P>
            <P>(5) Consideration of any special relocation advisory services that may be necessary from the displacing Agency and other cooperating Agencies.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Loans for planning and preliminary expenses.</E> In the event that an Agency elects to consider using the duplicative provision in section 215 of the Uniform Act which permits the use of project funds for loans to cover planning and other preliminary expenses for the development of additional housing, the Lead Agency will establish criteria and procedures for such use upon the request of the Federal Agency funding the program or project.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Relocation assistance advisory services</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The Agency shall carry out a relocation assistance advisory program which satisfies the requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d <E T="03">et seq.</E>), Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3601 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), and Executive Order 11063 (27 FR 11527, November 24, 1962), and offer the services described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. If the Agency determines that a person occupying property adjacent to the real property acquired for the project is caused substantial economic injury because of such acquisition, it may offer advisory services to such person.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Services to be provided.</E> The advisory program shall include such measures, facilities, and services as may be necessary or appropriate in order to:<PRTPAGE P="200"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) Determine, for nonresidential (businesses, farm and nonprofit organizations) displacements, the relocation needs and preferences of each business (farm and nonprofit organization) to be displaced and explain the relocation payments and other assistance for which the business may be eligible, the related eligibility requirements, and the procedures for obtaining such assistance. This shall include a personal interview with each business. At a minimum, interviews with displaced business owners and operators should include the following items:</P>
            <P>(A) The business's replacement site requirements, current lease terms and other contractual obligations and the financial capacity of the business to accomplish the move.</P>
            <P>(B) Determination of the need for outside specialists in accordance with § 24.301(g)(12) that will be required to assist in planning the move, assistance in the actual move, and in the reinstallation of machinery and/or other personal property.</P>
            <P>(C) For businesses, an identification and resolution of personalty/realty issues. Every effort must be made to identify and resolve realty/personalty issues prior to, or at the time of, the appraisal of the property.</P>
            <P>(D) An estimate of the time required for the business to vacate the site.</P>
            <P>(E) An estimate of the anticipated difficulty in locating a replacement property.</P>
            <P>(F) An identification of any advance relocation payments required for the move, and the Agency's legal capacity to provide them.</P>
            <P>(ii) Determine, for residential displacements, the relocation needs and preferences of each person to be displaced and explain the relocation payments and other assistance for which the person may be eligible, the related eligibility requirements, and the procedures for obtaining such assistance. This shall include a personal interview with each residential displaced person.</P>
            <P>(A) Provide current and continuing information on the availability, purchase prices, and rental costs of comparable replacement dwellings, and explain that the person cannot be required to move unless at least one comparable replacement dwelling is made available as set forth in § 24.204(a).</P>

            <P>(B) As soon as feasible, the Agency shall inform the person in writing of the specific comparable replacement dwelling and the price or rent used for establishing the upper limit of the replacement housing payment (<E T="03">see</E> § 24.403 (a) and (b)) and the basis for the determination, so that the person is aware of the maximum replacement housing payment for which he or she may qualify.</P>

            <P>(C) Where feasible, housing shall be inspected prior to being made available to assure that it meets applicable standards. (<E T="03">See</E> § 24.2(a)(8).) If such an inspection is not made, the Agency shall notify the person to be displaced that a replacement housing payment may not be made unless the replacement dwelling is subsequently inspected and determined to be decent, safe, and sanitary.</P>

            <P>(D) Whenever possible, minority persons shall be given reasonable opportunities to relocate to decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings, not located in an area of minority concentration, that are within their financial means. This policy, however, does not require an Agency to provide a person a larger payment than is necessary to enable a person to relocate to a comparable replacement dwelling.

A displaced person must be provided reasonable assistance necessary to complete and file any required claim for payment.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Expeditious payments.</E> The Agency shall review claims in an expeditious manner.

            <SUBJECT>Aliens not lawfully present in the United States.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Each person seeking relocation payments or relocation advisory assistance shall, as a condition of eligibility, certify:</P>
            <P>(1) In the case of an individual, that he or she is either a citizen or national of the United States, or an alien who is lawfully present in the United States.</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of a family, that each family member is either a citizen or national of the United States, or an alien who is lawfully present in the United States. The certification may be made by the head of the household on behalf of other family members.</P>
            <P>(3) In the case of an unincorporated business, farm, or nonprofit organization, that each owner is either a citizen or national of the United States, or an alien who is lawfully present in the United States. The certification may be made by the principal owner, manager, or operating officer on behalf of other persons with an ownership interest.</P>
            <P>(4) In the case of an incorporated business, farm, or nonprofit organization, that the corporation is authorized to conduct business within the United States.</P>
            <P>(b) The certification provided pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of this section shall indicate whether such person is either a citizen or national of the United States, or an alien who is lawfully present in the United States. Requirements concerning the certification in addition to those contained in this rule shall be within the discretion of the Federal funding Agency and, within those parameters, that of the displacing Agency.</P>
            <P>(c) In computing relocation payments under the Uniform Act, if any member(s) of a household or owner(s) of an unincorporated business, farm, or nonprofit organization is (are) determined to be ineligible because of a failure to be legally present in the United States, no relocation payments may be made to him or her. Any payment(s) for which such household, unincorporated business, farm, or nonprofit organization would otherwise be eligible shall be computed for the household, based on the number of eligible household members and for the unincorporated business, farm, or nonprofit organization, based on the ratio of ownership between eligible and ineligible owners.</P>
            <P>(d) The displacing Agency shall consider the certification provided pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to be valid, unless the displacing Agency determines in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section that it is invalid based on a review of an alien's documentation or other information that the Agency considers reliable and appropriate.</P>
            <P>(e) Any review by the displacing Agency of the certifications provided pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be conducted in a nondiscriminatory fashion. Each displacing Agency will apply the same standard of review to all such certifications it receives, except that such standard may be revised periodically.</P>
            <P>(f) If, based on a review of an alien's documentation or other credible evidence, a displacing Agency has reason to believe that a person's certification is invalid (for example a document reviewed does not on its face reasonably appear to be genuine), and that, as a result, such person may be an alien not lawfully present in the United States, it shall obtain the following information before making a final determination:</P>

            <P>(1) If the Agency has reason to believe that the certification of a person who has certified that he or she is an alien lawfully present in the United States is invalid, the displacing Agency shall obtain verification of the alien's <PRTPAGE P="203"/>status from the local Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Service (BCIS) Office. A list of local BCIS offices is available at <E T="03">http://www.uscis.gov/graphics/fieldoffices/alphaa.htm.</E> Any request for BCIS verification shall include the alien's full name, date of birth and alien number, and a copy of the alien's documentation. (If an Agency is unable to contact the BCIS, it may contact the FHWA in Washington, DC, Office of Real Estate Services or Office of Chief Counsel for a referral to the BCIS.)</P>
            <P>(2) If the Agency has reason to believe that the certification of a person who has certified that he or she is a citizen or national is invalid, the displacing Agency shall request evidence of United States citizenship or nationality from such person and, if considered necessary, verify the accuracy of such evidence with the issuer.</P>
            <P>(g) No relocation payments or relocation advisory assistance shall be provided to a person who has not provided the certification described in this section or who has been determined to be not lawfully present in the United States, unless such person can demonstrate to the displacing Agency's satisfaction that the denial of relocation assistance will result in an exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to such person's spouse, parent, or child who is a citizen of the United States, or is an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States.</P>
            <P>(h) For purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” to such spouse, parent, or child of the person not lawfully present in the United States means that the denial of relocation payments and advisory assistance to such person will directly result in:</P>
            <P>(1) A significant and demonstrable adverse impact on the health or safety of such spouse, parent, or child;</P>
            <P>(2) A significant and demonstrable adverse impact on the continued existence of the family unit of which such spouse, parent, or child is a member; or</P>
            <P>(3) Any other impact that the displacing Agency determines will have a significant and demonstrable adverse impact on such spouse, parent, or child.</P>
            <P>(i) The certification referred to in paragraph (a) of this section may be included as part of the claim for relocation payments described in § 24.207 of this part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Fixed payment for moving expenses—nonresidential moves.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Business.</E> A displaced business may be eligible to choose a fixed payment in lieu of the payments for actual moving and related expenses, and actual reasonable reestablishment expenses provided by §§ 24.301, 24.303 and 24.304. Such fixed payment, except for payment to a nonprofit organization, shall equal the average annual net earnings of the business, as computed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, but not less than $1,000 nor more than $20,000. The displaced business is eligible for the payment if the Agency determines that:</P>
            <P>(1) The business owns or rents personal property which must be moved in connection with such displacement and for which an expense would be incurred in such move and, the business vacates or relocates from its displacement site;</P>
            <P>(2) The business cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of its existing patronage (clientele or net earnings). A business is assumed to meet this test unless the Agency determines that it will not suffer a substantial loss of its existing patronage;</P>
            <P>(3) The business is not part of a commercial enterprise having more than three other entities which are not being acquired by the Agency, and which are under the same ownership and engaged in the same or similar business activities.</P>
            <P>(4) The business is not operated at a displacement dwelling solely for the purpose of renting such dwelling to others;</P>
            <P>(5) The business is not operated at the displacement site solely for the purpose of renting the site to others; and</P>
            <P>(6) The business contributed materially to the income of the displaced person during the 2 taxable years prior to displacement. (See § 24.2(a)(7).)</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Determining the number of businesses.</E> In determining whether two or more displaced legal entities constitute a single business, which is entitled to only one fixed payment, all pertinent factors shall be considered, including the extent to which:</P>
            <P>(1) The same premises and equipment are shared;</P>
            <P>(2) Substantially identical or interrelated business functions are carried out and business and financial affairs are commingled;</P>
            <P>(3) The entities are held out to the public, and to those customarily dealing with them, as one business; and</P>
            <P>(4) The same person or closely related persons own, control, or manage the affairs of the entities.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Farm operation.</E> A displaced farm operation (defined at § 24.2(a)(12)) may choose a fixed payment, in lieu of the payments for actual moving and related expenses and actual reasonable reestablishment expenses, in an amount equal to its average annual net earnings as computed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, but not less than $1,000 nor more than $20,000. In the case of a partial acquisition of land, which was a farm operation before the acquisition, the fixed payment shall be made only if the Agency determines that:</P>
            <P>(1) The acquisition of part of the land caused the operator to be displaced from the farm operation on the remaining land; or</P>
            <P>(2) The partial acquisition caused a substantial change in the nature of the farm operation.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Nonprofit organization.</E> A displaced nonprofit organization may choose a fixed payment of $1,000 to $20,000, in lieu of the payments for actual moving and related expenses and actual reasonable reestablishment expenses, if the Agency determines that it cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of existing patronage (membership or clientele). A nonprofit organization is assumed to meet this test, unless the Agency demonstrates otherwise. Any payment in excess of $1,000 must be supported with financial statements <PRTPAGE P="209"/>for the two 12-month periods prior to the acquisition. The amount to be used for the payment is the average of 2 years annual gross revenues less administrative expenses. (See appendix A, § 24.305(d).)</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Average annual net earnings of a business or farm operation.</E> The average annual net earnings of a business or farm operation are one-half of its net earnings before Federal, State, and local income taxes during the 2 taxable years immediately prior to the taxable year in which it was displaced. If the business or farm was not in operation for the full 2 taxable years prior to displacement, net earnings shall be based on the actual period of operation at the displacement site during the 2 taxable years prior to displacement, projected to an annual rate. Average annual net earnings may be based upon a different period of time when the Agency determines it to be more equitable. Net earnings include any compensation obtained from the business or farm operation by its owner, the owner's spouse, and dependents. The displaced person shall furnish the Agency proof of net earnings through income tax returns, certified financial statements, or other reasonable evidence, which the Agency determines is satisfactory.

            <SUBJECT>Discretionary utility relocation payments.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Whenever a program or project undertaken by a displacing Agency causes the relocation of a utility facility (see § 24.2(a)(31)) and the relocation of the facility creates extraordinary expenses for its owner, the displacing Agency may, at its option, make a relocation payment to the owner for all or part of such expenses, if the following criteria are met:</P>
            <P>(1) The utility facility legally occupies State or local government property, or property over which the State or local government has an easement or right-of-way;</P>
            <P>(2) The utility facility's right of occupancy thereon is pursuant to State law or local ordinance specifically authorizing such use, or where such use and occupancy has been granted through a franchise, use and occupancy permit, or other similar agreement;</P>
            <P>(3) Relocation of the utility facility is required by and is incidental to the primary purpose of the project or program undertaken by the displacing Agency;</P>
            <P>(4) There is no Federal law, other than the Uniform Act, which clearly establishes a policy for the payment of utility moving costs that is applicable to the displacing Agency's program or project; and</P>
            <P>(5) State or local government reimbursement for utility moving costs or payment of such costs by the displacing Agency is in accordance with State law.</P>
            <P>(b) For the purposes of this section, the term extraordinary expenses means those expenses which, in the opinion of the displacing Agency, are not routine or predictable expenses relating to the utility's occupancy of rights-of-way, and are not ordinarily budgeted as operating expenses, unless the owner of the utility facility has explicitly and knowingly agreed to bear such expenses as a condition for use of the property, or has voluntarily agreed to be responsible for such expenses.</P>

            <P>(c) A relocation payment to a utility facility owner for moving costs under this section may not exceed the cost to functionally restore the service disrupted by the federally-assisted program or project, less any increase in value of the new facility and salvage value of the old facility. The displacing Agency and the utility facility owner shall reach prior agreement on the nature of the utility relocation work to be accomplished, the eligibility of the work for reimbursement, the responsibilities for financing and accomplishing the work, and the method of accumulating costs and making payment.

            <SUBJECT>Replacement housing payment for 180-day homeowner-occupants.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligibility.</E> A displaced person is eligible for the replacement housing payment for a 180-day homeowner-occupant if the person:</P>

            <P>(1) Has actually owned and occupied the displacement dwelling for not less <PRTPAGE P="210"/>than 180 days immediately prior to the initiation of negotiations; and</P>
            <P>(2) Purchases and occupies a decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling within one year after the later of the following dates (except that the Agency may extend such one year period for good cause):</P>
            <P>(i) The date the displaced person receives final payment for the displacement dwelling or, in the case of condemnation, the date the full amount of the estimate of just compensation is deposited in the court; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The date the displacing Agency's obligation under § 24.204 is met.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Amount of payment.</E> The replacement housing payment for an eligible 180-day homeowner-occupant may not exceed $22,500. (See also § 24.404.) The payment under this subpart is limited to the amount necessary to relocate to a comparable replacement dwelling within one year from the date the displaced homeowner-occupant is paid for the displacement dwelling, or the date a comparable replacement dwelling is made available to such person, whichever is later. The payment shall be the sum of:</P>
            <P>(1) The amount by which the cost of a replacement dwelling exceeds the acquisition cost of the displacement dwelling, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section;</P>
            <P>(2) The increased interest costs and other debt service costs which are incurred in connection with the mortgage(s) on the replacement dwelling, as determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(3) The reasonable expenses incidental to the purchase of the replacement dwelling, as determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Price differential</E>—(1) <E T="03">Basic computation.</E> The price differential to be paid under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is the amount which must be added to the acquisition cost of the displacement dwelling and site (<E T="03">see</E> § 24.2(a)(11)) to provide a total amount equal to the lesser of:</P>
            <P>(i) The reasonable cost of a comparable replacement dwelling as determined in accordance with § 24.403(a); or</P>
            <P>(ii) The purchase price of the decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling actually purchased and occupied by the displaced person.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Owner retention of displacement dwelling.</E> If the owner retains ownership of his or her dwelling, moves it from the displacement site, and reoccupies it on a replacement site, the purchase price of the replacement dwelling shall be the sum of:</P>
            <P>(i) The cost of moving and restoring the dwelling to a condition comparable to that prior to the move;</P>
            <P>(ii) The cost of making the unit a decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling (defined at § 24.2(a)(8)); and</P>

            <P>(iii) The current fair market value for residential use of the replacement dwelling site (<E T="03">see</E> appendix A, § 24.401(c)(2)(iii)), unless the claimant rented the displacement site and there is a reasonable opportunity for the claimant to rent a suitable replacement site; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The retention value of the dwelling, if such retention value is reflected in the “acquisition cost” used when computing the replacement housing payment.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Increased mortgage interest costs.</E> The displacing Agency shall determine the factors to be used in computing the amount to be paid to a displaced person under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The payment for increased mortgage interest cost shall be the amount which will reduce the mortgage balance on a new mortgage to an amount which could be amortized with the same monthly payment for principal and interest as that for the mortgage(s) on the displacement dwelling. In addition, payments shall include other debt service costs, if not paid as incidental costs, and shall be based only on bona fide mortgages that were valid liens on the displacement dwelling for at least 180 days prior to the initiation of negotiations. Paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section shall apply to the computation of the increased mortgage interest costs payment, which payment shall be contingent upon a mortgage being placed on the replacement dwelling.</P>

            <P>(1) The payment shall be based on the unpaid mortgage balance(s) on the displacement dwelling; however, in the event the displaced person obtains a smaller mortgage than the mortgage <PRTPAGE P="211"/>balance(s) computed in the buydown determination, the payment will be prorated and reduced accordingly. (See appendix A, § 24.401(d).) In the case of a home equity loan the unpaid balance shall be that balance which existed 180 days prior to the initiation of negotiations or the balance on the date of acquisition, whichever is less.</P>
            <P>(2) The payment shall be based on the remaining term of the mortgage(s) on the displacement dwelling or the term of the new mortgage, whichever is shorter.</P>
            <P>(3) The interest rate on the new mortgage used in determining the amount of the payment shall not exceed the prevailing fixed interest rate for conventional mortgages currently charged by mortgage lending institutions in the area in which the replacement dwelling is located.</P>
            <P>(4) Purchaser's points and loan origination or assumption fees, but not seller's points, shall be paid to the extent:</P>
            <P>(i) They are not paid as incidental expenses;</P>
            <P>(ii) They do not exceed rates normal to similar real estate transactions in the area;</P>
            <P>(iii) The Agency determines them to be necessary; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The computation of such points and fees shall be based on the unpaid mortgage balance on the displacement dwelling, less the amount determined for the reduction of the mortgage balance under this section.</P>
            <P>(5) The displaced person shall be advised of the approximate amount of this payment and the conditions that must be met to receive the payment as soon as the facts relative to the person's current mortgage(s) are known and the payment shall be made available at or near the time of closing on the replacement dwelling in order to reduce the new mortgage as intended.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Incidental expenses.</E> The incidental expenses to be paid under paragraph (b)(3) of this section or § 24.402(c)(1) are those necessary and reasonable costs actually incurred by the displaced person incident to the purchase of a replacement dwelling, and customarily paid by the buyer, including:</P>
            <P>(1) Legal, closing, and related costs, including those for title search, preparing conveyance instruments, notary fees, preparing surveys and plats, and recording fees.</P>
            <P>(2) Lender, FHA, or VA application and appraisal fees.</P>
            <P>(3) Loan origination or assumption fees that do not represent prepaid interest.</P>
            <P>(4) Professional home inspection, certification of structural soundness, and termite inspection.</P>
            <P>(5) Credit report.</P>
            <P>(6) Owner's and mortgagee's evidence of title, <E T="03">e.g.</E>, title insurance, not to exceed the costs for a comparable replacement dwelling.</P>
            <P>(7) Escrow agent's fee.</P>
            <P>(8) State revenue or documentary stamps, sales or transfer taxes (not to exceed the costs for a comparable replacement dwelling).</P>
            <P>(9) Such other costs as the Agency determine to be incidental to the purchase.</P>
            <P>(f) Rental assistance payment for 180-day homeowner. A 180-day homeowner-occupant, who could be eligible for a replacement housing payment under paragraph (a) of this section but elects to rent a replacement dwelling, is eligible for a rental assistance payment. The amount of the rental assistance payment is based on a determination of market rent for the acquired dwelling compared to a comparable rental dwelling available on the market. The difference, if any, is computed in accordance with § 24.402(b)(1), except that the limit of $5,250 does not apply, and disbursed in accordance with § 24.402(b)(3). Under no circumstances would the rental assistance payment exceed the amount that could have been received under § 24.401(b)(1) had the 180-day homeowner elected to purchase and occupy a comparable replacement dwelling.</P>

(See § 24.404.) Such payment shall be 42 times the amount obtained by subtracting the base monthly rental for the displacement dwelling from the lesser of:</P>
            <P>(i) The monthly rent and estimated average monthly cost of utilities for a comparable replacement dwelling; or</P>

For a tenant who paid little or no rent for the displacement dwelling, use the fair market rent, unless its use would result in a hardship because of the person's income or other circumstances);</P>
            <P>(ii) Thirty (30) percent of the displaced person's average monthly gross household income if the amount is classified as “low income” by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Annual Survey of Income Limits for the Public Housing and Section 8 Programs <SU>4</SU>
              <FTREF/>. The base monthly rental shall be established solely on the criteria in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section for persons with income exceeding the survey's “low income” limits, for persons refusing to provide appropriate evidence of income, and for persons who are dependents.

At the Agency's discretion, a downpayment assistance payment that is less than $5,250 may be increased to any amount not to exceed $5,250. However, the payment to a displaced homeowner shall not exceed the amount the owner would receive under § 24.401(b) if he or she met the 180-day occupancy requirement. If the Agency elects to provide the maximum payment of $5,250 as <PRTPAGE P="213"/>a downpayment, the Agency shall apply this discretion in a uniform and consistent manner, so that eligible displaced persons in like circumstances are treated equally.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Determining cost of comparable replacement dwelling.</E> The upper limit of a replacement housing payment shall be based on the cost of a comparable replacement dwelling (defined at § 24.2(a)(6)).</P>
            <P>(1) If available, at least three comparable replacement dwellings shall be examined and the payment computed on the basis of the dwelling most nearly representative of, and equal to, or better than, the displacement dwelling.</P>

            <P>(2) If the site of the comparable replacement dwelling lacks a major exterior attribute of the displacement dwelling site, (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, the site is significantly smaller or does not contain a swimming pool), the value of such attribute shall be subtracted from the acquisition cost of the displacement dwelling for purposes of computing the payment.</P>
            <P>(3) If the acquisition of a portion of a typical residential property causes the displacement of the owner from the dwelling and the remainder is a buildable residential lot, the Agency may offer to purchase the entire property. If the owner refuses to sell the remainder to the Agency, the fair market value of the remainder may be added to the acquisition cost of the displacement dwelling for purposes of computing the replacement housing payment.</P>
            <P>(4) To the extent feasible, comparable replacement dwellings shall be selected from the neighborhood in which the displacement dwelling was located or, if that is not possible, in nearby or similar neighborhoods where housing costs are generally the same or higher.</P>
            <P>(5) Multiple occupants of one displacement dwelling. If two or more occupants of the displacement dwelling move to separate replacement dwellings, each occupant is entitled to a reasonable prorated share, as determined by the Agency, of any relocation payments that would have been made if the occupants moved together to a comparable replacement dwelling. However, if the Agency determines that two or more occupants maintained separate households within the same dwelling, such occupants have separate entitlements to relocation payments.</P>
            <P>(6) Deductions from relocation payments. An Agency shall deduct the amount of any advance relocation payment from the relocation payment(s) to which a displaced person is otherwise entitled. The Agency shall not withhold any part of a relocation payment to a displaced person to satisfy an obligation to any other creditor.</P>
            <P>(7) Mixed-use and multifamily properties. If the displacement dwelling was part of a property that contained another dwelling unit and/or space used for nonresidential purposes, and/or is located on a lot larger than typical for residential purposes, only that portion of the acquisition payment which is actually attributable to the displacement dwelling shall be considered the acquisition cost when computing the replacement housing payment.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Inspection of replacement dwelling.</E> Before making a replacement housing payment or releasing the initial payment from escrow, the Agency or its designated representative shall inspect the replacement dwelling and determine whether it is a decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling as defined at § 24.2(a)(8).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Purchase of replacement dwelling.</E> A displaced person is considered to have met the requirement to purchase a replacement dwelling, if the person:</P>
            <P>(1) Purchases a dwelling;</P>
            <P>(2) Purchases and rehabilitates a substandard dwelling;</P>
            <P>(3) Relocates a dwelling which he or she owns or purchases;</P>

            <P>(4) Constructs a dwelling on a site he or she owns or purchases;<PRTPAGE P="214"/>
            </P>
            <P>(5) Contracts for the purchase or construction of a dwelling on a site provided by a builder or on a site the person owns or purchases; or</P>
            <P>(6) Currently owns a previously purchased dwelling and site, valuation of which shall be on the basis of current fair market value.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Occupancy requirements for displacement or replacement dwelling.</E> No person shall be denied eligibility for a replacement housing payment solely because the person is unable to meet the occupancy requirements set forth in these regulations for a reason beyond his or her control, including:</P>
            <P>(1) A disaster, an emergency, or an imminent threat to the public health or welfare, as determined by the President, the Federal Agency funding the project, or the displacing Agency; or</P>
            <P>(2) Another reason, such as a delay in the construction of the replacement dwelling, military duty, or hospital stay, as determined by the Agency.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Conversion of payment.</E> A displaced person who initially rents a replacement dwelling and receives a rental assistance payment under § 24.402(b) is eligible to receive a payment under § 24.401 or § 24.402(c) if he or she meets the eligibility criteria for such payments, including purchase and occupancy within the prescribed 1-year period. Any portion of the rental assistance payment that has been disbursed shall be deducted from the payment computed under § 24.401 or § 24.402(c).</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Payment after death.</E> A replacement housing payment is personal to the displaced person and upon his or her death the undisbursed portion of any such payment shall not be paid to the heirs or assigns, except that:</P>
            <P>(1) The amount attributable to the displaced person's period of actual occupancy of the replacement housing shall be paid.</P>
            <P>(2) Any remaining payment shall be disbursed to the remaining family members of the displaced household in any case in which a member of a displaced family dies.</P>
            <P>(3) Any portion of a replacement housing payment necessary to satisfy the legal obligation of an estate in connection with the selection of a replacement dwelling by or on behalf of a deceased person shall be disbursed to the estate.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Insurance proceeds.</E> To the extent necessary to avoid duplicate compensation, the amount of any insurance proceeds received by a person in connection with a loss to the displacement dwelling due to a catastrophic occurrence (fire, flood, etc.) shall be included in the acquisition cost of the displacement dwelling when computing the price differential. (<E T="03">See</E> § 24.3.)</P>

            <SUBJECT>Replacement housing of last resort.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Determination to provide replacement housing of last resort.</E> Whenever a program or project cannot proceed on a timely basis because comparable replacement dwellings are not available within the monetary limits for owners or tenants, as specified in § 24.401 or § 24.402, as appropriate, the Agency shall provide additional or alternative assistance under the provisions of this subpart. Any decision to provide last resort housing assistance must be adequately justified either:</P>
            <P>(1) On a case-by-case basis, for good cause, which means that appropriate consideration has been given to:</P>
            <P>(i) The availability of comparable replacement housing in the program or project area;</P>
            <P>(ii) The resources available to provide comparable replacement housing; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The individual circumstances of the displaced person, or</P>
            <P>(2) By a determination that:</P>
            <P>(i) There is little, if any, comparable replacement housing available to displaced persons within an entire program or project area; and, therefore, last resort housing assistance is necessary for the area as a whole;</P>
            <P>(ii) A program or project cannot be advanced to completion in a timely manner without last resort housing assistance; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The method selected for providing last resort housing assistance is cost effective, considering all elements, which contribute to total program or project costs.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Basic rights of persons to be displaced.</E> Notwithstanding any provision <PRTPAGE P="215"/>of this subpart, no person shall be required to move from a displacement dwelling unless comparable replacement housing is available to such person. No person may be deprived of any rights the person may have under the Uniform Act or this part. The Agency shall not require any displaced person to accept a dwelling provided by the Agency under these procedures (unless the Agency and the displaced person have entered into a contract to do so) in lieu of any acquisition payment or any relocation payment for which the person may otherwise be eligible.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Methods of providing comparable replacement housing.</E> Agencies shall have broad latitude in implementing this subpart, but implementation shall be for reasonable cost, on a case-by-case basis unless an exception to case-by-case analysis is justified for an entire project.</P>
            <P>(1) The methods of providing replacement housing of last resort include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(i) A replacement housing payment in excess of the limits set forth in § 24.401 or § 24.402. A replacement housing payment under this section may be provided in installments or in a lump sum at the Agency's discretion.</P>
            <P>(ii) Rehabilitation of and/or additions to an existing replacement dwelling.</P>
            <P>(iii) The construction of a new replacement dwelling.</P>
            <P>(iv) The provision of a direct loan, which requires regular amortization or deferred repayment. The loan may be unsecured or secured by the real property. The loan may bear interest or be interest-free.</P>
            <P>(v) The relocation and, if necessary, rehabilitation of a dwelling.</P>
            <P>(vi) The purchase of land and/or a replacement dwelling by the displacing Agency and subsequent sale or lease to, or exchange with a displaced person.</P>
            <P>(vii) The removal of barriers for persons with disabilities.</P>

            <P>(2) Under special circumstances, consistent with the definition of a comparable replacement dwelling, modified methods of providing replacement housing of last resort permit consideration of replacement housing based on space and physical characteristics different from those in the displacement dwelling (<E T="03">see</E> appendix A, § 24.404(c)), including upgraded, but smaller replacement housing that is decent, safe, and sanitary and adequate to accommodate individuals or families displaced from marginal or substandard housing with probable functional obsolescence. In no event, however, shall a displaced person be required to move into a dwelling that is not functionally equivalent in accordance with § 24.2(a)(6)(ii) of this part.</P>

            <P>(3) The Agency shall provide assistance under this subpart to a displaced person who is not eligible to receive a replacement housing payment under §§ 24.401 and 24.402 because of failure to meet the length of occupancy requirement when comparable replacement rental housing is not available at rental rates within the displaced person's financial means. (<E T="03">See</E> § 24.2(a)(6)(viii)(C).) Such assistance shall cover a period of 42 months.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This subpart describes the requirements governing the provision of replacement housing payments to a person displaced from a mobile home and/or mobile home site who meets the basic eligibility requirements of this part. Except as modified by this subpart, such a displaced person is entitled to a moving expense payment in accordance with subpart D of this part and a replacement housing payment in accordance with subpart E of this part to the same extent and subject to the same requirements as persons displaced from conventional dwellings.

If the Agency determines that a mobile home located in the remaining part of the property must be moved as a direct result of the project, the occupant of the mobile home shall be considered to be a displaced person who is entitled to relocation payments and other assistance under this part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Replacement housing payment for 180-day mobile homeowner displaced from a mobile home, and/or from the acquired mobile home site.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligibility.</E> An owner-occupant displaced from a mobile home or site is entitled to a replacement housing payment, not to exceed $22,500, under § 24.401 if:</P>
            <P>(1) The person occupied the mobile home on the displacement site for at least 180 days immediately before:</P>
            <P>(i) The initiation of negotiations to acquire the mobile home, if the person owned the mobile home and the mobile home is real property;</P>
            <P>(ii) The initiation of negotiations to acquire the mobile home site if the mobile home is personal property, but the person owns the mobile home site; or</P>
            <P>(iii) The date of the Agency's written notification to the owner-occupant that the owner is determined to be displaced from the mobile home as described in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) The person meets the other basic eligibility requirements at § 24.401(a)(2); and</P>
            <P>(3) The Agency acquires the mobile home as real estate, or acquires the mobile home site from the displaced owner, or the mobile home is personal property but the owner is displaced from the mobile home because the Agency determines that the mobile home:</P>
            <P>(i) Is not, and cannot economically be made decent, safe, and sanitary;</P>
            <P>(ii) Cannot be relocated without substantial damage or unreasonable cost;</P>
            <P>(iii) Cannot be relocated because there is no available comparable replacement site; or</P>
            <P>(iv) Cannot be relocated because it does not meet mobile home park entrance requirements.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Replacement housing payment computation for a 180-day owner that is displaced from a mobile home.</E> The replacement housing payment for an eligible displaced 180-day owner is computed as described at § 24.401(b) incorporating the following, as applicable:</P>
            <P>(1) If the Agency acquires the mobile home as real estate and/or acquires the owned site, the acquisition cost used to compute the price differential payment is the actual amount paid to the owner as just compensation for the acquisition of the mobile home, and/or site, if owned by the displaced mobile homeowner.</P>

            <P>(2) If the Agency does not purchase the mobile home as real estate but the owner is determined to be displaced from the mobile home and eligible for a replacement housing payment based on paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, the eligible price differential payment for the purchase of a comparable replacement mobile home, is the lesser of the displaced mobile homeowner's net cost to purchase a replacement mobile home (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, purchase price of the replacement mobile home less trade-in or sale proceeds of the displacement mobile home); or, the cost of the Agency's selected comparable mobile home less the Agency's estimate of the salvage or trade-in value for the mobile home from which the person is displaced.</P>
            <P>(3) If a comparable replacement mobile home site is not available, the price differential payment shall be computed on the basis of the reasonable cost of a conventional comparable replacement dwelling.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Rental assistance payment for a 180-day owner-occupant that is displaced from a leased or rented mobile home site.</E> If the displacement mobile home site is leased or rented, a displaced 180-day owner-occupant is entitled to a rental assistance payment computed as described in § 24.402(b). This rental assistance payment may be used to lease a replacement site; may be applied to the purchase price of a replacement site; or may be applied, with any replacement housing payment attributable to the mobile home, to the purchase of a replacement mobile home or conventional decent, safe and sanitary dwelling.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Owner-occupant not displaced from the mobile home.</E> If the Agency determines that a mobile home is personal property and may be relocated to a comparable replacement site, but the owner-occupant elects not to do so, the owner is not entitled to a replacement housing payment for the purchase of a replacement mobile home. However, the owner is eligible for moving costs described at § 24.301 and any replacement housing payment for the purchase or rental of a comparable site as <PRTPAGE P="217"/>described in this section or § 24.503 as applicable.</P>

            <P>This appendix provides additional information to explain the intent of certain provisions of this part.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Subpart A—General</HD>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.2 Definitions and Acronyms</E>
            </P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.2(a)(6) Definition of comparable replacement dwelling.</E> The requirement in § 24.2(a)(6)(ii) that a comparable replacement dwelling be “functionally equivalent” to the displacement dwelling means that it must perform the same function, and provide the <PRTPAGE P="218"/>same utility. While it need not possess every feature of the displacement dwelling, the principal features must be present.</P>
            <P>For example, if the displacement dwelling contains a pantry and a similar dwelling is not available, a replacement dwelling with ample kitchen cupboards may be acceptable. Insulated and heated space in a garage might prove an adequate substitute for basement workshop space. A dining area may substitute for a separate dining room. Under some circumstances, attic space could substitute for basement space for storage purposes, and vice versa.</P>
            <P>Only in unusual circumstances may a comparable replacement dwelling contain fewer rooms or, consequentially, less living space than the displacement dwelling. Such may be the case when a decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling (which by definition is “adequate to accommodate” the displaced person) may be found to be “functionally equivalent” to a larger but very run-down substandard displacement dwelling. Another example is when a displaced person accepts an offer of government housing assistance and the applicable requirements of such housing assistance program require that the displaced person occupy a dwelling that has fewer rooms or less living space than the displacement dwelling.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.2(a)(6)(vii).</E> The definition of comparable replacement dwelling requires that a comparable replacement dwelling for a person who is not receiving assistance under any government housing program before displacement must be currently available on the private market without any subsidy under a government housing program.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.2(a)(6)(ix).</E> A public housing unit may qualify as a comparable replacement dwelling only for a person displaced from a public housing unit. A privately owned dwelling with a housing program subsidy tied to the unit may qualify as a comparable replacement dwelling only for a person displaced from a similarly subsidized unit or public housing.</P>
            <P>A housing program subsidy that is paid to a person (not tied to the building), such as a HUD Section 8 Housing Voucher Program, may be reflected in an offer of a comparable replacement dwelling to a person receiving a similar subsidy or occupying a privately owned subsidized unit or public housing unit before displacement.</P>
            <P>However, nothing in this part prohibits an Agency from offering, or precludes a person from accepting, assistance under a government housing program, even if the person did not receive similar assistance before displacement. However, the Agency is obligated to inform the person of his or her options under this part. (If a person accepts assistance under a government housing assistance program, the rules of that program governing the size of the dwelling apply, and the rental assistance payment under § 24.402 would be computed on the basis of the person's actual out-of-pocket cost for the replacement housing.)</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.2(a)(8)(ii) Decent, Safe and Sanitary.</E> Many local housing and occupancy codes require the abatement of deteriorating paint, including lead-based paint and lead-based paint dust, in protecting the public health and safety. Where such standards exist, they must be honored. Even where local law does not mandate adherence to such standards, it is strongly recommended that they be considered as a matter of public policy.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.2(a)(8)(vii) Persons with a disability.</E> Reasonable accommodation of a displaced person with a disability at the replacement dwelling means the Agency is required to address persons with a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities. In these situations, reasonable accommodation should include the following at a minimum: Doors of adequate width; ramps or other assistance devices to traverse stairs and access bathtubs, shower stalls, toilets and sinks; storage cabinets, vanities, sink and mirrors at appropriate heights. Kitchen accommodations will include sinks and storage cabinets built at appropriate heights for access. The Agency shall also consider other items that may be necessary, such as physical modification to a unit, based on the displaced person's needs.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.2(a)(9)(ii)(D) Persons not displaced.</E> Paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(D) of this section recognizes that there are circumstances where the acquisition, rehabilitation or demolition of real property takes place without the intent or necessity that an occupant of the property be permanently displaced. Because such occupants are not considered “displaced persons” under this part, great care must be exercised to ensure that they are treated fairly and equitably. For example, if the tenant-occupant of a dwelling will not be displaced, but is required to relocate temporarily in connection with the project, the temporarily occupied housing must be decent, safe, and sanitary and the tenant must be reimbursed for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation. These expenses may include moving expenses and increased housing costs during the temporary relocation. Temporary relocation should not extend beyond one year before the person is returned to his or her previous unit or location. The Agency must contact any residential tenant who has been temporarily relocated for a period beyond one year and offer all permanent relocation assistance. This assistance would be in addition to any assistance the person has already received for temporary relocation, and may not be reduced by the amount of any temporary relocation assistance.<PRTPAGE P="219"/>
            </P>
            <P>Similarly, if a business will be shut-down for any length of time due to rehabilitation of a site, it may be temporarily relocated and reimbursed for all reasonable out of pocket expenses or must be determined to be displaced at the Agency's option.</P>
            <P>Any person who disagrees with the Agency's determination that he or she is not a displaced person under this part may file an appeal in accordance with 49 CFR part 24.10 of this regulation.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.2(a)(11) Dwelling Site.</E> This definition ensures that the computation of replacement housing payments are accurate and realistic (a) when the dwelling is located on a larger than normal site, (b) when mixed-use properties are acquired, (c) when more than one dwelling is located on the acquired property, or (d) when the replacement dwelling is retained by an owner and moved to another site.</P>

              <E T="03">Section 24.2(a)(14) Household income (exclusions).</E> Household income for purposes of this regulation does not include program benefits that are not considered income by Federal law such as food stamps and the Women Infants and Children (WIC) program. For a more detailed list of income exclusions see Federal Highway Administration, Office of Real Estate Services Web site: <E T="03">http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/realestate/.</E> (FR 4644-N-16 page 20319 Updated.) If there is a question on whether or not to include income from a specific program contact the Federal Agency administering the program.</P>

              <E T="03">Section 24(a)(15) Initiation of negotiations.</E> This section provides a special definition for acquisition and displacements under Pub. L. 96-510 or Superfund. The order of activities under Superfund may differ slightly in that temporary relocation may precede acquisition. Superfund is a program designed to clean up hazardous waste sites. When such a site is discovered, it may be necessary, in certain limited circumstances, to alert individual owners and tenants to potential health or safety threats and to offer to temporarily relocate them while additional information is gathered. If a decision is later made to permanently relocate such persons, those who had been temporarily relocated under Superfund authority would no longer be on site when a formal, written offer to acquire the property was made, and thus would lose their eligibility for a replacement housing payment. In order to prevent this unfair outcome, we have provided a definition of initiation of negotiation, which is based on the date the Federal Government offers to temporarily relocate an owner or tenant from the subject property.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.2(a)(15)(iv) Initiation of negotiations (Tenants.)</E> Tenants who occupy property that may be acquired amicably, without recourse to the use of the power of eminent domain, must be fully informed as to their eligibility for relocation assistance. This includes notifying such tenants of their potential eligibility when negotiations are initiated, notifying them if they become fully eligible, and, in the event the purchase of the property will not occur, notifying them that they are no longer eligible for relocation benefits. If a tenant is not readily accessible, as the result of a disaster or emergency, the Agency must make a good faith effort to provide these notifications and document its efforts in writing.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.2(a)(17) Mobile home.</E> The following examples provide additional guidance on the types of mobile homes and manufactured housing that can be found acceptable as comparable replacement dwellings for persons displaced from mobile homes. A recreational vehicle that is capable of providing living accommodations may be considered a replacement dwelling if the following criteria are met: the recreational vehicle is purchased and occupied as the “primary” place of residence; it is located on a purchased or leased site and connected to or have available all necessary utilities for functioning as a housing unit on the date of the displacing Agency's inspection; and, the dwelling, as sited, meets all local, State, and Federal requirements for a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling. (The regulations of some local jurisdictions will not permit the consideration of these vehicles as decent, safe and sanitary dwellings. In those cases, the recreational vehicle will not qualify as a replacement dwelling.)</P>
            <P>For HUD programs, mobile home is defined as “a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which, in the traveling mode, is eight body feet or more in width or forty body feet or more in length, or, when erected on site, is three hundred or more square feet, and which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used as a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities and includes the plumbing, heating, air-conditioning, and electrical systems contained therein; except that such terms shall include any structure which meets all the requirements of this paragraph except the size requirements and with respect to which the manufacturer voluntarily files a certification required by the Secretary of HUD and complies with the standards established under the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act, provided by Congress in the original 1974 Manufactured Housing Act.” In 1979 the term “mobile home” was changed to “manufactured home.” For purposes of this regulation, the terms mobile home and manufactured home are synonymous.</P>

            <P>When assembled, manufactured homes built after 1976 contain no less than 320 <PRTPAGE P="220"/>square feet. They may be single or multi-sectioned units when installed. Their designation as personalty or realty will be determined by State law. When determined to be realty, most are eligible for conventional mortgage financing.</P>
            <P>The 1976 HUD standards distinguish manufactured homes from factory-built “modular homes” as well as conventional or “stick-built” homes. Both of these types of housing are required to meet State and local construction codes.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.3 No Duplication of Payments.</E> This section prohibits an Agency from making a payment to a person under these regulations that would duplicate another payment the person receives under Federal, State, or local law. The Agency is not required to conduct an exhaustive search for such other payments; it is only required to avoid creating a duplication based on the Agency's knowledge at the time a payment is computed.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Subpart B—Real Property Acquisition</HD>
            <P>Federal Agencies may find that, for Federal eminent domain purposes, the terms “fair market value” (as used throughout this subpart) and “market value,” which may be the more typical term in private transactions, may be synonymous.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.101(a) Direct Federal program or project.</E> All 49 CFR Part 24 Subpart B (real property acquisition) requirements apply to all direct acquisitions for Federal programs and projects by Federal Agencies, except for acquisitions undertaken by the Tennessee Valley Authority or the Rural Utilities Service. There are no exceptions for “voluntary transactions.”</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.101(b)(1)(i).</E> The term “general geographic area” is used to clarify that the “geographic area” is not to be construed to be a small, limited area.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Sections 24.101(b)(1)(iv) and (2)(ii).</E> These sections provide that, for programs and projects receiving Federal financial assistance described in §§ 24.101(b)(1) and (2), Agencies are to inform the owner(s) in writing of the Agency's estimate of the fair market value for the property to be acquired.</P>
            <P>While this part does not require an appraisal for these transactions, Agencies may still decide that an appraisal is necessary to support their determination of the market value of these properties, and, in any event, Agencies must have some reasonable basis for their determination of market value. In addition, some of the concepts inherent in Federal Program appraisal practice are appropriate for these estimates. It would be appropriate for Agencies to adhere to project influence restrictions, as well as guard against discredited “public interest value” valuation concepts.</P>
            <P>After an Agency has established an amount it believes to be the market value of the property and has notified the owner of this amount in writing, an Agency may negotiate freely with the owner in order to reach agreement. Since these transactions are voluntary, accomplished by a willing buyer and a willing seller, negotiations may result in agreement for the amount of the original estimate, an amount exceeding it, or for a lesser amount. Although not required by the regulations, it would be entirely appropriate for Agencies to apply the administrative settlement concept and procedures in § 24.102(i) to negotiate amounts that exceed the original estimate of market value. Agencies shall not take any coercive action in order to reach agreement on the price to be paid for the property.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.101(c) Less-than-full-fee interest in real property.</E> This provision provides a benchmark beyond which the requirements of the subpart clearly apply to leases.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.102(c)(2) Appraisal, waiver thereof, and invitation to owner.</E> The purpose of the appraisal waiver provision is to provide Agencies a technique to avoid the costs and time delay associated with appraisal requirements for low-value, non-complex acquisitions. The intent is that non-appraisers make the waiver valuations, freeing appraisers to do more sophisticated work.</P>
            <P>The Agency employee making the determination to use the appraisal waiver process must have enough understanding of appraisal principles to be able to determine whether or not the proposed acquisition is low value and uncomplicated.</P>
            <P>Waiver valuations are not appraisals as defined by the Uniform Act and these regulations; therefore, appraisal performance requirements or standards, regardless of their source, are not required for waiver valuations by this rule. Since waiver valuations are not appraisals, neither is there a requirement for an appraisal review. However, the Agency must have a reasonable basis for the waiver valuation and an Agency official must still establish an amount believed to be just compensation to offer the property owner(s).</P>
            <P>The definition of “appraisal” in the Uniform Act and appraisal waiver provisions of the Uniform Act and these regulations are Federal law and public policy and should be considered as such when determining the impact of appraisal requirements levied by others.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.102(d) Establishment of offer of just compensation.</E> The initial offer to the property owner may not be less than the amount of the Agency's approved appraisal, but may exceed that amount if the Agency determines that a greater amount reflects just compensation for the property.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.102(f) Basic negotiation procedures.</E> An offer should be adequately presented to an owner, and the owner should be properly informed. Personal, face-to-face contact <PRTPAGE P="221"/>should take place, if feasible, but this section does not require such contact in all cases.</P>
            <P>This section also provides that the property owner be given a reasonable opportunity to consider the Agency's offer and to present relevant material to the Agency. In order to satisfy this requirement, Agencies must allow owners time for analysis, research and development, and compilation of a response, including perhaps getting an appraisal. The needed time can vary significantly, depending on the circumstances, but thirty (30) days would seem to be the minimum time these actions can be reasonably expected to require. Regardless of project time pressures, property owners must be afforded this opportunity.</P>
            <P>In some jurisdictions, there is pressure to initiate formal eminent domain procedures at the earliest opportunity because completing the eminent domain process, including gaining possession of the needed real property, is very time consuming. These provisions are not intended to restrict this practice, so long as it does not interfere with the reasonable time that must be provided for negotiations, described above, and the Agencies adhere to the Uniform Act ban on coercive action (section 301(7) of the Uniform Act).</P>
            <P>If the owner expresses intent to provide an appraisal report, Agencies are encouraged to provide the owner and/or his/her appraiser a copy of Agency appraisal requirements and inform them that their appraisal should be based on those requirements.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.102(i) Administrative settlement.</E> This section provides guidance on administrative settlement as an alternative to judicial resolution of a difference of opinion on the value of a property, in order to avoid unnecessary litigation and congestion in the courts.</P>
            <P>All relevant facts and circumstances should be considered by an Agency official delegated this authority. Appraisers, including review appraisers, must not be pressured to adjust their estimate of value for the purpose of justifying such settlements. Such action would invalidate the appraisal process.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.102(j) Payment before taking possession.</E> It is intended that a right-of-entry for construction purposes be obtained only in the exceptional case, such as an emergency project, when there is no time to make an appraisal and purchase offer and the property owner is agreeable to the process.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.102(m) Fair rental.</E> Section 301(6) of the Uniform Act limits what an Agency may charge when a former owner or previous occupant of a property is permitted to rent the property for a short term or when occupancy is subject to termination by the Agency on short notice. Such rent may not exceed “the fair rental value of the property to a short-term occupier.” Generally, the Agency's right to terminate occupancy on short notice (whether or not the renter also has that right) supports the establishment of a lesser rental than might be found in a longer, fixed-term situation.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.102(n) Conflict of interest.</E> The overall objective is to minimize the risk of fraud while allowing Agencies to operate as efficiently as possible. There are three parts to this provision.</P>
            <P>The first provision is the prohibition against having any interest in the real property being valued by the appraiser (for an appraisal), the valuer (for a waiver estimate) or the review appraiser (for an appraisal review.)</P>
            <P>The second provision is that no person functioning as a negotiator for a project or program can supervise or formally evaluate the performance of any appraiser or review appraiser performing appraisal or appraisal review work for that project or program. The intent of this provision is to ensure appraisal/valuation independence and to prevent inappropriate influence. It is not intended to prevent Agencies from providing appraisers/valuers with appropriate project information and participating in determining the scope of work for the appraisal or valuation. For a program or project receiving Federal financial assistance, the Federal funding Agency may waive this requirement if it would create a hardship for the Agency. The intent is to accommodate Federal-aid recipients that have a small staff where this provision would be unworkable.</P>

            <P>The third provision is to minimize situations where administrative costs exceed acquisition costs. Section 24.102(n) also provides that the same person may prepare a valuation estimate (including an appraisal) and negotiate that acquisition, if the valuation estimate amount is $10,000 or less. However, it should be noted that this exception for properties valued at $10,000 or less is not mandatory, <E T="03">e.g.</E>, Agencies are not required to use those who prepare a waiver valuation or appraisal of $10,000 or less to negotiate the acquisition, and, all appraisals must be reviewed in accordance with § 24.104. This includes appraisals of real property valued at $10,000 or less.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.103 Criteria for Appraisals.</E> The term “requirements” is used throughout this section to avoid confusion with The Appraisal Foundation's Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) “standards.” Although this section discusses appraisal requirements, the definition of “appraisal” itself at § 24.2(a)(3) includes appraisal performance requirements that are an inherent part of this section.</P>

            <P>The term “Federal and federally-assisted program or project” is used to better identify the type of appraisal practices that are to be referenced and to differentiate them <PRTPAGE P="222"/>from the private sector, especially mortgage lending, appraisal practice.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.103(a) Appraisal requirements.</E> The first sentence instructs readers that requirements for appraisals for Federal and federally-assisted programs or projects are located in 49 CFR part 24. These are the basic appraisal requirements for Federal and federally-assisted programs or projects. However, Agencies may enhance and expand on them, and there may be specific project or program legislation that references other appraisal requirements.</P>
            <P>These appraisal requirements are necessarily designed to comply with the Uniform Act and other Federal eminent domain based appraisal requirements. They are also considered to be consistent with Standards Rules 1, 2, and 3 of the 2004 edition of the USPAP. Consistency with USPAP has been a feature of these appraisal requirements since the beginning of USPAP. This “consistent” relationship was more formally recognized in OMB Bulletin 92-06. While these requirements are considered consistent with USPAP, neither can supplant the other; their provisions are neither identical, nor interchangeable. Appraisals performed for Federal and federally-assisted real property acquisition must follow the requirements in this regulation. Compliance with any other appraisal requirements is not the purview of this regulation. An appraiser who is committed to working within the bounds of USPAP should recognize that compliance with both USPAP and these requirements may be achieved by using the Supplemental Standards Rule and the Jurisdictional Exception Rule of USPAP, where applicable.</P>
            <P>The term “scope of work” defines the general parameters of the appraisal. It reflects the needs of the Agency and the requirements of Federal and federally-assisted program appraisal practice. It should be developed cooperatively by the assigned appraiser and an Agency official who is competent to both represent the Agency's needs and respect valid appraisal practice. The scope of work statement should include the purpose and/or function of the appraisal, a definition of the estate being appraised, and if it is fair market value, its applicable definition, and the assumptions and limiting conditions affecting the appraisal. It may include parameters for the data search and identification of the technology, including approaches to value, to be used to analyze the data. The scope of work should consider the specific requirements in 49 CFR 24.103(a)(2)(i) through (v) and address them as appropriate.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.103(a)(1).</E> The appraisal report should identify the items considered in the appraisal to be real property, as well as those identified as personal property.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.103(a)(2).</E> All relevant and reliable approaches to value are to be used. However, where an Agency determines that the sales comparison approach will be adequate by itself and yield credible appraisal results because of the type of property being appraised and the availability of sales data, it may limit the appraisal assignment to the sales comparison approach. This should be reflected in the scope of work.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.103(b) Influence of the project on just compensation.</E> As used in this section, the term “project” means an undertaking which is planned, designed, and intended to operate as a unit.</P>
            <P>When the public is aware of the proposed project, project area property values may be affected. Therefore, property owners should not be penalized because of a decrease in value caused by the proposed project nor reap a windfall at public expense because of increased value created by the proposed project.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.103(d)(1).</E> The appraiser and review appraiser must each be qualified and competent to perform the appraisal and appraisal review assignments, respectively. Among other qualifications, State licensing or certification and professional society designations can help provide an indication of an appraiser's abilities.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.104 Review of appraisals.</E> The term “review appraiser” is used rather than “reviewing appraiser,” to emphasize that “review appraiser” is a separate specialty and not just an appraiser who happens to be reviewing an appraisal. Federal Agencies have long held the perspective that appraisal review is a unique skill that, while it certainly builds on appraisal skills, requires more. The review appraiser should possess both appraisal technical abilities and the ability to be the two-way bridge between the Agency's real property valuation needs and the appraiser.</P>
            <P>Agency review appraisers typically perform a role greater than technical appraisal review. They are often involved in early project development. Later they may be involved in devising the scope of work statements and participate in making appraisal assignments to fee and/or staff appraisers. They are also mentors and technical advisors, especially on Agency policy and requirements, to appraisers, both staff and fee. Additionally, review appraisers are frequently technical advisors to other Agency officials.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.104(a).</E> This paragraph states that the review appraiser is to review the appraiser's presentation and analysis of market information and that it is to be reviewed against § 24.103 and other applicable requirements, including, to the extent appropriate, the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisition. The appraisal review is to be a technical review by an appropriately qualified review appraiser. The qualifications of the review appraiser and the level of <PRTPAGE P="223"/>explanation of the basis for the review appraiser's recommended (or approved) value depend on the complexity of the appraisal problem. If the initial appraisal submitted for review is not acceptable, the review appraiser is to communicate and work with the appraiser to the greatest extent possible to facilitate the appraiser's development of an acceptable appraisal.</P>
            <P>In doing this, the review appraiser is to remain in an advisory role, not directing the appraisal, and retaining objectivity and options for the appraisal review itself.</P>
            <P>If the Agency intends that the staff review appraiser approve the appraisal (as the basis for the establishment of the amount believed to be just compensation), or establish the amount the Agency believes is just compensation, she/he must be specifically authorized by the Agency to do so. If the review appraiser is not specifically authorized to approve the appraisal (as the basis for the establishment of the amount believed to be just compensation), or establish the amount believed to be just compensation, that authority remains with another Agency official.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.104(b).</E> In developing an independent approved or recommended value, the review appraiser may reference any acceptable resource, including acceptable parts of any appraisal, including an otherwise unacceptable appraisal. When a review appraiser develops an independent value, while retaining the appraisal review, that independent value also becomes the approved appraisal of the fair market value for Uniform Act Section 301(3) purposes. It is within Agency discretion to decide whether a second review is needed if the first review appraiser establishes a value different from that in the appraisal report or reports on the property.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.104(c).</E> Before acceptance of an appraisal, the review appraiser must determine that the appraiser's documentation, including valuation data and analysis of that data, demonstrates the soundness of the appraiser's opinion of value. For the purposes of this part, an acceptable appraisal is any appraisal that, on its own, meets the requirements of § 24.103. An approved appraisal is the one acceptable appraisal that is determined to best fulfill the requirement to be the basis for the amount believed to be just compensation. Recognizing that appraisal is not an exact science, there may be more than one acceptable appraisal of a property, but for the purposes of this part, there can be only one approved appraisal.</P>
            <P>At the Agency's discretion, for a low value property requiring only a simple appraisal process, the review appraiser's recommendation (or approval), endorsing the appraiser's report, may be determined to satisfy the requirement for the review appraiser's signed report and certification.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.106(b). Expenses incidental to transfer of title to the agency.</E> Generally, the Agency is able to pay such incidental costs directly and, where feasible, is required to do so. In order to prevent the property owner from making unnecessary out-of-pocket expenditures and to avoid duplication of expenses, the property owner should be informed early in the acquisition process of the Agency's intent to make such arrangements. Such expenses must be reasonable and necessary.</P>

In addition, § 24.204(a) requires that, “where possible, three or more comparable replacement dwellings shall be made available.” Thus, the basic standard for the number of referrals required under this section is three.

            <P>While § 24.207(f) prohibits an Agency from proposing or requesting that a displaced person waive his or her rights or entitlements to relocation assistance and payments, an <PRTPAGE P="224"/>Agency may accept a written statement from the displaced person that states that they have chosen not to accept some or all of the payments or assistance to which they are entitled. Any such written statement must clearly show that the individual knows what they are entitled to receive (a copy of the Notice of Eligibility which was provided may serve as documentation) and their statement must specifically identify which assistance or payments they have chosen not to accept. The statement must be signed and dated and may not be coerced by the Agency.</P>

              <E T="03">Section 24.301(g)(17) Searching expenses.</E> In special cases where the displacing Agency determines it to be reasonable and necessary, certain additional categories of searching costs may be considered for reimbursement. These include those costs involved in investigating potential replacement sites and the time of the business owner, based on salary or earnings, required to apply for licenses or permits, zoning changes, and attendance at zoning hearings. Necessary attorney fees required to obtain such licenses or permits are also reimbursable. Time spent in negotiating the purchase of a replacement business site is also reimbursable based on a reasonable salary or earnings rate. In those instances when such additional costs to investigate and acquire the site exceed $2,500, the displacing Agency may consider waiver of the cost limitation under the § 24.7, waiver provision. Such a waiver should be subject to the approval of the Federal-funding Agency in accordance with existing delegation authority.</P>

              <E T="03">Section 24.303(b) Professional Services.</E> If a question should arise as to what is a “reasonable hourly rate,” the Agency should compare the rates of other similar professional providers in that area.</P>

Administrative expenses are those for administrative support such as rent, utilities, salaries, advertising, and other like items as well as fundraising expenses.

This payment is commonly known as the “buydown.”</P>
            <P>The Agency must know the remaining principal balance, the interest rate, and monthly principal and interest payments for the old mortgage as well as the interest rate, points and term for the new mortgage to compute the increased mortgage interest costs. If the combination of interest and points for the new mortgage exceeds the current prevailing fixed interest rate and points for conventional mortgages and there is no justification for the excessive rate, then the current prevailing fixed interest rate and points shall be used in the computations. Justification may be the unavailability of the current prevailing rate due to the amount of the new mortgage, credit difficulties, or other similar reasons.</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.402(b)(2) Low income calculation example.</E> The Uniform Act requires that an eligible displaced person who rents a replacement dwelling is entitled to a rental assistance payment calculated in accordance with § 24.402(b). One factor in this calculation is to determine if a displaced person is “low income,” as defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's annual survey of income limits for the Public Housing and Section 8 Programs. To make such a determination, the Agency must: (1) Determine the total number of members in the household (including all adults and children); (2) locate the appropriate table for income limits applicable to the Uniform Act for the state in which the displaced residence is located (found at: <E T="03">http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/realestate/ua/ualic.htm</E>); (3) from the list of local jurisdictions shown, identify the appropriate county, Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)*, or Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area (PMSA)* in which the displacement property is located; and (4) locate the appropriate income limit in that jurisdiction for the size of this displaced person/family. The income limit must then be compared to the household income (§ 24.2(a)(15)) which is the gross annual income received by the displaced family, excluding income from any dependent children and full-time students under the age of 18. If the household income for the eligible displaced person/family is less than or equal to the income limit, the family is considered “low income.” For example:</P>
            <P>Tom and Mary Smith and their three children are being displaced. The information obtained from the family and verified by the Agency is as follows:</P>
            <P>Tom Smith, employed, earns $21,000/yr.</P>

            <P>Mary Smith, receives disability payments of $6,000/yr.<PRTPAGE P="226"/>
            </P>
            <P>Tom Smith Jr., 21, employed, earns $10,000/yr.</P>
            <P>Mary Jane Smith, 17, student, has a paper route, earns $3,000/yr. (Income is not included because she is a dependent child and a full-time student under 18)</P>
            <P>Sammie Smith, 10, full-time student, no income.</P>
            <P>Total family income for 5 persons is: $21,000 + $6,000 + $10,000 = $37,000</P>
            <P>The displacement residence is located in the State of Maryland, Caroline County. The low income limit for a 5 person household is: $47,450. (2004 Income Limits)</P>
            <P>This household is considered “low income.”</P>

            <P>* A complete list of counties and towns included in the identified MSAs and PMSAs can be found under the bulleted item “Income Limit Area Definition” posted on the FHWA's Web site at: <E T="03">http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/realestate/ua/ualic.htm.</E>

              <E T="03">Section 24.402(c) Downpayment assistance.</E> The downpayment assistance provisions in § 24.402(c) limit such assistance to the amount of the computed rental assistance payment for a tenant or an eligible homeowner. It does, however, provide the latitude for Agency discretion in offering downpayment assistance that exceeds the computed rental assistance payment, up to the $5,250 statutory maximum. This does not mean, however, that such Agency discretion may be exercised in a selective or discriminatory fashion. The displacing Agency should develop a policy that affords equal treatment for displaced persons in like circumstances and this policy should be applied uniformly throughout the Agency's programs or projects.</P>
            <P>For the purpose of this section, should the amount of the rental assistance payment exceed the purchase price of the replacement dwelling, the payment would be limited to the cost of the dwelling.</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.404(b) Basic rights of persons to be displaced.</E> This paragraph affirms the right of a 180-day homeowner-occupant, who is eligible for a replacement housing payment under § 24.401, to a reasonable opportunity to purchase a comparable replacement dwelling. However, it should be read in conjunction with the definition of “owner of a dwelling” at § 24.2(a)(20). The Agency is not required to provide persons owning only a fractional interest in the displacement dwelling a greater level of assistance to purchase a replacement dwelling than the Agency would be required to provide such persons if they owned fee simple title to the displacement dwelling. If such assistance is not sufficient to buy a replacement dwelling, the Agency may provide additional purchase assistance or rental assistance.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 24.404(c) Methods of providing comparable replacement housing.</E> This Section emphasizes the use of cost effective means of providing comparable replacement housing. The term “reasonable cost” is used to highlight the fact that while innovative means to provide housing are encouraged, they should be cost-effective. Section 24.404(c)(2) permits the use of last resort housing, in special cases, which may involve variations from the usual methods of obtaining comparability. However, such variation should never result in a lowering of housing standards nor should it ever result in a lower quality of living style for the displaced person. The physical characteristics of the comparable replacement dwelling may be dissimilar to those of the displacement dwelling but they may never be inferior.</P>
            <P>One example might be the use of a new mobile home to replace a very substandard conventional dwelling in an area where comparable conventional dwellings are not available.</P>
            <P>Another example could be the use of a superior, but smaller, decent, safe and sanitary dwelling to replace a large, old substandard dwelling, only a portion of which is being used as living quarters by the occupants and no other large comparable dwellings are available in the area.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Separate teams.</E> Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill <PRTPAGE P="242"/>or the activity involved is a contact sport. However, where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport.

            <P>(b) These measures may include the use of incentives, technical assistance, business development programs, mentor-protégé programs, and other appropriate measures designed to assist DBEs in performing work outside of the specific field in which you have determined that non-DBEs are unduly burdened. You may also consider varying your use of contract goals, to the extent consistent with § 26.51, to unsure that non-DBEs are not unfairly prevented from competing for subcontracts.</P>
            <P>(c) You must obtain the approval of the concerned DOT operating administration for your determination of overconcentration and the measures you devise to address it. Once approved, the measures become part of your DBE program.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What role do business development and mentor-protégé programs have in the DBE program?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) You may or, if an operating administration directs you to, you must establish a DBE business development program (BDP) to assist firms in gaining the ability to compete successfully in the marketplace outside the DBE program. You may require a DBE firm, as a condition of receiving assistance through the BDP, to agree to terminate its participation in the DBE program after a certain time has passed or certain objectives have been reached. See Appendix C of this part for guidance on administering BDP programs.</P>
            <P>(b) As part of a BDP or separately, you may establish a “mentor-protégé” program, in which another DBE or non-DBE firm is the principal source of business development assistance to a DBE firm.</P>
            <P>(1) Only firms you have certified as DBEs before they are proposed for participation in a mentor-protégé program are eligible to participate in the mentor-protégé program.</P>
            <P>(2) During the course of the mentor-protégé relationship, you must:</P>
            <P>(i) Not award DBE credit to a non-DBE mentor firm for using its own protégé firm for more than one half of its goal on any contract let by the recipient; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Not award DBE credit to a non-DBE mentor firm for using its own protégé firm for more than every other contract performed by the protégé firm.</P>
            <P>(3) For purposes of making determinations of business size under this part, you must not treat protégé firms as affiliates of mentor firms, when both firms are participating under an approved mentor-protégé program. See Appendix D of this part for guidance concerning the operation of mentor-protégé programs.</P>
            <P>(c) Your BDPs and mentor-protégé programs must be approved by the concerned operating administration before you implement them. Once approved, they become part of your DBE program.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What are a recipient's responsibilities for monitoring the performance of other program participants?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) You must implement appropriate mechanisms to ensure compliance with the part's requirements by all program participants (e.g., applying legal and contract remedies available under Federal, state and local law). You must set forth these mechanisms in your DBE program.</P>

            <P>(b) Your DBE program must also include a monitoring and enforcement mechanism to ensure that work committed to DBEs at contract award or subsequently (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> as the result of modification to the contract) is actually performed by the DBEs to which the work was committed. This mechanism must include a written certification that you have reviewed contracting records and monitored work sites in your state for this purpose. The <PRTPAGE P="256"/>monitoring to which this paragraph refers may be conducted in conjunction with monitoring of contract performance for other purposes (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> close-out reviews for a contract).</P>

            <P>(c) This mechanism must provide for a running tally of actual DBE attainments (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> payments actually made to DBE firms), including a means of comparing these attainments to commitments. In your reports of DBE participation to the Department, you must display both commitments and attainments.</P>

            <P>(a) Your DBE program must include an element to structure contracting requirements to facilitate competition by small business concerns, taking all reasonable steps to eliminate obstacles to their participation, including unnecessary and unjustified bundling of contract requirements that may preclude small business participation in procurements as prime contractors or subcontractors.</P>
            <P>(b) This element must be submitted to the appropriate DOT operating administration for approval as a part of your DBE program by February 28, 2012. As part of this program element you may include, but are not limited to, the following strategies:</P>

            <P>(1) Establishing a race-neutral small business set-aside for prime contracts under a stated amount (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> $1 million).</P>

            <P>(2) In multi-year design-build contracts or other large contracts (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> for “megaprojects”) requiring bidders on the prime contract to specify elements of the contract or specific subcontracts that are of a size that small businesses, including DBEs, can reasonably perform.</P>
            <P>(3) On prime contracts not having DBE contract goals, requiring the prime contractor to provide subcontracting opportunities of a size that small businesses, including DBEs, can reasonably perform, rather than self-performing all the work involved.</P>
            <P>(4) Identifying alternative acquisition strategies and structuring procurements to facilitate the ability of consortia or joint ventures consisting of small businesses, including DBEs, to compete for and perform prime contracts.</P>
            <P>(5) To meet the portion of your overall goal you project to meet through race-neutral measures, ensuring that a reasonable number of prime contracts are of a size that small businesses, including DBEs, can reasonably perform.</P>
            <P>(c) You must actively implement your program elements to foster small business participation. Doing so is a requirement of good faith implementation of your DBE program.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How do recipients set overall goals?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, you must set an overall goal for DBE participation in your DOT-assisted contracts.</P>
            <P>(2) If you are a FTA or FAA recipient who reasonably anticipates awarding (excluding transit vehicle purchases) $250,000 or less in FTA or FAA funds in prime contracts in a Federal fiscal year, you are not required to develop overall goals for FTA or FAA respectively for that fiscal year. However, if you have an existing DBE program, it must remain in effect and you must seek to fulfill the objectives outlined in § 26.1.</P>
            <P>(b) Your overall goal must be based on demonstrable evidence of the availability of ready, willing and able DBEs relative to all businesses ready, willing and able to participate on your DOT-assisted contracts (hereafter, the “relative availability of DBEs”). The goal must reflect your determination of the level of DBE participation you would expect absent the effects of discrimination. You cannot simply rely on either the 10 percent national goal, your previous overall goal or past DBE participation rates in your program without reference to the relative availability of DBEs in your market.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Step 1.</E> You must begin your goal setting process by determining a base figure for the relative availability of DBEs. The following are examples of approaches that you may take toward determining a base figure. These examples are provided as a starting point for your goal setting process. Any percentage figure derived from one of these examples should be considered a basis from which you begin when examining all evidence available in your jurisdiction. These examples are not intended as an exhaustive list. Other methods or combinations of methods to determine a base figure may be used, subject to approval by the concerned operating administration.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Use DBE Directories and Census Bureau Data.</E> Determine the number of ready, willing and able DBEs in your market from your DBE directory. Using the Census Bureau's County Business Pattern (CBP) data base, determine the number of all ready, willing and able businesses available in your market that perform work in the same NAICS codes. (Information about the CBP data base may be obtained from the Census Bureau at their web site, <E T="03">www.census.gov/epcd/cbp/view/cbpview.html.</E>) Divide the number of DBEs by the number of all businesses to derive a base figure for the relative availability of DBEs in your market.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Use a bidders list.</E> Determine the number of DBEs that have bid or quoted (successful and unsuccessful) on your DOT-assisted prime contracts or subcontracts in the past three years. Determine the number of all businesses that have bid or quoted (successful and unsuccessful) on prime or subcontracts in the same time period. Divide the number of DBE bidders and quoters by the number of all businesses to derive a base figure for the relative availability of DBEs in your market. When using this approach, you must establish a mechanism (documented in your goal submission) to directly capture data on DBE and non-DBE prime and subcontractors that submitted bids or quotes on your DOT-assisted contracts.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Use data from a disparity study.</E> Use a percentage figure derived from data in a valid, applicable disparity study.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Use the goal of another DOT recipient.</E> If another DOT recipient in the same, or substantially similar, market has set an overall goal in compliance with this rule, you may use that goal as a base figure for your goal.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Alternative methods.</E> Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, you may use other methods to determine a base figure for your overall goal. Any methodology you choose must be based on demonstrable evidence of local market conditions and be designed to ultimately attain a goal that is rationally related to the relative availability of DBEs in your market. The exclusive use of a list of prequalified contractors or plan holders, or a bidders list that does not comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, is not an acceptable alternative means of determining the availability of DBEs.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Step 2.</E> Once you have calculated a base figure, you must examine all of the evidence available in your jurisdiction to determine what adjustment, if <PRTPAGE P="258"/>any, is needed to the base figure to arrive at your overall goal. If the evidence does not suggest an adjustment is necessary, then no adjustment shall be made.</P>
            <P>(1) There are many types of evidence that must be considered when adjusting the base figure. These include:</P>
            <P>(i) The current capacity of DBEs to perform work in your DOT-assisted contracting program, as measured by the volume of work DBEs have performed in recent years;</P>
            <P>(ii) Evidence from disparity studies conducted anywhere within your jurisdiction, to the extent it is not already accounted for in your base figure; and</P>
            <P>(iii) If your base figure is the goal of another recipient, you must adjust it for differences in your local market and your contracting program.</P>
            <P>(2) If available, you must consider evidence from related fields that affect the opportunities for DBEs to form, grow and compete. These include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(i) Statistical disparities in the ability of DBEs to get the financing, bonding and insurance required to participate in your program;</P>
            <P>(ii) Data on employment, self-employment, education, training and union apprenticeship programs, to the extent you can relate it to the opportunities for DBEs to perform in your program.</P>
            <P>(3) If you attempt to make an adjustment to your base figure to account for the continuing effects of past discrimination (often called the “but for” factor) or the effects of an ongoing DBE program, the adjustment must be based on demonstrable evidence that is logically and directly related to the effect for which the adjustment is sought.</P>
            <P>(e) Once you have determined a percentage figure in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, you should express your overall goal as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) If you are an FHWA recipient, as a percentage of all Federal-aid highway funds you will expend in FHWA-assisted contracts in the forthcoming three fiscal years.</P>
            <P>(2) If you are an FTA or FAA recipient, as a percentage of all FT or FAA funds (exclusive of FTA funds to be used for the purchase of transit vehicles) that you will expend in FTA or FAA-assisted contracts in the three forthcoming fiscal years.</P>
            <P>(3) In appropriate cases, the FHWA, FTA or FAA Administrator may permit or require you to express your overall goal as a percentage of funds for a particular grant or project or group of grants and/or projects, including entire projects. Like other overall goals, a project goal may be adjusted to reflect changed circumstances, with the concurrence of the appropriate operating administration.</P>
            <P>(i) A project goal is an overall goal, and must meet all the substantive and procedural requirements of this section pertaining to overall goals.</P>
            <P>(ii) A project goal covers the entire length of the project to which it applies.</P>
            <P>(iii) The project goal should include a projection of the DBE participation anticipated to be obtained during each fiscal year covered by the project goal.</P>
            <P>(iv) The funds for the project to which the project goal pertains are separated from the base from which your regular overall goal, applicable to contracts not part of the project covered by a project goal, is calculated.</P>
            <P>(f)(1)(i) If you set your overall goal on a fiscal year basis, you must submit it to the applicable DOT operating administration by August 1 at three-year intervals, based on a schedule established by the FHWA, FTA, or FAA, as applicable, and posted on that agency's Web site.</P>
            <P>(ii) You may adjust your three-year overall goal during the three-year period to which it applies, in order to reflect changed circumstances. You must submit such an adjustment to the concerned operating administration for review and approval.</P>
            <P>(iii) The operating administration may direct you to undertake a review of your goal if necessary to ensure that the goal continues to fit your circumstances appropriately.</P>
            <P>(iv) While you are required to submit an overall goal to FHWA, FTA, or FAA only every three years, the overall goal and the provisions of Sec. 26.47(c) apply to each year during that three-year period.</P>

            <P>(v) You may make, for informational purposes, projections of your expected <PRTPAGE P="259"/>DBE achievements during each of the three years covered by your overall goal. However, it is the overall goal itself, and not these informational projections, to which the provisions of section 26.47(c) of this part apply.</P>
            <P>(2) If you are a recipient and set your overall goal on a project or grant basis as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, you must submit the goal for review at a time determined by the FHWA, FTA or FAA Administrator, as applicable.</P>

            <P>(3) You must include with your overall goal submission a description of the methodology you used to establish the goal, incuding your base figure and the evidence with which it was calculated, and the adjustments you made to the base figure and the evidence you relied on for the adjustments. You should also include a summary listing of the relevant available evidence in your jurisdiction and, where applicable, an explanation of why you did not use that evidence to adjust your base figure. You must also include your projection of the portions of the overall goal you expect to meet through race-neutral and race-consioous measures, respectively (<E T="03">see</E> 26.51(c)).</P>
            <P>(4) You are not required to obtain prior operating administration concurrence with your overall goal. However, if the operating administration's review suggests that your overall goal has not been correctly calculated or that your method for calculating goals is inadequate, the operating administration may, after consulting with you, adjust your overall goal or require that you do so. The adjusted overall goal is binding on you. In evaluating the adequacy or soundness of the methodology used to derive the overall goal, the operating administration will be guided by goal setting principles and best practices identified by the Department in guidance issued pursuant to § 26.9.</P>
            <P>(5) If you need additional time to collect data or take other steps to develop an approach to setting overall goals, you may request the approval of the concerned operating administration for an interim goal and/or goal-setting mechanism. Such a mechanism must:</P>
            <P>(i) Reflect the relative availability of DBEs in your local market to the maximum extent feasible given the data available to you; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Avoid imposing undue burdens on non-DBEs.</P>
            <P>(6) Timely submission and operating administration approval of your overall goal is a condition of eligibility for DOT financial assistance.</P>
            <P>(7) If you fail to establish and implement goals as provided in this section, you are not in compliance with this part. If you establish and implement goals in a way different from that provided in this part, you are not in compliance with this part. If you fail to comply with this requirement, you are not eligible to receive DOT financial assistance.</P>
            <P>(g)(1) In establishing an overall goal, you must provide for consultation and publication. This includes:</P>
            <P>(i) Consultation with minority, women's and general contractor groups, community organizations, and other officials or organizations which could be expected to have information concerning the availability of disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged businesses, the effects of discrimination on opportunities for DBEs, and your efforts to establish a level playing field for the participation of DBEs. The consultation must include a scheduled, direct, interactive exchange (e.g., a face-to-face meeting, video conference, teleconference) with as many interested stakeholders as possible focused on obtaining information relevant to the goal setting process, and it must occur before you are required to submit your methodology to the operating administration for review pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section. You must document in your goal submission the consultation process you engaged in. Notwithstanding paragraph (f)(4) of this section, you may not implement your proposed goal until you have complied with this requirement.</P>

            <P>(ii) A published notice announcing your proposed overall goal before submission to the operating administration on August 1st. The notice must be posted on your official Internet Web site and may be posted in any other sources (e.g., minority-focused media, trade association publications). If the proposed goal changes following review by the operating administration, the <PRTPAGE P="260"/>revised goal must be posted on your official Internet Web site.</P>
            <P>(2) At your discretion, you may inform the public that the proposed overall goal and its rationale are available for inspection during normal business hours at your principal office and for a 30-day comment period. Notice of the comment period must include addresses to which comments may be sent. The public comment period will not extend the August 1st deadline set in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(h) Your overall goals must provide for participation by all certified DBEs and must not be subdivided into group-specific goals.</P>

            <P>(3)(i) If you are a state highway agency; one of the 50 largest transit authorities as determined by the FTA; or an Operational Evolution Partnership Plan airport or other airport designated by the FAA, you must submit, within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year, the analysis and corrective actions developed under paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section to the appropriate operating administration for approval. If the operating administration approves the report, you will be regarded as complying with the requirements of this section for the remainder of the fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(ii) As a transit authority or airport not meeting the criteria of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, you must retain analysis and corrective actions in your records for three years and make it available to FTA or FAA on request for their review.</P>
            <P>(4) FHWA, FTA, or FAA may impose conditions on the recipient as part of its approval of the recipient's analysis and corrective actions including, but not limited to, modifications to your overall goal methodology, changes in your race-conscious/race-neutral split, or the introduction of additional race-neutral or race-conscious measures.</P>
            <P>(5) You may be regarded as being in noncompliance with this Part, and therefore subject to the remedies in § 26.103 or § 26.105 of this part and other applicable regulations, for failing to implement your DBE program in good faith if any of the following things occur:</P>
            <P>(i) You do not submit your analysis and corrective actions to FHWA, FTA, or FAA in a timely manner as required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section;</P>

            <P>(a) If you are an FTA recipient, you must require in your DBE program that each transit vehicle manufacturer, as a condition of being authorized to bid or propose on FTA-assisted transit vehicle procurements, certify that it has complied with the requirements of this section. You do not include FTA assistance used in transit vehicle procurements in the base amount from which your overall goal is calculated.</P>
            <P>(1) Only those transit vehicle manufacturers listed on FTA's certified list of Transit Vehicle Manufacturers, or that have submitted a goal methodology to FTA that has been approved or has not been disapproved, at the time of solicitation are eligible to bid.</P>
            <P>(2) A TVM's failure to implement the DBE Program in the manner as prescribed in this section and throughout 49 CFR part 26 will be deemed as non-compliance, which will result in removal from FTA's certified TVMs list, resulting in that manufacturer becoming ineligible to bid.</P>
            <P>(3) FTA recipient's failure to comply with the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section may result in formal enforcement action or appropriate sanction as determined by FTA (e.g., FTA declining to participate in the vehicle procurement).</P>
            <P>(4) FTA recipients are required to submit within 30 days of making an award, the name of the successful bidder, and the total dollar value of the contract in the manner prescribed in the grant agreement.</P>
            <P>(b) If you are a transit vehicle manufacturer, you must establish and submit for FTA's approval an annual overall percentage goal.</P>
            <P>(1) In setting your overall goal, you should be guided, to the extent applicable, by the principles underlying § 26.45. The base from which you calculate this goal is the amount of FTA financial assistance included in transit vehicle contracts you will bid on during the fiscal year in question, less the portion(s) attributable to the manufacturing process performed entirely by the transit vehicle manufacturer's own forces.</P>
            <P>(i) You must consider and include in your base figure all domestic contracting opportunities made available to non-DBE firms; and</P>
            <P>(ii) You must exclude from this base figure funds attributable to work performed outside the United States and its territories, possessions, and commonwealths.</P>
            <P>(iii) In establishing an overall goal, the transit vehicle manufacturer must provide for public participation. This includes consultation with interested parties consistent with § 26.45(g).</P>
            <P>(2) The requirements of this part with respect to submission and approval of overall goals apply to you as they do to recipients.</P>
            <P>(c) Transit vehicle manufacturers awarded must comply with the reporting requirements of § 26.11 of this part including the requirement to submit the Uniform Report of Awards or Commitments and Payments, in order to remain eligible to bid on FTA assisted transit vehicle procurements.</P>
            <P>(d) Transit vehicle manufacturers must implement all other applicable requirements of this part, except those relating to UCPs and DBE certification procedures.</P>
            <P>(e) If you are an FHWA or FAA recipient, you may, with FHWA or FAA approval, use the procedures of this section with respect to procurements of vehicles or specialized equipment. If you choose to do so, then the manufacturers of this equipment must meet the same requirements (including goal approval by FHWA or FAA) as transit vehicle manufacturers must meet in FTA-assisted procurements.</P>
            <P>(f) As a recipient you may, with FTA approval, establish project-specific goals for DBE participation in the procurement of transit vehicles in lieu of complying through the procedures of this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What means do recipients use to meet overall goals?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) You must meet the maximum feasible portion of your overall goal by using race-neutral means of facilitating race-neutral DBE participation. Race-neutral DBE participation includes any time a DBE wins a prime contract through customary competitive procurement procedures or is awarded a subcontract on a prime contract that does not carry a DBE contract goal.</P>
            <P>(b) Race-neutral means include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Arranging solicitations, times for the presentation of bids, quantities, specifications, and delivery schedules in ways that facilitate participation by DBEs and other small businesses and by making contracts more accessible to small businesses, by means such as those provided under § 26.39 of this part.</P>
            <P>(2) Providing assistance in overcoming limitations such as inability to obtain bonding or financing (e.g., by such means as simplifying the bonding process, reducing bonding requirements, eliminating the impact of surety costs from bids, and providing services to help DBEs, and other small businesses, obtain bonding and financing);</P>
            <P>(3) Providing technical assistance and other services;</P>
            <P>(4) Carrying out information and communications programs on contracting procedures and specific contract opportunities (e.g., ensuring the inclusion of DBEs, and other small businesses, on recipient mailing lists for bidders; ensuring the dissemination to bidders on prime contracts of lists of potential subcontractors; provision of information in languages other than English, where appropriate);</P>
            <P>(5) Implementing a supportive services program to develop and improve immediate and long-term business management, record keeping, and financial and accounting capability for DBEs and other small businesses;</P>
            <P>(6) Providing services to help DBEs, and other small businesses, improve long-term development, increase opportunities to participate in a variety of kinds of work, handle increasingly significant projects, and achieve eventual self-sufficiency;</P>
            <P>(7) Establishing a program to assist new, start-up firms, particularly in fields in which DBE participation has historically been low;</P>
            <P>(8) Ensuring distribution of your DBE directory, through print and electronic means, to the widest feasible universe of potential prime contractors; and</P>
            <P>(9) Assisting DBEs, and other small businesses, to develop their capability to utilize emerging technology and conduct business through electronic media.</P>
            <P>(c) Each time you submit your overall goal for review by the concerned operating administration, you must also submit your projection of the portion of the goal that you expect to meet through race-neutral means and your basis for that projection. This projection is subject to approval by the concerned operating administration, in conjunction with its review of your overall goal.</P>
            <P>(d) You must establish contract goals to meet any portion of your overall goal you do not project being able to meet using race-neutral means.</P>
            <P>(e) The following provisions apply to the use of contract goals:</P>
            <P>(1) You may use contract goals only on those DOT-assisted contracts that have subcontracting possibilities.</P>
            <P>(2) You are not required to set a contract goal on every DOT-assisted contract. You are not required to set each contract goal at the same percentage level as the overall goal. The goal for a specific contract may be higher or lower than that percentage level of the overall goal, depending on such factors as the type of work involved, the location of the work, and the availability of DBEs for the work of the particular contract. However, over the period covered by your overall goal, you must set contract goals so that they will cumulatively result in meeting any portion of your overall goal you do not project being able to meet through the use of race-neutral means.</P>
            <P>(3) Operating administration approval of each contract goal is not necessarily required. However, operating administrations may review and approve or disapprove any contract goal you establish.</P>

            <P>(4) Your contract goals must provide for participation by all certified DBEs <PRTPAGE P="263"/>and must not be subdivided into group-specific goals.</P>
            <P>(f) To ensure that your DBE program continues to be narrowly tailored to overcome the effects of discrimination, you must adjust your use of contract goals as follows:</P>

            <P>(1) If your approved projection under paragraph (c) of this section estimates that you can meet your entire overall goal for a given year through race-neutral means, you must implement your program without setting contract goals during that year, unless it becomes necessary in order meet your overall goal.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example to paragraph (f)(1):</HD>
              <P>Your overall goal for Year 1 is 12 percent. You estimate that you can obtain 12 percent or more DBE participation through the use of race-neutral measures, without any use of contract goals. In this case, you do not set any contract goals for the contracts that will be performed in Year 1. However, if part way through Year 1, your DBE awards or commitments are not at a level that would permit you to achieve your overall goal for Year 1, you could begin setting race-conscious DBE contract goals during the remainder of the year as part of your obligation to implement your program in good faith.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            

            <P>(2) If, during the course of any year in which you are using contract goals, you determine that you will exceed your overall goal, you must reduce or eliminate the use of contract goals to the extent necessary to ensure that the use of contract goals does not result in exceeding the overall goal. If you determine that you will fall short of your overall goal, then you must make appropriate modifications in your use of race-neutral and/or race-conscious measures to allow you to meet the overall goal.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example to paragraph (f)(2):</HD>
              <P>In Year II, your overall goal is 12 percent. You have estimated that you can obtain 5 percent DBE participation through use of race-neutral measures. You therefore plan to obtain the remaining 7 percent participation through use of DBE goals. By September, you have already obtained 11 percent DBE participation for the year. For contracts let during the remainder of the year, you use contract goals only to the extent necessary to obtain an additional one percent DBE participation. However, if you determine in September that your participation for the year is likely to be only 8 percent total, then you would increase your use of race-neutral and/or race-conscious means during the remainder of the year in order to achieve your overall goal.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            

            <P>(3) If the DBE participation you have obtained by race-neutral means alone meets or exceeds your overall goals for two consecutive years, you are not required to make a projection of the amount of your goal you can meet using such means in the next year. You do not set contract goals on any contracts in the next year. You continue using only race-neutral means to meet your overall goals unless and until you do not meet your overall goal for a year.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example to paragraph (f)(3):</HD>
              <P>Your overall goal for Years I and Year II is 10 percent. The DBE participation you obtain through race-neutral measures alone is 10 percent or more in each year. (For this purpose, it does not matter whether you obtained additional DBE participation through using contract goals in these years.) In Year III and following years, you do not need to make a projection under paragraph (c) of this section of the portion of your overall goal you expect to meet using race-neutral means. You simply use race-neutral means to achieve your overall goals. However, if in Year VI your DBE participation falls short of your overall goal, then you must make a paragraph (c) projection for Year VII and, if necessary, resume use of contract goals in that year.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            

            <P>(4) If you obtain DBE participation that exceeds your overall goal in two consecutive years through the use of contract goals (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, not through the use of race-neutral means alone), you must reduce your use of contract goals proportionately in the following year.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example to paragraph (f)(4):</HD>

              <P>In Years I and II, your overall goal is 12 percent, and you obtain 14 and 16 percent DBE participation, respectively. You have exceeded your goals over the two-year period by an average of 25 percent. In Year III, your overall goal is again 12 percent, and your paragraph (c) projection estimates that you will obtain 4 percent DBE participation through race-neutral means and 8 percent through contract goals. You then reduce the contract goal projection by 25 percent (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, from 8 to 6 percent) and set contract goals accordingly during the year. If in Year III you obtain 11 percent participation, you do not use this contract goal adjustment mechanism for Year IV, because there have not been two <E T="03">consecutive</E> years of exceeding overall goals.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            

            <P>(g) In any year in which you project meeting part of your goal through race-neutral means and the remainder <PRTPAGE P="264"/>through contract goals, you must maintain data separately on DBE achievements in those contracts with and without contract goals, respectively. You must report this data to the concerned operating administration as provided in § 26.11.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What are the good faith efforts procedures recipients follow in situations where there are contract goals?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) When you have established a DBE contract goal, you must award the contract only to a bidder/offeror who makes good faith efforts to meet it. You must determine that a bidder/offeror has made good faith efforts if the bidder/offeror does either of the following things:</P>
            <P>(1) Documents that it has obtained enough DBE participation to meet the goal; or</P>
            <P>(2) Documents that it made adequate good faith efforts to meet the goal, even though it did not succeed in obtaining enough DBE participation to do so. If the bidder/offeror does document adequate good faith efforts, you must not deny award of the contract on the basis that the bidder/offeror failed to meet the goal. See Appendix A of this part for guidance in determining the adequacy of a bidder/offeror's good faith efforts.</P>
            <P>(b) In your solicitations for DOT-assisted contracts for which a contract goal has been established, you must require the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Award of the contract will be conditioned on meeting the requirements of this section;</P>
            <P>(2) All bidders or offerors will be required to submit the following information to the recipient, at the time provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section:</P>
            <P>(i) The names and addresses of DBE firms that will participate in the contract;</P>
            <P>(ii) A description of the work that each DBE will perform. To count toward meeting a goal, each DBE firm must be certified in a NAICS code applicable to the kind of work the firm would perform on the contract;</P>
            <P>(iii) The dollar amount of the participation of each DBE firm participating;</P>
            <P>(iv) Written documentation of the bidder/offeror's commitment to use a DBE subcontractor whose participation it submits to meet a contract goal; and</P>
            <P>(v) Written confirmation from each listed DBE firm that it is participating in the contract in the kind and amount of work provided in the prime contractor's commitment.</P>
            <P>(vi) If the contract goal is not met, evidence of good faith efforts (see Appendix A of this part). The documentation of good faith efforts must include copies of each DBE and non-DBE subcontractor quote submitted to the bidder when a non-DBE subcontractor was selected over a DBE for work on the contract; and</P>
            <P>(3)(i) At your discretion, the bidder/offeror must present the information required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section—</P>
            <P>(A) Under sealed bid procedures, as a matter of responsiveness, or with initial proposals, under contract negotiation procedures; or</P>
            <P>(B) No later than 7 days after bid opening as a matter of responsibility. The 7 days shall be reduced to 5 days beginning January 1, 2017.</P>
            <P>(ii) Provided that, in a negotiated procurement, including a design-build procurement, the bidder/offeror may make a contractually binding commitment to meet the goal at the time of bid submission or the presentation of initial proposals but provide the information required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section before the final selection for the contract is made by the recipient.</P>
            <P>(c) You must make sure all information is complete and accurate and adequately documents the bidder/offeror's good faith efforts before committing yourself to the performance of the contract by the bidder/offeror.</P>

            <P>(d) If you determine that the apparent successful bidder/offeror has failed to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, you must, before awarding the contract, provide the bidder/offeror an opportunity for administrative reconsideration.<PRTPAGE P="265"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) As part of this reconsideration, the bidder/offeror must have the opportunity to provide written documentation or argument concerning the issue of whether it met the goal or made adequate good faith efforts to do so.</P>
            <P>(2) Your decision on reconsideration must be made by an official who did not take part in the original determination that the bidder/offeror failed to meet the goal or make adequate good faith efforts to do so.</P>
            <P>(3) The bidder/offeror must have the opportunity to meet in person with your reconsideration official to discuss the issue of whether it met the goal or made adequate good faith efforts to do so.</P>
            <P>(4) You must send the bidder/offeror a written decision on reconsideration, explaining the basis for finding that the bidder did or did not meet the goal or make adequate good faith efforts to do so.</P>
            <P>(5) The result of the reconsideration process is not administratively appealable to the Department of Transportation.</P>
            <P>(e) In a “design-build” or “turnkey” contracting situation, in which the recipient lets a master contract to a contractor, who in turn lets subsequent subcontracts for the work of the project, a recipient may establish a goal for the project. The master contractor then establishes contract goals, as appropriate, for the subcontracts it lets. Recipients must maintain oversight of the master contractor's activities to ensure that they are conducted consistent with the requirements of this part.</P>
            <P>(f)(1)(i) You must require that a prime contractor not terminate a DBE subcontractor listed in response to paragraph (b)(2) of this section (or an approved substitute DBE firm) without your prior written consent. This includes, but is not limited to, instances in which a prime contractor seeks to perform work originally designated for a DBE subcontractor with its own forces or those of an affiliate, a non-DBE firm, or with another DBE firm.</P>
            <P>(ii) You must include in each prime contract a provision stating:</P>
            <P>(A) That the contractor shall utilize the specific DBEs listed to perform the work and supply the materials for which each is listed unless the contractor obtains your written consent as provided in this paragraph (f); and</P>
            <P>(B) That, unless your consent is provided under this paragraph (f), the contractor shall not be entitled to any payment for work or material unless it is performed or supplied by the listed DBE.</P>
            <P>(2) You may provide such written consent only if you agree, for reasons stated in your concurrence document, that the prime contractor has good cause to terminate the DBE firm.</P>
            <P>(3) For purposes of this paragraph, good cause includes the following circumstances:</P>
            <P>(i) The listed DBE subcontractor fails or refuses to execute a written contract;</P>
            <P>(ii) The listed DBE subcontractor fails or refuses to perform the work of its subcontract in a way consistent with normal industry standards. Provided, however, that good cause does not exist if the failure or refusal of the DBE subcontractor to perform its work on the subcontract results from the bad faith or discriminatory action of the prime contracor;</P>
            <P>(iii) The listed DBE subcontractor fails or refuses to meet the prime contractor's reasonable, nondiscriminatory bond requirements.</P>
            <P>(iv) The listed DBE subcontractor becomes bankrupt, insolvent, or exhibits credit unworthiness;</P>
            <P>(v) The listed DBE subcontractor is ineligible to work on public works projects because of suspension and debarment proceedings pursuant 2 CFR Parts 180, 215 and 1,200 or applicable state law;</P>
            <P>(vii) You have determined that the listed DBE subcontractor is not a responsible contractor;</P>
            <P>(vi) The listed DBE subcontractor voluntarily withdraws from the project and provides to you written notice of its withdrawal;</P>
            <P>(vii) The listed DBE is ineligible to receive DBE credit for the type of work required;</P>

            <P>(viii) A DBE owner dies or becomes disabled with the result that the listed DBE contractor is unable to complete its work on the contract;<PRTPAGE P="266"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ix) Other documented good cause that you determine compels the termination of the DBE subcontractor. Provided, that good cause does not exist if the prime contractor seeks to terminate a DBE it relied upon to obtain the contract so that the prime contractor can self-perform the work for which the DBE contractor was engaged or so that the prime contractor can substitute another DBE or non-DBE contractor after contract award.</P>
            <P>(4) Before transmitting to you its request to terminate and/or substitute a DBE subcontractor, the prime contractor must give notice in writing to the DBE subcontractor, with a copy to you, of its intent to request to terminate and/or substitute, and the reason for the request.</P>

            <P>(5) The prime contractor must give the DBE five days to respond to the prime contractor's notice and advise you and the contractor of the reasons, if any, why it objects to the proposed termination of its subcontract and why you should not approve the prime contractor's action. If required in a particular case as a matter of public necessity (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> safety), you may provide a response period shorter than five days.</P>
            <P>(6) In addition to post-award terminations, the provisions of this section apply to preaward deletions of or substitutions for DBE firms put forward by offerors in negotiated procurements.</P>
            <P>(g) When a DBE subcontractor is terminated as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, or fails to complete its work on the contract for any reason, you must require the prime contractor to make good faith efforts to find another DBE subcontractor to substitute for the original DBE. These good faith efforts shall be directed at finding another DBE to perform at least the same amount of work under the contract as the DBE that was terminated, to the extent needed to meet the contract goal you established for the procurement. The good faith efforts shall be documented by the contractor. If the recipient requests documentation under this provision, the contractor shall submit the documentation within 7 days, which may be extended for an additional 7 days if necessary at the request of the contractor, and the recipient shall provide a written determination to the contractor stating whether or not good faith efforts have been demonstrated.</P>
            <P>(h) You must include in each prime contract the contract clause required by § 26.13(b) stating that failure by the contractor to carry out the requirements of this part is a material breach of the contract and may result in the termination of the contract or such other remedies set forth in that section you deem appropriate if the prime contractor fails to comply with the requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(i) You must apply the requirements of this section to DBE bidders/offerors for prime contracts. In determining whether a DBE bidder/offeror for a prime contract has met a contract goal, you count the work the DBE has committed to performing with its own forces as well as the work that it has committed to be performed by DBE subcontractors and DBE suppliers.</P>
            <P>(j) You must require the contractor awarded the contract to make available upon request a copy of all DBE subcontracts. The subcontractor shall ensure that all subcontracts or an agreement with DBEs to supply labor or materials require that the subcontract and all lower tier subcontractors be performed in accordance with this part's provisions.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 26.55</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How is DBE participation counted toward goals?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) When a DBE participates in a contract, you count only the value of the work actually performed by the DBE toward DBE goals.</P>
            <P>(1) Count the entire amount of that portion of a construction contract (or other contract not covered by paragraph (a)(2) of this section) that is performed by the DBE's own forces. Include the cost of supplies and materials obtained by the DBE for the work of the contract, including supplies purchased or equipment leased by the DBE (except supplies and equipment the DBE subcontractor purchases or leases from the prime contractor or its affiliate).</P>

            <P>(2) Count the entire amount of fees or commissions charged by a DBE firm for providing a bona fide service, such as <PRTPAGE P="267"/>professional, technical, consultant, or managerial services, or for providing bonds or insurance specifically required for the performance of a DOT-assisted contract, toward DBE goals, provided you determine the fee to be reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services.</P>
            <P>(3) When a DBE subcontracts part of the work of its contract to another firm, the value of the subcontracted work may be counted toward DBE goals only if the DBE's subcontractor is itself a DBE. Work that a DBE subcontracts to a non-DBE firm does not count toward DBE goals.</P>
            <P>(b) When a DBE performs as a participant in a joint venture, count a portion of the total dollar value of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the contract that the DBE performs with its own forces toward DBE goals.</P>
            <P>(c) Count expenditures to a DBE contractor toward DBE goals only if the DBE is performing a commercially useful function on that contract.</P>
            <P>(1) A DBE performs a commercially useful function when it is responsible for execution of the work of the contract and is carrying out its responsibilities by actually performing, managing, and supervising the work involved. To perform a commercially useful function, the DBE must also be responsible, with respect to materials and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining quality and quantity, ordering the material, and installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself. To determine whether a DBE is performing a commercially useful function, you must evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices, whether the amount the firm is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing and the DBE credit claimed for its performance of the work, and other relevant factors.</P>
            <P>(2) A DBE does not perform a commercially useful function if its role is limited to that of an extra participant in a transaction, contract, or project through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of DBE participation. In determining whether a DBE is such an extra participant, you must examine similar transactions, particularly those in which DBEs do not participate.</P>
            <P>(3) If a DBE does not perform or exercise responsibility for at least 30 percent of the total cost of its contract with its own work force, or the DBE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a contract than would be expected on the basis of normal industry practice for the type of work involved, you must presume that it is not performing a commercially useful function.</P>
            <P>(4) When a DBE is presumed not to be performing a commercially useful function as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the DBE may present evidence to rebut this presumption. You may determine that the firm is performing a commercially useful function given the type of work involved and normal industry practices.</P>
            <P>(5) Your decisions on commercially useful function matters are subject to review by the concerned operating administration, but are not administratively appealable to DOT.</P>
            <P>(d) Use the following factors in determining whether a DBE trucking company is performing a commercially useful function:</P>
            <P>(1) The DBE must be responsible for the management and supervision of the entire trucking operation for which it is responsible on a particular contract, and there cannot be a contrived arrangement for the purpose of meeting DBE goals.</P>
            <P>(2) The DBE must itself own and operate at least one fully licensed, insured, and operational truck used on the contract.</P>
            <P>(3) The DBE receives credit for the total value of the transportation services it provides on the contract using trucks it owns, insures, and operates using drivers it employs.</P>
            <P>(4) The DBE may lease trucks from another DBE firm, including an owner-operator who is certified as a DBE. The DBE who leases trucks from another DBE receives credit for the total value of the transportation services the lessee DBE provides on the contract.</P>

            <P>(5) The DBE may also lease trucks from a non-DBE firm, including from an owner-operator. The DBE that leases trucks equipped with drivers <PRTPAGE P="268"/>from a non-DBE is entitled to credit for the total value of transportation services provided by non-DBE leased trucks equipped with drivers not to exceed the value of transportation services on the contract provided by DBE-owned trucks or leased trucks with DBE employee drivers. Additional participation by non-DBE owned trucks equipped with drivers receives credit only for the fee or commission it receives as a result of the lease arrangement. If a recipient chooses this approach, it must obtain written consent from the appropriate DOT operating administration.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example to paragraph (d)(5):</HD>
              <P>DBE Firm X uses two of its own trucks on a contract. It leases two trucks from DBE Firm Y and six trucks equipped with drivers from non-DBE Firm Z. DBE credit would be awarded for the total value of transportation services provided by Firm X and Firm Y, and may also be awarded for the total value of transportation services provided by four of the six trucks provided by Firm Z. In all, full credit would be allowed for the participation of eight trucks. DBE credit could be awarded only for the fees or commissions pertaining to the remaining trucks Firm X receives as a result of the lease with Firm Z.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            

            <P>(6) The DBE may lease trucks without drivers from a non-DBE truck leasing company. If the DBE leases trucks from a non-DBE truck leasing company and uses its own employees as drivers, it is entitled to credit for the total value of these hauling services.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example to paragraph (d)(6):</HD>
              <P>DBE Firm X uses two of its own trucks on a contract. It leases two additional trucks from non-DBE Firm Z. Firm X uses its own employees to drive the trucks leased from Firm Z. DBE credit would be awarded for the total value of the transportation services provided by all four trucks.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>(7) For purposes of this paragraph (d), a lease must indicate that the DBE has exclusive use of and control over the truck. This does not preclude the leased truck from working for others during the term of the lease with the consent of the DBE, so long as the lease gives the DBE absolute priority for use of the leased truck. Leased trucks must display the name and identification number of the DBE.</P>
            <P>(e) Count expenditures with DBEs for materials or supplies toward DBE goals as provided in the following:</P>
            <P>(1)(i) If the materials or supplies are obtained from a DBE manufacturer, count 100 percent of the cost of the materials or supplies toward DBE goals.</P>
            <P>(ii) For purposes of this paragraph (e)(1), a manufacturer is a firm that operates or maintains a factory or establishment that produces, on the premises, the materials, supplies, articles, or equipment required under the contract and of the general character described by the specifications.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) If the materials or supplies are purchased from a DBE regular dealer, count 60 percent of the cost of the materials or supplies toward DBE goals.</P>
            <P>(ii) For purposes of this section, a regular dealer is a firm that owns, operates, or maintains a store, warehouse, or other establishment in which the materials, supplies, articles or equipment of the general character described by the specifications and required under the contract are bought, kept in stock, and regularly sold or leased to the public in the usual course of business.</P>
            <P>(A) To be a regular dealer, the firm must be an established, regular business that engages, as its principal business and under its own name, in the purchase and sale or lease of the products in question.</P>
            <P>(B) A person may be a regular dealer in such bulk items as petroleum products, steel, cement, gravel, stone, or asphalt without owning, operating, or maintaining a place of business as provided in this paragraph (e)(2)(ii) if the person both owns and operates distribution equipment for the products. Any supplementing of regular dealers' own distribution equipment shall be by a long-term lease agreement and not on an ad hoc or contract-by-contract basis.</P>
            <P>(C) Packagers, brokers, manufacturers' representatives, or other persons who arrange or expedite transactions are not regular dealers within the meaning of this paragraph (e)(2).</P>

            <P>(3) With respect to materials or supplies purchased from a DBE which is neither a manufacturer nor a regular dealer, count the entire amount of fees or commissions charged for assistance in the procurement of the materials and supplies, or fees or transportation charges for the delivery of materials or <PRTPAGE P="269"/>supplies required on a job site, toward DBE goals, provided you determine the fees to be reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services. Do not count any portion of the cost of the materials and supplies themselves toward DBE goals, however.</P>
            <P>(4) You must determine the amount of credit awarded to a firm for the provisions of materials and supplies (e.g., whether a firm is acting as a regular dealer or a transaction expediter) on a contract-by-contract basis.</P>
            <P>(f) If a firm is not currently certified as a DBE in accordance with the standards of subpart D of this part at the time of the execution of the contract, do not count the firm's participation toward any DBE goals, except as provided for in § 26.87(i)).</P>
            <P>(g) Do not count the dollar value of work performed under a contract with a firm after it has ceased to be certified toward your overall goal.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How are burdens of proof allocated in the certification process?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In determining whether to certify a firm as eligible to participate as a DBE, you must apply the standards of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(b) The firm seeking certification has the burden of demonstrating to you, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it meets the requirements of this subpart concerning group membership or individual disadvantage, business size, ownership, and control.</P>

            <P>(c) You must rebuttably presume that members of the designated groups identified in § 26.67(a) are socially and economically disadvantaged. This means they do not have the burden of proving to you that they are socially and economically disadvantaged. In order to obtain the benefit of the rebuttable presumption, individuals must submit a signed, notarized statement that they are a member of one of the groups in § 26.67(a). Applicants do have the obligation to provide you information concerning their economic disadvantage (<E T="03">see</E> § 26.67).</P>
            <P>(d) Individuals who are not presumed to be socially and economically disadvantaged, and individuals concerning whom the presumption of disadvantage has been rebutted, have the burden of proving to you, by a preponderance of the evidence, that they are socially and economically disadvantaged. (See Appendix E of this part.)</P>
            <P>(e) You must make determinations concerning whether individuals and firms have met their burden of demonstrating group membership, ownership, control, and social and economic disadvantage (where disadvantage must be demonstrated on an individual basis) by considering all the facts in the record, viewed as a whole.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 26.63</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What rules govern group membership determinations?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) If, after reviewing the signed notarized statement of membership in a presumptively disadvantaged group (see § 26.61(c)), you have a well founded reason to question the individual's claim of membership in that group, you must require the individual to present additional evidence that he or she is a member of the group.</P>
            <P>(2) You must provide the individual a written explanation of your reasons for questioning his or her group membership and a written request for additional evidence as outlined in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) In implementing this section, you must take special care to ensure that you do not impose a disproportionate burden on members of any particular designated group. Imposing a disproportionate burden on members of a particular group could violate § 26.7(b) and/or Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 49 CFR part 21.</P>

            <P>(b) In making such a determination, you must consider whether the person has held himself out to be a member of the group over a long period of time prior to application for certification and whether the person is regarded as a <PRTPAGE P="270"/>member of the group by the relevant community. You may require the applicant to produce appropriate documentation of group membership.</P>
            <P>(1) If you determine that an individual claiming to be a member of a group presumed to be disadvantaged is not a member of a designated disadvantaged group, the individual must demonstrate social and economic disadvantage on an individual basis.</P>
            <P>(2) Your decisions concerning membership in a designated group are subject to the certification appeals procedure of § 26.89.</P>

            <P>(a) To be an eligible DBE, a firm (including its affiliates) must be an existing small business, as defined by Small Business Administration (SBA) standards. As a recipient, you must apply current SBA business size standard(s) found in 13 CFR part 121 appropriate to the type(s) of work the firm seeks to perform in DOT-assisted contracts, including the primary industry classification of the applicant.</P>
            <P>(b) Even if it meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a firm is not an eligible DBE in any Federal fiscal year if the firm (including its affiliates) has had average annual gross receipts, as defined by SBA regulations (see 13 CFR 121.402), over the firm's previous three fiscal years, in excess of $23.98 million.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 26.67</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What rules determine social and economic disadvantage?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Presumption of disadvantage.</E> (1) You must rebuttably presume that citizens of the United States (or lawfully admitted permanent residents) who are women, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian-Pacific Americans, Subcontinent Asian Americans, or other minorities found to be disadvantaged by the SBA, are socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. You must require applicants to submit a signed, notarized certification that each presumptively disadvantaged owner is, in fact, socially and economically disadvantaged.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) You must require each individual owner of a firm applying to participate as a DBE, whose ownership and control are relied upon for DBE certification, to certify that he or she has a personal net worth that does not exceed $1.32 million.</P>
            <P>(ii) You must require each individual who makes this certification to support it with a signed, notarized statement of personal net worth, with appropriate supporting documentation. To meet this requirement, you must use the DOT personal net worth form provided in appendix G to this part without change or revision. Where necessary to accurately determine an individual's personal net worth, you may, on a case-by-case basis, require additional financial information from the owner of an applicant firm (e.g., information concerning the assets of the owner's spouse, where needed to clarify whether assets have been transferred to the spouse or when the owner's spouse is involved in the operation of the company). Requests for additional information shall not be unduly burdensome or intrusive.</P>
            <P>(iii) In determining an individual's net worth, you must observe the following requirements:</P>
            <P>(A) Exclude an individual's ownership interest in the applicant firm;</P>
            <P>(B) Exclude the individual's equity in his or her primary residence (except any portion of such equity that is attributable to excessive withdrawals from the applicant firm). The equity is the market value of the residence less any mortgages and home equity loan balances. Recipients must ensure that home equity loan balances are included in the equity calculation and not as a separate liability on the individual's personal net worth form. Exclusions for net worth purposes are not exclusions for asset valuation or access to capital and credit purposes.</P>

            <P>(C) Do not use a contingent liability to reduce an individual's net worth.<PRTPAGE P="271"/>
            </P>
            <P>(D) With respect to assets held in vested pension plans, Individual Retirement Accounts, 401(k) accounts, or other retirement savings or investment programs in which the assets cannot be distributed to the individual at the present time without significant adverse tax or interest consequences, include only the present value of such assets, less the tax and interest penalties that would accrue if the asset were distributed at the present time.</P>
            <P>(iv) Notwithstanding any provision of Federal or State law, you must not release an individual's personal net worth statement nor any documents pertaining to it to any third party without the written consent of the submitter. Provided, that you must transmit this information to DOT in any certification appeal proceeding under § 26.89 of this part or to any other State to which the individual's firm has applied for certification under § 26.85 of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Rebuttal of presumption of disadvantage.</E> (1) An individual's presumption of economic disadvantage may be rebutted in two ways.</P>

            <P>(i) If the statement of personal net worth and supporting documentation that an individual submits under paragraph (a)(2) of this section shows that the individual's personal net worth exceeds $1.32 million, the individual's presumption of economic disadvantage is rebutted. You are not required to have a proceeding under paragraph (b)(2) of this section in order to rebut the presumption of economic disadvantage in this case.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example to paragraph (b)(1)(i):</HD>
              <P>An individual with very high assets and significant liabilities may, in accounting terms, have a PNW of less than $1.32 million. However, the person's assets collectively (e.g., high income level, a very expensive house, a yacht, extensive real or personal property holdings) may lead a reasonable person to conclude that he or she is not economically disadvantaged. The recipient may rebut the individual's presumption of economic disadvantage under these circumstances, as provided in this section, even though the individual's PNW is less than $1.32 million.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>(ii)(A) If the statement of personal net worth and supporting documentation that an individual submits under paragraph (a)(2) of this section demonstrates that the individual is able to accumulate substantial wealth, the individual's presumption of economic disadvantage is rebutted. In making this determination, as a certifying agency, you may consider factors that include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Whether the average adjusted gross income of the owner over the most recent three year period exceeds $350,000;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Whether the income was unusual and not likely to occur in the future;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Whether the earnings were offset by losses;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Whether the income was reinvested in the firm or used to pay taxes arising in the normal course of operations by the firm;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Other evidence that income is not indicative of lack of economic disadvantage; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) Whether the total fair market value of the owner's assets exceed $6 million.</P>
            <P>(B) You must have a proceeding under paragraph (b)(2) of this section in order to rebut the presumption of economic disadvantage in this case.</P>
            <P>(2) If you have a reasonable basis to believe that an individual who is a member of one of the designated groups is not, in fact, socially and/or economically disadvantaged you may, at any time, start a proceeding to determine whether the presumption should be regarded as rebutted with respect to that individual. Your proceeding must follow the procedures of § 26.87.</P>
            <P>(3) In such a proceeding, you have the burden of demonstrating, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the individual is not socially and economically disadvantaged. You may require the individual to produce information relevant to the determination of his or her disadvantage.</P>

            <P>(4) When an individual's presumption of social and/or economic disadvantage has been rebutted, his or her ownership and control of the firm in question cannot be used for purposes of DBE eligibility under this subpart unless and until he or she makes an individual showing of social and/or economic disadvantage. If the basis for rebutting the presumption is a determination that the individual's personal net <PRTPAGE P="272"/>worth exceeds $1.32 million, the individual is no longer eligible for participation in the program and cannot regain eligibility by making an individual showing of disadvantage, so long as his or her PNW remains above that amount.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Transfers within two years.</E> (1) Except as set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, recipients must attribute to an individual claiming disadvantaged status any assets which that individual has transferred to an immediate family member, to a trust a beneficiary of which is an immediate family member, or to the applicant firm for less than fair market value, within two years prior to a concern's application for participation in the DBE program or within two years of recipient's review of the firm's annual affidavit, unless the individual claiming disadvantaged status can demonstrate that the transfer is to or on behalf of an immediate family member for that individual's education, medical expenses, or some other form of essential support.</P>
            <P>(2) Recipients must not attribute to an individual claiming disadvantaged status any assets transferred by that individual to an immediate family member that are consistent with the customary recognition of special occasions, such as birthdays, graduations, anniversaries, and retirements.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Individual determinations of social and economic disadvantage.</E> Firms owned and controlled by individuals who are not presumed to be socially and economically disadvantaged (including individuals whose presumed disadvantage has been rebutted) may apply for DBE certification. You must make a case-by-case determination of whether each individual whose ownership and control are relied upon for DBE certification is socially and economically disadvantaged. In such a proceeding, the applicant firm has the burden of demonstrating to you, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the individuals who own and control it are socially and economically disadvantaged. An individual whose personal net worth exceeds $1.32 million shall not be deemed to be economically disadvantaged. In making these determinations, use the guidance found in Appendix E of this part. You must require that applicants provide sufficient information to permit determinations under the guidance of appendix E of this part.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 26.69</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What rules govern determinations of ownership?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In determining whether the socially and economically disadvantaged participants in a firm own the firm, you must consider all the facts in the record viewed as a whole, including the origin of all assets and how and when they were used in obtaining the firm. All transactions for the establishment and ownership (or transfer of ownership) must be in the normal course of business, reflecting commercial and arms-length practices.</P>
            <P>(b) To be an eligible DBE, a firm must be at least 51 percent owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.</P>
            <P>(1) In the case of a corporation, such individuals must own at least 51 percent of the each class of voting stock outstanding and 51 percent of the aggregate of all stock outstanding.</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of a partnership, 51 percent of each class of partnership interest must be owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Such ownership must be reflected in the firm's partnership agreement.</P>
            <P>(3) In the case of a limited liability company, at least 51 percent of each class of member interest must be owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.</P>

            <P>(c)(1) The firm's ownership by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, including their contribution of capital or expertise to acquire their ownership interests, must be real, substantial, and continuing, going beyond pro forma ownership of the firm as reflected in ownership documents. Proof of contribution of capital should be submitted at the time of the application. When the contribution of capital is through a loan, there must be documentation of the value of assets used as collateral for the loan.
            </P>

            <P>(2) Insufficient contributions include a promise to contribute capital, an unsecured note payable to the firm or an <PRTPAGE P="273"/>owner who is not a disadvantaged individual, mere participation in a firm's activities as an employee, or capitalization not commensurate with the value for the firm.</P>
            <P>(3) The disadvantaged owners must enjoy the customary incidents of ownership, and share in the risks and be entitled to the profits and loss commensurate with their ownership interests, as demonstrated by the substance, not merely the form, of arrangements. Any terms or practices that give a non-disadvantaged individual or firm a priority or superior right to a firm's profits, compared to the disadvantaged owner(s), are grounds for denial.</P>

            <P>(4) Debt instruments from financial institutions or other organizations that lend funds in the normal course of their business do not render a firm ineligible, even if the debtor's ownership interest is security for the loan.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Examples to paragraph (c):</HD>
              <P>(i) An individual pays $100 to acquire a majority interest in a firm worth $1 million. The individual's contribution to capital would not be viewed as substantial.</P>
              <P>(ii) A 51% disadvantaged owner and a non-disadvantaged 49% owner contribute $100 and $10,000, respectively, to acquire a firm grossing $1 million. This may be indicative of a pro forma arrangement that does not meet the requirements of (c)(1).</P>
              <P>(iii) The disadvantaged owner of a DBE applicant firm spends $250 to file articles of incorporation and obtains a $100,000 loan, but makes only nominal or sporadic payments to repay the loan. This type of contribution is not of a continuing nature.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>(d) All securities that constitute ownership of a firm shall be held directly by disadvantaged persons. Except as provided in this paragraph (d), no securities or assets held in trust, or by any guardian for a minor, are considered as held by disadvantaged persons in determining the ownership of a firm. However, securities or assets held in trust are regarded as held by a disadvantaged individual for purposes of determining ownership of the firm, if—</P>
            <P>(1) The beneficial owner of securities or assets held in trust is a disadvantaged individual, and the trustee is the same or another such individual; or</P>
            <P>(2) The beneficial owner of a trust is a disadvantaged individual who, rather than the trustee, exercises effective control over the management, policy-making, and daily operational activities of the firm. Assets held in a revocable living trust may be counted only in the situation where the same disadvantaged individual is the sole grantor, beneficiary, and trustee.</P>
            <P>(e) The contributions of capital or expertise by the socially and economically disadvantaged owners to acquire their ownership interests must be real and substantial. Examples of insufficient contributions include a promise to contribute capital, an unsecured note payable to the firm or an owner who is not a disadvantaged individual, or mere participation in a firm's activities as an employee. Debt instruments from financial institutions or other organizations that lend funds in the normal course of their business do not render a firm ineligible, even if the debtor's ownership interest is security for the loan.</P>
            <P>(f) The following requirements apply to situations in which expertise is relied upon as part of a disadvantaged owner's contribution to acquire ownership:</P>
            <P>(1) The owner's expertise must be—</P>
            <P>(i) In a specialized field;</P>
            <P>(ii) Of outstanding quality;</P>
            <P>(iii) In areas critical to the firm's operations;</P>
            <P>(iv) Indispensable to the firm's potential success;</P>
            <P>(v) Specific to the type of work the firm performs; and</P>
            <P>(vi) Documented in the records of the firm. These records must clearly show the contribution of expertise and its value to the firm.</P>
            <P>(2) The individual whose expertise is relied upon must have a significant financial investment in the firm.</P>
            <P>(g) You must always deem as held by a socially and economically disadvantaged individual, for purposes of determining ownership, all interests in a business or other assets obtained by the individual—</P>
            <P>(1) As the result of a final property settlement or court order in a divorce or legal separation, provided that no term or condition of the agreement or divorce decree is inconsistent with this section; or</P>

            <P>(2) Through inheritance, or otherwise because of the death of the former owner.<PRTPAGE P="274"/>
            </P>
            <P>(h)(1) You must presume as not being held by a socially and economically disadvantaged individual, for purposes of determining ownership, all interests in a business or other assets obtained by the individual as the result of a gift, or transfer without adequate consideration, from any non-disadvantaged individual or non-DBE firm who is—</P>
            <P>(i) Involved in the same firm for which the individual is seeking certification, or an affiliate of that firm;</P>
            <P>(ii) Involved in the same or a similar line of business; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Engaged in an ongoing business relationship with the firm, or an affiliate of the firm, for which the individual is seeking certification.</P>
            <P>(2) To overcome this presumption and permit the interests or assets to be counted, the disadvantaged individual must demonstrate to you, by clear and convincing evidence, that—</P>
            <P>(i) The gift or transfer to the disadvantaged individual was made for reasons other than obtaining certification as a DBE; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The disadvantaged individual actually controls the management, policy, and operations of the firm, notwithstanding the continuing participation of a non-disadvantaged individual who provided the gift or transfer.</P>
            <P>(i) You must apply the following rules in situations in which marital assets form a basis for ownership of a firm:</P>
            <P>(1) When marital assets (other than the assets of the business in question), held jointly or as community property by both spouses, are used to acquire the ownership interest asserted by one spouse, you must deem the ownership interest in the firm to have been acquired by that spouse with his or her own individual resources, provided that the other spouse irrevocably renounces and transfers all rights in the ownership interest in the manner sanctioned by the laws of the state in which either spouse or the firm is domiciled. You do not count a greater portion of joint or community property assets toward ownership than state law would recognize as belonging to the socially and economically disadvantaged owner of the applicant firm.</P>
            <P>(2) A copy of the document legally transferring and renouncing the other spouse's rights in the jointly owned or community assets used to acquire an ownership interest in the firm must be included as part of the firm's application for DBE certification.</P>
            <P>(j) You may consider the following factors in determining the ownership of a firm. However, you must not regard a contribution of capital as failing to be real and substantial, or find a firm ineligible, solely because—</P>
            <P>(1) A socially and economically disadvantaged individual acquired his or her ownership interest as the result of a gift, or transfer without adequate consideration, other than the types set forth in paragraph (h) of this section;</P>
            <P>(2) There is a provision for the co-signature of a spouse who is not a socially and economically disadvantaged individual on financing agreements, contracts for the purchase or sale of real or personal property, bank signature cards, or other documents; or</P>
            <P>(3) Ownership of the firm in question or its assets is transferred for adequate consideration from a spouse who is not a socially and economically disadvantaged individual to a spouse who is such an individual. In this case, you must give particularly close and careful scrutiny to the ownership and control of a firm to ensure that it is owned and controlled, in substance as well as in form, by a socially and economically disadvantaged individual.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 26.71</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What rules govern determinations concerning control?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In determining whether socially and economically disadvantaged owners control a firm, you must consider all the facts in the record, viewed as a whole.</P>
            <P>(b) Only an independent business may be certified as a DBE. An independent business is one the viability of which does not depend on its relationship with another firm or firms.</P>

            <P>(1) In determining whether a potential DBE is an independent business, you must scrutinize relationships with non-DBE firms, in such areas as personnel, facilities, equipment, financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.<PRTPAGE P="275"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) You must consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the disadvantaged owner(s) of the potential DBE and non-DBE firms or persons associated with non-DBE firms compromise the independence of the potential DBE firm.</P>
            <P>(3) You must examine the firm's relationships with prime contractors to determine whether a pattern of exclusive or primary dealings with a prime contractor compromises the independence of the potential DBE firm.</P>
            <P>(4) In considering factors related to the independence of a potential DBE firm, you must consider the consistency of relationships between the potential DBE and non-DBE firms with normal industry practice.</P>
            <P>(c) A DBE firm must not be subject to any formal or informal restrictions which limit the customary discretion of the socially and economically disadvantaged owners. There can be no restrictions through corporate charter provisions, by-law provisions, contracts or any other formal or informal devices (e.g., cumulative voting rights, voting powers attached to different classes of stock, employment contracts, requirements for concurrence by non-disadvantaged partners, conditions precedent or subsequent, executory agreements, voting trusts, restrictions on or assignments of voting rights) that prevent the socially and economically disadvantaged owners, without the cooperation or vote of any non-disadvantaged individual, from making any business decision of the firm. This paragraph does not preclude a spousal co-signature on documents as provided for in § 26.69(j)(2).</P>
            <P>(d) The socially and economically disadvantaged owners must possess the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the firm and to make day-to-day as well as long-term decisions on matters of management, policy and operations.</P>
            <P>(1) A disadvantaged owner must hold the highest officer position in the company (e.g., chief executive officer or president).</P>
            <P>(2) In a corporation, disadvantaged owners must control the board of directors.</P>
            <P>(3) In a partnership, one or more disadvantaged owners must serve as general partners, with control over all partnership decisions.</P>
            <P>(e) Individuals who are not socially and economically disadvantaged or immediate family members may be involved in a DBE firm as owners, managers, employees, stockholders, officers, and/or directors. Such individuals must not, however possess or exercise the power to control the firm, or be disproportionately responsible for the operation of the firm.</P>
            <P>(f) The socially and economically disadvantaged owners of the firm may delegate various areas of the management, policymaking, or daily operations of the firm to other participants in the firm, regardless of whether these participants are socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Such delegations of authority must be revocable, and the socially and economically disadvantaged owners must retain the power to hire and fire any person to whom such authority is delegated. The managerial role of the socially and economically disadvantaged owners in the firm's overall affairs must be such that the recipient can reasonably conclude that the socially and economically disadvantaged owners actually exercise control over the firm's operations, management, and policy.</P>

            <P>(g) The socially and economically disadvantaged owners must have an overall understanding of, and managerial and technical competence and experience directly related to, the type of business in which the firm is engaged and the firm's operations. The socially and economically disadvantaged owners are not required to have experience or expertise in every critical area of the firm's operations, or to have greater experience or expertise in a given field than managers or key employees. The socially and economically disadvantaged owners must have the ability to intelligently and critically evaluate information presented by other participants in the firm's activities and to use this information to make independent decisions concerning the firm's daily operations, management, and policymaking. Generally, <PRTPAGE P="276"/>expertise limited to office management, administration, or bookkeeping functions unrelated to the principal business activities of the firm is insufficient to demonstrate control.</P>
            <P>(h) If state or local law requires the persons to have a particular license or other credential in order to own and/or control a certain type of firm, then the socially and economically disadvantaged persons who own and control a potential DBE firm of that type must possess the required license or credential. If state or local law does not require such a person to have such a license or credential to own and/or control a firm, you must not deny certification solely on the ground that the person lacks the license or credential. However, you may take into account the absence of the license or credential as one factor in determining whether the socially and economically disadvantaged owners actually control the firm.</P>
            <P>(i)(1) You may consider differences in remuneration between the socially and economically disadvantaged owners and other participants in the firm in determining whether to certify a firm as a DBE. Such consideration shall be in the context of the duties of the persons involved, normal industry practices, the firm's policy and practice concerning reinvestment of income, and any other explanations for the differences proffered by the firm. You may determine that a firm is controlled by its socially and economically disadvantaged owner although that owner's remuneration is lower than that of some other participants in the firm.</P>
            <P>(2) In a case where a non-disadvantaged individual formerly controlled the firm, and a socially and economically disadvantaged individual now controls it, you may consider a difference between the remuneration of the former and current controller of the firm as a factor in determining who controls the firm, particularly when the non-disadvantaged individual remains involved with the firm and continues to receive greater compensation than the disadvantaged individual.</P>
            <P>(j) In order to be viewed as controlling a firm, a socially and economically disadvantaged owner cannot engage in outside employment or other business interests that conflict with the management of the firm or prevent the individual from devoting sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the firm to control its activities. For example, absentee ownership of a business and part-time work in a full-time firm are not viewed as constituting control. However, an individual could be viewed as controlling a part-time business that operates only on evenings and/or weekends, if the individual controls it all the time it is operating.</P>
            <P>(k)(1) A socially and economically disadvantaged individual may control a firm even though one or more of the individual's immediate family members (who themselves are not socially and economically disadvantaged individuals) participate in the firm as a manager, employee, owner, or in another capacity. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, you must make a judgment about the control the socially and economically disadvantaged owner exercises vis-a-vis other persons involved in the business as you do in other situations, without regard to whether or not the other persons are immediate family members.</P>
            <P>(2) If you cannot determine that the socially and economically disadvantaged owners—as distinct from the family as a whole—control the firm, then the socially and economically disadvantaged owners have failed to carry their burden of proof concerning control, even though they may participate significantly in the firm's activities.</P>
            <P>(l) Where a firm was formerly owned and/or controlled by a non-disadvantaged individual (whether or not an immediate family member), ownership and/or control were transferred to a socially and economically disadvantaged individual, and the nondisadvantaged individual remains involved with the firm in any capacity, there is a rebuttable presumption of control by the non-disadvantaged individual unless the disadvantaged individual now owning the firm demonstrates to you, by clear and convincing evidence, that:</P>

            <P>(1) The transfer of ownership and/or control to the disadvantaged individual was made for reasons other than obtaining certification as a DBE; and<PRTPAGE P="277"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) The disadvantaged individual actually controls the management, policy, and operations of the firm, notwithstanding the continuing participation of a nondisadvantaged individual who formerly owned and/or controlled the firm.</P>
            <P>(m) In determining whether a firm is controlled by its socially and economically disadvantaged owners, you may consider whether the firm owns equipment necessary to perform its work. However, you must not determine that a firm is not controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals solely because the firm leases, rather than owns, such equipment, where leasing equipment is a normal industry practice and the lease does not involve a relationship with a prime contractor or other party that compromises the independence of the firm.</P>
            <P>(n) You must grant certification to a firm only for specific types of work in which the socially and economically disadvantaged owners have the ability to control the firm. To become certified in an additional type of work, the firm need demonstrate to you only that its socially and economically disadvantaged owners are able to control the firm with respect to that type of work. You must not require that the firm be recertified or submit a new application for certification, but you must verify the disadvantaged owner's control of the firm in the additional type of work.</P>
            <P>(1) The types of work a firm can perform (whether on initial certification or when a new type of work is added) must be described in terms of the most specific available NAICS code for that type of work. If you choose, you may also, in addition to applying the appropriate NAICS code, apply a descriptor from a classification scheme of equivalent detail and specificity. A correct NAICS code is one that describes, as specifically as possible, the principal goods or services which the firm would provide to DOT recipients. Multiple NAICS codes may be assigned where appropriate. Program participants must rely on, and not depart from, the plain meaning of NAICS code descriptions in determining the scope of a firm's certification. If your Directory does not list types of work for any firm in a manner consistent with this paragraph (a)(1), you must update the Directory entry for that firm to meet the requirements of this paragraph (a)(1) by August 28, 2011.</P>
            <P>(2) Firms and recipients must check carefully to make sure that the NAICS codes cited in a certification are kept up-to-date and accurately reflect work which the UCP has determined the firm's owners can control. The firm bears the burden of providing detailed company information the certifying agency needs to make an appropriate NAICS code designation.</P>
            <P>(3) If a firm believes that there is not a NAICS code that fully or clearly describes the type(s) of work in which it is seeking to be certified as a DBE, the firm may request that the certifying agency, in its certification documentation, supplement the assigned NAICS code(s) with a clear, specific, and detailed narrative description of the type of work in which the firm is certified. A vague, general, or confusing description is not sufficient for this purpose, and recipients should not rely on such a description in determining whether a firm's participation can be counted toward DBE goals.</P>
            <P>(4) A certifier is not precluded from changing a certification classification or description if there is a factual basis in the record. However, certifiers must not make after-the-fact statements about the scope of a certification, not supported by evidence in the record of the certification action.</P>

            <P>(o) A business operating under a franchise or license agreement may be certified if it meets the standards in this subpart and the franchiser or licenser is not affiliated with the franchisee or licensee. In determining whether affiliation exists, you should generally not consider the restraints relating to standardized quality, advertising, accounting format, and other provisions imposed on the franchisee or licensee by the franchise agreement or license, provided that the franchisee or licensee has the right to profit from its efforts and bears the risk of loss commensurate with ownership. Alternatively, even though a franchisee or licensee may not be controlled by virtue of such provisions in the franchise agreement or license, affiliation could arise <PRTPAGE P="278"/>through other means, such as common management or excessive restrictions on the sale or transfer of the franchise interest or license.</P>
            <P>(p) In order for a partnership to be controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, any non-disadvantaged partners must not have the power, without the specific written concurrence of the socially and economically disadvantaged partner(s), to contractually bind the partnership or subject the partnership to contract or tort liability.</P>
            <P>(q) The socially and economically disadvantaged individuals controlling a firm may use an employee leasing company. The use of such a company does not preclude the socially and economically disadvantaged individuals from controlling their firm if they continue to maintain an employer-employee relationship with the leased employees. This includes being responsible for hiring, firing, training, assigning, and otherwise controlling the on-the-job activities of the employees, as well as ultimate responsibility for wage and tax obligations related to the employees.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 26.73</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What are other rules affecting certification?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) Consideration of whether a firm performs a commercially useful function or is a regular dealer pertains solely to counting toward DBE goals the participation of firms that have already been certified as DBEs. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, you must not consider commercially useful function issues in any way in making decisions about whether to certify a firm as a DBE.</P>
            <P>(2) You may consider, in making certification decisions, whether a firm has exhibited a pattern of conduct indicating its involvement in attempts to evade or subvert the intent or requirements of the DBE program.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) You must evaluate the eligibility of a firm on the basis of present circumstances. You must not refuse to certify a firm based solely on historical information indicating a lack of ownership or control of the firm by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals at some time in the past, if the firm currently meets the ownership and control standards of this part.</P>
            <P>(2) You must not refuse to certify a firm solely on the basis that it is a newly formed firm, has not completed projects or contracts at the time of its application, has not yet realized profits from its activities, or has not demonstrated a potential for success. If the firm meets disadvantaged, size, ownership, and control requirements of this Part, the firm is eligible for certification.</P>
            <P>(c) DBE firms and firms seeking DBE certification shall cooperate fully with your requests (and DOT requests) for information relevant to the certification process. Failure or refusal to provide such information is a ground for a denial or removal of certification.</P>
            <P>(d) Only firms organized for profit may be eligible DBEs. Not-for-profit organizations, even though controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, are not eligible to be certified as DBEs.</P>
            <P>(e) An eligible DBE firm must be owned by individuals who are socially and economically disadvantaged. Except as provided in this paragraph, a firm that is not owned by such individuals, but instead is owned by another firm—even a DBE firm—cannot be an eligible DBE.</P>
            <P>(1) If socially and economically disadvantaged individuals own and control a firm through a parent or holding company, established for tax, capitalization or other purposes consistent with industry practice, and the parent or holding company in turn owns and controls an operating subsidiary, you may certify the subsidiary if it otherwise meets all requirements of this subpart. In this situation, the individual owners and controllers of the parent or holding company are deemed to control the subsidiary through the parent or holding company.</P>

            <P>(2) You may certify such a subsidiary only if there is cumulatively 51 percent ownership of the subsidiary by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. The following examples illustrate how this cumulative ownership provision works:
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1:</HD>

              <P>Socially and economically disadvantaged individuals own 100 percent of a <PRTPAGE P="279"/>holding company, which has a wholly-owned subsidiary. The subsidiary may be certified, if it meets all other requirements.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2:</HD>
              <P>Disadvantaged individuals own 100 percent of the holding company, which owns 51 percent of a subsidiary. The subsidiary may be certified, if all other requirements are met.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 3:</HD>
              <P>Disadvantaged individuals own 80 percent of the holding company, which in turn owns 70 percent of a subsidiary. In this case, the cumulative ownership of the subsidiary by disadvantaged individuals is 56 percent (80 percent of the 70 percent). This is more than 51 percent, so you may certify the subsidiary, if all other requirements are met.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 4:</HD>
              <P>Same as Example 2 or 3, but someone other than the socially and economically disadvantaged owners of the parent or holding company controls the subsidiary. Even though the subsidiary is owned by disadvantaged individuals, through the holding or parent company, you cannot certify it because it fails to meet control requirements.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 5:</HD>
              <P>Disadvantaged individuals own 60 percent of the holding company, which in turn owns 51 percent of a subsidiary. In this case, the cumulative ownership of the subsidiary by disadvantaged individuals is about 31 percent. This is less than 51 percent, so you cannot certify the subsidiary.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 6:</HD>
              <P>The holding company, in addition to the subsidiary seeking certification, owns several other companies. The combined gross receipts of the holding companies and its subsidiaries are greater than the size standard for the subsidiary seeking certification and/or the gross receipts cap of § 26.65(b). Under the rules concerning affiliation, the subsidiary fails to meet the size standard and cannot be certified.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>(f) Recognition of a business as a separate entity for tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a firm is an independent business, owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.</P>
            <P>(g) You must not require a DBE firm to be prequalified as a condition for certification.</P>
            <P>(h) A firm that is owned by an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization, rather than by Indians or Native Hawaiians as individuals, may be eligible for certification. Such a firm must meet the size standards of § 26.65. Such a firm must be controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, as provided in § 26.71.</P>
            <P>(i) The following special rules apply to the certification of firms related to Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs).</P>
            <P>(1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, a direct or indirect subsidiary corporation, joint venture, or partnership entity of an ANC is eligible for certification as a DBE if it meets all of the following requirements:</P>
            <P>(i) The Settlement Common Stock of the underlying ANC and other stock of the ANC held by holders of the Settlement Common Stock and by Natives and descendents of Natives represents a majority of both the total equity of the ANC and the total voting power of the corporation for purposes of electing directors;</P>
            <P>(ii) The shares of stock or other units of common ownership interest in the subsidiary, joint venture, or partnership entity held by the ANC and by holders of its Settlement Common Stock represent a majority of both the total equity of the entity and the total voting power of the entity for the purpose of electing directors, the general partner, or principal officers; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The subsidiary, joint venture, or partnership entity has been certified by the Small Business Administration under the 8(a) or small disadvantaged business program.</P>

            <P>(2) As a recipient to whom an ANC-related entity applies for certification, you do not use the DOT uniform application form (<E T="03">see</E> Appendix F of this part). You must obtain from the firm documentation sufficient to demonstrate that entity meets the requirements of paragraph (i)(1) of this section. You must also obtain sufficient information about the firm to allow you to administer your program (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> information that would appear in your DBE Directory).</P>
            <P>(3) If an ANC-related firm does not meet all the conditions of paragraph (i)(1) of this section, then it must meet the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section in order to be certified, on the same basis as firms owned by Indian Tribes or Native Hawaiian Organizations.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 26.81</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What are the requirements for Unified Certification Programs?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) You and all other DOT recipients in your state must participate in a Unified Certification Program (UCP).</P>
            <P>(1) Within three years of March 4, 1999, you and the other recipients in your state must sign an agreement establishing the UCP for that state and submit the agreement to the Secretary for approval. The Secretary may, on the basis of extenuating circumstances shown by the recipients in the state, extend this deadline for no more than one additional year.</P>
            <P>(2) The agreement must provide for the establishment of a UCP meeting all the requirements of this section. The agreement must specify that the UCP will follow all certification procedures and standards of this part, on the same basis as recipients; that the UCP shall cooperate fully with oversight, review, and monitoring activities of DOT and its operating administrations; and that the UCP shall implement DOT directives and guidance concerning certification matters. The agreement shall also commit recipients to ensuring that the UCP has sufficient resources and expertise to carry out the requirements of this part. The agreement shall include an implementation schedule ensuring that the UCP is fully operational no later than 18 months following the approval of the agreement by the Secretary.</P>
            <P>(3) Subject to approval by the Secretary, the UCP in each state may take any form acceptable to the recipients in that state.</P>
            <P>(4) The Secretary shall review the UCP and approve it, disapprove it, or remand it to the recipients in the state for revisions. A complete agreement which is not disapproved or remanded within 180 days of its receipt is deemed to be accepted.</P>
            <P>(5) If you and the other recipients in your state fail to meet the deadlines set forth in this paragraph (a), you shall have the opportunity to make an explanation to the Secretary why a deadline could not be met and why meeting the deadline was beyond your control. If you fail to make such an explanation, or the explanation does not justify the failure to meet the deadline, the Secretary shall direct you to complete the required action by a date certain. If you and the other recipients fail to carry out this direction in a timely manner, you are collectively in noncompliance with this part.</P>
            <P>(b) The UCP shall make all certification decisions on behalf of all DOT recipients in the state with respect to participation in the DOT DBE Program.</P>
            <P>(1) Certification decisions by the UCP shall be binding on all DOT recipients within the state.</P>
            <P>(2) The UCP shall provide “one-stop shopping” to applicants for certification, such that an applicant is required to apply only once for a DBE certification that will be honored by all recipients in the state.</P>
            <P>(3) All obligations of recipients with respect to certification and nondiscrimination must be carried out by UCPs, and recipients may use only UCPs that comply with the certification and nondiscrimination requirements of this part.</P>
            <P>(c) All certifications by UCPs shall be pre-certifications; i.e., certifications that have been made final before the due date for bids or offers on a contract on which a firm seeks to participate as a DBE.</P>
            <P>(d) A UCP is not required to process an application for certification from a firm having its principal place of business outside the state if the firm is not certified by the UCP in the state in which it maintains its principal place of business. The “home state” UCP shall share its information and documents concerning the firm with other UCPs that are considering the firm's application.</P>
            <P>(e) Subject to DOT approval as provided in this section, the recipients in two or more states may form a regional UCP. UCPs may also enter into written reciprocity agreements with other UCPs. Such an agreement shall outline the specific responsibilities of each participant. A UCP may accept the certification of any other UCP or DOT recipient.</P>

            <P>(f) Pending the establishment of UCPs meeting the requirements of this <PRTPAGE P="281"/>section, you may enter into agreements with other recipients, on a regional or inter-jurisdictional basis, to perform certification functions required by this part.

            <P>(g) Each UCP shall maintain a unified DBE directory containing, for all firms certified by the UCP (including those from other states certified under the provisions of this part), the information required by § 26.31. The UCP shall make the directory available to the public electronically, on the internet, as well as in print. The UCP shall update the electronic version of the directory by including additions, deletions, and other changes as soon as they are made and shall revise the print version of the Directory at least once a year.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What procedures do recipients follow in making certification decisions?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) You must ensure that only firms certified as eligible DBEs under this section participate as DBEs in your program.</P>
            <P>(b) You must determine the eligibility of firms as DBEs consistent with the standards of subpart D of this part. When a UCP is formed, the UCP must meet all the requirements of subpart D of this part and this subpart that recipients are required to meet.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) You must take all the following steps in determining whether a DBE firm meets the standards of subpart D of this part:</P>
            <P>(i) Perform an on-site visit to the firm's principal place of business. You must interview the principal officers and review their résumés and/or work histories. You may interview key personnel of the firm if necessary. You must also perform an on-site visit to job sites if there are such sites on which the firm is working at the time of the eligibility investigation in your jurisdiction or local area. You may rely upon the site visit report of any other recipient with respect to a firm applying for certification;</P>
            <P>(ii) Analyze documentation related to the legal structure, ownership, and control of the applicant firm. This includes, but is not limited to, Articles of Incorporation/Organization; corporate by-laws or operating agreements; organizational, annual and board/member meeting records; stock ledgers and certificates; and State-issued Certificates of Good Standing</P>
            <P>(iii) Analyze the bonding and financial capacity of the firm; lease and loan agreements; bank account signature cards;</P>
            <P>(iv) Determine the work history of the firm, including contracts it has received, work it has completed; and payroll records;</P>
            <P>(v) Obtain a statement from the firm of the type of work it prefers to perform as part of the DBE program and its preferred locations for performing the work, if any.</P>
            <P>(vi) Obtain or compile a list of the equipment owned by or available to the firm and the licenses the firm and its key personnel possess to perform the work it seeks to do as part of the DBE program;</P>
            <P>(vii) Obtain complete Federal income tax returns (or requests for extensions) filed by the firm, its affiliates, and the socially and economically disadvantaged owners for the last 3 years. A complete return includes all forms, schedules, and statements filed with the Internal Revenue Service.</P>
            <P>(viii) Require potential DBEs to complete and submit an appropriate application form, except as otherwise provided in § 26.85 of this part.</P>
            <P>(2) You must use the application form provided in Appendix F to this part without change or revision. However, you may provide in your DBE program, with the written approval of the concerned operating administration, for supplementing the form by requesting specified additional information not inconsistent with this part.</P>

            <P>(3) You must make sure that the applicant attests to the accuracy and truthfulness of the information on the application form. This shall be done either in the form of an affidavit sworn to by the applicant before a person who <PRTPAGE P="282"/>is authorized by State law to administer oaths or in the form of an unsworn declaration executed under penalty of perjury of the laws of the United States.</P>
            <P>(4) You must review all information on the form prior to making a decision about the eligibility of the firm. You may request clarification of information contained in the application at any time in the application process.</P>
            <P>(d) When another recipient, in connection with its consideration of the eligibility of a firm, makes a written request for certification information you have obtained about that firm (e.g., including application materials or the report of a site visit, if you have made one to the firm), you must promptly make the information available to the other recipient.</P>
            <P>(e) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(f) Subject to the approval of the concerned operating administration as part of your DBE program, you may impose a reasonable application fee for certification. Fee waivers shall be made in appropriate cases.</P>
            <P>(g) You must safeguard from disclosure to unauthorized persons information gathered as part of the certification process that may reasonably be regarded as proprietary or other confidential business information, consistent with applicable Federal, state, and local law.</P>
            <P>(h)(1) Once you have certified a DBE, it shall remain certified until and unless you have removed its certification, in whole or in part, through the procedures of § 26.87 of this part, except as provided in § 26.67(b)(1) of this part.</P>
            <P>(2) You may not require DBEs to reapply for certification or undergo a recertification process. However, you may conduct a certification review of a certified DBE firm, including a new on-site review, if appropriate in light of changed circumstances (e.g., of the kind requiring notice under paragraph (i) of this section or relating to suspension of certification under § 26.88), a complaint, or other information concerning the firm's eligibility. If information comes to your attention that leads you to question the firm's eligibility, you may conduct an on-site review on an unannounced basis, at the firm's offices and job sites.</P>
            <P>(i) If you are a DBE, you must inform the recipient or UCP in writing of any change in circumstances affecting your ability to meet size, disadvantaged status, ownership, or control requirements of this part or any material change in the information provided in your application form.</P>
            <P>(1) Changes in management responsibility among members of a limited liability company are covered by this requirement.</P>
            <P>(2) You must attach supporting documentation describing in detail the nature of such changes.</P>
            <P>(3) The notice must take the form of an affidavit sworn to by the applicant before a person who is authorized by state law to administer oaths or of an unsworn declaration executed under penalty of perjury of the laws of the United States. You must provide the written notification within 30 days of the occurrence of the change. If you fail to make timely notification of such a change, you will be deemed to have failed to cooperate under § 26.109(c).</P>

            <P>(j) If you are a DBE, you must provide to the recipient, every year on the anniversary of the date of your certification, an affidavit sworn to by the firm's owners before a person who is authorized by State law to administer oaths or an unsworn declaration executed under penalty of perjury of the laws of the United States. This affidavit must affirm that there have been no changes in the firm's circumstances affecting its ability to meet size, disadvantaged status, ownership, or control requirements of this part or any material changes in the information provided in its application form, except for changes about which you have notified the recipient under paragraph (i) of this section. The affidavit shall specifically affirm that your firm continues to meet SBA business size criteria and the overall gross receipts cap of this part, documenting this affirmation with supporting documentation of your firm's size and gross receipts (e.g., submission of Federal tax returns). If you fail to provide this affidavit in a timely manner, you will be deemed to have failed to cooperate under § 26.109(c).<PRTPAGE P="283"/>
            </P>
            <P>(k) If you are a recipient, you must make decisions on applications for certification within 90 days of receiving from the applicant firm all information required under this part. You may extend this time period once, for no more than an additional 60 days, upon written notice to the firm, explaining fully and specifically the reasons for the extension. You may establish a different time frame in your DBE program, upon a showing that this time frame is not feasible, and subject to the approval of the concerned operating administration. Your failure to make a decision by the applicable deadline under this paragraph is deemed a constructive denial of the application, on the basis of which the firm may appeal to DOT under § 26.89.</P>
            <P>(l) As a recipient or UCP, you must advise each applicant within 30 days from your receipt of the application whether the application is complete and suitable for evaluation and, if not, what additional information or action is required.</P>
            <P>(m) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, if an applicant for DBE certification withdraws its application before you have issued a decision on the application, the applicant can resubmit the application at any time. As a recipient or UCP, you may not apply the waiting period provided under § 26.86(c) of this part before allowing the applicant to resubmit its application. However, you may place the reapplication at the “end of the line,” behind other applications that have been made since the firm's previous application was withdrawn. You may also apply the waiting period provided under § 26.86(c) of this part to a firm that has established a pattern of frequently withdrawing applications before you make a decision.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Interstate certification.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This section applies with respect to any firm that is currently certified in its home state.</P>
            <P>(b) When a firm currently certified in its home state (“State A”) applies to another State (“State B”) for DBE certification, State B may, at its discretion, accept State A's certification and certify the firm, without further procedures.</P>
            <P>(1) To obtain certification in this manner, the firm must provide to State B a copy of its certification notice from State A.</P>
            <P>(2) Before certifying the firm, State B must confirm that the firm has a current valid certification from State A. State B can do so by reviewing State A's electronic directory or obtaining written confirmation from State A.</P>
            <P>(c) In any situation in which State B chooses not to accept State A's certification of a firm as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, as the applicant firm you must provide the information in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section to State B.</P>

            <P>(1) You must provide to State B a complete copy of the application form, all supporting documents, and any other information you have submitted to State A or any other state related to your firm's certification. This includes affidavits of no change (<E T="03">see</E> § 26.83(j)) and any notices of changes (<E T="03">see</E> § 26.83(i)) that you have submitted to State A, as well as any correspondence you have had with State A's UCP or any other recipient concerning your application or status as a DBE firm.</P>
            <P>(2) You must also provide to State B any notices or correspondence from states other than State A relating to your status as an applicant or certified DBE in those states. For example, if you have been denied certification or decertified in State C, or subject to a decertification action there, you must inform State B of this fact and provide all documentation concerning this action to State B.</P>
            <P>(3) If you have filed a certification appeal with DOT (<E T="03">see</E> § 26.89), you must inform State B of the fact and provide your letter of appeal and DOT's response to State B.</P>
            <P>(4) You must submit an affidavit sworn to by the firm's owners before a person who is authorized by State law to administer oaths or an unsworn declaration executed under penalty of perjury of the laws of the United States.</P>

            <P>(i) This affidavit must affirm that you have submitted all the information required by 49 CFR 26.85(c) and the information is complete and, in the case <PRTPAGE P="284"/>of the information required by § 26.85(c)(1), is an identical copy of the information submitted to State A.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the on-site report from State A supporting your certification in State A is more than three years old, as of the date of your application to State B, State B may require that your affidavit also affirm that the facts in the on-site report remain true and correct.</P>
            <P>(d) As State B, when you receive from an applicant firm all the information required by paragraph (c) of this section, you must take the following actions:</P>

            <P>(1) Within seven days contact State A and request a copy of the site visit review report for the firm (<E T="03">see</E> § 26.83(c)(1)), any updates to the site visit review, and any evaluation of the firm based on the site visit. As State A, you must transmit this information to State B within seven days of receiving the request. A pattern by State B of not making such requests in a timely manner or by “State A” or any other State of not complying with such requests in a timely manner is noncompliance with this Part.</P>
            <P>(2) Determine whether there is good cause to believe that State A's certification of the firm is erroneous or should not apply in your State. Reasons for making such a determination may include the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Evidence that State A's certification was obtained by fraud;</P>
            <P>(ii) New information, not available to State A at the time of its certification, showing that the firm does not meet all eligibility criteria;</P>
            <P>(iii) State A's certification was factually erroneous or was inconsistent with the requirements of this part;</P>
            <P>(iv) The State law of State B requires a result different from that of the State law of State A.</P>
            <P>(v) The information provided by the applicant firm did not meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) If, as State B, unless you have determined that there is good cause to believe that State A's certification is erroneous or should not apply in your State, you must, no later than 60 days from the date on which you received from the applicant firm all the information required by paragraph (c) of this section, send to the applicant firm a notice that it is certified and place the firm on your directory of certified firms.</P>
            <P>(4) If, as State B, you have determined that there is good cause to believe that State A's certification is erroneous or should not apply in your State, you must, no later than 60 days from the date on which you received from the applicant firm all the information required by paragraph (c) of this section, send to the applicant firm a notice stating the reasons for your determination.</P>
            <P>(i) This notice must state with particularity the specific reasons why State B believes that the firm does not meet the requirements of this Part for DBE eligibility and must offer the firm an opportunity to respond to State B with respect to these reasons.</P>
            <P>(ii) The firm may elect to respond in writing, to request an in-person meeting with State B's decision maker to discuss State B's objections to the firm's eligibility, or both. If the firm requests a meeting, as State B you must schedule the meeting to take place within 30 days of receiving the firm's request.</P>
            <P>(iii) The firm bears the burden of demonstrating, by a preponderance of evidence, that it meets the requirements of this Part with respect to the particularized issues raised by State B's notice. The firm is not otherwise responsible for further demonstrating its eligibility to State B.</P>
            <P>(iv) The decision maker for State B must be an individual who is thoroughly familiar with the provisions of this Part concerning certification.</P>
            <P>(v) State B must issue a written decision within 30 days of the receipt of the written response from the firm or the meeting with the decision maker, whichever is later.</P>
            <P>(vi) The firm's application for certification is stayed pending the outcome of this process.</P>
            <P>(vii) A decision under this paragraph (d)(4) may be appealed to the Departmental Office of Civil Rights under s§ 26.89 of this part.</P>

            <P>(e) As State B, if you have not received from State A a copy of the site visit review report by a date 14 days after you have made a timely request <PRTPAGE P="285"/>for it, you may hold action required by paragraphs (d)(2) through (4) of this section in abeyance pending receipt of the site visit review report. In this event, you must, no later than 30 days from the date on which you received from an applicant firm all the information required by paragraph (c) of this section, notify the firm in writing of the delay in the process and the reason for it.</P>
            <P>(f)(1) As a UCP, when you deny a firm's application, reject the application of a firm certified in State A or any other State in which the firm is certified, through the procedures of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, or decertify a firm, in whole or in part, you must make an entry in the Department of Transportation Office of Civil Rights' (DOCR's) Ineligibility Determination Online Database. You must enter the following information:</P>
            <P>(i) The name of the firm;</P>
            <P>(ii) The name(s) of the firm's owner(s);</P>
            <P>(iii) The type and date of the action;</P>
            <P>(iv) The reason for the action.</P>
            <P>(2) As a UCP, you must check the DOCR Web site at least once every month to determine whether any firm that is applying to you for certification or that you have already certified is on the list.</P>
            <P>(3) For any such firm that is on the list, you must promptly request a copy of the listed decision from the UCP that made it. As the UCP receiving such a request, you must provide a copy of the decision to the requesting UCP within 7 days of receiving the request. As the UCP receiving the decision, you must then consider the information in the decision in determining what, if any, action to take with respect to the certified DBE firm or applicant.</P>
            <P>(g) You must implement the requirements of this section beginning January 1, 2012.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What rules govern recipients' denials of initial requests for certification?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) When you deny a request by a firm, which is not currently certified with you, to be certified as a DBE, you must provide the firm a written explanation of the reasons for the denial, specifically referencing the evidence in the record that supports each reason for the denial. All documents and other information on which the denial is based must be made available to the applicant, on request.</P>
            <P>(b) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(c) When a firm is denied certification, you must establish a time period of no more than twelve months that must elapse before the firm may reapply to the recipient for certification. You may provide, in your DBE program, subject to approval by the concerned operating administration, a shorter waiting period for reapplication. The time period for reapplication begins to run on the date the explanation required by paragraph (a) of this section is received by the firm. An applicant's appeal of your decision to the Department pursuant to § 26.89 does not extend this period.</P>
            <P>(d) When you make an administratively final denial of certification concerning a firm, the firm may appeal the denial to the Department under § 26.89.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What procedures does a recipient use to remove a DBE's eligibility?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Ineligibility complaints.</E> (1) Any person may file with you a written complaint alleging that a currently-certified firm is ineligible and specifying the alleged reasons why the firm is ineligible. You are not required to accept a general allegation that a firm is ineligible or an anonymous complaint. The complaint may include any information or arguments supporting the complainant's assertion that the firm is ineligible and should not continue to be certified. Confidentiality of complainants' identities must be protected as provided in § 26.109(b).</P>
            <P>(2) You must review your records concerning the firm, any material provided by the firm and the complainant, and other available information. You may request additional information from the firm or conduct any other investigation that you deem necessary.</P>

            <P>(3) If you determine, based on this review, that there is reasonable cause to <PRTPAGE P="286"/>believe that the firm is ineligible, you must provide written notice to the firm that you propose to find the firm ineligible, setting forth the reasons for the proposed determination. If you determine that such reasonable cause does not exist, you must notify the complainant and the firm in writing of this determination and the reasons for it. All statements of reasons for findings on the issue of reasonable cause must specifically reference the evidence in the record on which each reason is based.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Recipient-initiated proceedings.</E> If, based on notification by the firm of a change in its circumstances or other information that comes to your attention, you determine that there is reasonable cause to believe that a currently certified firm is ineligible, you must provide written notice to the firm that you propose to find the firm ineligible, setting forth the reasons for the proposed determination. The statement of reasons for the finding of reasonable cause must specifically reference the evidence in the record on which each reason is based.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">DOT directive to initiate proceeding.</E> (1) If the concerned operating administration determines that information in your certification records, or other information available to the concerned operating administration, provides reasonable cause to believe that a firm you certified does not meet the eligibility criteria of this part, the concerned operating administration may direct you to initiate a proceeding to remove the firm's certification.</P>
            <P>(2) The concerned operating administration must provide you and the firm a notice setting forth the reasons for the directive, including any relevant documentation or other information.</P>
            <P>(3) You must immediately commence and prosecute a proceeding to remove eligibility as provided by paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Hearing.</E> When you notify a firm that there is reasonable cause to remove its eligibility, as provided in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, you must give the firm an opportunity for an informal hearing, at which the firm may respond to the reasons for the proposal to remove its eligibility in person and provide information and arguments concerning why it should remain certified.</P>
            <P>(1) In such a proceeding, you bear the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the firm does not meet the certification standards of this part.</P>
            <P>(2) You must maintain a complete record of the hearing, by any means acceptable under state law for the retention of a verbatim record of an administrative hearing. If there is an appeal to DOT under § 26.89, you must provide a transcript of the hearing to DOT and, on request, to the firm. You must retain the original record of the hearing. You may charge the firm only for the cost of copying the record.</P>
            <P>(3) The firm may elect to present information and arguments in writing, without going to a hearing. In such a situation, you bear the same burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the firm does not meet the certification standards, as you would during a hearing.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Separation of functions.</E> You must ensure that the decision in a proceeding to remove a firm's eligibility is made by an office and personnel that did not take part in actions leading to or seeking to implement the proposal to remove the firm's eligibility and are not subject, with respect to the matter, to direction from the office or personnel who did take part in these actions.</P>
            <P>(1) Your method of implementing this requirement must be made part of your DBE program.</P>
            <P>(2) The decisionmaker must be an individual who is knowledgeable about the certification requirements of your DBE program and this part.</P>

            <P>(3) Before a UCP is operational in its state, a small airport or small transit authority (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, an airport or transit authority serving an area with less than 250,000 population) is required to meet this requirement only to the extent feasible.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Grounds for decision.</E> You may base a decision to remove a firm's eligibility only on one or more of the following grounds:</P>

            <P>(1) Changes in the firm's circumstances since the certification of the firm by the recipient that render <PRTPAGE P="287"/>the firm unable to meet the eligibility standards of this part;</P>
            <P>(2) Information or evidence not available to you at the time the firm was certified;</P>
            <P>(3) Information relevant to eligibility that has been concealed or misrepresented by the firm;</P>
            <P>(4) A change in the certification standards or requirements of the Department since you certified the firm;</P>
            <P>(5) Your decision to certify the firm was clearly erroneous;</P>
            <P>(6) The firm has failed to cooperate with you (see § 26.109(c));</P>
            <P>(7) The firm has exhibited a pattern of conduct indicating its involvement in attempts to subvert the intent or requirements of the DBE program (see § 26.73(a)(2)); or</P>
            <P>(8) The firm has been suspended or debarred for conduct related to the DBE program. The notice required by paragraph (g) of this section must include a copy of the suspension or debarment action. A decision to remove a firm for this reason shall not be subject to the hearing procedures in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Notice of decision.</E> Following your decision, you must provide the firm written notice of the decision and the reasons for it, including specific references to the evidence in the record that supports each reason for the decision. The notice must inform the firm of the consequences of your decision and of the availability of an appeal to the Department of Transportation under § 26.89. You must send copies of the notice to the complainant in an ineligibility complaint or the concerned operating administration that had directed you to initiate the proceeding. Provided that, when sending such a notice to a complainant other than a DOT operating administration, you must not include information reasonably construed as confidential business information without the written consent of the firm that submitted the information.</P>

            <P>(j) <E T="03">Effects of removal of eligibility.</E> When you remove a firm's eligibility, you must take the following action:</P>
            <P>(1) When a prime contractor has made a commitment to using the ineligible firm, or you have made a commitment to using a DBE prime contractor, but a subcontract or contract has not been executed before you issue the decertification notice provided for in paragraph (g) of this section, the ineligible firm does not count toward the contract goal or overall goal. You must direct the prime contractor to meet the contract goal with an eligible DBE firm or demonstrate to you that it has made a good faith effort to do so.</P>
            <P>(2) If a prime contractor has executed a subcontract with the firm before you have notified the firm of its ineligibility, the prime contractor may continue to use the firm on the contract and may continue to receive credit toward its DBE goal for the firm's work. In this case, or in a case where you have let a prime contract to the DBE that was later ruled ineligible, the portion of the ineligible firm's performance of the contract remaining after you issued the notice of its ineligibility shall not count toward your overall goal, but may count toward the contract goal.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Exception:</E> If the DBE's ineligibility is caused solely by its having exceeded the size standard during the performance of the contract, you may continue to count its participation on that contract toward overall and contract goals.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Availability of appeal.</E> When you make an administratively final removal of a firm's eligibility under this section, the firm may appeal the removal to the Department under § 26.89.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Summary suspension of certification.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) A recipient shall immediately suspend a DBE's certification without adhering to the requirements in § 26.87(d) of this part when an individual owner whose ownership and control of the firm are necessary to the <PRTPAGE P="288"/>firm's certification dies or is incarcerated.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) A recipient may immediately suspend a DBE's certification without adhering to the requirements in § 26.87(d) when there is adequate evidence to believe that there has been a material change in circumstances that may affect the eligibility of the DBE firm to remain certified, or when the DBE fails to notify the recipient or UCP in writing of any material change in circumstances as required by § 26.83(i) of this part or fails to timely file an affidavit of no change under § 26.83(j).</P>
            <P>(2) In determining the adequacy of the evidence to issue a suspension under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the recipient shall consider all relevant factors, including how much information is available, the credibility of the information and allegations given the circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result.</P>
            <P>(c) The concerned operating administration may direct the recipient to take action pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) this section if it determines that information available to it is sufficient to warrant immediate suspension.</P>
            <P>(d) When a firm is suspended pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the recipient shall immediately notify the DBE of the suspension by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of the owner(s) of the DBE.</P>
            <P>(e) Suspension is a temporary status of ineligibility pending an expedited show cause hearing/proceeding under § 26.87 of this part to determine whether the DBE is eligible to participate in the program and consequently should be removed. The suspension takes effect when the DBE receives, or is deemed to have received, the Notice of Suspension.</P>
            <P>(f) While suspended, the DBE may not be considered to meet a contract goal on a new contract, and any work it does on a contract received during the suspension shall not be counted toward a recipient's overall goal. The DBE may continue to perform under an existing contract executed before the DBE received a Notice of Suspension and may be counted toward the contract goal during the period of suspension as long as the DBE is performing a commercially useful function under the existing contract.</P>
            <P>(g) Following receipt of the Notice of Suspension, if the DBE believes it is no longer eligible, it may voluntarily withdraw from the program, in which case no further action is required. If the DBE believes that its eligibility should be reinstated, it must provide to the recipient information demonstrating that the firm is eligible notwithstanding its changed circumstances. Within 30 days of receiving this information, the recipient must either lift the suspension and reinstate the firm's certification or commence a decertification action under § 26.87 of this part. If the recipient commences a decertification proceeding, the suspension remains in effect during the proceeding.</P>
            <P>(h) The decision to immediately suspend a DBE under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section is not appealable to the US Department of Transportation. The failure of a recipient to either lift the suspension and reinstate the firm or commence a decertification proceeding, as required by paragraph (g) of this section, is appealable to the U.S. Department of Transportation under § 26.89 of this part, as a constructive decertification.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What is the process for certification appeals to the Department of Transportation?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) If you are a firm that is denied certification or whose eligibility is removed by a recipient, including SBA-certified firms, you may make an administrative appeal to the Department.</P>

            <P>(2) If you are a complainant in an ineligibility complaint to a recipient (including the concerned operating administration in the circumstances provided in § 26.87(c)), you may appeal to the Department if the recipient does not find reasonable cause to propose removing the firm's eligibility or, following a removal of eligibility proceeding, determines that the firm is eligible.<PRTPAGE P="289"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) Send appeals to the following address: U.S. Department of Transportation, Departmental Office of Civil Rights, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20590-0001.</P>
            <P>(b) Pending the Department's decision in the matter, the recipient's decision remains in effect. The Department does not stay the effect of the recipient's decision while it is considering an appeal.</P>
            <P>(c) If you want to file an appeal, you must send a letter to the Department within 90 days of the date of the recipient's final decision, including information and setting forth a full and specific statement as to why the decision is erroneous, what significant fact that the recipient failed to consider, or what provisions of this Part the recipient did not properly apply. The Department may accept an appeal filed later than 90 days after the date of the decision if the Department determines that there was good cause for the late filing of the appeal or in the interest of justice.</P>
            <P>(d) When it receives an appeal, the Department requests a copy of the recipient's complete administrative record in the matter. If you are the recipient, you must provide the administrative record, including a hearing transcript, within 20 days of the Department's request. The Department may extend this time period on the basis of a recipient's showing of good cause. To facilitate the Department's review of a recipient's decision, you must ensure that such administrative records are well organized, indexed, and paginated. Records that do not comport with these requirements are not acceptable and will be returned to you to be corrected immediately. If an appeal is brought concerning one recipient's certification decision concerning a firm, and that recipient relied on the decision and/or administrative record of another recipient, this requirement applies to both recipients involved.</P>
            <P>(e) The Department makes its decision based solely on the entire administrative record as supplemented by the appeal. The Department does not make a de novo review of the matter and does not conduct a hearing. The Department may also supplement the administrative record by adding relevant information made available by the DOT Office of Inspector General; Federal, State, or local law enforcement authorities; officials of a DOT operating administration or other appropriate DOT office; a recipient; or a firm or other private party.</P>
            <P>(f) As a recipient, when you provide supplementary information to the Department, you shall also make this information available to the firm and any third-party complainant involved, consistent with Federal or applicable state laws concerning freedom of information and privacy. The Department makes available, on request by the firm and any third-party complainant involved, any supplementary information it receives from any source.</P>
            <P>(1) The Department affirms your decision unless it determines, based on the entire administrative record, that your decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or inconsistent with the substantive or procedural provisions of this part concerning certification.</P>
            <P>(2) If the Department determines, after reviewing the entire administrative record, that your decision was unsupported by substantial evidence or inconsistent with the substantive or procedural provisions of this part concerning certification, the Department reverses your decision and directs you to certify the firm or remove its eligibility, as appropriate. You must take the action directed by the Department's decision immediately upon receiving written notice of it.</P>
            <P>(3) The Department is not required to reverse your decision if the Department determines that a procedural error did not result in fundamental unfairness to the appellant or substantially prejudice the opportunity of the appellant to present its case.</P>

            <P>(4) If it appears that the record is incomplete or unclear with respect to matters likely to have a significant impact on the outcome of the case, the Department may remand the record to you with instructions seeking clarification or augmentation of the record before making a finding. The Department may also remand a case to you for further proceedings consistent with Department instructions concerning the <PRTPAGE P="290"/>proper application of the provisions of this part.</P>
            <P>(5) The Department does not uphold your decision based on grounds not specified in your decision.</P>
            <P>(6) The Department's decision is based on the status and circumstances of the firm as of the date of the decision being appealed.</P>

            <P>(7) The Department provides written notice of its decision to you, the firm, and the complainant in an ineligibility complaint. A copy of the notice is also sent to any other recipient whose administrative record or decision has been involved in the proceeding (<E T="03">see</E> paragraph (d) of this section). The Department will also notify the SBA in writing when DOT takes an action on an appeal that results in or confirms a loss of eligibility to any SBA-certified firm. The notice includes the reasons for the Department's decision, including specific references to the evidence in the record that supports each reason for the decision.</P>
            <P>(8) The Department's policy is to make its decision within 180 days of receiving the complete administrative record. If the Department does not make its decision within this period, the Department provides written notice to concerned parties, including a statement of the reason for the delay and a date by which the appeal decision will be made.</P>
            <P>(g) All decisions under this section are administratively final, and are not subject to petitions for reconsideration.</P>

            <P>(a) If you are the recipient from whose action an appeal under § 26.89 is taken, the decision is binding. It is not binding on other recipients.</P>
            <P>(b) If you are a recipient to which a DOT determination under § 26.89 is applicable, you must take the following action:</P>
            <P>(1) If the Department determines that you erroneously certified a firm, you must remove the firm's eligibility on receipt of the determination, without further proceedings on your part. Effective on the date of your receipt of the Department's determination, the consequences of a removal of eligibility set forth in § 26.87(i) take effect.</P>
            <P>(2) If the Department determines that you erroneously failed to find reasonable cause to remove the firm's eligibility, you must expeditiously commence a proceeding to determine whether the firm's eligibility should be removed, as provided in § 26.87.</P>
            <P>(3) If the Department determines that you erroneously declined to certify or removed the eligibility of the firm, you must certify the firm, effective on the date of your receipt of the written notice of Department's determination.</P>
            <P>(4) If the Department determines that you erroneously determined that the presumption of social and economic disadvantage either should or should not be deemed rebutted, you must take appropriate corrective action as determined by the Department.</P>
            <P>(5) If the Department affirms your determination, no further action is necessary.</P>
            <P>(c) Where DOT has upheld your denial of certification to or removal of eligibility from a firm, or directed the removal of a firm's eligibility, other recipients with whom the firm is certified may commence a proceeding to remove the firm's eligibility under § 26.87. Such recipients must not remove the firm's eligibility absent such a proceeding. Where DOT has reversed your denial of certification to or removal of eligibility from a firm, other recipients must take the DOT action into account in any certification action involving the firm. However, other recipients are not required to certify the firm based on the DOT decision.</P>

The appropriate DOT office may extend the conciliation period for up to 30 days for good cause, consistent with applicable statutes.</P>
            <P>(2) If you and the appropriate DOT office sign a conciliation agreement, then the matter is regarded as closed and you are regarded as being in compliance.

If such confidentiality will hinder the investigation, proceeding or hearing, or result in a denial of appropriate administrative due process to other parties, the complainant must be advised for the purpose of waiving the privilege. Complainants are advised that, in some circumstances, failure to waive the privilege may result in the closure of the investigation or dismissal of the proceeding or hearing.

Failure to do so shall be a ground for appropriate action against the party involved (e.g., with respect to recipients, a finding of noncompliance; with respect to DBE firms, denial of certification or removal of eligibility and/or suspension and debarment; with respect to a complainant or appellant, dismissal of the complaint or appeal; with respect to a contractor which uses DBE firms to meet goals, findings of non-responsibility for future contracts and/or suspension and debarment).</P>

            <EAR>Pt. 26, App. A</EAR>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 26—Guidance Concerning Good Faith Efforts</HD>
            <P>I. When, as a recipient, you establish a contract goal on a DOT-assisted contract for procuring construction, equipment, services, or any other purpose, a bidder must, in order to be responsible and/or responsive, make sufficient good faith efforts to meet the goal. The bidder can meet this requirement in either of two ways. First, the bidder can meet the goal, documenting commitments for participation by DBE firms sufficient for this purpose. Second, even if it doesn't meet the goal, the bidder can document adequate good faith efforts. This means that the bidder must show that it took all necessary and reasonable steps to achieve a DBE goal or other requirement of this part which, by their scope, intensity, and appropriateness to the objective, could reasonably be expected to obtain sufficient DBE participation, even if they were not fully successful.</P>
            <P>II. In any situation in which you have established a contract goal, Part 26 requires you to use the good faith efforts mechanism of this part. As a recipient, you have the responsibility to make a fair and reasonable judgment whether a bidder that did not meet the goal made adequate good faith efforts. It is important for you to consider the quality, quantity, and intensity of the different kinds of efforts that the bidder has made, based on the regulations and the guidance in this Appendix.</P>
            <P>The efforts employed by the bidder should be those that one could reasonably expect a bidder to take if the bidder were actively and aggressively trying to obtain DBE participation sufficient to meet the DBE contract goal. Mere pro forma efforts are not good faith efforts to meet the DBE contract requirements. We emphasize, however, that your determination concerning the sufficiency of the firm's good faith efforts is a judgment call. Determinations should not be made using quantitative formulas.</P>

            <P>III. The Department also strongly cautions you against requiring that a bidder meet a contract goal (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, obtain a specified amount of DBE participation) in order to be awarded a contract, even though the bidder makes an adequate good faith efforts showing. This rule specifically prohibits you from ignoring bona fide good faith efforts.</P>
            <P>IV. The following is a list of types of actions which you should consider as part of the bidder's good faith efforts to obtain DBE participation. It is not intended to be a mandatory checklist, nor is it intended to be exclusive or exhaustive. Other factors or types of efforts may be relevant in appropriate cases.</P>
            <P>A. (1) Conducing market research to identify small business contractors and suppliers and soliciting through all reasonable and available means the interest of all certified DBEs that have the capability to perform the work of the contract. This may include attendance at pre-bid and business matchmaking meetings and events, advertising and/or written notices, posting of Notices of Sources Sought and/or Requests for Proposals, written notices or emails to all DBEs listed in the State's directory of transportation firms that specialize in the areas of work desired (as noted in the DBE directory) and which are located in the area or surrounding areas of the project.</P>

            <P>(2) The bidder should solicit this interest as early in the acquisition process as practicable to allow the DBEs to respond to the solicitation and submit a timely offer for the subcontract. The bidder should determine with certainty if the DBEs are interested by <PRTPAGE P="294"/>taking appropriate steps to follow up initial solicitations.</P>
            <P>B. Selecting portions of the work to be performed by DBEs in order to increase the likelihood that the DBE goals will be achieved. This includes, where appropriate, breaking out contract work items into economically feasible units (for example, smaller tasks or quantities) to facilitate DBE participation, even when the prime contractor might otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces. This may include, where possible, establishing flexible timeframes for performance and delivery schedules in a manner that encourages and facilitates DBE participation.</P>
            <P>C. Providing interested DBEs with adequate information about the plans, specifications, and requirements of the contract in a timely manner to assist them in responding to a solicitation with their offer for the subcontract.</P>
            <P>D. (1) Negotiating in good faith with interested DBEs. It is the bidder's responsibility to make a portion of the work available to DBE subcontractors and suppliers and to select those portions of the work or material needs consistent with the available DBE subcontractors and suppliers, so as to facilitate DBE participation. Evidence of such negotiation includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of DBEs that were considered; a description of the information provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and evidence as to why additional Agreements could not be reached for DBEs to perform the work.</P>
            <P>(2) A bidder using good business judgment would consider a number of factors in negotiating with subcontractors, including DBE subcontractors, and would take a firm's price and capabilities as well as contract goals into consideration. However, the fact that there may be some additional costs involved in finding and using DBEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a bidder's failure to meet the contract DBE goal, as long as such costs are reasonable. Also, the ability or desire of a prime contractor to perform the work of a contract with its own organization does not relieve the bidder of the responsibility to make good faith efforts. Prime contractors are not, however, required to accept higher quotes from DBEs if the price difference is excessive or unreasonable.</P>
            <P>E. (1) Not rejecting DBEs as being unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their capabilities. The contractor's standing within its industry, membership in specific groups, organizations, or associations and political or social affiliations (for example union vs. non-union status) are not legitimate causes for the rejection or non-solicitation of bids in the contractor's efforts to meet the project goal. Another practice considered an insufficient good faith effort is the rejection of the DBE because its quotation for the work was not the lowest received. However, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require the bidder or prime contractor to accept unreasonable quotes in order to satisfy contract goals.</P>
            <P>(2) A prime contractor's inability to find a replacement DBE at the original price is not alone sufficient to support a finding that good faith efforts have been made to replace the original DBE. The fact that the contractor has the ability and/or desire to perform the contract work with its own forces does not relieve the contractor of the obligation to make good faith efforts to find a replacement DBE, and it is not a sound basis for rejecting a prospective replacement DBE's reasonable quote.</P>
            <P>F. Making efforts to assist interested DBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or insurance as required by the recipient or contractor.</P>
            <P>G. Making efforts to assist interested DBEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies, materials, or related assistance or services.</P>
            <P>H. Effectively using the services of available minority/women community organizations; minority/women contractors' groups; local, State, and Federal minority/women business assistance offices; and other organizations as allowed on a case-by-case basis to provide assistance in the recruitment and placement of DBEs.</P>
            <P>V. In determining whether a bidder has made good faith efforts, it is essential to scrutinize its documented efforts. At a minimum, you must review the performance of other bidders in meeting the contract goal. For example, when the apparent successful bidder fails to meet the contract goal, but others meet it, you may reasonably raise the question of whether, with additional efforts, the apparent successful bidder could have met the goal. If the apparent successful bidder fails to meet the goal, but meets or exceeds the average DBE participation obtained by other bidders, you may view this, in conjunction with other factors, as evidence of the apparent successful bidder having made good faith efforts. As provided in § 26.53(b)(2)((vi), you must also require the contractor to submit copies of each DBE and non-DBE subcontractor quote submitted to the bidder when a non-DBE subcontractor was selected over a DBE for work on the contract to review whether DBE prices were substantially higher; and contact the DBEs listed on a contractor's solicitation to inquire as to whether they were contacted by the prime. Pro forma mailings to DBEs requesting bids are not alone sufficient to satisfy good faith efforts under the rule.</P>

            <P>VI. A promise to use DBEs after contract award is not considered to be responsive to <PRTPAGE P="295"/>the contract solicitation or to constitute good faith efforts.</P>

            <P>Recipients of Department of Transportation (DOT) funds are expected to keep accurate data regarding the contracting opportunities available to firms paid for with DOT dollars. Failure to submit contracting data relative to the DBE program will result in noncompliance with Part 26. All dollar values listed on this form should represent the DOT share attributable to the Operating Administration (OA): Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to which this report will be submitted.</P>
            <P>1. Indicate the DOT (OA) that provides your Federal financial assistance. If assistance comes from more than one OA, use separate reporting forms for each OA. If you are an FTA recipient, indicate your Vendor Number in the space provided.</P>
            <P>2. If you are an FAA recipient, indicate the relevant AIP Numbers covered by this report. If you are an FTA recipient, indicate the Grant/Project numbers covered by this report. If more than ten attach a separate sheet.</P>
            <P>3. Specify the Federal fiscal year (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, October 1-September 30) in which the covered reporting period falls.</P>
            <P>4. State the date of submission of this report.</P>
            <P>5. Check the appropriate box that indicates the reporting period that the data provided in this report covers. For FHWA and FTA recipients, if this report is due June 1, data should cover October 1-March 31. If this report is due December 1, data should cover April 1-September 30. If the report is due to the FAA, data should cover the entire year.</P>
            <P>6. Provide the name and address of the recipient.</P>
            <P>7. State your overall DBE goal(s) established for the Federal fiscal year of the report being submitted to and approved by the relevant OA. Your overall goal is to be reported as well as the breakdown for specific Race Conscious and Race Neutral projections (both of which include gender-conscious/neutral projections). The Race Conscious projection should be based on measures that focus on and provide benefits only for DBEs. The use of contract goals is a primary example of a race conscious measure. The Race Neutral projection should include measures that, while benefiting DBEs, are not solely focused on DBE firms. For example, a small business outreach program, technical assistance, and prompt payment clauses can assist a wide variety of businesses in addition to helping DBE firms.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix C to Part 26—DBE Business Development Program Guidelines</HD>

            <P>The purpose of this program element is to further the development of DBEs, including but not limited to assisting them to move into non-traditional areas of work and/or compete in the marketplace outside the DBE program, via the provision of training and assistance from the recipient.<PRTPAGE P="299"/>
            </P>
            <P>(A) Each firm that participates in a recipient's business development program (BDP) program is subject to a program term determined by the recipient. The term should consist of two stages; a developmental stage and a transitional stage.</P>
            <P>(B) In order for a firm to remain eligible for program participation, it must continue to meet all eligibility criteria contained in part 26.</P>
            <P>(C) By no later than 6 months of program entry, the participant should develop and submit to the recipient a comprehensive business plan setting forth the participant's business targets, objectives and goals. The participant will not be eligible for program benefits until such business plan is submitted and approved by the recipient. The approved business plan will constitute the participant's short and long term goals and the strategy for developmental growth to the point of economic viability in non-traditional areas of work and/or work outside the DBE program.</P>
            <P>(D) The business plan should contain at least the following:</P>
            <P>(1) An analysis of market potential, competitive environment and other business analyses estimating the program participant's prospects for profitable operation during the term of program participation and after graduation from the program.</P>
            <P>(2) An analysis of the firm's strengths and weaknesses, with particular attention paid to the means of correcting any financial, managerial, technical, or labor conditions which could impede the participant from receiving contracts other than those in traditional areas of DBE participation.</P>
            <P>(3) Specific targets, objectives, and goals for the business development of the participant during the next two years, utilizing the results of the analysis conducted pursuant to paragraphs (C) and (D)(1) of this appendix;</P>
            <P>(4) Estimates of contract awards from the DBE program and from other sources which are needed to meet the objectives and goals for the years covered by the business plan; and</P>
            <P>(5) Such other information as the recipient may require.</P>
            <P>(E) Each participant should annually review its currently approved business plan with the recipient and modify the plan as may be appropriate to account for any changes in the firm's structure and redefined needs. The currently approved plan should be considered the applicable plan for all program purposes until the recipient approves in writing a modified plan. The recipient should establish an anniversary date for review of the participant's business plan and contract forecasts.</P>
            <P>(F) Each participant should annually forecast in writing its need for contract awards for the next program year and the succeeding program year during the review of its business plan conducted under paragraph (E) of this appendix. Such forecast should be included in the participant's business plan. The forecast should include:</P>
            <P>(1) The aggregate dollar value of contracts to be sought under the DBE program, reflecting compliance with the business plan;</P>
            <P>(2) The aggregate dollar value of contracts to be sought in areas other than traditional areas of DBE participation;</P>
            <P>(3) The types of contract opportunities being sought, based on the firm's primary line of business; and</P>
            <P>(4) Such other information as may be requested by the recipient to aid in providing effective business development assistance to the participant.</P>
            <P>(G) Program participation is divided into two stages; (1) a developmental stage and (2) a transitional stage. The developmental stage is designed to assist participants to overcome their social and economic disadvantage by providing such assistance as may be necessary and appropriate to enable them to access relevant markets and strengthen their financial and managerial skills. The transitional stage of program participation follows the developmental stage and is designed to assist participants to overcome, insofar as practical, their social and economic disadvantage and to prepare the participant for leaving the program.</P>
            <P>(H) The length of service in the program term should not be a pre-set time frame for either the developmental or transitional stages but should be figured on the number of years considered necessary in normal progression of achieving the firm's established goals and objectives. The setting of such time could be factored on such items as, but not limited to, the number of contracts, aggregate amount of the contract received, years in business, growth potential, etc.</P>
            <P>(I) Beginning in the first year of the transitional stage of program participation, each participant should annually submit for inclusion in its business plan a transition management plan outlining specific steps to promote profitable business operations in areas other than traditional areas of DBE participation after graduation from the program. The transition management plan should be submitted to the recipient at the same time other modifications are submitted pursuant to the annual review under paragraph (E) of this section. The plan should set forth the same information as required under paragraph (F) of steps the participant will take to continue its business development after the expiration of its program term.</P>

            <P>(J) When a participant is recognized as successfully completing the program by substantially achieving the targets, objectives and goals set forth in its program term, and has demonstrated the ability to compete in the marketplace, its further participation <PRTPAGE P="300"/>within the program may be determined by the recipient.</P>
            <P>(K) In determining whether a concern has substantially achieved the goals and objectives of its business plan, the following factors, among others, should be considered by the recipient:</P>
            <P>(1) Profitability;</P>
            <P>(2) Sales, including improved ratio of non-traditional contracts to traditional-type contracts;</P>
            <P>(3) Net worth, financial ratios, working capital, capitalization, access to credit and capital;</P>
            <P>(4) Ability to obtain bonding;</P>
            <P>(5) A positive comparison of the DBE's business and financial profile with profiles of non-DBE businesses in the same area or similar business category; and</P>
            <P>(6) Good management capacity and capability.</P>
            <P>(L) Upon determination by the recipient that the participant should be graduated from the developmental program, the recipient should notify the participant in writing of its intent to graduate the firm in a letter of notification. The letter of notification should set forth findings, based on the facts, for every material issue relating to the basis of the program graduation with specific reasons for each finding. The letter of notification should also provide the participant 45 days from the date of service of the letter to submit in writing information that would explain why the proposed basis of graduation is not warranted.</P>
            <P>(M) Participation of a DBE firm in the program may be discontinued by the recipient prior to expiration of the firm's program term for good cause due to the failure of the firm to engage in business practices that will promote its competitiveness within a reasonable period of time as evidenced by, among other indicators, a pattern of inadequate performance or unjustified delinquent performance. Also, the recipient can discontinue the participation of a firm that does not actively pursue and bid on contracts, and a firm that, without justification, regularly fails to respond to solicitations in the type of work it is qualified for and in the geographical areas where it has indicated availability under its approved business plan. The recipient should take such action if over a 2-year period a DBE firm exhibits such a pattern.</P>

            <P>(A) The purpose of this program element is to further the development of DBEs, including but not limited to assisting them to move into non-traditional areas of work and/or compete in the marketplace outside the DBE program, via the provision of training and assistance from other firms. To operate a mentor-protégé program, a recipient must obtain the approval of the concerned operating administration.</P>

            <P>(C) DBEs involved in a mentor-protégé agreement must be independent business entities which meet the requirements for certification as defined in subpart D of this part. A protégé firm must be certified <E T="03">before</E> it begins participation in a mentor-protégé arrangement. If the recipient chooses to recognize mentor/protégé agreements, it should establish formal general program guidelines. These guidelines must be submitted to the operating administration for approval prior to the recipient executing an individual contractor/ subcontractor mentor-protégé agreement.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix E to Part 26—Individual Determinations of Social and Economic Disadvantage</HD>
            <P>The following guidance is adapted, with minor modifications, from SBA regulations concerning social and economic disadvantage determinations (see 13 CFR 124.103(c) and 124.104).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Social Disadvantage</HD>

            <P>I. Socially disadvantaged individuals are those who have been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias within American society because of their identities as members of groups and without regard to their individual qualities. Social disadvantage must stem from circumstances beyond their control. Evidence of individual social <PRTPAGE P="301"/>disadvantage must include the following elements:</P>
            <P>(A) At least one objective distinguishing feature that has contributed to social disadvantage, such as race, ethnic origin, gender, disability, long-term residence in an environment isolated from the mainstream of American society, or other similar causes not common to individuals who are not socially disadvantaged;</P>
            <P>(B) Personal experiences of substantial and chronic social disadvantage in American society, not in other countries; and</P>
            <P>(C) Negative impact on entry into or advancement in the business world because of the disadvantage. Recipients will consider any relevant evidence in assessing this element. In every case, however, recipients will consider education, employment and business history, where applicable, to see if the totality of circumstances shows disadvantage in entering into or advancing in the business world.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Education.</E> Recipients will consider such factors as denial of equal access to institutions of higher education and vocational training, exclusion from social and professional association with students or teachers, denial of educational honors rightfully earned, and social patterns or pressures which discouraged the individual from pursuing a professional or business education.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Employment.</E> Recipients will consider such factors as unequal treatment in hiring, promotions and other aspects of professional advancement, pay and fringe benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment; retaliatory or discriminatory behavior by an employer or labor union; and social patterns or pressures which have channeled the individual into non-professional or non-business fields.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Business history.</E> The recipient will consider such factors as unequal access to credit or capital, acquisition of credit or capital under commercially unfavorable circumstances, unequal treatment in opportunities for government contracts or other work, unequal treatment by potential customers and business associates, and exclusion from business or professional organizations.</P>
            <P>II. With respect to paragraph I.(A) of this appendix, the Department notes that people with disabilities have disproportionately low incomes and high rates of unemployment. Many physical and attitudinal barriers remain to their full participation in education, employment, and business opportunities available to the general public. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was passed in recognition of the discrimination faced by people with disabilities. It is plausible that many individuals with disabilities—especially persons with severe disabilities (e.g., significant mobility, vision, or hearing impairments)—may be socially and economically disadvantaged.</P>
            <P>III. Under the laws concerning social and economic disadvantage, people with disabilities are not a group presumed to be disadvantaged. Nevertheless, recipients should look carefully at individual showings of disadvantage by individuals with disabilities, making a case-by-case judgment about whether such an individual meets the criteria of this appendix. As public entities subject to Title II of the ADA, recipients must also ensure their DBE programs are accessible to individuals with disabilities. For example, physical barriers or the lack of application and information materials in accessible formats cannot be permitted to thwart the access of potential applicants to the certification process or other services made available to DBEs and applicants.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Economic Disadvantage</HD>
            <P>(A) <E T="03">General.</E> Economically disadvantaged individuals are socially disadvantaged individuals whose ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to others in the same or similar line of business who are not socially disadvantaged.</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Submission of narrative and financial information.</E> (1) Each individual claiming economic disadvantage must describe the conditions which are the basis for the claim in a narrative statement, and must submit personal financial information.</P>
            <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(C) <E T="03">Factors to be considered.</E> In considering diminished capital and credit opportunities, recipients will examine factors relating to the personal financial condition of any individual claiming disadvantaged status, including personal income for the past two years (including bonuses and the value of company stock given in lieu of cash), personal net worth, and the fair market value of all assets, whether encumbered or not. Recipients will also consider the financial condition of the applicant compared to the financial profiles of small businesses in the same primary industry classification, or, if not available, in similar lines of business, which are not owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in evaluating the individual's access to credit and capital. The financial profiles that recipients will compare include total assets, net sales, pre-tax profit, sales/working capital ratio, and net worth.</P>
            <P>(D) <E T="03">Transfers within two years.</E> (1) Except as set forth in paragraph (D)(2) of this appendix, recipients will attribute to an individual claiming disadvantaged status any assets which that individual has transferred to an immediate family member, or to a trust, a beneficiary of which is an immediate family member, for less than fair market value, <PRTPAGE P="302"/>within two years prior to a concern's application for participation in the DBE program, unless the individual claiming disadvantaged status can demonstrate that the transfer is to or on behalf of an immediate family member for that individual's education, medical expenses, or some other form of essential support.</P>
            <P>(2) Recipients will not attribute to an individual claiming disadvantaged status any assets transferred by that individual to an immediate family member that are consistent with the customary recognition of special occasions, such as birthdays, graduations, anniversaries, and retirements.</P>
            <P>(3) In determining an individual's access to capital and credit, recipients may consider any assets that the individual transferred within such two-year period described by paragraph (D)(1) of this appendix that are not considered in evaluating the individual's assets and net worth (e.g., transfers to charities).</P>

            <P>(i) Deny a qualified person with a disability the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;</P>
            <P>(ii) Afford a qualified person with a disability an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not substantially equal to that afforded persons who are not disabled;</P>

            <P>(v) Aid or perpetuate discrimination against a qualified person with a disability by providing financial or other assistance to an agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of disability in providing any aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries of the recipient's program or activity;</P>
            <P>(vi) Deny a qualified person with a disability the opportunity to participate in conferences, in planning or advising recipients, applicants or would-be applicants, or</P>
            <P>(vii) Otherwise limit a qualified person with a disability in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving an aid, benefit, or service.</P>
            <P>(2) For purposes of this part, aids, benefits, and services, to be equally effective, are not required to produce the identical result or level of achievement for persons with and without a disability, but must afford persons with a disability equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement, in the most integrated setting that is reasonably achievable.</P>
            <P>(3) Even if separate or different aid, benefits, or services are available to persons with a disability, a recipient may not deny a qualified person with a disability the opportunity to participate in the programs or activities that are not separate or different.</P>

            <P>(i) That have the effect of subjecting qualified persons with a disability to discrimination on the basis of disability,</P>
            <P>(ii) That have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially reducing the likelihood that persons with a disability can benefit by the objectives of the recipient's program or activity, or</P>
            <P>(iii) That yield or perpetuate discrimination against another recipient if both recipients are subject to common administrative control or are agencies of the same State.</P>
            <P>(5) In determining the site or location of a facility, an applicant or a recipient may not make selections:</P>
            <P>(i) That have the effect of excluding persons with a disability from, denying them the benefits of, or otherwise subjecting them to discrimination under any program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance, or</P>

For the purposes of this section, the term reasonable accommodation shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the term “reasonable modifications” as set forth in the Americans with Disabilities Act title II regulations at 28 CFR 35.130(b)(7), and not as it is defined or interpreted for <PRTPAGE P="326"/>the purposes of employment discrimination under title I of the ADA (42 U.S.C. 12111-12112) and its implementing regulations at 29 CFR part 1630.</P>

            <P>(2) With respect to any televisions and other audio-visual displays located in any gate area, ticketing area, first-class or other passenger lounge provided by a U.S. or foreign carrier, or any common area of the terminal to which any passengers have access that provide passengers with safety briefings, information, or entertainment that do not have high-contrast captioning capability, an airport operator must replace or ensure the replacement of these devices with equipment that does have such capability whenever such equipment is replaced in the normal course of operations and/or whenever areas of the terminal in which <PRTPAGE P="330"/>such equipment is located undergo substantial renovation or expansion.</P>
            <P>(3) If an airport installs new televisions and other audio-visual displays for passenger safety briefings, information, or entertainment on or after October 5, 2015, such equipment must have high-contrast captioning capability.</P>

            <P>(b) Airports shall, in cooperation with carriers serving the airports, provide boarding assistance to individuals with disabilities using mechanical lifts, ramps, or other devices that do not require employees to lift or carry passengers up stairs. This section applies to all aircraft with a passenger capacity of 19 or more passenger seats, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. Paragraph (c) of this section applies to U.S. carriers and paragraph (d) of this section applies to foreign carriers.</P>
            <P>(c) Each airport operator shall negotiate in good faith with each U.S. carrier serving the airport concerning the acquisition and use of boarding assistance devices to ensure the provision of mechanical lifts, ramps, or other devices for boarding and deplaning where level-entry loading bridges are not available. The airport operator must have a written, signed agreement with each U.S. carrier allocating responsibility for meeting the boarding and deplaning assistance requirements of this section between or among the parties. The agreement shall be made available, on request, to representatives of the Department of Transportation.</P>
            <P>(1) All airport operators and U.S. carriers involved are jointly and severally responsible for the timely and complete implementation of the agreement.</P>
            <P>(2) The agreement shall ensure that all lifts and other accessibility equipment are maintained in proper working condition.</P>

            <P>(d) Each airport operator shall negotiate in good faith with each foreign carrier serving the airport concerning the acquisition and use of boarding assistance devices to ensure the provision of mechanical lifts, ramps, or other devices for boarding and deplaning where level-entry loading bridges are not available. The airport operator shall, by no later than November 3, 2015, sign a written agreement with the foreign carrier allocating responsibility for meeting the boarding and deplaning assistance requirements of this section between or among the parties. The agreement shall be made available, on request, to representatives of the Department of Transportation.<PRTPAGE P="333"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) The agreement shall provide that all actions necessary to ensure accessible boarding and deplaning for passengers with disabilities are completed as soon as practicable, but no later than December 3, 2015.</P>
            <P>(2) All airport operators and foreign carriers involved are jointly and severally responsible for the timely and complete implementation of the agreement.</P>
            <P>(3) The agreement shall ensure that all lifts and other accessibility equipment are maintained in proper working condition.</P>
            <P>(e) Boarding assistance agreements required in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section are not required to apply to the following situations:</P>

            <P>(3) Access to any other aircraft model determined by the Department of Transportation to be unsuitable for boarding and deplaning assistance by lift, ramp, or other suitable device. The Department will make such a determination if it concludes that—</P>
            <P>(i) No existing boarding and deplaning assistance device on the market will accommodate the aircraft without significant risk of serious damage to the aircraft or injury to passengers or employees, or</P>
            <P>(ii) Internal barriers are present in the aircraft that would preclude passengers who use a boarding or aisle chair from reaching a non-exit row seat.</P>

            <P>(f) When level-entry boarding and deplaning assistance is not required to be provided under paragraph (e) of this section, or cannot be provided as required by paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> because of mechanical problems with a lift), boarding assistance shall be provided by any available means to which the passenger consents. However, hand-carrying (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> directly picking up the passenger's body in the arms of one or more carrier personnel to effect a level change the passenger needs to enter or leave the aircraft) must never be used, even if the passenger consents, unless this is the only way of evacuating the individual in the event of an emergency.</P>
            <P>(g) In the event that airport personnel are involved in providing boarding assistance, the airport shall ensure that they are trained to proficiency in the use of the boarding assistance equipment used at the airport and appropriate boarding assistance procedures that safeguard the safety and dignity of passengers.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Decisions by Administrative Law Judge.</E> After the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge certifies the entire record including his recommended findings and proposed decision to the Secretary for a final decision.

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Decisions if hearing is waived.</E> Whenever a hearing pursuant to § 27.125(b) is waived, the Secretary makes his/her final decision on the record, stating the reasons therefor.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Rulings required.</E> Each decision of the Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary contains a ruling on each finding or conclusion presented and specifies any failures to comply with this part.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Content of orders.</E> The final decision may provide for suspension or termination, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which this first regulation applies. The decision may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this part, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be extended unless and until the recipient corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the Secretary that it will fully comply with this part.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Subsequent proceedings.</E> (1) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (e) of this section is restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order or if it brings itself into compliance with this part and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this part.</P>
            <P>(2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section may, at any time, request the responsible Departmental official to restore its eligibility, to receive Federal financial assistance. Any request must be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section. If the responsible Departmental official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he/she may restore such eligibility, subject to the approval of the Secretary.</P>

            <P>(3) If the responsible Departmental official denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request, in writing, for a hearing specifying why it believes the responsible Departmental official should restore it to full eligibility. It is thereupon given a prompt hearing, with a decision on the record. The applicant or recipient is restored to eligibility if it demonstrates to the satisfaction of the <PRTPAGE P="338"/>Secretary at the hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(4) The hearing procedures of § 27.127(b) through (c) and paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section apply to hearings held under paragraph (f)(3) of this section.</P>

          <P>Except as otherwise provided in § 28.150, no qualified individual with handicaps shall, because the Department's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the Department.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Department shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—</P>
          <P>(1) Necessarily require the Department to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;</P>
          <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
          <P>(3) Require the Department to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where personnel of a DOT element believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the DOT element has the burden of proving that compliance with § 28.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Secretary or his or her designee, after considering all resources available for use in the funding and operation of the program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Department shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods.</E> The Department may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making <PRTPAGE P="343"/>its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The Department is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The Department, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the Department shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The Department shall comply with the obligations established under this section within sixty days of the effective date of this part except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made within three years of the effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as possible. Provided that, where major restructuring of fixed facilities to accommodate technological changes is planned to occur within five years from the effective date of this part, changes needed to comply with this section are not required to be made until the planned restructuring takes place. However, alternative means for participation by individuals with handicaps in DOT programs and activities in the most integrated setting possible during this interim waiting period shall be available.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the Department shall develop, within six months of the effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps, agency employees with handicaps, or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
          <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the Department's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
          <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>

          <P>(1) The Department shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the Department.</P>
          <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the Department shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.</P>

          <P>(ii) The Department need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers <PRTPAGE P="344"/>for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature to applicants or participants in programs.</P>
          <P>(2) Where the Department communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunications devices for deaf persons (TDDs) or equally effective telecommunication systems, shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.</P>
          <P>(b) The Department shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
          <P>(c) The Department shall provide signs at each primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information as to the location of accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
          <P>(d) This section does not require the Department to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where personnel of a DOT element believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in an undue financial and administrative burden, the DOT element has the burden of proving that compliance with § 28.160 would result in such alteration or burden. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burden must be made by the Secretary or his or her designee, after considering all resources available for use in the funding and operation of the program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Department shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such a burden but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

The Departmental element shall inform the complainant, in writing, or the decision on the request. The complainant may request reconsideration by the Departmental element of the decision. The decision on the petition or request shall constitute the Department's final action in the matter.</P>

          <P>(d)(1) The Department shall accept and investigate all complete complaints for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The Department may extend this time period for good cause.</P>

          <P>(2) If the subject matter of a complete complaint concerns a decision by a Departmental element, under a safety regulation, concerning an individual's qualifications to perform a function or to receive a certificate or license, and the complainant has available within the Departmental element a formal review or appeal mechanism <PRTPAGE P="345"/>concerning that decision, the Department shall not take action on the complaint until the Departmental element's review or appeal process has been completed.</P>
          <P>(e) If the Department receives a complaint over which it does not have jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate Government entity.</P>

          <P>(2) A description of a remedy for each violation found; and</P>
          <P>(3) A notice of the right to appeal.</P>
          <P>(h) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or remedies must be filed by the complainant within 90 days of receipt from the Department of the letter required by § 28.170(g). The Department may extend this time for good cause.</P>
          <P>(i) Timely appeals shall be accepted and processed by the Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy.

          <P>(a) The restrictions imposed by section 109(a) of the Continuing Resolution extend to all DOT agencies as well <PRTPAGE P="346"/>as all recipients of DOT funds. The restrictions apply to all projects for which funds are obligated or contracts or subcontracts are awarded during fiscal year 1988, including projects and contracts under all DOT financial assistance programs. The prohibition applies to public buildings and public works projects everywhere in the United States or any territory or possession of the United States. U.S. overseas bases, installations, and embassies are not subject to this part.</P>
          <P>(b) The restrictions imposed by section 115 of the Airport Safety Act extend to all projects for which funds are made available by that Act, whether or not the contracts are awarded during fiscal year 1988. The restrictions apply to all contracts entered into under grants authorized by the Airport Safety Act.</P>
          <P>(c) This part applies to projects covered by section 109(a) of the Continuing Resolution, section 115 of the Airport Safety Act, or both. Whether one or the other statute or both apply, the effect on the project shall be the same, subject to paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
          <P>(d) In addition to construction, alteration, and repair contracts, the restrictions of this part cover all architect, engineering, and other services related to the preparation and performance of construction, alteration, and repair of public projects and public works.</P>

The provisions of section 115 of the Airport Safety Act apply to contracts funded by the Act and entered into after December 30, 1987, its date of enactment; the restrictions remain effective so long as money provided by the Airport Safety Act is used. Accordingly, any contracts or subcontracts subject to the restrictions of this part entered into with contractors or subcontractors owned or controlled by citizens of subject countries, as defined by §§ 30.7 and 30.9 of this part, since December 22, 1987 shall be canceled at no cost to the Government, subject to the waiver provisions of § 30.17 of this part.

          <P>(k) If the authority head decides that extraordinary circumstances excused the defendant's failure to answer on time, the authority head shall remand the case to the ALJ with instructions to grant the defendant an opportunity to answer.</P>

          <P>(l) If the authority head decides that the defendant's failure to answer on <PRTPAGE P="356"/>time is not excused, the authority head shall reinstate the initial decision of the ALJ, which shall become final and binding upon the parties 30 days after the authority head issues such decision.</P>

          <P>(a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessments, the ALJ and the authority head, upon appeal, should evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs of fraud, the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, ordinarily double damages and a significant civil penalty should be imposed.</P>

          <P>(5) The value of the Government's actual loss as a result of the misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the costs of investigation;</P>
          <P>(6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the amount of the Government's loss;</P>
          <P>(7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon national defense, public health or safety, or public confidence in the management of Government programs and operations, including particularly the impact on the intended beneficiaries of such programs;</P>
          <P>(8) Whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of the same or similar misconduct;</P>
          <P>(9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct;</P>
          <P>(10) The degree to which the defendant has involved others in the misconduct or in concealing it;</P>
          <P>(11) Where the misconduct of employees or agents is imputed to the defendant, the extent to which the defendant's practices fostered or attempted to preclude such misconduct;</P>
          <P>(12) Whether the defendant cooperated in or obstructed an investigation of the misconduct;</P>
          <P>(13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying and prosecuting other wrongdoers;</P>
          <P>(14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of the defendant's sophistication with respect to it, including the extent of the defendant's prior participation in the program or in similar transactions;</P>
          <P>(15) Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding to have engaged in similar misconduct or to have dealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of a State, directly or indirectly; and</P>

          <P>(c) The ALJ shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.</P>
          <P>(d) The ALJ shall permit the parties to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.</P>

            <P>There are two actions you must take if an employee is convicted of a drug violation in the workplace:</P>
            <P>(a) First, you must notify Federal agencies if an employee who is engaged in the performance of an award informs you about a conviction, as required by § 32.205(c)(2), or you otherwise learn of the conviction. Your notification to the Federal agencies must—</P>
            <P>(1) Be in writing;</P>
            <P>(2) Include the employee's position title;</P>
            <P>(3) Include the identification number(s) of each affected award;</P>
            <P>(4) Be sent within ten calendar days after you learn of the conviction; and</P>
            <P>(5) Be sent to every Federal agency on whose award the convicted employee was working. It must be sent to every awarding official or his or her official designee, unless the Federal agency has specified a central point for the receipt of the notices.</P>
            <P>(b) Second, within 30 calendar days of learning about an employee's conviction, you must either—</P>
            <P>(1) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to and including termination, consistent with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), as amended; or</P>
            <P>(2) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for these purposes by a Federal, State or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate agency.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 32.230</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How and when must I identify workplaces?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) You must identify all known workplaces under each DOT award. A failure to do so is a violation of your drug-free workplace requirements. You may identify the workplaces—</P>
            <P>(1) To the DOT official that is making the award, either at the time of application or upon award; or</P>
            <P>(2) In documents that you keep on file in your offices during the performance of the award, in which case you must make the information available for inspection upon request by DOT officials or their designated representatives.</P>

            <P>(b) Your workplace identification for an award must include the actual address of buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under the award takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> all vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, performers in concert halls or radio studios).</P>
            <P>(c) If you identified workplaces to the DOT awarding official at the time of application or award, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and any workplace that you identified changes during the performance of the award, you must inform the DOT awarding official.</P>

(For a full discussion of Directives, see § 33.62.)</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Program identification symbols.</E> Program identification symbols indicate which approved program is being supported by a rated order. DOT will use the letter “T” followed by a number for all transportation-related approved programs. Programs may be approved under the procedures of Executive Order 13603 at any time. Program identification symbols, in themselves, do not connote any priority.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Priority ratings.</E> A priority rating consists of the rating symbol—DO and DX—and the program identification symbol, such as DO-T1 or DX-T1 for a priority rating under TPAS.</P>

            <P>Each rated order must include:</P>
            <P>(a) The appropriate priority rating (<E T="03">e.g.</E> DO-T1 or DX-T1);</P>
            <P>(b) A required delivery date or dates. The words “immediately” or “as soon as possible” do not constitute a delivery date. A “requirements contract,” “basic ordering agreement,” “prime vendor contract,” or similar procurement document bearing a priority rating may contain no specific delivery date or dates and may provide for the furnishing of items or service from time-to-time or within a stated period against specific purchase orders, such as “calls,” “requisitions,” and “delivery orders.” These purchase orders must specify a required delivery date or dates and are to be considered as rated as of the date of their receipt by the supplier and not as of the date of the original procurement document;</P>
            <P>(c) The written signature on a manually placed order, or the digital signature or name on an electronically placed order, of an individual authorized to sign rated orders for the person placing the order.

            <SUBJECT>Acceptance and rejection of rated orders.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Mandatory acceptance.</E> (1) Except as otherwise specified in this section, a person shall accept every rated order received and must fill such orders regardless of any other rated or unrated orders that have been accepted.</P>
            <P>(2) A person shall not discriminate against rated orders in any manner such as by charging higher prices or by imposing different terms and conditions than for comparable unrated orders.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Mandatory rejection.</E> Unless otherwise directed by the Department of Transportation for a rated order involving all forms of civil transportation:</P>
            <P>(1) A person shall not accept a rated order for delivery on a specific date if unable to fill the order by that date. However, the person must inform the customer of the earliest date on which delivery can be made and offer to accept the order on the basis of that date. Scheduling conflicts with previously accepted lower rated or unrated orders are not sufficient reason for rejection under this section.</P>
            <P>(2) A person shall not accept a DO-rated order for delivery on a date which would interfere with delivery of any previously accepted DO- or DX-rated orders. However, the person must offer to accept the order based on the earliest delivery date otherwise possible.</P>
            <P>(3) A person shall not accept a DX-rated order for delivery on a date which would interfere with delivery of any previously accepted DX-rated orders, but must offer to accept the order based on the earliest delivery date otherwise possible.</P>
            <P>(4) If a person is unable to fill all of the rated orders of equal priority status received on the same day, the person must accept, based upon the earliest delivery dates, only those orders which can be filled, and reject the other orders. For example, a person must accept order A requiring delivery on December 15 before accepting order B requiring delivery on December 31. However, the person must offer to accept the rejected orders based on the earliest delivery dates otherwise possible.</P>
            <P>(5) A person shall not accept a rated order if the person is prohibited by Federal law from meeting the terms of the order.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Optional rejection.</E> Unless otherwise directed by the Department of Transportation for a rated order involving all forms of civil transportation, rated orders may be rejected in any of the following cases as long as a supplier does not discriminate among customers:</P>
            <P>(1) If the person placing the order is unwilling or unable to meet regularly established terms of sale or payment;</P>
            <P>(2) If the order is for an item not supplied or for a service not capable of being performed;</P>
            <P>(3) If the order is for an item or service produced, acquired, or provided only for the supplier's own use for which no orders have been filled for two years prior to the date of receipt of the rated order. If, however, a supplier has sold some of these items or provided similar services, the supplier is obligated to accept rated orders up to that quantity or portion of production or service, whichever is greater, sold or provided within the past two years;</P>
            <P>(4) If the person placing the rated order, other than the U.S. Government, makes the item or performs the service being ordered;</P>
            <P>(5) If acceptance of a rated order or performance against a rated order would violate any other regulation, official action, or order of the Department of Transportation, issued under the authority of the Defense Production Act or another relevant statute.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Customer notification requirements.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, a person must accept or reject a rated order in writing or electronically within fifteen (15) working days after receipt of a DO rated order and within ten (10) working days after receipt of a DX rated order. If the order is rejected, the person must give reasons in writing or electronically for the rejection.</P>

            <P>(2) If a person has accepted a rated order and subsequently finds that shipment or performance will be delayed, <PRTPAGE P="378"/>the person must notify the customer immediately, give the reasons for the delay, and advise of a new shipment or performance date. If notification is given verbally, written or electronic confirmation must be provided within five (5) working days.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Exception for emergency preparedness conditions.</E> If a rated order is placed for the purpose of emergency preparedness and includes the additional statement set forth in § 33.32(d)(2), a person must accept or reject the rated order and transmit the acceptance or rejection in writing or in an electronic format:</P>
            <P>(1) Within six (6) hours after receipt of the order if the order is issued in response to a hazard that has occurred; or</P>
            <P>(2) Within the greater of twelve (12) hours from receipt of the order or the time specified in the order, if the order is issued to prepare for an imminent hazard.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Preferential scheduling.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A person must schedule operations, including the acquisition of all needed production items or services, in a timely manner to satisfy the delivery requirements of each rated order. Modifying production or delivery schedules is necessary only when required delivery dates for rated orders cannot otherwise be met.</P>
            <P>(b) DO-rated orders must be given production or performance preference over unrated orders, if necessary to meet required delivery dates, even if this requires the diversion of items being processed or ready for delivery or services being performed against unrated orders. Similarly, DX-rated orders must be given preference over DO-rated orders and unrated orders. (Examples: If a person receives a DO-rated order with a delivery date of June 3 and if meeting that date would mean delaying production or delivery of an item for an unrated order, the unrated order must be delayed. If a DX-rated order is received calling for delivery on July 15 and a person has a DO-rated order requiring delivery on June 2 and operations can be scheduled to meet both deliveries, there is no need to alter production schedules to give any additional preference to the DX-rated order.)</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Conflicting rated orders.</E> (1) If a person finds that delivery or performance against any accepted rated orders conflicts with the delivery or performance against other accepted rated orders of equal priority status, the person shall give precedence to the conflicting orders in the sequence in which they are to be delivered or performed (not to the receipt dates). If the conflicting orders are scheduled to be delivered or performed on the same day, the person shall give precedence to those orders that have the earliest receipt dates.</P>
            <P>(2) If a person is unable to resolve rated order delivery or performance conflicts under this section, the person should promptly seek special priorities assistance as provided in §§ 33.40 through 33.44. If the person's customer objects to the rescheduling of delivery or performance of a rated order, the customer should promptly seek special priorities assistance as provided in §§ 33.40 through 33.44. For any rated order against which delivery or performance will be delayed, the person must notify the customer as provided in § 33.33.</P>
            <P>(d) If a person is unable to purchase needed production items in time to fill a rated order by its required delivery date, the person must fill the rated order by using inventoried production items. A person who uses inventoried items to fill a rated order may replace those items with the use of a rated order as provided in § 33.37(b).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Extension of priority ratings.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A person must use rated orders with suppliers to obtain items or services needed to fill a rated order. The person must use the priority rating indicated on the customer's rated order, except as otherwise provided in this part or as directed by the Department of Transportation. For example, if a person is in receipt of a DO-T1 priority rating for a bus and has several buses in inventory that are in need of repair, that person must use a DO-T1 rated order to obtain the needed bus repairs.</P>

            <P>(b) The priority rating must be included on each successive order placed to obtain items or services needed to <PRTPAGE P="379"/>fill a customer's rated order. This continues from contractor to subcontractor to supplier throughout the entire procurement chain.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Changes or cancellations of priority ratings and rated orders.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The priority rating on a rated order may be changed or canceled by:</P>
            <P>(1) An official action of the Department of Transportation; or</P>
            <P>(2) Written notification from the person who placed the rated order.</P>
            <P>(b) If an unrated order is amended so as to make it a rated order, or a DO rating is changed to a DX rating, the supplier must give the appropriate preferential treatment to the order as of the date the change is received by the supplier.</P>
            <P>(c) An amendment to a rated order that significantly alters a supplier's original production or delivery schedule shall constitute a new rated order as of the date of its receipt. The supplier must accept or reject the amended order according to the provisions of § 33.33.</P>
            <P>(d) The following amendments do not constitute a new rated order: a change in shipping destination; a reduction in the total amount of the order; an increase in the total amount of the order which has negligible impact upon deliveries; a minor variation in size or design; or a change which is agreed upon between the supplier and the customer.</P>
            <P>(e) If a person no longer needs items or services to fill a rated order, any rated orders placed with suppliers for the items or services, or the priority rating on those orders, must be canceled.</P>
            <P>(f) When a priority rating is added to an unrated order, or is changed or canceled, all suppliers must be promptly notified in writing.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Use of rated orders.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A person must use rated orders to obtain:</P>
            <P>(1) Items which will be physically incorporated into other items to fill rated orders, including that portion of such items normally consumed or converted into scrap or by-products in the course of processing;</P>
            <P>(2) Containers or other packaging materials required to make delivery of the finished items against rated orders;</P>
            <P>(3) Services, other than contracts of employment, needed to fill rated orders; and</P>
            <P>(4) MRO needed to produce the finished items to fill rated orders.</P>
            <P>(b) A person may use a rated order to replace inventoried items (including finished items) if such items were used to fill rated orders, as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) The order must be placed within 90 days of the date of use of the inventory.</P>
            <P>(2) A DO rating and the program identification symbol indicated on the customer's rated order must be used on the order. A DX rating may not be used even if the inventory was used to fill a DX-rated order.</P>

            <P>(3) If the priority ratings on rated orders from one customer or several customers contain different program identification symbols, the rated orders may be combined. In this case, the program identification symbol “T9” must be used (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> DO-T9).</P>

            <P>(c) A person may combine DX- and DO-rated orders from one customer or several customers if the items or services covered by each level of priority are identified separately and clearly. If different program identification symbols are indicated on those rated orders of equal priority, the person must use the program identification symbol “T9” (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> DO-T9 or DX-T9).</P>
            <P>(d) Combining rated and unrated orders.</P>
            <P>(1) A person may combine rated and unrated order quantities on one purchase order provided that:</P>
            <P>(i) The rated quantities are separately and clearly identified; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The four elements of a rated order, as required by § 33.32, are included on the order with the statement required in § 33.32(d) modified to read in substance:</P>

            <P>This purchase order contains rated order quantities certified for national defense use, and you are required to follow all the provisions of the Transportation Priorities and Allocations System regulations at 49 CFR Part 33 only as it pertains to the rated quantities.<PRTPAGE P="380"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) A supplier must accept or reject the rated portion of the purchase order as provided in § 33.33 and give preferential treatment only to the rated quantities as required by this part. This part may not be used to require preferential treatment for the unrated portion of the order.</P>
            <P>(3) Any supplier who believes that rated and unrated orders are being combined in a manner contrary to the intent of this part or in a fashion that causes undue or exceptional hardship may submit a request for adjustment or exception under § 33.80.</P>
            <P>(e) A person may place a rated order for the minimum commercially procurable quantity even if the quantity needed to fill a rated order is less than that minimum. However, a person must combine rated orders as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if possible, to obtain minimum procurable quantities.</P>
            <P>(f) A person is not required to place a priority rating on an order for less than $75,000, or one-half of the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (as established in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) (see FAR section 2.101) or in other authorized acquisition regulatory or management systems), whichever amount is greater, provided that delivery can be obtained in a timely fashion without the use of the priority rating.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) TPAS is designed to be largely self-executing. However, from time-to-time production or delivery problems will arise. In this event, a person should immediately contact DOT's Defense Production Act Activities Coordinator, Office of Intelligence, Security, and Emergency Response, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20590, for guidance or assistance. If the problem(s) cannot otherwise be resolved, special priorities assistance should be sought from the Department of Transportation through the Director, Office of Intelligence, Security, and Emergency Response, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20590. If the Department of Transportation is unable to resolve the problem or to authorize the use of a priority rating and believes additional assistance is warranted, the Department of Transportation may forward the request to another resource agency, as appropriate, for action. Special priorities assistance is a service provided to alleviate problems that do arise.</P>
            <P>(b) Special priorities assistance is available for any reason consistent with this part. Generally, special priorities assistance is provided to expedite deliveries, resolve delivery conflicts, place rated orders, locate suppliers, or to verify information supplied by customers and vendors. Special priorities assistance may also be used to request rating authority for items that are not normally eligible for priority treatment.</P>
            <P>(c) A request for special priorities assistance or priority rating authority must be submitted on Form OST F 1254 (OMB control number to be inserted in the subsequent final rule) to the Defense Production Act Activities Coordinator, Office of Intelligence, Security, and Emergency Response, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20590. Form OST F 1254 may be obtained from the Department of Transportation or a Delegate Agency. A sample Form OST F 1254 is attached at Appendix I to this part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requests for priority rating authority.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If a rated order is likely to be delayed because a person is unable to obtain items or services not normally rated under this part, the person may request the authority to use a priority rating in ordering the needed items or services.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Rating authority for production or construction equipment.</E> (1) A request for priority rating authority for production or construction equipment must be submitted to the U.S. Department of Commerce on FORM BIS-999. (See 15 CFR 700.51).</P>
            <P>(2) When the use of a priority rating is authorized for the procurement of production or construction equipment, a rated order may be used either to purchase or to lease such equipment. However, in the latter case, the equipment may be leased only from a person engaged in the business of leasing such equipment or from a person willing to lease rather than sell.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Rating authority in advance of a rated prime contract.</E> (1) In certain cases and upon specific request, the Department of Transportation, in order to promote the national defense, may authorize a person to place a priority rating on an order to a supplier in advance of the issuance of a rated prime contract. In these instances, the person requesting advance rating authority must obtain sponsorship of the request from the Department of Transportation or the appropriate Delegate Agency. The person shall also assume any business risk associated with the placing of rated orders if these orders have to be cancelled in the event the rated prime contract is not issued.</P>
            <P>(2) The person must state the following in the request:</P>

            <P>It is understood that the authorization of a priority rating in advance of our receiving a rated prime contract from the Department of Transportation and our use of that priority rating with our suppliers in no way commits the Department of Transportation or any other government agency to <PRTPAGE P="382"/>enter into a contract or order or to expend funds. Further, we understand that the Federal Government shall not be liable for any cancellation charges, termination costs, or other damages that may accrue if a rated prime contract is not eventually placed and, as a result, we must subsequently cancel orders placed with the use of the priority rating authorized as a result of this request.</P>
            <P>(3) In reviewing requests for rating authority in advance of a rated prime contract, the Department of Transportation will consider, among other things, the following criteria:</P>
            <P>(i) The probability that the prime contract will be awarded;</P>
            <P>(ii) The impact of the resulting rated orders on suppliers and on other authorized programs;</P>
            <P>(iii) Whether the contractor is the sole source;</P>
            <P>(iv) Whether the item being produced has a long lead time; and</P>
            <P>(v) The time period for which the rating is being requested.</P>
            <P>(4) The Department of Transportation may require periodic reports on the use of the rating authority granted under paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(5) If a rated prime contract is not issued, the person shall promptly notify all suppliers who have received rated orders pursuant to the advanced rating authority that the priority rating on those orders is cancelled.</P>

            <P>(1) A person is experiencing difficulty in obtaining delivery against a rated order by the required delivery date; or</P>
            <P>(2) A person cannot locate a supplier for an item or service needed to fill a rated order.</P>
            <P>(b) Other examples of special priorities assistance include:</P>
            <P>(1) Ensuring that rated orders receive preferential treatment by suppliers;</P>
            <P>(2) Resolving production or delivery conflicts between various rated orders;</P>

            <P>(a) A public entity shall construct any new facility to be used in providing designated public transportation services so that the facility is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs. This requirement also applies to the construction of a new station for use in intercity or commuter rail transportation. For purposes of this section, a facility or station is “new” if its construction begins (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, issuance of notice to proceed) after January 25, 1992, or, in the case of intercity or commuter rail stations, after October 7, 1991.</P>

Full compliance will be considered structurally impracticable only in those rare circumstances when the unique characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility features.</P>
            <P>(2) If full compliance with this section would be structurally impracticable, compliance with this section is required to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable. In that case, any portion of the facility that can be made accessible shall be made accessible to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable.</P>

            <P>(3) If providing accessibility in conformance with this section to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., <PRTPAGE P="409"/>those who use wheelchairs) would be structurally impracticable, accessibility shall nonetheless be ensured to persons with other types of disabilities (e.g., those who use crutches or who have sight, hearing, or mental impairments) in accordance with this section.</P>

            <P>(a) In addition to meeting the requirements of sections 37.9 and 37.41, an operator of a commuter, intercity, or high-speed rail system must ensure, at stations that are approved for entry into final design or that begin construction or alteration of platforms on or after February 1, 2012, that the following performance standard is met: individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, must have access to all accessible cars available to passengers without disabilities in each train using the station.</P>
            <P>(b) For new or altered stations serving commuter, intercity, or high-speed rail lines or systems, in which no track passing through the station and adjacent to platforms is shared with existing freight rail operations, the performance standard of paragraph (a) of this section must be met by providing level-entry boarding to all accessible cars in each train that serves the station.</P>
            <P>(c) For new or altered stations serving commuter, intercity, or high-speed rail lines or systems, in which track passing through the station and adjacent to platforms is shared with existing freight rail operations, the railroad operator may comply with the performance standard of paragraph (a) by use of one or more of the following means:</P>
            <P>(1) Level-entry boarding;</P>
            <P>(2) Car-borne lifts;</P>
            <P>(3) Bridge plates, ramps or other appropriate devices;</P>
            <P>(4) Mini-high platforms, with multiple mini-high platforms or multiple train stops, as needed, to permit access to all accessible cars available at that station; or</P>
            <P>(5) Station-based lifts;</P>
            <P>(d) Before constructing or altering a platform at a station covered by paragraph (c) of this section, at which a railroad proposes to use a means other than level-entry boarding, the railroad must meet the following requirements:</P>
            <P>(1) If the railroad operator not using level-entry boarding chooses a means of meeting the performance standard other than using car-borne lifts, it must perform a comparison of the costs (capital, operating, and life-cycle costs) of car-borne lifts and the means chosen by the railroad operator, as well as a comparison of the relative ability of each of these alternatives to provide service to individuals with disabilities in an integrated, safe, timely, and reliable manner. The railroad operator must submit a copy of this analysis to FTA or FRA at the time it submits the plan required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) The railroad operator must submit a plan to FRA and/or FTA, describing its proposed means to meet the performance standard of paragraph (a) of this section at that station. The plan must demonstrate how boarding equipment or platforms would be deployed, maintained, and operated; and how personnel would be trained and deployed to ensure that service to individuals with disabilities is provided in an integrated, safe, timely, and reliable manner.</P>
            <P>(3) Before proceeding with constructing or modifying a station platform covered by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the railroad must obtain approval from the FTA (for commuter rail systems) or the FRA (for intercity rail systems). The agencies will evaluate the proposed plan and may approve, disapprove, or modify it. The FTA and the FRA may make this determination jointly in any situation in which both a commuter rail system and an intercity or high-speed rail system use the tracks serving the platform. FTA and FRA will respond to the railroad's plan in a timely manner, in accordance with the timetable set forth in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (d)(3)(iii) of this paragraph.</P>

            <P>(i) FTA/FRA will provide an initial written response within 30 days of receiving a railroad's written proposal. <PRTPAGE P="410"/>This response will say either that the submission is complete or that additional information is needed.</P>
            <P>(ii) Once a complete package, including any requested additional information, is received, as acknowledged by FRA/FTA in writing, FRA/FTA will provide a substantive response accepting, rejecting, or modifying the proposal within 120 days.</P>
            <P>(iii) If FTA/FRA needs additional time to consider the railroad's proposal, FRA/FTA will provide a written communication to the railroad setting forth the reasons for the delay and an estimate of the additional time (not to exceed an additional 60 days) that FRA/FTA expect to take to finalize a substantive response to the proposal.</P>
            <P>(iv) In reviewing the plan, FRA and FTA will consider factors including, but not limited to, how the proposal maximizes accessibility to individuals with disabilities, any obstacles to the use of a method that could provide better service to individuals with disabilities, the safety and reliability of the approach and related technology proposed to be used, the suitability of the means proposed to the station and line and/or system on which it would be used, and the adequacy of equipment and maintenance and staff training and deployment.</P>
            <P>(e) In any situation using a combination of high and low platforms, a commuter or intercity rail operator shall not employ a solution that has the effect of channeling passengers into a narrow space between the face of the higher-level platform and the edge of the lower platform.</P>

            <P>(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this paragraph, any obstructions on a platform (mini-high platforms, stairwells, elevator shafts, seats <E T="03">etc.</E>) shall be set at least six feet back from the edge of a platform.</P>
            <P>(2) If the six-foot clearance is not feasible (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> where such a clearance would create an insurmountable gap on a mini-high platform or where the physical structure of an existing station does not allow such clearance), barriers must be used to prevent the flow of pedestrian traffic through these narrower areas.</P>
            <P>(f) For purposes of this part, level-entry boarding means a boarding platform design in which the horizontal gap between a car at rest and the platform is no more than 10 inches on tangent track and 13 inches on curves and the vertical height of the car floor is no more than 5.5 inches above the boarding platform. Where the horizontal gap is more than 3 inches and/or the vertical gap is more than <FR>5/8</FR> inch, measured when the vehicle is at rest, the horizontal and vertical gaps between the car floor and the boarding platform must be mitigated by a bridge plate, ramp, or other appropriate device consistent with 49 CFR 38.95(c) and 38.125(c).</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 37.43</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Alteration of transportation facilities by public entities.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) When a public entity alters an existing facility or a part of an existing facility used in providing designated public transportation services in a way that affects or could affect the usability of the facility or part of the facility, the entity shall make the alterations (or ensure that the alterations are made) in such a manner, to the maximum extent feasible, that the altered portions of the facility are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, upon the completion of such alterations.</P>

            <P>(2) When a public entity undertakes an alteration that affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area of a facility containing a primary function, the entity shall make the alteration in such a manner that, to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered area and the bathrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, upon completion of the alterations. <E T="03">Provided,</E> that alterations to the path of travel, drinking fountains, telephones and bathrooms are not required to be made readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, if the cost and scope of doing so would be disproportionate.</P>

            <P>(3) The requirements of this paragraph also apply to the alteration of <PRTPAGE P="411"/>existing intercity or commuter rail stations by the responsible person for, owner of, or person in control of the station.</P>

            <P>(4) The requirements of this section apply to any alteration which begins (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, issuance of notice to proceed or work order, as applicable) after January 25, 1992, or, in the case of intercity and commuter rail stations, after October 7, 1991.</P>
            <P>(b) As used in this section, the phrase <E T="03">to the maximum extent feasible</E> applies to the occasional case where the nature of an existing facility makes it impossible to comply fully with applicable accessibility standards through a planned alteration. In these circumstances, the entity shall provide the maximum physical accessibility feasible. Any altered features of the facility or portion of the facility that can be made accessible shall be made accessible. If providing accessibility to certain individuals with disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs) would not be feasible, the facility shall be made accessible to individuals with other types of disabilities (e.g., those who use crutches, those who have impaired vision or hearing, or those who have other impairments).</P>
            <P>(c) As used in this section, a <E T="03">primary function</E> is a major activity for which the facility is intended. Areas of transportation facilities that involve primary functions include, but are not necessarily limited to, ticket purchase and collection areas, passenger waiting areas, train or bus platforms, baggage checking and return areas and employment areas (except those involving non-occupiable spaces accessed only by ladders, catwalks, crawl spaces, very narrow passageways, or freight (non-passenger) elevators which are frequented only by repair personnel).</P>
            <P>(d) As used in this section, a “path of travel” includes a continuous, unobstructed way of pedestrian passage by means of which the altered area may be approached, entered, and exited, and which connects the altered area with an exterior approach (including sidewalks, parking areas, and streets), an entrance to the facility, and other parts of the facility. The term also includes the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area. An accessible path of travel may include walks and sidewalks, curb ramps and other interior or exterior pedestrian ramps, clear floor paths through corridors, waiting areas, concourses, and other improved areas, parking access aisles, elevators and lifts, bridges, tunnels, or other passageways between platforms, or a combination of these and other elements.</P>
            <P>(e)(1) Alterations made to provide an accessible path of travel to the altered area will be deemed disproportionate to the overall alteration when the cost exceeds 20 percent of the cost of the alteration to the primary function area (without regard to the costs of accessibility modifications).</P>
            <P>(2) Costs that may be counted as expenditures required to provide an accessible path of travel include:</P>
            <P>(i) Costs associated with providing an accessible entrance and an accessible route to the altered area (e.g., widening doorways and installing ramps);</P>
            <P>(ii) Costs associated with making restrooms accessible (e.g., grab bars, enlarged toilet stalls, accessible faucet controls);</P>
            <P>(iii) Costs associated with providing accessible telephones (e.g., relocation of phones to an accessible height, installation of amplification devices or TDDs);</P>
            <P>(iv) Costs associated with relocating an inaccessible drinking fountain.</P>
            <P>(f)(1) When the cost of alterations necessary to make a path of travel to the altered area fully accessible is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration, then such areas shall be made accessible to the maximum extent without resulting in disproportionate costs;</P>
            <P>(2) In this situation, the public entity should give priority to accessible elements that will provide the greatest access, in the following order:</P>
            <P>(i) An accessible entrance;</P>
            <P>(ii) An accessible route to the altered area;</P>
            <P>(iii) At least one accessible restroom for each sex or a single unisex restroom (where there are one or more restrooms);</P>
            <P>(iv) Accessible telephones;</P>
            <P>(v) Accessible drinking fountains;<PRTPAGE P="412"/>
            </P>
            <P>(vi) When possible, other accessible elements (e.g., parking, storage, alarms).</P>
            <P>(g) If a public entity performs a series of small alterations to the area served by a single path of travel rather than making the alterations as part of a single undertaking, it shall nonetheless be responsible for providing an accessible path of travel.</P>
            <P>(h)(1) If an area containing a primary function has been altered without providing an accessible path of travel to that area, and subsequent alterations of that area, or a different area on the same path of travel, are undertaken within three years of the original alteration, the total cost of alteration to the primary function areas on that path of travel during the preceding three year period shall be considered in determining whether the cost of making that path of travel is disproportionate;</P>
            <P>(2) For the first three years after January 26, 1992, only alterations undertaken between that date and the date of the alteration at issue shall be considered in determining if the cost of providing accessible features is disproportionate to the overall cost of the alteration.</P>
            <P>(3) Only alterations undertaken after January 26, 1992, shall be considered in determining if the cost of providing an accessible path of travel is disproportionate to the overall cost of the alteration.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Key stations in light and rapid rail systems.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Each public entity that provides designated public transportation by means of a light or rapid rail system shall make key stations on its system readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs. This requirement is separate from and in addition to requirements set forth in § 37.43 of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) Each public entity shall determine which stations on its system are key stations. The entity shall identify key stations, using the planning and public participation process set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, and taking into consideration the following criteria:</P>
            <P>(1) Stations where passenger boardings exceed average station passenger boardings on the rail system by at least fifteen percent, unless such a station is close to another accessible station;</P>
            <P>(2) Transfer stations on a rail line or between rail lines;</P>
            <P>(3) Major interchange points with other transportation modes, including stations connecting with major parking facilities, bus terminals, intercity or commuter rail stations, passenger vessel terminals, or airports;</P>
            <P>(4) End stations, unless an end station is close to another accessible station; and</P>
            <P>(5) Stations serving major activity centers, such as employment or government centers, institutions of higher education, hospitals or other major health care facilities, or other facilities that are major trip generators for individuals with disabilities.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) Unless an entity receives an extension under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the public entity shall achieve accessibility of key stations as soon as possible, but in no case later than July 26, 1994.</P>
            <P>(2) The FTA Administrator may grant an extension of this completion date for key station accessibility for a period up to July 26, 2020, provided that two-thirds of key stations are made accessible by July 26, 2010. Extensions may be granted as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) The public entity shall develop a plan for compliance for this section. The plan shall be submitted to the appropriate FTA regional office by July 26, 1992. (See appendix B to this part for list.)</P>

            <P>(1) The public entity shall consult with individuals with disabilities affected by the plan. The public entity also shall hold at least one public hearing on the plan and solicit comments <PRTPAGE P="413"/>on it. The plan submitted to FTA shall document this public participation, including summaries of the consultation with individuals with disabilities and the comments received at the hearing and during the comment period. The plan also shall summarize the public entity's responses to the comments and consultation.</P>
            <P>(2) The plan shall establish milestones for the achievement of required accessibility of key stations, consistent with the requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) A public entity wishing to apply for an extension of the July 26, 1993, deadline for key station accessibility shall include a request for an extension with its plan submitted to FTA under paragraph (d) of this section. Extensions may be granted only with respect to key stations which need extraordinarily expensive structural changes to, or replacement of, existing facilities (e.g., installations of elevators, raising the entire passenger platform, or alterations of similar magnitude and cost). Requests for extensions shall provide for completion of key station accessibility within the time limits set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. The FTA Administrator may approve, approve with conditions, modify, or disapprove any request for an extension.</P>

            <P>(c) For purposes of this section, it shall be considered feasible to remanufacture a bus or other motor vehicle so as to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, unless an engineering analysis demonstrates that including accessibility features required by this part would have a significant adverse effect on the structural integrity of the vehicle.</P>
            <P>(d) If a public entity operates a fixed route system, any segment of which is included on the National Register of Historic Places, and if making a vehicle of historic character used solely on such segment readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities would significantly alter the historic character of such vehicle, the public entity has only to make (or purchase or lease a remanufactured vehicle with) those modifications to make the vehicle accessible which do not alter the historic character of such vehicle, in consultation with the National Register of Historic Places.</P>

            <P>(e) A public entity operating a fixed route system as described in paragraph (d) of this section may apply in writing to the FTA Administrator for a determination of the historic character of the vehicle.

Public entities operating demand responsive service receiving funds under any other section of the FT Act shall file the certificate with the appropriate FTA regional office. A public entity which does not receive FTA funds shall make such a certificate and retain it in its files, subject to inspection on request of FTA. All certificates under this paragraph may be made and filed in connection with a particular procurement or in advance of a procurement; however, no certificate shall be valid for more than one year. A copy of the required certificate is found in appendix C to this part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Acquisition of passenger rail cars by private entities primarily engaged in the business of transporting people.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) A private entity which is primarily engaged in the business of transporting people and whose operations affect commerce, which makes a solicitation after February 25, 1992, to purchase or lease a new rail passenger car to be used in providing specified public transportation, shall ensure that the car is readily accessible to, <PRTPAGE P="422"/>and usable by, individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs. The accessibility standards in part 38 of this title which apply depend upon the type of service in which the car will be used.</P>
            <P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a private entity which is primarily engaged in transporting people and whose operations affect commerce, which remanufactures a rail passenger car to be used in providing specified public transportation to extend its useful life for ten years or more, or purchases or leases such a remanufactured rail car, shall ensure that the rail car, to the maximum extent feasible, is made readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs. For purposes of this paragraph, it shall be considered feasible to remanufacture a rail passenger car to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, unless an engineering analysis demonstrates that doing so would have a significant adverse effect on the structural integrity of the car.</P>
            <P>(c) Compliance with paragraph (b) of this section is not required to the extent that it would significantly alter the historic or antiquated character of a historic or antiquated rail passenger car, or a rail station served exclusively by such cars, or would result in the violation of any rule, regulation, standard or order issued by the Secretary under the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970. For purposes of this section, a historic or antiquated rail passenger car means a rail passenger car—</P>
            <P>(1) Which is not less than 30 years old at the time of its use for transporting individuals;</P>
            <P>(2) The manufacturer of which is no longer in the business of manufacturing rail passenger cars; and</P>
            <P>(3) Which—</P>
            <P>(i) Has a consequential association with events or persons significant to the past; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Embodies, or is being restored to embody, the distinctive characteristics of a type of rail passenger car used in the past, or to represent a time period which has passed.</P>

            <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, each public entity operating a fixed route system shall provide paratransit or other special service to individuals with disabilities that is comparable to the level of service provided to individuals without disabilities who use the fixed route system.</P>
            <P>(b) To be deemed comparable to fixed route service, a complementary paratransit system shall meet the requirements of §§ 37.123-37.133 of this subpart.

            <P>(a) Public entities required by § 37.121 of this subpart to provide complementary paratransit service shall provide the service to the ADA paratransit eligible individuals described in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) If an individual meets the eligibility criteria of this section with respect to some trips but not others, the individual shall be ADA paratransit eligible only for those trips for which he or she meets the criteria.</P>
            <P>(c) Individuals may be ADA paratransit eligible on the basis of a permanent or temporary disability.</P>

            <P>(d) Public entities may provide complementary paratransit service to persons other than ADA paratransit eligible individuals. However, only the cost of service to ADA paratransit eligible <PRTPAGE P="423"/>individuals may be considered in a public entity's request for an undue financial burden waiver under §§ 37.151-37.155 of this part.</P>
            <P>(e) The following individuals are ADA paratransit eligible:</P>
            <P>(1) Any individual with a disability who is unable, as the result of a physical or mental impairment (including a vision impairment), and without the assistance of another individual (except the operator of a wheelchair lift or other boarding assistance device), to board, ride, or disembark from any vehicle on the system which is readily accessible to and usable individuals with disabilities.</P>
            <P>(2) Any individual with a disability who needs the assistance of a wheelchair lift or other boarding assistance device and is able, with such assistance, to board, ride and disembark from any vehicle which is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities if the individual wants to travel on a route on the system during the hours of operation of the system at a time, or within a reasonable period of such time, when such a vehicle is not being used to provide designated public transportation on the route.</P>
            <P>(i) An individual is eligible under this paragraph with respect to travel on an otherwise accessible route on which the boarding or disembarking location which the individual would use is one at which boarding or disembarking from the vehicle is precluded as provided in § 37.167(g) of this part.</P>
            <P>(ii) An individual using a common wheelchair is eligible under this paragraph if the individual's wheelchair cannot be accommodated on an existing vehicle (e.g., because the vehicle's lift does not meet the standards of part 38 of this title), even if that vehicle is accessible to other individuals with disabilities and their mobility wheelchairs.</P>
            <P>(iii) With respect to rail systems, an individual is eligible under this paragraph if the individual could use an accessible rail system, but—</P>
            <P>(A) There is not yet one accessible car per train on the system; or</P>
            <P>(B) Key stations have not yet been made accessible.</P>
            <P>(3) Any individual with a disability who has a specific impairment-related condition which prevents such individual from traveling to a boarding location or from a disembarking location on such system.</P>
            <P>(i) Only a specific impairment-related condition which prevents the individual from traveling to a boarding location or from a disembarking location is a basis for eligibility under this paragraph. A condition which makes traveling to boarding location or from a disembarking location more difficult for a person with a specific impairment-related condition than for an individual who does not have the condition, but does not prevent the travel, is not a basis for eligibility under this paragraph.</P>
            <P>(ii) Architectural barriers not under the control of the public entity providing fixed route service and environmental barriers (e.g., distance, terrain, weather) do not, standing alone, form a basis for eligibility under this paragraph. The interaction of such barriers with an individual's specific impairment-related condition may form a basis for eligibility under this paragraph, if the effect is to prevent the individual from traveling to a boarding location or from a disembarking location.</P>
            <P>(f) Individuals accompanying an ADA paratransit eligible individual shall be provided service as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) One other individual accompanying the ADA paratransit eligible individual shall be provided service—</P>
            <P>(i) If the ADA paratransit eligible individual is traveling with a personal care attendant, the entity shall provide service to one other individual in addition to the attendant who is accompanying the eligible individual;</P>
            <P>(ii) A family member or friend is regarded as a person accompanying the eligible individual, and not as a personal care attendant, unless the family member or friend registered is acting in the capacity of a personal care attendant;</P>

            <P>(2) Additional individuals accompanying the ADA paratransit eligible individual shall be provided service, provided that space is available for <PRTPAGE P="424"/>them on the paratransit vehicle carrying the ADA paratransit eligible individual and that transportation of the additional individuals will not result in a denial of service to ADA paratransit eligible individuals;</P>
            <P>(3) In order to be considered as “accompanying” the eligible individual for purposes of this paragraph (f), the other individual(s) shall have the same origin and destination as the eligible individual.</P>

            <P>Each public entity required to provide complementary paratransit service by § 37.121 of this part shall establish a process for determining ADA paratransit eligibility.</P>
            <P>(a) The process shall strictly limit ADA paratransit eligibility to individuals specified in § 37.123 of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) All information about the process, materials necessary to apply for eligibility, and notices and determinations concerning eligibility shall be made available in accessible formats, upon request.</P>
            <P>(c) If, by a date 21 days following the submission of a complete application, the entity has not made a determination of eligibility, the applicant shall be treated as eligible and provided service until and unless the entity denies the application.</P>
            <P>(d) The entity's determination concerning eligibility shall be in writing. If the determination is that the individual is ineligible, the determination shall state the reasons for the finding.</P>
            <P>(e) The public entity shall provide documentation to each eligible individual stating that he or she is “ADA Paratransit Eligible.” The documentation shall include the name of the eligible individual, the name of the transit provider, the telephone number of the entity's paratransit coordinator, an expiration date for eligibility, and any conditions or limitations on the individual's eligibility including the use of a personal care attendant.</P>
            <P>(f) The entity may require recertification of the eligibility of ADA paratransit eligible individuals at reasonable intervals.</P>
            <P>(g) The entity shall establish an administrative appeal process through which individuals who are denied eligibility can obtain review of the denial.</P>
            <P>(1) The entity may require that an appeal be filed within 60 days of the denial of an individual's application.</P>

            <P>(2) The process shall include an opportunity to be heard and to present information and arguments, separation of functions (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, a decision by a person not involved with the initial decision to deny eligibility), and written notification of the decision, and the reasons for it.</P>
            <P>(3) The entity is not required to provide paratransit service to the individual pending the determination on appeal. However, if the entity has not made a decision within 30 days of the completion of the appeal process, the entity shall provide paratransit service from that time until and unless a decision to deny the appeal is issued.</P>
            <P>(h) The entity may establish an administrative process to suspend, for a reasonable period of time, the provision of complementary paratransit service to ADA eligible individuals who establish a pattern or practice of missing scheduled trips.</P>
            <P>(1) Trips missed by the individual for reasons beyond his or her control (including, but not limited to, trips which are missed due to operator error) shall not be a basis for determining that such a pattern or practice exists.</P>
            <P>(2) Before suspending service, the entity shall take the following steps:</P>
            <P>(i) Notify the individual in writing that the entity proposes to suspend service, citing with specificity the basis of the proposed suspension and setting forth the proposed sanction.</P>
            <P>(ii) Provide the individual an opportunity to be heard and to present information and arguments;</P>
            <P>(iii) Provide the individual with written notification of the decision and the reasons for it.</P>
            <P>(3) The appeals process of paragraph (g) of this section is available to an individual on whom sanctions have been imposed under this paragraph. The sanction is stayed pending the outcome of the appeal.</P>
            <P>(i) In applications for ADA paratransit eligibility, the entity may require the applicant to indicate whether or not he or she travels with a personal care attendant.</P>

            <P>(ii) Within the core service area, the entity also shall provide service to small areas not inside any of the corridors but which are surrounded by corridors.</P>
            <P>(iii) Outside the core service area, the entity may designate corridors with widths from three-fourths of a mile up to one and one half miles on each side of a fixed route, based on local circumstances.</P>
            <P>(iv) For purposes of this paragraph, the core service area is that area in which corridors with a width of three-fourths of a mile on each side of each fixed route merge together such that, with few and small exceptions, all origins and destinations within the area would be served.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Rail.</E> (i) For rail systems, the service area shall consist of a circle with a radius of <FR>3/4</FR> of a mile around each station.</P>
            <P>(ii) At end stations and other stations in outlying areas, the entity may designate circles with radii of up to 1<FR>1/2</FR> miles as part of its service area, based on local circumstances.</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Fares.</E> The fare for a trip charged to an ADA paratransit eligible user of the complementary paratransit service shall not exceed twice the fare that would be charged to an individual paying full fare (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, without regard to discounts) for a trip of similar length, at a similar time of day, on the entity's fixed route system.</P>
            <P>(1) In calculating the full fare that would be paid by an individual using the fixed route system, the entity may include transfer and premium charges applicable to a trip of similar length, at a similar time of day, on the fixed route system.</P>

            <P>(1) If an entity has met and is continuing to meet all requirements for complementary paratransit in §§ 37.121-37.133 of this part, the entity may submit to FTA an annual certification of continued compliance in lieu of a plan update. Entities that have submitted a joint plan under § 37.141 may submit a joint certification under this paragraph.

            <SUBJECT>Waiver for undue financial burden.</SUBJECT>
            <P>If compliance with the service criteria of § 37.131 of this part creates an undue financial burden, an entity may request a waiver from all or some of the provisions if the entity has complied with the public participation requirements in § 37.137 of this part and if the following conditions apply:</P>
            <P>(a) At the time of submission of the initial plan on January 26, 1992—</P>
            <P>(1) The entity determines that it cannot meet all of the service criteria by January 26, 1997; or</P>
            <P>(2) The entity determines that it cannot make measured progress toward compliance in any year before full compliance is required. For purposes of this part, measured progress means implementing milestones as scheduled, such as incorporating an additional paratransit service criterion or improving an aspect of a specific service criterion.</P>
            <P>(b) At the time of its annual plan update submission, if the entity believes that circumstances have changed since its last submission, and it is no longer able to comply by January 26, 1997, or make measured progress in any year before 1997, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>FTA waiver determination.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The Administrator will determine whether to grant a waiver for undue financial burden on a case-by-case basis, after considering the factors identified <PRTPAGE P="432"/>in § 37.155 of this part and the information accompanying the request. If necessary, the Administrator will return the application with a request for additional information.</P>
            <P>(b) Any waiver granted will be for a limited and specified period of time.</P>
            <P>(c) If the Administrator grants the applicant a waiver, the Administrator will do one of the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Require the public entity to provide complementary paratransit to the extent it can do so without incurring an undue financial burden. The entity shall make changes in its plan that the Administrator determines are appropriate to maximize the complementary paratransit service that is provided to ADA paratransit eligible individuals. When making changes to its plan, the entity shall use the public participation process specified for plan development and shall consider first a reduction in number of trips provided to each ADA paratransit eligible person per month, while attempting to meet all other service criteria.</P>
            <P>(2) Require the public entity to provide basic complementary paratransit services to all ADA paratransit eligible individuals, even if doing so would cause the public entity to incur an undue financial burden. Basic complementary paratransit service in corridors defined as provided in § 37.131(a) along the public entity's key routes during core service hours.</P>
            <P>(i) For purposes of this section, key routes are defined as routes along which there is service at least hourly throughout the day.</P>
            <P>(ii) For purposes of this section, core service hours encompass at least peak periods, as these periods are defined locally for fixed route service, consistent with industry practice.</P>
            <P>(3) If the Administrator determines that the public entity will incur an undue financial burden as the result of providing basic complementary paratransit service, such that it is infeasible for the entity to provide basic complementary paratransit service, the Administrator shall require the public entity to coordinate with other available providers of demand responsive service in the area served by the public entity to maximize the service to ADA paratransit eligible individuals to the maximum extent feasible.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 37.155</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Factors in decision to grant an undue financial burden waiver.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In making an undue financial burden determination, the FTA Administrator will consider the following factors:</P>
            <P>(1) Effects on current fixed route service, including reallocation of accessible fixed route vehicles and potential reduction in service, measured by service miles;</P>
            <P>(2) Average number of trips made by the entity's general population, on a per capita basis, compared with the average number of trips to be made by registered ADA paratransit eligible persons, on a per capita basis;</P>
            <P>(3) Reductions in other services, including other special services;</P>
            <P>(4) Increases in fares;</P>
            <P>(5) Resources available to implement complementary paratransit service over the period covered by the plan;</P>
            <P>(6) Percentage of budget needed to implement the plan, both as a percentage of operating budget and a percentage of entire budget;</P>
            <P>(7) The current level of accessible service, both fixed route and paratransit;</P>
            <P>(8) Cooperation/coordination among area transportation providers;</P>
            <P>(9) Evidence of increased efficiencies, that have been or could be effectuated, that would benefit the level and quality of available resources for complementary paratransit service; and</P>
            <P>(10) Unique circumstances in the submitting entity's area that affect the ability of the entity to provide paratransit, that militate against the need to provide paratransit, or in some other respect create a circumstance considered exceptional by the submitting entity.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) Costs attributable to complementary paratransit shall be limited to costs of providing service specifically required by this part to ADA paratransit eligible individuals, by entities responsible under this part for providing such service.</P>

            <P>(2) If the entity determines that it is impracticable to distinguish between trips mandated by the ADA and other trips on a trip-by-trip basis, the entity <PRTPAGE P="433"/>shall attribute to ADA complementary paratransit requirements a percentage of its overall paratransit costs. This percentage shall be determined by a statistically valid methodology that determines the percentage of trips that are required by this part. The entity shall submit information concerning its methodology and the data on which its percentage is based with its request for a waiver. Only costs attributable to ADA-mandated trips may be considered with respect to a request for an undue financial burden waiver.</P>
            <P>(3) Funds to which the entity would be legally entitled, but which, as a matter of state or local funding arrangements, are provided to another entity and used by that entity to provide paratransit service which is part of a coordinated system of paratransit meeting the requirements of this part, may be counted in determining the burden associated with the waiver request.</P>

            <P>(c) Requests for modification of a public entity's policies and practices may be denied only on one or more of the following grounds:</P>
            <P>(1) Granting the request would fundamentally alter the nature of the entity's services, programs, or activities;</P>
            <P>(2) Granting the request would create a direct threat to the health or safety of others;</P>

            </P>
            <P>(a) By October 30, 2006 no less than 50 percent of the buses in its fleet with which it provides fixed-route service are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs.</P>

            <P>(1) Whether the operator has purchased or leased, since October 30, 2000, enough new OTRBs to replace 50 percent of the OTRBs with which it provides fixed-route service by October 30, 2006 or 100 percent of such OTRBs by October 29, 2012;</P>
            <P>(2) Whether the operator has purchased or leased, between October 28, 1998 and October 30, 2000, a number of new inaccessible OTRBs significantly exceeding the number of buses it would normally obtain in such a period;</P>
            <P>(3) The compliance with all requirements of this part by the operator over the period between October 28, 1998 and the request for time extension.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Interline service.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) When the general public can purchase a ticket or make a reservation with one operator for a fixed-route trip of two or more stages in which another operator provides service, the first operator must arrange for an accessible bus, or equivalent service, as applicable, to be provided for each stage of the trip to a passenger with a disability. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (a):
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
              <P>By going to Operator X's ticket office or calling X for a reservation, a passenger can buy or reserve a ticket from Point A through to Point C, transferring at intermediate Point B to a bus operated by Operator Y. Operator X is responsible for communicating immediately with Operator Y to ensure that Y knows that a passenger needing accessible transportation or equivalent service, as applicable, is traveling from Point B to Point C. By immediate communication, we mean that the ticket or reservation agent for Operator X, by phone, fax, computer, or other instantaneous means, contacts Operator Y the minute the reservation or ticketing transaction with the passenger, as applicable, has been completed. It is the responsibility of each carrier to know how to contact carriers with which it interlines (e.g., Operator X must know Operator Y's phone number).</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
              <P>Operator X fails to provide the required information in a timely manner to Operator Y. Operator X is responsible for compensating the passenger for the consequent unavailability of an accessible bus or equivalent service, as applicable, on the B-C leg of the interline trip.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            

            <P>(b) Each operator retains the responsibility for providing the transportation required by this subpart to the passenger for its portion of an interline trip. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (b):
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
              <P>In Example 1 to paragraph (a) of this section, Operator X provides the required information to Operator Y in a timely fashion. However, Operator Y fails to provide an accessible bus or equivalent service to the passenger at Point B as the rules require. Operator Y is responsible for compensating the passenger as provided in § 37.199.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>

              <P>Operator X provides the required information to Operator Y in a timely fashion. However, the rules require Operator Y to provide an accessible bus on 48 hours' advance notice (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, as a matter of interim service under § 37.193(a) or service by a small mixed-service operator under § 37.191), and the passenger has purchased the ticket or made the reservation for the interline trip only 8 hours before Operator Y's bus leaves from Point B to go to Point C. In this situation, Operator Y is not responsible for providing an accessible bus to the passenger at Point B, any more than that it would be had the passenger directly contacted Operator Y to travel from Point B to Point C.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            

            <P>(c) All fixed-route operators involved in interline service shall ensure that they have the capacity to receive communications at all times concerning interline service for passengers with disabilities. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (c):
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>

              <P>Operator Y's office is staffed only during normal weekday business hours. Operator Y must have a means of receiving communications from carriers with which it <PRTPAGE P="438"/>interlines (e.g., telephone answering machine, fax, computer) when no one is in the office.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
              <P>Operator Y has the responsibility to monitor its communications devices at reasonable intervals to ensure that it can act promptly on the basis of messages received. If Operator Y receives a message from Operator X on its answering machine on Friday night, notifying Y of the need for an accessible bus on Monday morning, it has the responsibility of making sure that the accessible bus is there on Monday morning. Operator Y is not excused from its obligation because no one checked the answering machine over the weekend.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Service requirement for OTRB demand-responsive systems.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This section applies to private entities primarily in the business of transporting people, whose operations affect commerce, and that provide demand-responsive OTRB service. Except as needed to meet the other requirements of this section, these entities are not required to purchase or lease accessible buses in connection with providing demand-responsive service.</P>
            <P>(b) Demand-responsive operators shall ensure that, beginning one year from the date on which the requirements of this subpart begin to apply to the entity, any individual with a disability who requests service in an accessible OTRB receives such service. This requirement applies to both large and small operators.</P>
            <P>(c) The operator may require up to 48 hours' advance notice to provide this service.</P>
            <P>(d) If the individual with a disability does not provide the advance notice the operator requires under paragraph (a) of this section, the operator shall nevertheless provide the service if it can do so by making a reasonable effort.</P>

            <P>(e) To meet this requirement, an operator is not required to fundamentally alter its normal reservation policies or to displace another passenger who has reserved a seat on the bus. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (e):
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
              <P>A tour bus operator requires all passengers to reserve space on the bus three months before the trip date. This requirement applies to passengers with disabilities on the same basis as other passengers. Consequently, an individual passenger who is a wheelchair user would have to request an accessible bus at the time he or she made his reservation, at least three months before the trip date. If the individual passenger with a disability makes a request for space on the trip and an accessible OTRB 48 hours before the trip date, the operator could refuse the request because all passengers were required to make reservations three months before the trip date.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
              <P>A group makes a reservation to charter a bus for a trip four weeks in advance. A week before the trip date, the group discovers that someone who signed up for the trip is a wheelchair user who needs an accessible bus, or someone who later buys a seat in the block of seats the group has reserved needs an accessible bus. A group representative or the passenger with a disability informs the bus company of this need more than 48 hours before the trip date. The bus company must provide an accessible bus.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 3.</HD>
              <P>While the operator's normal deadline for reserving space on a charter or tour trip has passed, a number of seats for a trip are unfilled. The operator permits members of the public to make late reservations for the unfilled seats. If a passenger with a disability calls 48 hours before the trip is scheduled to leave and requests a seat and the provision of an accessible OTRB, the operator must meet this request, as long as it does not displace another passenger with a reservation.</P>

              <P>A tour bus trip is nearly sold out three weeks in advance of the trip date. A passenger with a disability calls 48 hours before the trip is scheduled to leave and requests a seat and the provision of an accessible OTRB. The operator need not meet this request if it will have the effect of displacing a passenger with an existing reservation. If other passengers would not be displaced, the operator must meet this request.</P>

            <P>(1) Beginning one year from the date on which the requirements of this subpart begin to apply to the operator, it shall ensure that any individual with a disability that requests service in an accessible OTRB receives such service.</P>
            <P>(i) The operator may require up to 48 hours' advance notice to provide this service.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the individual with a disability does not provide the advance notice the operator requires, the operator shall nevertheless provide the service if it can do so by making a reasonable effort.</P>
            <P>(iii) If the trip on which the person with a disability wishes to travel is already provided by an accessible bus, the operator has met this requirement.</P>
            <P>(2) Interim service under this paragraph (a) is not required to be provided by a small operator who is providing equivalent service to its fixed-route service as provided in § 37.183(b)(2).</P>
            <P>(b) Some small fixed-route operators may never have a fleet 100 percent of which consists of accessible buses (e.g., a small fixed-route operator who exclusively or primarily purchases or leases used buses). Such an operator must continue to comply with the requirements of this section with respect to any service that is not provided entirely with accessible buses.</P>

            <P>The Department of Transportation, in § 37.9 of this part, adopts as its regulatory standards for accessible transportation facilities the revised Americans with Disabilities Act Guidelines (ADAGG) issued by the Access Board on July 23, 2004. The ADAGG is codified in the Code of Federal Regulations in Appendices B and D of 36 CFR part 1191. Note the ADAAG may also be found via a hyperlink on the Internet at the following address: <E T="03">http://www.access-board.gov/ada-aba/final.htm.</E> Like all regulations, the ADAAG also can be found by using the electronic Code of Federal Regulations at <E T="03">http://www.gpoaccess.gov/ecfr.</E> Because the ADAAG has been established as a Federal consensus standard by the Access Board, the Department is not republishing the regulations in their entirety, but is adopting them by cross-reference as permitted under 1 CFR 21.21(c)(4). In a few instances, the Department has modified the language of the ADAAG as it applies to entities subject to 49 CFR part 37. These entities must comply with the modified language in this Appendix rather than the language of Appendices B and D to 36 CFR part 1191.</P>

Elements such as ramps, elevators, or other circulation devices, fare vending or other ticketing areas, and fare collection areas shall be placed to minimize the distance which wheelchair users and other persons who cannot negotiate steps may have to travel compared to the general public.<PRTPAGE P="444"/>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix D to Part 37—Construction and Interpretation of Provisions of 49 CFR Part 37</HD>
            <P>This appendix explains the Department's construction and interpretation of provisions of 49 CFR part 37. It is intended to be used as definitive guidance concerning the meaning and implementation of these provisions. The appendix is organized on a section-by-section basis. Some sections of the rule are not discussed in the appendix, because they are self-explanatory or we do not currently have interpretive material to provide concerning them.</P>

            <P>The Department also provides guidance by other means, such as manuals and letters. The Department intends to update this Appendix periodically to include guidance, provided in response to inquiries about specific situations, that is of general relevance or interest.<PRTPAGE P="446"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Amendments to 49 CFR Part 27</HD>
            <P>Section 27.67(d) has been revised to reference the Access Board facility guidelines (found in appendix A to part 37) as well as the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standard (UFAS). This change was made to ensure consistency between requirements under section 504 and the ADA. Several caveats relating to the application of UFAS (e.g., that spaces not used by the public or likely to result in the employment of individuals with disabilities would not have to meet the standards) have been deleted. It is the Department's understanding that provisions of the Access Board standards and part 37 make them unnecessary.</P>
            <P>The Department is aware that there is a transition period between the publication of this rule and the effective date of many of its provisions (e.g., concerning facilities and paratransit services) during which section 504 remains the basic authority for accessibility modifications. In this interval, the Department expects recipients' compliance with section 504 to look forward to compliance with the ADA provisions. That is, if a recipient is making a decision about the shape of its paratransit service between the publication of this rule and January 26, 1992, the decision should be in the direction of service that will help to comply with post-January 1992 requirements. A recipient that severely curtailed its present paratransit service in October, and then asked for a three- or five-year phase-in of service under its paratransit plan, would not be acting consistent with this policy.</P>
            <P>Likewise, the Department would view with disfavor any attempt by a recipient to accelerate the beginning of the construction, installation or alteration of a facility to before January 26, 1992, to “beat the clock” and avoid the application of this rule's facility standards. The Department would be very reluctant to approve grants, contracts, exemption requests etc., that appear to have this effect. The purpose of the Department's administration of section 504 is to ensure compliance with the national policy stated in the ADA, not to permit avoidance of it.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Subpart A—General</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.3 Definitions</HD>
            <P>The definition of “commuter authority” includes a list of commuter rail operators drawn from a statutory reference in the ADA. It should be noted that this list is not exhaustive. Other commuter rail operators (e.g., in Chicago or San Francisco) would also be encompassed by this definition.</P>
            <P>The definition of “commuter bus service” is important because the ADA does not require complementary paratransit to be provided with respect to commuter bus service operated by public entities. The rationale that may be inferred for the statutory exemption for this kind of service concerns its typical characteristics (e.g., no attempt to comprehensively cover a service area, limited route structure, limited origins and destinations, interface with another mode of transportation, limited purposes of travel). These characteristics can be found in some transportation systems other than bus systems oriented toward work trips. For example, bus service that is used as a dedicated connecter to commuter or intercity rail service, certain airport shuttles, and university bus systems share many or all of these characteristics. As explained further in the discussion of subpart B, the Department has determined that it is appropriate to cover these services with the requirements applicable to commuter bus systems.</P>
            <P>The definitions of “designated public transportation” and “specified public transportation” exclude transportation by aircraft. Persons interested in matters concerning access to air travel for individuals with disabilities should refer to 14 CFR part 382, the Department's regulation implementing the Air Carrier Access Act. Since the facility requirements of this part refer to facilities involved in the provision of designated or specified public transportation, airport facilities are not covered by this part. DOJ makes clear that public and private airport facilities are covered under its title II and title III regulations, respectively.</P>
            <P>The examples given in the definition of “facility” all relate to ground transportation. We would point out that, since transportation by passenger vessels is covered by this rule and by DOJ rules, such vessel-related facilities as docks, wharfs, vessel terminals, etc. fall under this definition. It is intended that specific requirements for vessels and related facilities will be set forth in future rulemaking.</P>
            <P>The definitions of “fixed route system” and “demand responsive system” derive directly from the ADA's definitions of these terms. Some systems, like a typical city bus system or a dial-a-ride van system, fit clearly into one category or the other. Other systems may not so clearly fall into one of the categories. Nevertheless, because how a system is categorized has consequences for the requirements it must meet, entities must determine, on a case-by-case basis, into which category their systems fall.</P>
            <P>In making this determination, one of the key factors to be considered is whether the individual, in order to use the service, must request the service, typically by making a call.</P>

            <P>With fixed route service, no action by the individual is needed to initiate public transportation. If an individual is at a bus stop at the time the bus is scheduled to appear, then that individual will be able to access the transportation system. With demand-<PRTPAGE P="447"/>reponsive service, an additional step must be taken by the individual before he or she can ride the bus, i.e., the individual must make a telephone call.
            </P>
            <PARAUTH>(S. Rept. 101-116 at 54).</PARAUTH>
            
            <P>Other factors, such as the presence or absence of published schedules, or the variation of vehicle intervals in anticipation of differences in usage, are less important in making the distinction between the two types of service. If a service is provided along a given route, and a vehicle will arrive at certain times regardless of whether a passenger actively requests the vehicle, the service in most cases should be regarded as fixed route rather than demand responsive.</P>
            <P>At the same time, the fact that there is an interaction between a passenger and transportation service does not necessarily make the service demand responsive. For many types of service (e.g., intercity bus, intercity rail) which are clearly fixed route, a passenger has to interact with an agent to buy a ticket. Some services (e.g., certain commuter bus or commuter rail operations) may use flag stops, in which a vehicle along the route does not stop unless a passenger flags the vehicle down. A traveler staying at a hotel usually makes a room reservation before hopping on the hotel shuttle. This kind of interaction does not make an otherwise fixed route service demand responsive.</P>
            <P>On the other hand, we would regard a system that permits user-initiated deviations from routes or schedules as demand-responsive. For example, if a rural public transit system (e.g., a recipient of funds under 49 U.S.C. 5311) has a few fixed routes, the fixed route portion of its system would be subject to the requirements of subpart F for complementary paratransit service. If the entity changed its system so that it operated as a route-deviation system, we would regard it as a demand responsive system. Such a system would not be subject to complementary paratransit requirements.</P>

            <P>The definition of “individual with a disability” excludes someone who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs, when a covered entity is acting on the basis of such use. This concept is more important in employment and public accommodations contexts than it is in transportation, and is discussed at greater length in the DOJ and EEOC rules. Essentially, the definition says that, although drug addiction (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the status or a diagnosis of being a drug abuser) is a disability, no one is regarded as being an individual with a disability on the basis of current illegal drug use.</P>
            <P>Moreover, even if an individual has a disability, a covered entity can take action against the individual if that individual is currently engaging in illegal drug use. For example, if a person with a mobility or vision impairment is ADA paratransit eligible, but is caught possessing or using cocaine or marijuana on a paratransit vehicle, the transit provider can deny the individual further eligibility. If the individual has successfully undergone rehabilitation or is no longer using drugs, as explained in the preamble to the DOJ rules, the transit provider could not continue to deny eligibility on the basis that the individual was a former drug user or still was diagnosed as a person with a substance abuse problem.</P>
            <P>We defined “paratransit” in order to note its specialized usage in the rule. Part 37 uses this term to refer to the complementary paratransit service comparable to public fixed route systems which must be provided. Typically, paratransit is provided in a demand responsive mode. Obviously, the rule refers to a wide variety of demand responsive services that are not “paratransit,” in this specialized sense.</P>

            <P>The ADA's definition of “over-the-road bus” may also be somewhat narrower than the common understanding of the term. The ADA definition focuses on a bus with an elevated passenger deck over a baggage compartment (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, a “Greyhound-type” bus). Other types of buses commonly referred to as “over-the-road buses,” which are sometimes used for commuter bus or other service, do not come within this definition. Only buses that do come within the definition are subject to the over-the-road bus exception to accessibility requirements in Title III of the ADA.</P>
            <P>For terminological clarity, we want to point out that two different words are used in ADA regulations to refer to devices on which individuals with hearing impairments communicate over telephone lines. DOJ uses the more traditional term “telecommunications device for the deaf” (TDD). The Access Board uses a newer term, “text telephone.” The DOT rule uses the terms interchangably.</P>
            <P>A “used vehicle” means a vehicle which has prior use; prior, that is, to its acquisition by its present owner or lessee. The definition is not relevant to existing vehicles in one's own fleet, which were obtained before the ADA vehicle accessibility requirements took effect.</P>

            <P>A “vanpool” is a voluntary commuter ridesharing arrangement using a van with a seating capacity of more than seven persons, including the driver. Carpools are not included in the definition. There are some systems using larger vehicles (e.g., buses) that operate, in effect, as vanpools. This definition encompasses such systems. Vanpools are used for daily work trips, between commuters' homes (or collection points near them) and work sites (or drop points near them). Drivers are themselves commuters who are either volunteers who receive no compensation for their efforts or persons <PRTPAGE P="448"/>who are reimbursed by other riders for the vehicle, operating, and driving costs.</P>

            <P>The definition of “wheelchair” includes a wide variety of mobility devices. This inclusiveness is consistent with the legislative history of the ADA (See S. Rept. 101-116 at 48). While some mobility devices may not look like many persons' traditional idea of a wheelchair, three- and more-wheeled devices, of many varied designs, are used by individuals with disabilities and must be transported. “Wheelchair” is defined in this rule as a mobility aid belonging to any class of three-or more-wheeled devices, usable indoors, designed or modified for and used by individuals with mobility impairments, whether operated manually or powered. The “three- or-more-wheeled” language in the definition is intended to encompass wheelchairs that may have additional wheels (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> two extra guide wheels in addition to the more traditional four wheels).</P>

            <P>Persons with mobility disabilities may use devices other than wheelchairs to assist with locomotion. Canes, crutches, and walkers, for example, are often used by people whose mobility disabilities do not require use of a wheelchair. These devices must be accommodated on the same basis as wheelchairs. However, the Department does not interpret its rules to require transportation providers to accommodate devices that are not primarily designed or intended to assist persons with mobility disabilities (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> skateboards, bicycles, shopping carts), apart from general policies applicable to all passengers who might seek to bring such devices into a vehicle. Similarly, the Department does not interpret its rules to require transportation providers to permit an assistive device to be used in a way that departs from or exceeds the intended purpose of the device (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> to use a walker, even one with a seat intended to allow temporary rest intervals, as a wheelchair in which a passenger sits for the duration of a ride on a transit vehicle).</P>

            <P>The definition of wheelchair is not intended to include a class of devices known as “other power-driven mobility devices” (OPMDs). OPMDs are defined in Department of Justice ADA rules as “any mobility device powered by batteries, fuel, or other engines—whether or not designed primarily for use by individuals with mobility disabilities—that is used by individuals with mobility disabilities for the purpose of locomotion, including golf carts * * * Segway[s]<E T="03">®,</E> or any mobility device designed to operate in areas without defined pedestrian routes, but that is not a wheelchair * * * .” DOT is placing guidance on its Web site concerning the use of Segways in transportation vehicles and facilities.</P>
            <P>The definition of “direct threat” is intended to be interpreted consistently with the parallel definition in Department of Justice regulations. That is, part 37 does not require a public entity to permit an individual to participate in or benefit from the services, programs, or activities of that public entity when that individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others. In determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others, a public entity must make an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence, to ascertain: the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures or the provision of auxiliary aids or services will mitigate the risk.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.5 Nondiscrimination</HD>
            <P>This section states the general nondiscrimination obligation for entities providing transportation service. It should be noted that virtually all public and private entities covered by this regulation are also covered by DOJ regulations, which have more detailed statements of general nondiscrimination obligations.</P>
            <P>Under the ADA, an entity may not consign an individual with disabilities to a separate, “segregated,” service for such persons, if the individual can in fact use the service for the general public. This is true even if the individual takes longer, or has more difficulty, than other persons in using the service for the general public.</P>
            <P>One instance in which this principal applies concerns the use of designated priority seats (e.g., the so-called “elderly and handicapped” seats near the entrances to buses). A person with a disability (e.g., a visual impairment) may choose to take advantage of this accommodation or not. If not, it is contrary to rule for the entity to insist that the individual must sit in the priority seats.</P>
            <P>The prohibition on special charges applies to charges for service to individuals with disabilities that are higher than charges for the same or comparable services to other persons. For example, if a shuttle service charges $20.00 for a ride from a given location to the airport for most people, it could not charge $40.00 because the passenger had a disability or needed to use the shuttle service's lift-equipped van. Higher mileage charges for using an accessible vehicle would likewise be inconsistent with the rule. So would charging extra to carry a service animal accompanying an individual with a disability.</P>

            <P>If a taxi company charges $1.00 to stow luggage in the trunk, it cannot charge $2.00 to stow a folding wheelchair there. This provision does not mean, however, that a transportation provider cannot charge nondiscriminatory fees to passengers with disabilities. The taxi company in the above example can charge a passenger $1.00 to stow a <PRTPAGE P="449"/>wheelchair in the trunk; it is not required to waive the charge. This section does not prohibit the fares for paratransit service which transit providers are allowed to charge under § 37.131(d).</P>
            <P>A requirement for an attendant is inconsistent with the general nondiscrimination principle that prohibits policies that unnecessarily impose requirements on individuals with disabilities that are not imposed on others. Consequently, such requirements are prohibited. An entity is not required to provide attendant services (e.g., assistance in toileting, feeding, dressing), etc.</P>
            <P>This provision must also be considered in light of the fact that an entity may refuse service to someone who engages in violent, seriously disruptive, or illegal conduct. If an entity may legitimately refuse service to someone, it may condition service to him on actions that would mitigate the problem. The entity could require an attendant as a condition of providing service it otherwise had the right to refuse.</P>
            <P>The rule also points out that involuntary conduct related to a disability that may offend or annoy other persons, but which does not pose a direct threat, is not a basis for refusal of transportation. For example, some persons with Tourette's syndrome may make involuntary profane exclamations. These may be very annoying or offensive to others, but would not be a ground for denial of service. Nor would it be consistent with the nondiscrimination requirements of this part to deny service based on fear or misinformation about the disability. For example, a transit provider could not deny service to a person with HIV disease because its personnel or other passengers are afraid of being near people with that condition.</P>
            <P>This section also prohibits denials of service or the placing on services of conditions inconsistent with this part on individuals with disabilities because of insurance company policies or requirements. If an insurance company told a transit provider that it would withdraw coverage, or raise rates, unless a transit provider refused to carry persons with disabilities, or unless the provider refused to carry three-wheeled scooters, this would not excuse the provider from providing the service as mandate by this part. This is not a regulatory requirement on insurance companies, but simply says that covered entities must comply with this part, even in the face of difficulties with their insurance companies.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.7 Standards for Accessible Vehicles</HD>
            <P>This section makes clear that, in order to meet accessibility requirements of this rule, vehicles must comply with Access Board standards, incorporated in DOT rules as 49 CFR part 38. Paragraph (b) of § 37.7 spells out a procedure by which an entity (public or private) can deviate from provisions of part 38 with respect to vehicles. The entity would have to describe how its alternative mode of compliance would meet or exceed the level of access to or usability of the vehicle that compliance with part 38 would otherwise provide.</P>
            <P>It should be noted that equivalent facilitation does not provide a means to get a waiver of accessibility requirements. Rather, it is a way in which comparable (not a lesser degree of) accessibility can be provided by other means. The entity must consult with the public through some means of public participation in devising its alternative form of compliance, and the public input must be reflected in the submission to the Administrator (or the Federal Railroad Administrator in appropriate cases, such as a request concerning Amtrak). The Administrator will make a case-by-case decision about whether compliance with part 38 was achievable and, if not, whether the proffered alternative complies with the equivalent facilitation standard. DOT intends to consult with the Access Board in making these determinations.</P>
            <P>This equivalent facilitation provision can apply to buses or other motor vehicles as well as to rail cars and vehicles. An example of what could be an equivalent facilitation would concern rail cars which would leave too wide a horizontal gap between the door and the platform. If the operator used a combination of bridgeplates and personnel to bridge the gap, it might be regarded as an equivalent facilitation in appropriate circumstances.</P>
            <P>Section 37.7(c) clarifies which specifications must be complied with for over-the-road buses purchased by public entities (under subpart D of part 37) or private entities standing in the shoes of the public entity (as described in § 37.23 of part 37). This section is necessary to make clear that over-the-road coaches must be accessible, when they are purchased by or in furtherance of a contract with a public entity. While the October 4, 1990 rule specified that over-the-road coaches must be accessible under these circumstances, we had not previously specified what constitutes accessibility.</P>
            <P>Accordingly, this paragraph specifies that an over-the-road bus must have a lift which meets the performance requirements of a regular bus lift (see § 38.23) and must meet the interim accessibility features specified for all over-the-road buses in part 3, subpart G.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.9 Standards for Transportation Facilities</HD>

            <P>This section makes clear that, in order to meet accessibility requirements of this rule, vehicles must comply with appendix A to part 37, which incorporates the Access Board facility guidelines.<PRTPAGE P="450"/>
            </P>
            <P>Paragraph (b) of § 37.9 provides that, under certain circumstances, existing accessibility modifications to key station facilities do not need to be modified further in order to conform to appendix A. This is true even if the standards under which the facility was modified differ from the Access Board guidelines or provide a lesser standard of accessibility.</P>
            <P>To qualify for this “grandfathering,” alterations must have been before January 26, 1992. As in other facility sections of the rule, an alteration is deemed to begin with the issuance of a notice to proceed or work order. The existing modifications must conform to ANSI A-117.1, Specifications for Making Buildings and Facilities Accessible to and Usable by the Physically Handicapped 1980, or the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standard. (UFAS).</P>
            <P>For example, if an entity used a Federal grant or loan or money to make changes to a building, it would already have had to comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards. Likewise, if a private entity, acting without any Federal money in the project, may have complied with the ANSI A117.1 standard. So long as the work was done in conformity with the standard that was in effect when the work was done, the alteration will be considered accessible.</P>
            <P>However, because one modification was made to a facility under one of these standards, the entity still has a responsibility to make other modifications needed to comply with applicable accessibility requirements. For example, if an entity has made some modifications to a key station according to one of these older standards, but the modifications do not make the key station entirely accessible as this rule requires, then additional modifications would have to be made according to the standards of appendix A. Suppose this entity has put an elevator into the station to make it accessible to individuals who use wheelchairs. If the elevator does not fully meet appendix A standards, but met the applicable ANSI standard when it was installed, it would not need further modifications now. But if it had not already done so, the entity would have to install a tactile strip along the platform edge in order to make the key station fully accessible as provided in this rule. The tactile strip would have to meet appendix A requirements.</P>
            <P>The rule specifically provides that “grandfathering” applies only to alterations of individual elements and spaces and only to the extent that provisions covering those elements or spaces are found in UFAS or AHSI A117.1. For example, alterations to the telephones in a key station may have been carried out in order to lower them to meet the requirements of UFAS, but telecommunications devices for the deaf (TDDs) were not installed. (Neither UFAS nor the ANSI standard include requirements concerning TDDs). However, because appendix A does contain TDD requirements, the key station must now be altered in accordance with the standards for TDDs. Similarly, earlier alteration of an entire station in accordance with UFAS or the ANSI standard would not relieve an entity from compliance with any applicable provision concerning the gap between the platform between the platform and the vehicle in a key station, because neither of these two standards addresses the interface between vehicle and platform.</P>
            <P>One further clarification concerning the implication of this provision deals with a bus loading island at which buses pull up on both sides of the island. It would be possible to read the bus pad specification to require the island to be a minimum of 84 inches wide (two widths of a bus stop pad), so that a lift could be deployed from buses on both sides of the island at the same time. A double-wide bus pad, however, is likely to exceed available space in most instances.</P>

            <P>Where there is space, of course, building a double-wide pad is one acceptable option under this rule. However, the combination of a pad of normal width and standard operational practices may also suffice. (Such practices could be offered as an equivalent facilitation.) For example, buses on either side of the island could stop at staggered locations (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the bus on the left side could stop several feet ahead of the bus on the right side), so that even when buses were on both sides of the island at once, their lifts could be deployed without conflict. Where it is possible, building the pad a little longer than normal size could facilitate such an approach. In a situation where staggered stop areas are not feasible, an operational practice of having one bus wait until the other's lift cycle had been completed could do the job. Finally, the specification does not require that a pad be built at all. If there is nothing that can be done to permit lift deployment on both sides of an island, the buses can stop on the street, or some other location, so long as the lift is deployable.</P>
            <P>Like § 37.7, this section contains a provision allowing an entity to request approval for providing accessibility through an equivalent facilitation.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.11 Administrative Enforcement</HD>

            <P>This section spells out administrative means of enforcing the requirements of the ADA. Recipients of Federal financial assistance from DOT (whether public or private entities) are subject to DOT's section 504 enforcement procedures. The existing procedures, including administrative complaints to the DOT Office of Civil Rights, investigation, attempts at conciliation, and final resort to proceedings to cut off funds to a noncomplying recipient, will continue to be used.<PRTPAGE P="451"/>
            </P>
            <P>In considering enforcement matters, the Department is guided by a policy that emphasizes compliance. The aim of enforcement action, as we see it, is to make sure that entities meet their obligations, not to impose sanctions for their own sake. The Department's enforcement priority is on failures to comply with basic requirements and “pattern or practice” kinds of problems, rather than on isolated operational errors.</P>
            <P>Under the DOJ rules implementing title II of the ADA (28 CFR part 35), DOT is a “designated agency” for enforcement of complaints relating to transportation programs of public entities, even if they do not receive Federal financial assistance. When it receives such a complaint, the Department will investigate the complaint, attempt conciliation and, if conciliation is not possible, take action under section 504 and/or refer the matter to the DOJ for possible further action.</P>
            <P>Title III of the ADA does not give DOT any administrative enforcement authority with respect to private entities whose transportation services are subject to part 37. In its title III rule (28 CFR part 36), DOJ assumes enforcement responsibility for all title III matters. If the Department of Transportation receives complaints of violations of part 37 by private entities, it will refer the matters to the DOJ.</P>
            <P>It should be pointed out that the ADA includes other enforcement options. Individuals have a private right of action against entities who violate the ADA and its implementing regulations. The DOJ can take violators to court. These approaches are not mutually exclusive with the administrative enforcement mechanisms described in this section. An aggrieved individual can complain to DOT about an alleged transportation violation and go to court at the same time. Use of administrative enforcement procedures is not, under titles II and III, an administrative remedy that individuals must exhaust before taking legal action.</P>
            <P>We also would point out that the ADA does not assert any blanket preemptive authority over state or local nondiscrimination laws and enforcement mechanisms. While requirements of the ADA and this regulation would preempt conflicting state or local provisions (e.g., a building code or zoning ordinance that prevents compliance with appendix A or other facility accessibility requirements, a provision of local law that said bus drivers could not leave their seats to help secure wheelchair users), the ADA and this rule do not prohibit states and localities from legislating in areas relating to disability. For example, if a state law requires a higher degree of service than the ADA, that requirement could still be enforced. Also, states and localities may continue to enforce their own parallel requirements. For example, it would be a violation of this rule for a taxi driver to refuse to pick up a person based on that person's disability. Such a refusal may also be a violation of a county's taxi rules, subjecting the violator to a fine or suspension of operating privileges. Both ADA and local remedies could proceed in such a case.</P>
            <P>Labor-management agreements cannot stand in conflict with the requirements of the ADA and this rule. For example, if a labor-management agreement provides that vehicle drivers are not required to provide assistance to persons with disabilities in a situation in which this rule requires such assistance, then the assistance must be provided notwithstanding the agreement. Labor and management do not have the authority to agree to violate requirements of Federal law.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.13 Effective Date for Certain Vehicle Lift Specifications.</HD>
            <P>This section contains an explicit statement of the effective date for vehicle lift platform specifications. The Department has decided to apply the new part 38 lift platform specifications to solicitations after January 25, 1992. As in the October 4, 1990, rule implementing the acquisition requirements; the date of a solicitation is deemed to be the closing date for the submission of bids or offers in a procurement.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Subpart B—Applicability</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.21 Applicability—General</HD>
            <P>This section emphasizes the broad applicability of part 37. Unlike section 504, the ADA and its implementing rules apply to entities whether or not they receive Federal financial assistance. They apply to private and public entities alike. For entities which do receive Federal funds, compliance with the ADA and part 37 is a condition of compliance with section 504 and 49 CFR part 27, DOT's section 504 rule.</P>
            <P>Virtually all entities covered by this rule also are covered by DOJ rules, either under 28 CFR part 36 as state and local program providers or under 28 CFR part 35 as operators of places of public accommodation. Both sets of rules apply; one does not override the other. The DOT rules apply only to the entity's transportation facilities, vehicles, or services; the DOJ rules may cover the entity's activities more broadly. For example, if a public entity operates a transit system and a zoo, DOT's coverage would stop at the transit system's edge, while DOJ's rule would cover the zoo as well.</P>

            <P>DOT and DOJ have coordinated their rules, and the rules have been drafted to be consistent with one another. Should, in the context of some future situation, there be an apparent inconsistency between the two rules, the DOT rule would control within the sphere of transportation services, facilities and vehicles.<PRTPAGE P="452"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.23 Service Under Contract</HD>
            <P>This section requires private entities to “stand in the shoes” of public entities with whom they contract to provide transportation services. It ensures that, while a public entity may contract out its service, it may not contract away its ADA responsibilities. The requirement applies primarily to vehicle acquisition requirements and to service provision requirements.</P>
            <P>If a public entity wishes to acquire vehicles for use on a commuter route, for example, it must acquire accessible vehicles. It may acquire accessible over-the-road buses, it may acquire accessible full-size transit buses, it may acquire accessible smaller buses, or it may acquire accessible vans. It does not matter what kind of vehicles it acquires, so long as they are accessible. On the other hand, if the public entity wants to use inaccessible buses in its existing fleet for the commuter service, it may do so. All replacement vehicles acquired in the future must, of course, be accessible.</P>
            <P>Under this provision, a private entity which contracts to provide this commuter service stands in the shoes of the public entity and is subject to precisely the same requirements (it is not required to do more than the public entity). If the private entity acquires vehicles used to provide the service, the vehicles must be accessible. If it cannot, or chooses not to, acquire an accessible vehicle of one type, it can acquire an accessible vehicle of another type. Like the public entity, it can provide the service with inaccessible vehicles in its existing fleet.</P>
            <P>The import of the provision is that it requires a private entity contracting to provide transportation service to a public entity to follow the rules applicable to the public entity. For the time being, a private entity operating in its own right can purchase a new over-the-road bus inaccessible to individuals who use wheelchairs. When that private entity operates service under contract to the public entity, however, it is just as obligated as the public entity itself to purchase an accessible bus for use in that service, whether or not it is an over-the-road bus.</P>
            <P>The “stand in the shoes” requirement applies not only to vehicles acquired by private entities explicitly under terms of an executed contract to provide service to a public entity, but also to vehicles acquired “in contemplation of use” for service under such a contract. This language is included to ensure good faith compliance with accessibility requirements for vehicles acquired before the execution of a contract. Whether a particular acquisition is in contemplation of use on a contract will be determined on a case-by-case basis. However, acquiring a vehicle a short time before a contract is executed and then using it for the contracted service is an indication that the vehicle was acquired in contemplation of use on the contract, as is acquiring a vehicle obstensibly for other service provided by the entity and then regularly rotating it into service under the contract.</P>
            <P>The “stand in the shoes” requirement is applicable only to the vehicles and service (public entity service requirements, like § 37.163, apply to a private entity in these situations) provided under contract to a public entity. Public entity requirements clearly do not apply to all phases of a private entity's operations, just because it has a contract with a public entity. For example, a private bus company, if purchasing buses for service under contract to a public entity, must purchase accessible buses. The same company, to the extent permitted by the private entity provisions of this part, may purchase inaccessible vehicles for its tour bus operations.</P>
            <P>The Department also notes that the “stands in the shoes” requirement may differ depending on the kind of service involved. The public entity's “shoes” are shaped differently, for example, depending on whether the public entity is providing fixed route or demand responsive service to the general public. In the case of demand responsive service, a public entity is not required to buy an accessible vehicle if its demand responsive system, when viewed in its entirety, provides service to individuals with disabilities equivalent to its service to other persons. A private contractor providing a portion of this paratransit service would not necessarily have to acquire an accessible vehicle if this equivalency test is being met by the system as a whole. Similarly, a public entity can, after going through a “good faith efforts” search, acquire inaccessible buses. A private entity under contract to the public can do the same. “Stand in the shoes” may also mean that, under some circumstances, a private contractor need not acquire accessible vehicles. If a private company contracts with a public school district to provide school bus service, it is covered, for that purpose, by the exemption for public school transportation.</P>

            <P>In addition, the requirement that a private entity play by the rules applicable to a public entity can apply in situations involving an “arrangement or other relationship” with a public entity other than the traditional contract for service. For example, a private utility company that operates what is, in essence, a regular fixed route public transportation system for a city, and which receives funding under 49 U.S.C. 5307 or 49 U.S.C. 5309 via an agreement with a state or local government agency, would fall under the provisions of this section. The provider would have to comply with the vehicle acquisition, paratransit, and service requirements that would apply to the public entity through <PRTPAGE P="453"/>which it receives the FTA funds, if that public entity operated the system itself. The Department would not, however, construe this section to apply to situations in which the degree of FTA funding and state and local agency involvement is considerably less, or in which the system of transportation involved is not a <E T="03">de facto</E> surrogate for a traditional public entity fixed route transit system serving a city (e.g., a private non-profit social service agency which receives funds under 49 U.S.C. 5310 to purchase a vehicle).</P>
            <P>This section also requires that a public entity not diminish the percentage of accessible vehicles in its fleet through contracting. For example, suppose a public entity has 100 buses in its fleet, of which 20 are accessible, meaning that 20 percent of its fleet is accessible. The entity decides to add a fixed route, for which a contractor is engaged. The contractor is supplying ten of its existing inaccessible buses for the fixed route. To maintain the 20 percent accessibility ratio, there would have to be 22 accessible buses out of the 110 buses now in operation in carrying out the public entity's service. The public entity could maintain its 20 percent level of accessibility through any one or more of a number of means, such as having the contractor to provide two accessible buses, retrofitting two if its own existing buses, or accelerating replacement of two of its own inaccessible buses with accessible buses.</P>
            <P>This rule applies the “stand in the shoes” principle to transactions wholly among private entities as well. For example, suppose a taxi company (a private entity primarily engaged in the business of transporting people) contracts with a hotel to provide airport shuttle van service. With respect to that service, the taxi company would be subject to the requirements for private entities not primarily in the business of transporting people, since it would be “standing in the shoes” of the hotel for that purpose.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.25 University Transportation Systems</HD>
            <P>Private university-operated transportation systems are subject to the requirements of this rule for private entities not primarily engaged in the business of transporting people. With one important exception, public university-operated transportation systems are subject to the requirements of the rule for public entities. The nature of the systems involved—demand-responsive or fixed route—determines the precise requirements involved.</P>
            <P>For public university fixed route systems, public entity requirements apply. In the case of fixed route systems, the requirements for commuter bus service would govern. This has the effect of requiring the acquisition of accessible vehicles and compliance with most other provisions of the rule, but does not require the provision of complementary paratransit or submitting a paratransit plan. As a result, private and public universities will have very similar obligations under the rule.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.27 Transportation for Elementary and Secondary Education Systems</HD>
            <P>This section restates the statutory exemption from public entity requirements given to public school transportation. This extension also applies to transportation of pre-school children to Head Start or special education programs which receive Federal assistance. It also applies to arrangements permitting pre-school children of school bus drivers to ride a school bus or allowing teenage mothers to be transported to day care facilities at a school or along a school bus route so that their mothers may continue to attend school (See H. Rept. 101-485, pt. 1 at 27). The situation for private schools is more complex. According to the provision, a private elementary or secondary school's transportation system is exempt from coverage under this rule if all three of the following conditions are met: (1) The school receives Federal financial assistance; (2) the school is subject to section 504; and (3) the school's transportation system provides transportation services to individuals with disabilities, including wheelchair users, equivalent to those provided to individuals without disabilities. The test of equivalency is the same as that for other private entities, and is described under § 37.105. If the school does not meet all these criteria, then it is subject to the requirements of Part 37 for private entities not primarily engaged in the business of transporting people.</P>
            <P>The Department notes that, given the constitutional law on church-state separation, it is likely that church-affiliated private schools do not receive Federal financial assistance. To the extent that these schools' transportation systems are operated by religious entities or entities controlled by religious organizations, they are not subject to the ADA at all, so this section does not apply to them.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.29 Private Providers of Taxi Service</HD>
            <P>This section first recites that providers of taxi service are private entities primarily engaged in the business of transporting people which provide demand responsive service. For purposes of this section, other transportation services that involve calling for a car and a driver to take one places (e.g., limousine services, of the kind that provide luxury cars and chauffeurs for senior proms and analogous adult events) are regarded as taxi services.</P>

            <P>Under the ADA, no private entity is required to purchase an accessible automobile. If a taxi company purchases a larger vehicle, <PRTPAGE P="454"/>like a van, it is subject to the same rules as any other private entity primarily engaged in the business of transporting people which operates a demand responsive service. That is, unless it is already providing equivalent service, any van it acquires must be accessible. Equivalent service is measured according to the criteria of § 37.105. Taxi companies are not required to acquire vehicles other than automobiles to add accessible vehicles to their fleets.</P>
            <P>Taxi companies are subject to nondiscrimination obligations. These obligations mean, first, that a taxi service may not deny a ride to an individual with a disability who is capable of using the taxi vehicles. It would be discrimination to pass up a passenger because he or she was blind or used a wheelchair, if the wheelchair was one that could be stowed in the cab and the passenger could transfer to a vehicle seat. Nor could a taxi company insist that a wheelchair user wait for a lift-equipped van if the person could use an automobile.</P>
            <P>It would be discrimination for a driver to refuse to assist with stowing a wheelchair in the trunk (since taxi drivers routinely assist passengers with stowing luggage). It would be discrimination to charge a higher fee or fare for carrying a person with a disability than for carrying a non-disabled passenger, or a higher fee for stowing a wheelchair than for stowing a suitcase. (Charging the same fee for stowing a wheelchair as for stowing a suitcase would be proper, however.) The fact that it may take somewhat more time and effort to serve a person with a disability than another passenger does not justify discriminatory conduct with respect to passengers with disabilities.</P>
            <P>State or local governments may run user-side subsidy arrangements for the general public (e.g., taxi voucher systems for senior citizens or low-income persons). Under the DOJ title II rule, these programs would have to meet “program accessibility” requirements, which probably would require that accessible transportation be made available to senior citizens or low-income persons with disabilities. This would not directly require private taxi providers who accept the vouchers to purchase accessible vehicles beyond the requirements of this rule, however.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.31 Vanpools</HD>
            <P>This provision applies to public vanpool systems the requirements for public entities operating demand responsive systems for the general public. A public vanpool system is one operated by a public entity, or in which a public entity owns or purchases or leases the vehicles. Lesser degrees of public involvement with an otherwise private ridesharing arrangement (e.g., provision of parking spaces, HOV lanes, coordination or clearinghouse services) do not convert a private into a public system.</P>
            <P>The requirement for a public vanpool system is that it purchase or lease an accessible vehicle unless it can demonstrate that it provides equivalent service to individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, as it provides to individuals without disabilities. For a public vanpool system, the equivalency requirement would be met if an accessible vehicle is made available to and used by a vanpool when an individual with a disability needs such a vehicle to participate. Public vanpool systems may meet this requirement through obtaining a percentage of accessible vehicles that is reasonable in light of demand for them by participants, but this is not required, so long as the entity can respond promptly to requests for participation in a vanpool with the provision of an accessible van when needed.</P>
            <P>There is no requirement for private vanpools, defined as a voluntary arrangement in which the driver is compensated only for expenses.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.33 Airport Transportation Systems</HD>
            <P>Fixed route transportation systems operated by public airports are regarded by this section as fixed route commuter bus systems. As such, shuttles among terminals and parking lots, connector systems among the airport and a limited number of other local destinations must acquire accessible buses, but are not subject to complementary paratransit requirements. (If a public airport operates a demand responsive system for the general public, it would be subject to the rules for demand responsive systems for the general public.)</P>
            <P>It should be noted that this section applies only to transportation services that are operated by public airports themselves (or by private contractors who stand in their shoes). When a regular urban mass transit system serves the airport, the airport is simply one portion of its service area, treated for purposes of this rule like the rest of its service area.</P>
            <P>Virtually all airports are served by taxi companies, who are subject to § 37.29 at airports as elsewhere. In addition, many airports are served by jitney or shuttle systems. Typically, these systems operate in a route-deviation or similar variable mode in which there are passenger-initiated decisions concerning destinations. We view such systems as demand responsive transportation operated by private entities primarily engaged in the business of transporting people.</P>

            <P>Since many of these operators are small businesses, it may be difficult for them to meet equivalency requirements on their own without eventually having all or nearly all accessible vehicles, which could pose economic problems. One suggested solution to this problem is for the operators serving a given airport to form a pool or consortium arrangement, in which a number of shared <PRTPAGE P="455"/>accessible vehicles would meet the transportations of individuals with disabilities. As in other forms of transportation, such an arrangement would have to provide service in a nondiscriminatory way (e.g., in an integrated setting, no higher fares for accessible service).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.35 Supplemental Service for Other Transportation Modes</HD>
            <P>This section applies to a number of situations in which an operator of another transportation mode uses bus or other service to connect its service with limited other points.</P>
            <P>One instance is when an intercity railroad route is set up such that the train stops outside the major urban center which is the actual destination for many passengers. Examples mentioned to us include bus service run by Amtrak from a stop in Columbus, Wisconsin, to downtown Madison, or from San Jose to San Francisco. Such service is fixed route, from the train station to a few points in the metropolitan area, with a schedule keyed to the train schedule. It would be regarded as commuter bus service, meaning that accessible vehicles would have to be acquired but complementary paratransit was not required.</P>
            <P>Another instance is one in which a commuter rail operator uses fixed route bus service as a dedicated connection to, or extension of, its rail service. The service may go to park and ride lots or other destinations beyond the vicinity of the rail line. Again, this service shares the characteristics of commuter bus service that might be used even if the rail line were not present, and does not attempt to be a comprehensive mass transit bus service for the area.</P>
            <P>Of course, there may be instances in which a rail operator uses demand responsive instead of fixed route service for a purpose of this kind. In that case, the demand responsive system requirements of the rule would apply.</P>
            <P>Private entities (i.e., those operating places of public accommodation) may operate similar systems, as when a cruise ship operator provides a shuttle or connector between an airport and the dock. This service is covered by the rules governing private entities not primarily engaged in the business of transporting people. Fixed route or demand responsive rules apply, depending on the characteristics of the system involved.</P>

            <P>One situation not explicitly covered in this section concerns <E T="03">ad hoc</E> transportation arranged, for instance, by a rail operator when the train does not wind up at its intended destination. For example, an Amtrak train bound for Philadelphia may be halted at Wilmington by a track blockage between the two cities. Usually, the carrier responds by providing bus service to the scheduled destination or to the next point where rail service can resume.</P>
            <P>The service that the carrier provides in this situation is essentially a continuation by other means of its primary service. We view the obligation of the rail operator as being to ensure that all passengers, including individuals with disabilities, are provided service to the destination in a nondiscriminatory manner. This includes, for instance, providing service in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of the individual and service that gets a passenger with a disability to the destination as soon as other passengers.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.37 Other Applications</HD>
            <P>The ADA specifically defines “public entity.” Anything else is a “private entity.” The statute does not include in this definition a private entity that receives a subsidy or franchise from a state or local government or is regulated by a public entity. Only through the definition of “operates” (see discussion of § 37.23) do private entities' relationships to public entities subject private entities to the requirements for public entities. Consequently, in deciding which provisions of the rule to apply to an entity in other than situations covered by § 37.23, the nature of the entity—public or private—is determinative.</P>
            <P>Transportation service provided by public accommodations is viewed as being provided by private entities not primarily engaged in the business of transporting people. Either the provisions of this part applicable to demand responsive or fixed route systems apply, depending on the nature of a specific system at a specific location. The distinction between fixed route and demand responsive systems is discussed in connection with the definitions section above. It is the responsibility of each private entity, in the first instance, to assess the nature of each transportation system on a case-by-case basis and determine the applicable rules.</P>
            <P>On the other hand, conveyances used for recreational purposes, such as amusement park rides, ski lifts, or historic rail cars or trolleys operated in museum settings, are not viewed as transportation under this rule at all. Other conveyances may fit into this category as well.</P>
            <P>The criterion for determining what requirements apply is whether the conveyances are primarily an aspect of the recreational experience itself or a means of getting from Point A to Point B. At a theme park, for instance, a large roller coaster (though a “train” of cars on a track) is a public accommodation not subject to this rule; the tram that transports the paying customers around the park, with a stop at the roller coaster, is a transportation system subject to the “private, not primarily” provisions of this part.</P>

            <P>Employer-provided transportation for employees is not covered by this part, but by <PRTPAGE P="456"/>EEOC rules under title I of the ADA. (Public entities are also subject to DOJ's title II rules with respect to employment.) This exclusion from part 37 applies to transportation services provided by an employer (whether access to motor pool vehicles, parking shuttles, employer-sponsored van pools) that is made available solely to its own employees. If an employer provides service to its own employees and other persons, such as workers of other employers or customers, it would be subject to the requirements of this part from private entities not primarily engaged in the business of transporting people or public entities, as applicable.</P>
            <P>The rule looks to the private entity actually providing the transportation service in question in determining whether the “private, primarily” or “private, not primarily” rules apply. For example, Conglomerate, Inc., owns a variety of agribusiness, petrochemical, weapons system production, and fast food corporations. One of its many subsidiaries, Green Tours, Inc., provides charter bus service for people who want to view national parks, old-growth forests, and other environmentally significant places. It is probably impossible to say in what business Conglomerate, Inc. is primarily engaged, but it clearly is not transporting people. Green Tours, Inc., on the other hand, is clearly primarily engaged in the business of transporting people, and the rule treats it as such.</P>
            <P>On the other hand, when operating a transportation service off to the side of to the main business of a public accommodation (e.g., a hotel shuttle), the entity as a whole would be considered. Even if some dedicated employees are used to provide the service, shuttles and other systems provided as a means of getting to, from, or around a public accommodation remain solidly in the “private, not primarily” category.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.41 Construction of Transportation Facilities by Public Entities</HD>
            <P>Section 37.41 contains the general requirement that all new facilities constructed after January 25, 1992, be accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. This provision tracks the statute closely, and is analogous to a provision in the DOJ regulations for private entities. Section 226 of the ADA provides little discretion in this requirement.</P>
            <P>The requirement is keyed to construction which “begins” after January 25, 1992. The regulation defines “begin” to mean when a notice to proceed order has been issued. This term has a standard meaning in the construction industry, as an instruction to the contractor to proceed with the work.</P>
            <P>Questions have been raised concerning which standards apply before January 26, 1992. There are Federal requirements that apply to all recipients of federal money, depending on the circumstances.</P>
            <P>First, if an entity is a Federal recipient and uses Federal dollars to construct the facility, regulations implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), require the recipient to comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards.</P>
            <P>Second, since the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-259), an operation of a recipient of federal funds would also have to comply with section 504, even though the activity was not paid for with Federal funds. Thus, the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards would apply to this construction as well.</P>
            <P>As mentioned above, the Department intends, in the period before January 26, 1991, to view compliance with section 504 in light of compliance with ADA requirements (this point applies to alterations as well as new construction). Consequently, in reviewing requests for grants, contract approvals, exemptions, etc., (whether with respect to ongoing projects or new, experimental, or one-time efforts), the Department will, as a policy matter, seek to ensure compliance with ADA standards.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.42</HD>
            <P>Service in an integrated setting to passengers at intercity, commuter, and high-speed rail station platforms constructed or altered after February 1, 2012.</P>
            <P>Individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, must have access to all accessible cars in each train using a new or altered station. This performance standard will apply at stations where construction or alteration of platforms begins 135 days or more after the rule is published. The performance standard does not require rail operators to retrofit existing station platforms or cars. The requirement is prospective, and section 37.42 does not require retrofit of existing stations (though compliance with existing disability nondiscrimination requirements not being altered is still required). To meet this performance standard on lines or systems where track passing through stations and adjacent to platforms is shared with existing freight rail operations, passenger railroads that do not choose to provide level-entry boarding may, after obtaining FRA and/or FTA approval, use car-borne lifts, ramps or other devices, mini-high platforms (making multiple stops where necessary to accommodate passengers wishing to use different cars of the train), or movable station-based lifts.</P>

            <P>On commuter, intercity, or high-speed rail lines or systems in which track passing through stations and adjacent to platforms is not shared with existing freight rail operations, the performance standard <E T="03">must</E> be met by providing level-entry boarding to all <PRTPAGE P="457"/>accessible cars in each train that serves new or altered stations on the line or system. For example, if a new commuter or high-speed rail line or system is being built, and the track adjacent to platforms is not shared with freight traffic (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> it is a passenger rail-only system, or a passing or gauntlet track exists for freight traffic), then the stations would have to provide level-entry boarding. Other options would not be permitted.</P>

            <P>If a platform being constructed or altered is not adjacent to track used for freight, but the track and platform are used by more than one passenger railroad (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Amtrak and a commuter railroad), the possibility of the platform serving cars with different door heights exists. In this situation, the level-entry boarding requirement continues to exist. Generally, the platform should be level with respect to the system that has the lower boarding height. This is because it is not good safety practice to make passengers step down (or be lifted down or use ramps to get down) to board a train. For example, if Amtrak operates through a station with cars that are 15 inches ATR, and a commuter railroad uses the same platform with cars that are 25 inches ATR, the platform would be level with respect to the Amtrak cars. The commuter railroad would have to provide another means of access, such as lifts. In all such cases where mixed rail equipment will be used, the rule requires that both FRA and FTA be consulted by the railroads involved. As in other cases where level-entry boarding is not used, the railroad must obtain FTA and/or FRA approval for the means the railroad wants to use to meet the performance standard.</P>

            <P>The details of the “track passing through stations and adjacent to platforms is shared with existing freight rail operations” language are important. There may be stations that serve lines that are shared, at some points, by passenger and freight traffic, but where the freight traffic does not go through the particular station (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> because freight traffic bypasses the station), level-entry boarding is required. There could also be situations on which multiple tracks pass through a station, and freight traffic uses only a center track, not a track which is adjacent to a platform. In such cases, the new or altered platform would have to provide level-entry boarding. It is important to note that this language refers to “existing” freight rail traffic, as opposed to the possibility that freight traffic might use the track in question at some future time. Likewise, if freight trains have not used a track passing through a station in a significant period of time (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the past 10 years), the Department does not view this as constituting “existing freight rail traffic.”</P>
            <P>Passenger rail operators must provide access only to accessible, available cars that people with disabilities are trying to access at a given station. If a train has eight accessible cars, and wheelchair users want to enter only cars 2 and 7 (see discussion below of passenger notification), then railroad personnel need to deploy lifts or bridge plates only at cars 2 and 7, not at the other cars. Similarly, the rule requires operators to provide access only to available cars at a station. If a train has eight accessible cars, but the platform only serves cars 1 through 6, then railroad personnel need to deploy lifts or bridge plates only at cars that people with disabilities are trying to access and that are available to all passengers. We would also point out that wheelchair positions on rail passenger cars are intended to serve wheelchair users, and railroad operators should take steps to ensure that these spaces are available for wheelchair users and not for other uses. For example, it would be contrary to the rule for a wheelchair user to be told that he or she could not use car 7 because the wheelchair spaces were filled with other passengers' luggage from a previous stop.</P>

            <P>In order to ensure that access was provided, passengers would have to notify railroad personnel. For example, if a passenger at a station wanted to use a station-based lift to access car 6, the passenger would request the use of car 6 and railroad personnel would deploy the lift at that car. Likewise, at a station using a mini-high platform, a passenger on this platform would inform train personnel that he or she wanted to enter car 5, whereupon the train would pull forward so that car 5 was opposite the mini-high platform. We contemplate that these requests would be made when the train arrives, and railroads could not insist on advance notice (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the railroad could not require a passenger to call a certain time in advance to make a “reservation” to use a lift to get on a particular car). As part of its submission to FTA or FRA, the railroad would describe the procedure it would use to receive and fulfill these requests.</P>

            <P>Where a railroad operator wishes to provide access to its rail cars through a means other than level-entry boarding, it is essential that it provide an integrated, safe, timely, reliable, and effective means of access for people with disabilities. A railroad is not required to choose what might be regarded as a more desirable or convenient method over a less desirable or convenient method, or to choose a more costly option over a less costly option. What a railroad must do is to ensure that whatever option it chooses works. However, to assist railroads in choosing the most suitable option, the rule requires that a railroad not using level-entry boarding, if it chooses an approach other than the use of car-borne lifts, must perform a comparison of the costs (capital, operating, and life-cycle costs) of car-borne lifts versus the <PRTPAGE P="458"/>means preferred by the railroad operator, as well as a comparison of the relative ability of each of the two alternatives (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> car-borne lifts and the railroad's preferred approach) to provide service to people with disabilities in an integrated, safe, reliable, and timely manner. The railroad must submit this comparison to FTA and FRA at the same time as it submits its plan to FRA and/or FTA, as described below, although the comparison is not part of the basis on which the agencies would determine whether the plan meets the performance standard. The Department believes that, in creating this plan, railroads should consult with interested individuals and groups and should make the plan readily available to the public, including individuals with disabilities.</P>

            <P>To ensure that the railroad's chosen option works, the railroad must provide to FRA or FTA (or both), as applicable, a plan explaining how its preferred method will provide the required integrated, safe, reliable, timely and effective means of access for people with disabilities. The plan would have to explain how boarding equipment (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> bridge plates, lifts, ramps, or other appropriate devices) and/or platforms will be deployed, maintained, and operated, as well as how personnel will be trained and deployed to ensure that service to individuals with disabilities was provided in an integrated, safe, timely, effective, and reliable manner.</P>
            <P>FTA and/or FRA will evaluate the proposed plan with respect to whether it will achieve the objectives of the performance standard and may approve, disapprove, or modify it. It should be emphasized that the purpose of FTA/FRA review of this plan is to make sure that whatever approach a railroad chooses will in fact work; that is, it will really result in an integrated, safe, reliable, timely and effective means of access for people with disabilities. If a plan, in the view of FRA or FTA, fails to meet this test, then FTA or FRA can reject it or require the railroad to modify it to meet the objectives of this provision.</P>
            <P>In considering railroads' plans, the agencies will consider factors including, but not limited to, how the proposal maximizes integration of and accessibility to individuals with disabilities, any obstacles to the use of a method that could provide better service to individuals with disabilities, the safety and reliability of the approach and related technology proposed to be used, the suitability of the means proposed to the station and line and/or system on which it would be used, and the adequacy of equipment and maintenance and staff training and deployment.</P>
            <P>For example, some commenters have expressed significant concerns about the use of station-based lifts, noting instances in which such lifts have not been maintained in a safe and reliable working order. A railroad proposing to use station-based lifts would have to describe to FTA or FRA how it would ensure that the lifts remained in safe and reliable operating condition (such as by cycling the lift daily or other regular maintenance) and how it would ensure that personnel to operate the lift were available in a timely manner to assist passengers in boarding a train. This demonstration must clearly state how the railroad expects that their operations will provide safe and dignified service to the users of such lifts.</P>

            <P>In existing stations where it is possible to provide access to every car without station or rail car retrofits, rail providers that receive DOT financial assistance should be mindful of the requirement of 49 CFR 27.7(b)(2), which requires that service be provided “in the most integrated setting that is reasonably achievable.” For example, if a set of rail cars has car-borne lifts that enable the railroad to comply with section 37.42 at new or altered station platforms, it is likely that deployment of this lift at existing stations will be reasonably achievable. Similarly, it is likely that, in a system using mini-high platforms, making multiple stops at existing stations would be reasonable achievable. The use of a station-based lift at an existing station to serve more than one car of a train may well also be reasonably achievable (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> with movement of the lift or multiple stops, as needed). Such actions would serve the objective of providing service in an integrated setting. In addition, in situations where a railroad and the Department have negotiated access to every accessible car in an existing system (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> with car-borne lifts and mini-high platforms as a back-up), the Department expects the railroads to continue to provide access to every accessible car for people with disabilities.</P>

            <P>Section 37.42(e) provides a safety requirement concerning the setback of structures and obstacles (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> mini-high platforms, elevators, escalators, and stairwells) from the platform edge. This provision is based on long-standing FRA recommendations and the expertise of the Department's staff. The Department believes that it is inadvisable, with the exception of boarding and alighting a train, to ever have a wheelchair operate over the two-foot wide tactile strips that are parallel to the edge of the platform. This leaves a four-foot distance for a person in a typical wheelchair to maneuver safely past stair wells, elevator shafts, <E T="03">etc.</E> It also is important because a wheelchair user exiting a train at a door where there is not a six-foot clearance would likely have difficulty exiting and making the turn out of the rail car door. The requirement would also avoid channeling pedestrians through a relatively narrow space where, in crowded platform conditions, there would be an increased chance of someone falling off the edge of the platform. Since the rule concerns only new and altered platforms, the Department does <PRTPAGE P="459"/>not believe the cost or difficulty of designing the platforms to eliminate this hazard will be significant.</P>
            <P>Section 37.42(f) provides the maximum gap allowable for a platform to be considered “level.” However, this maximum is not intended to be the norm for new or altered platforms. The Department expects transportation providers to minimize platform gaps to the greatest extent possible by building stations on tangent track and using gap-filling technologies, such as moveable platform edges, threshold plates, platform end boards, and flexible rubber fingers on the ends of platforms. The Department encourages the use of Gap Management Plans and consultation with FRA and/or FTA for guidance on gap safety issues.</P>
            <P>Even where level-entry boarding is provided, it is likely that, in many instances, bridge plates would have to be used to enable passengers with disabilities to enter cars, because of the horizontal gaps involved. Section 38.95(c)(5), referred to in the regulatory text, permits various ramp slopes for bridge plates, depending on the vertical gap in given situation. In order to maximize the opportunity of passengers to board independently, the Department urges railroads to use the least steep ramp slope feasible at a given platform.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.43 Alteration of Transportation Facilities by Public Entities</HD>
            <P>This section sets out the accessibility requirements that apply when a public entity undertakes an alteration of an existing facility. In general, the section requires that any alteration, to the maximum extent feasible, results in the altered area being accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including persons who use wheelchairs. The provisions follow closely those adopted by the DOJ, in its regulations implementing title III of the ADA.</P>
            <P>The section requires specific activities whenever an alteration of an existing facility is undertaken.</P>
            <P>First, if the alteration is made to a primary function area, (or access to an area containing a primary function), the entity shall make the alteration in such a way as to ensure that the path of travel to the altered area and the restrooms, telephones and drinking fountains servicing the altered area are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs.</P>
            <P>Second, alterations to drinking fountains, telephones, and restrooms do not have to be completed if the cost and scope of making them accessible is disproportionate.</P>
            <P>Third, the requirement goes into effect for alterations begun after January 25, 1992.</P>
            <P>Fourth, the term “maximum extent feasible” means that all changes that are possible must be made. The requirement to make changes to the maximum extent feasible derives from clear legislative history. The Senate Report states—</P>
            <P>The phrase “to the maximum extent feasible” has been included to allow for the occasional case in which the nature of an existing facility is such as to make it virtually impossible to renovate the building in a manner that results in its being entirely accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. In all such cases, however, the alteration should provide the maximum amount of physical accessibility feasible.</P>
            <P>Thus, for example the term “to the maximum extent feasible” should be construed as not requiring entities to make building alterations that have little likelihood of being accomplished without removing or altering a load-bearing structural member unless the load-bearing structural member is otherwise being removed or altered as part of the alteration. (S. Rept. 101-116, at 68).</P>
            <P>Fifth, primary function means a major activity for which the facility is intended. Primary function areas include waiting areas, ticket purchase and collection areas, train or bus platforms, baggage checking and return areas, and employment areas (with some exceptions stated in the rule, for areas used by service personnel that are very difficult to access).</P>
            <P>Sixth, “path of travel” means a continuous, unobstructed way of pedestrian passage by means of which the altered area may be approached, entered, and exited, and which connects the altered area with an exterior approach and includes restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area. If changes to the path of travel are disproportionate, then only those changes which are not disproportionate are to be completed.</P>
            <P>Seven, the final rule specifies that costs exceeding 20 percent would be disproportionate. This is consistent with the DOJ. In determining costs, the Department intends costs to be based on changes to the passenger service area that is scheduled for alteration.</P>
            <P>Finally, the Department has defined the term “begin”, in the context of begin an alteration that is subject to the alteration provision to mean when a notice to proceed or work order is issued. Two terms are used (instead of only notice to proceed in the context of new construction) because many alterations may be carried out by the entity itself, in which case the only triggering event would be a work order or similar authorization to begin.</P>

            <P>In looking at facility concepts like “disproportionality” and “to the maximum extent feasible,” the Department will consider any expenses related to accessibility for passengers. It is not relevant to consider non-passenger related improvements (e.g., installing a new track bed) or to permit “gold-plating” (attributing to accessibility <PRTPAGE P="460"/>costs the expense of non-related improvements, such as charging to accessibility costs the price of a whole new door, when only adding a new handle to the old door was needed for accessibility).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.47 Key Stations in Light and Rapid Rail Systems</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.49 Designation of Responsible Person(s) for Intercity and Commuter Rail Stations</HD>
            <P>This section sets forth a mechanism for determining who bears the legal and financial responsibility for accessibility modifications to a commuter and/or intercity rail station. The final provision of the section is the most important. It authorizes all concerned parties to come to their own agreement concerning the allocation of responsibility. Such an agreement can allocate responsibility in any way acceptable to the parties. The Department strongly encourages parties to come to such an agreement.</P>
            <P>In the absence of such an agreement, a statutory/regulatory scheme allocates responsibility. In the first, and simplest, situation posed by the statute, a single public entity owns more than 50 percent of the station. In this case, the public entity is the responsible person and nobody else is required to bear any of the responsibility.</P>
            <P>In the second situation, a private entity owns more than 50 percent of the station. The private entity need not bear any of the responsibility for making the station accessible. A public entity owner of the station, who does not operate passenger railroad service through the station, is not required to bear any of the responsibility for making the station accessible. The total responsibility is divided between passenger railroads operating service through the station, on the basis of respective passenger boardings. If there is only one railroad operating service through the station, it bears the total responsibility.</P>
            <P>The Department believes that reference to passenger boardings is the most equitable way of dividing responsibility among railroads, since the number of people drawn to the station by each is likely to reflect “cost causation” quite closely. The Department notes, however, that, as passenger boarding percentages change over time, the portion of responsibility assigned to each party also may change. Station modifications may involve long-term capital investment and planning, while passenger boarding percentages are more volatile. Some railroads may stop serving a station, while others may begin service, during the period of time before modifications to the station are complete. To help accommodate such situations, the rule refers to passenger boardings “over the entire period during which the station is made accessible.”</P>
            <P>This language is intended to emphasize that as circumstances change, the parties involved have the responsibility to adjust their arrangements for cost sharing. For example, suppose Railroad A has 30 percent of the passenger boardings in year 1, but by year 10 has 60 percent of the boardings. It would not be fair for Railroad A to pay only 30 percent of the costs of station modifications occurring in later years. Ultimately, the total cost burden for modifying the station over (for example) 20 years would be allocated on the share of the total number or boardings attributable to each railroad over the whole 20 year period, in order to avoid such unfairness.</P>
            <P>The third, and most complicated, situation is one in which no party owns 50 percent of the station. For example, consider the following hypothetical situation:</P>

            <FP>The private freight railroad drops out of the calculation of who is responsible. All of the responsibility would be allocated among four public entities: the city (a public entity who does not operate railroad service), Amtrak, and the two commuter railroads. Half the responsibility would go to public entity owners of the station (whether or not they are railroads who run passenger service through the station). The other half of the responsibility would go to railroads who run passenger service through the station (whether or not they are station owners).</FP>
            <P>On the ownership side of the equation, the city and Commuter A each own half of that portion of the station that is not owned by the private freight railroad. Therefore, the two parties divide up the ownership half of the responsibility equally. Based on their ownership interest, each of these two parties bears 25 percent of the responsibility for the entire station. Note that, should ownership percentages or owners change over the period during which the station is to be made accessible, these percentages may change. It is ownership percentage over this entire period that ultimately determines the percentage of responsibility.</P>

            <P>On the passenger rail operations side of the equation, 50 percent of passenger boardings are attributable to Commuter A and 25 percent each to Commuter B and Amtrak. Therefore, half of this portion of the responsibility belongs to Commuter A, while a quarter share each goes to the other railroads. This means that, based on passenger boardings, 25 percent of the responsibility <PRTPAGE P="461"/>goes to Commuter A, 12.5 percent to Commuter B, and 12.5 percent to Amtrak. Again, it is the proportion of passenger boardings over the entire length of the period during which the station is made accessible that ultimately determines the percentage of responsibility.</P>
            <P>In this hypothetical, Commuter A is responsible for a total of 50 percent of the responsibility for the station. Commuter A is responsible for 25 percent of the responsibility because of its role as a station owner and another 25 percent because of its operation of passenger rail service through the station.</P>
            <P>The Department recognizes that there will be situations in which application of this scheme will be difficult (e.g., involving problems with multiple owners of a station whose ownership percentages may be difficult to ascertain). The Department again emphasizes that agreement among the parties is the best way of resolving these problems, but we are willing to work with the parties to ensure a solution consistent with this rule.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.51 Key Stations in Commuter Rail Systems</HD>
            <P>These sections require that key stations in light, rapid, and commuter rail systems be made accessible as soon as practicable, but no later than July 26, 1993. Being made accessible, for this purpose, means complying with the applicable provisions of appendix A to this part. “As soon as practicable” means that, if modification can be made before July 26, 1993, they must be. A rail operator that failed to make a station accessible by July 1993 would be in noncompliance with the ADA and this rule, except in a case where an extension of time had been granted.</P>
            <P>What is a key station? A key station is one designated as such by the commuter authority or light/rapid rail operator, through the planning process and public participation process set forth in this section. The five criteria listed in the regulation are intended to guide the selection process but, while the entity must take these criteria into account (and this consideration must be reflected in the planning process and documents), they are not mandatory selection standards. That is, it is not required that every station that meets one of the criteria be designated as a key station. Since the criteria are not mandatory selection standards, the understanding of their terms is also a matter appropriately left to the planning process. A tight, legalistic definition is not necessary in the context of factors intended for consideration. For instance, what constitutes a major activity center or how close a station needs to be to another station to not be designated as key depend largely on local factors that it would not be reasonable to specify in this rule.</P>
            <P>Given the wide discretion permitted to rail operators in identifying key stations, there would be no objection to identifying as a key station a new (presumably accessible) station now under construction. Doing so would involve consideration of the key station criteria and would be subject to the planning/public participation process.</P>
            <P>If an extension to a rail system (e.g., a commuter system) is made, such that the system comes to include existing inaccessible stations that have not previously been part of the system, the Department construes the ADA to require application of key station accessibility in such a situation. The same would be true for a new start commuter rail system that began operations using existing stations. Key station planning, designation of key stations, and with being consistent with the ADA would be required. The Department would work with the commuter authority involved on a case-by-case basis to determine applicable time limits for accessibility, consistent with the time frames of the ADA.</P>
            <P>The entity must develop a compliance plan, subject to the public participation and planning process set forth in paragraph (d) of each of these sections. Note that this plan must be completed by July 26, 1992, not January 26, 1992, as in the case of paratransit plans. The key station plans must be submitted to FTA at that time. (The statute does not require FTA approval of the plans, however.).</P>
            <P>A rail operator may request an extension of the July 1993 completion deadline for accessibility modifications to one or more key stations. The extension for light and rapid rail stations can be up to July 2020, though two thirds of the key stations (per the legislative history of the statute, selected in a way to maximize accessibility to the whole system) must be accessible by July 2010.</P>
            <P>Commuter rail stations can be extended up to July 2010.</P>
            <P>Requests for extension of time must be submitted by July 26, 1992. FTA will review the requests on a station-by-station basis according to the statutory criterion, which is whether making the station accessible requires extraordinarily expensive alterations. An extraordinarily expensive alteration is raising the entire platform, installing an elevator, or making another alteration of similar cost and magnitude. If another means of making a station accessible (e.g., installation of a mini-high platform in a station where it is not necessary to install an elevator or to provide access to the platform for wheelchair users), then an extension can be granted only if the rail operator shows that the cost and magnitude of the alteration is similar to that of an elevator installation or platform raising.</P>

            <P>The rule does not include a specific deadline for FTA consideration of an extension <PRTPAGE P="462"/>request. However, since we are aware that, in the absence of an extension request, accessibility must be completed by July 1993, we will endeavor to complete review of plans as soon as possible, to give as much lead time as possible to local planning and implementation efforts.</P>
            <P>Once an extension is granted, the extension applies to all accessibility modifications in the station. However, the rail operator should not delay non-extraordinarily expensive modifications to the station. The key station plan and any extension request should include a schedule for phasing in non-extraordinarily expensive modifications to the station. For example, even if a key station is not going to be accessible to wheelchair users for 15 years, pending the installation of an elevator, the rail operator can improve its accessibility to persons with visual impairments by installing tactile strips.</P>
            <P>An extension cannot be granted except for a particular station which needs an extraordinarily expensive modification. An extension cannot be granted non-extraordinarily expensive changes to Station B because the extraordinarily expensive changes to Station A will absorb many resources. Non-extraordinarily expensive changes, however costly considered collectively for a system, are not, under the statute, grounds for granting an extension to one or more stations or the whole system. Only particular stations where an extraordinarily expensive modification must be made qualify for extensions.</P>
            <P>The FTA Administrator can approve, modify, or disapprove any request for an extension. For example, it is not a forgone conclusion that a situation for which an extension is granted will have the maximum possible extension granted. If it appears that the rail operator can make some stations accessible sooner, FTA can grant an extension for a shorter period (e.g., 2005 for a particular station rather than 2010).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.53 Exception for New York and Philadelphia</HD>
            <P>Consistent with the legislative history of the ADA, this section formally recognizes the selection of key stations in two identified litigation settlement agreements in New York and Philadelphia as in compliance with the ADA. Consequently, the entities involved can limit their key station planning process to issues concerning the timing of key station accessibility. The section references also § 37.9, which provides that key station accessibility alterations which have already been made, or which are begun before January 26, 1992, and which conform to specified prior standards, do not have to be re-modified. On the other hand, alterations begun after January 25, 1992 (including forthcoming key station modifications under the New York and Philadelphia agreements), must meet the requirements of appendix A to this part.</P>
            <P>This is an exception only for the two specified agreements. There are no situations in which other cities can take advantage of this provision. Nor are the provisions of the two agreements normative for other cities. Other cities must do their own planning, with involvement from local citizens, and cannot rely on agreements unique to New York and Philadelphia to determine the appropriate number of percentage of key stations or other matters.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.57 Required Cooperation</HD>
            <P>This section implements § 242(e)(2)(C) of the ADA, which treats as discrimination a failure, by an owner or person in control of an intercity rail station, to provide reasonable cooperation to the responsible persons' efforts to comply with accessibility requirements. For example, the imposition by the owner of an unreasonable insurance bond from the responsible person as a condition of making accessibility modifications would violate this requirement. See H. Rept. 101-485 at 53.</P>
            <P>The statute also provides that failure of the owner or person in control to cooperate does not create a defense to a discrimination suit against the responsible person, but the responsible person would have a third party action against the uncooperative owner or person in control. The rule does not restate this portion of the statute in the regulation, since it would be implemented by the courts if such an action is brought. Since cooperation is also a regulatory requirement, however, the Department could entertain a section 504 complaint against a recipient of Federal funds who failed to cooperate.</P>

            <P>The House Energy and Commerce Committee provided as an example of an action under this provision a situation in which a failure to cooperate leads to a construction delay, which in turn leads to a lawsuit by an individual with disabilities against the responsible person for missing an accessibility deadline. The responsible person could not use the lack of cooperation as a defense in the lawsuit, but the uncooperative party could be made to indemnify the responsible person for damages awarded the plaintiff. Also, a responsible person could obtain an injunction to force the recalcitrant owner or controller of the station to permit accessibility work to proceed. (<E T="03">Id.</E>)</P>

            <P>This provision does not appear to be intended to permit a responsible person to seek contribution for a portion of the cost of accessibility work from a party involved with the station whom the statute and § 37.49 do not identify as a responsible person. It simply provides a remedy for a situation in which someone impedes the responsible person's efforts to comply with accessibility obligations.<PRTPAGE P="463"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.59 Differences in Accessibility Completion Date Requirements</HD>
            <P>Portions of the same station may have different accessibility completion date requirements, both as the result of different statutory time frames for different kinds of stations and individual decisions made on requests for extension. The principle at work in responding to such situations is that if part of a station may be made accessible after another part, the “late” part of the work should not get in the way of people's use of modifications resulting from the “early” part.</P>
            <P>For example, the commuter part of a station may have to be made accessible by July 1993 (e.g., there is no need to install an elevator, and platform accessibility can be achieved by use of a relatively inexpensive mini-high platform). The Amtrak portion of the same station, by statute, is required to be accessible as soon as practicable, but no later than July 2010. If there is a common entrance to the station, that commuter rail passengers and Amtrak passengers both use, or a common ticket counter, it would have to be accessible by July 1993. If there were a waiting room used by Amtrak passengers but not commuter passengers (who typically stand and wait on the platform at this station), it would not have to be accessible by July 1993, but if the path from the common entrance to the commuter platform went through the waiting room, the path would have to be an accessible path by July 1993.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.61 Public Transportation Programs and Activities in Existing Facilities</HD>
            <P>This section implements section 228(a) of the ADA and establishes the general requirement for entities to operate their transportation facilities in a manner that, when viewed in its entirety, is accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. The section clearly excludes from this requirement access by persons in wheelchairs, unless these changes would be necessitated by the alterations or key station provisions.</P>
            <P>This provision is intended to cover activities and programs of an entity that do not rise to the level of alteration. Even if an entity is not making alterations to a facility, it has a responsibility to conduct its program in an accessible manner. Examples of possible activities include user friendly farecards, schedules, of edge detection on rail platforms, adequate lighting, telecommunication display devices (TDDs) or text telephones, and other accommodations for use by persons with speech and hearing impairments, signage for people with visual impairments, continuous pathways for persons with visual and ambulatory impairments, and public address systems and clocks.</P>
            <P>The Department did not prescribe one list of things that would be appropriate for all stations. For example, we believe that tactile strips are a valuable addition to platforms which have drop-offs. We also believe that most larger systems, to the extent they publish schedules, should make those schedules readily available in alternative formats. We encourage entities to find this another area which benefits from its commitment to far-reaching public participation efforts.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Subpart D—Acquisition of Accessible Vehicles by Public Entities</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.71 Purchase or Lease of New Non-Rail Vehicles by Public Entities Operating Fixed Route Systems</HD>
            <P>This section generally sets out the basic acquisition requirements for a public entity purchasing a new vehicle. The section requires any public entity that purchases or leases a new vehicle to acquire an accessible vehicle.</P>

            <P>In addition, the waiver request must include copies of advertisements in trade publications and inquiries to trade associations seeking lifts for the buses. The public entity also must include a full justification for the assertion that a delay in the bus procurement sufficient to obtain a lift-equipped bus would significantly impair transportation services in the community. There is no length of time that would be a <E T="03">per se</E> delay constituting a “significant impairment”. It will be more difficult to obtain a waiver if a relatively short rather than relatively lengthy delay is involved. A showing of timetables, absent a showing of significant impairment of actual transit services, would not form a basis for granting a waiver.</P>
            <P>Any waiver granted by the Department under this provision will be a conditional waiver. The conditions are intended to ensure that the waiver provision does not create a loophole in the accessible vehicle acquisition requirement that Congress intended to impose. The ADA requires a waiver to be limited in duration and the rule requires a termination date to be included. The date will be established on the basis of the information the Department receives concerning the availability of lifts in the waiver request and elsewhere. In addition, so that a waiver does not become open-ended, it will apply only to a particular procurement. If a transit agency wants a waiver for a subsequent delivery of buses in the procurement, or another procurement entirely, it will have to make a separate waiver request.</P>

            <P>For example, if a particular order of buses is delivered over a period of time, each delivery would be the potential subject of a waiver request. First, the entity would request a waiver for the first shipment of buses. If all of the conditions are met, the waiver would be granted, with a date specified to coincide <PRTPAGE P="464"/>with the due date of the lifts. When the lifts become available those buses would have to be retrofitted with the lifts. A subsequent delivery of buses—on the same order—would have to receive its own waiver, subject to the same conditions and specifications of the first waiver.</P>
            <P>The purpose of the waiver, as the Department construes it, is to address a situation in which (because of a sudden increase in the number of lift-equipped buses requested) lift manufacturers are unable to produce enough lifts to meet the demand in a timely fashion.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.73 Purchase or Lease of Used Non-Rail Vehicles by Public Entities Operating a Fixed Route System</HD>
            <P>The basic rule is that an acquisition of a used vehicle would have to be for an accessible vehicle.</P>
            <P>There is an exception, however, for situations in which the transit provider makes a good faith effort to obtain accessible used vehicles but does not succeed in finding them. The ADA requires transit agencies to purchase accessible used vehicles, providing a “demonstrated good faith efforts” exception to the requirement. The reports of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources and the House Committee on Education and Labor offered the following guidance on what “good faith efforts” involve:</P>
            <P>The phrase “demonstrated good faith efforts” is intended to require a nationwide search and not a search limited to a particular region. For instance, it would not be enough for a transit operator to contact only the manufacturer where the transit authority usually does business to see if there are accessible used buses. It involves the transit authority advertising in a trade magazine, i.e., Passenger Transport, or contacting the transit trade association, American Public Transit Association (APTA), to determine whether accessible used vehicles are available. It is the Committee's expectation that as the number of buses with lifts increases, the burden on the transit authority to demonstrate its inability to purchase accessible vehicles despite good faith efforts will become more and more difficult to satisfy. S. Rept. 101-116 at 49; H. Rept. 101-485 at 90.</P>
            <P>Consistent with this guidance, this section requires that good faith efforts include specifying accessible vehicles in bid solicitations. The section also requires that the entity retain for two years documentation of that effort, and that the information be available to FTA and the public.</P>
            <P>It does not meet the good faith efforts requirement to purchase inaccessible, rather than accessible, used buses, just because the former are less expensive, particularly if the difference is a difference attributable to the presence of a lift. There may be situations in which good faith efforts involve buying fewer accessible buses in preference to more inaccessible buses.</P>
            <P>The public participation requirements involved in the development of the paratransit plans for all fixed route operators requires an ongoing relationship, including extensive outreach, to the community likely to be using its accessible service. We believe that it will be difficult to comply with the public participation requirements and not involve the affected community in the decisions concerning the purchase or lease of used accessible vehicles.</P>
            <P>There is an exception to these requirements for donated vehicles. Not all “zero dollar” transfers are donations, however. The legislative history to this provision provides insight.</P>
            <P>It is not the Committee's intent to make the vehicle accessibility provisions of this title applicable to vehicles donated to a public entity. The Committee understands that it is not usual to donate vehicles to a public entity. However, there could be instances where someone could conceivably donate a bus to a public transit operator in a will. In such a case, the transit operators should not be prevented from accepting a gift.</P>
            <P>The Committee does not intend that this limited exemption for donated vehicles be used to circumvent the intent of the ADA. For example, a local transit authority could not arrange to be the recipient of donated inaccessible buses. This would be a violation of the ADA. S. Rpt. 101-116, at 46; H. Rpt. 101-486, at 87.</P>
            <P>Entities interested in accepting donated vehicles must submit a request to FTA to verify that the transaction is a donation.</P>
            <P>There is one situation, in which a vehicle has prior use is not treated as a used vehicle. If a vehicle has been remanufactured, and it is within the period of the extension of its useful life, it is not viewed as a used vehicle (see H. Rept. 101-485, Pt 1 at 27). During this period, such a vehicle may be acquired by another entity without going through the good faith efforts process. This is because, at the time of its remanufacture, the bus would have been made as accessible if feasible. When the vehicle has completed its extended useful life (e.g., the beginning of year six when its useful life has extended five years), it becomes subject to used bus requirements.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.75 Remanufacture of Non-Rail Vehicles and Purchase or Lease of Remanufactured Non-rail Vehicles by Public Entities Operating Fixed Route Systems</HD>

            <P>This section tracks the statute closely, and contains the following provisions. First, it requires any public entity operating a fixed route system to purchase an accessible vehicle if the acquisition occurs after August 25, 1990, if the vehicle is remanufactured after August 25, 1990, or the entity contracts or undertakes the remanufacture of a vehicle <PRTPAGE P="465"/>after August 25, 1990. The ADA legislative history makes it clear that remanufacture is to include changes to the structure of the vehicle which extend the useful life of the vehicle for five years. It clearly is not intended to capture things such as engine overhauls and the like.</P>
            <P>The term remanufacture, as used in the ADA context, is different from the use of the term in previously issued FTA guidance. The term has a specific meaning under the ADA: there must be structural work done to the vehicle and the work must extend the vehicle's useful life by five years.</P>
            <P>The ADA imposes no requirements on what FTA traditionally considers bus rehabilitation. Such work involves rebuilding a bus to original specifications and focuses on mechanical systems and interiors. Often this work includes replacing components. It is less extensive than remanufacture.</P>
            <P>The statute, and the rule, includes an exception for the remanufacture of historical vehicles. This exception applies to the remanufacture of or purchase of a remanufactured vehicle that (1) is of historic character; (2) operates solely on a segment of a fixed route system which is on the National Register of Historic Places; and (3) making the vehicle accessible would significantly alter the historic character of the vehicle. The exception only extends to the remanufacture that would alter the historic character of the vehicle. All modifications that can be made without altering the historic character (such as slip resistant flooring) must be done.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.77 Purchase or Lease of New Non-Rail Vehicles by Public Entities Operating a Demand Responsive System for the General Public</HD>
            <P>Section 224 of the ADA requires that a public entity operating a demand responsive system purchase or lease accessible new vehicles, for which a solicitation is made after August 25, 1990, unless the system, when viewed in its entirety, provides a level of service to individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, equivalent to the level of service provided to individuals without disabilities. This section is the same as the October 4, 1990 final rule which promulgated the immediately effective acquisition requirements of the ADA.</P>

            <P>The Department has been asked to clarify what “accessible when viewed in its entirety” means in the context of a demand responsive system being allowed to purchase an inaccessible vehicle. First, it is important to note that this exception applies only to demand responsive systems (and not fixed route systems). The term “equivalent service” was discussed during the passage of the ADA. Material from the legislative history indicates that “when viewed in its entirety/equivalent service” means that “when all aspects of a transportation system are analyzed, equal opportunities for each individual with a disability to use the transportation system must exist. (H. Rept. 101-184, Pt. 2, at 95; S. Rept. 101-116 at 54). For example, both reports said that “the time delay between a phone call to access the demand responsive system and pick up the individual is not greater because the individual needs a lift or ramp or other accommodation to access the vehicle.” (<E T="03">Id.</E>)</P>
            <P>Consistent with this, the Department has specified certain service criteria that are to be used when determining if the service is equivalent. As in previous rulemakings on this provision, the standards (which include service area, response time, fares, hours and days of service, trip purpose restrictions, information and reservations capability, and other capacity constraints) are not absolute standards. They do not say, for example, that a person with a disability must be picked up in a specified number of hours. The requirement is that there must be equivalent service for all passengers, whether or not they have a disability. If the system provides service to persons without disabilities within four hours of a call for service, then passengers with disabilities must be afforded the same service.</P>
            <P>The Department has been asked specifically where an entity should send its “equivalent level of service” certifications. We provide the following: Equivalent level of service certifications should be submitted to the state program office if you are a public entity receiving FTA funds through the state. All other entities should submit their equivalent level of service certifications to the FTA regional office (listed in appendix B of this part). Certifications must be submitted before the acquisition of the vehicles.</P>
            <P>Paragraph (e) of this section authorizes a waiver for the unavailability of lifts. Since demand responsive systems need not purchase accessible vehicles if they can certify equivalent service, the Department has been asked what this provision is doing in this section.</P>
            <P>Paragraph (e) applies in the case in which an entity operates a demand responsive system, which is not equivalent, and the entity cannot find accessible vehicles to acquire. In this case, the waiver provisions applicable to a fixed route entity purchasing or leasing inaccessible new vehicles applies to the demand responsive operator as well.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.81 Purchase or Lease of Used Rail Vehicles by Public Entities Operating Rapid or Light Rail Systems</HD>
            <P>This section lays out the requirements for a public entity acquiring a used rail vehicle. The requirements and standards are the same as those specified for non-rail vehicles in § 37.73. While we recognize it may create difficulties for entities in some situations, the statute does not include any extension or short-term leases. The Department will consider, in a case-by-case basis, how the good faith efforts requirement would apply in the case of an agreement between rail carriers to permit quick-response, short-term leases of cars over a period of time.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.83 Remanufacture of Rail Vehicles and Purchase or Lease of Remanufactured Rail Vehicles by Public Entities Operating Rapid or Light Rail System</HD>
            <P>This section parallels the remanufacturing section for buses, including the exception for historical vehicles. With respect to an entity having a class of historic vehicles that may meet the standards for the historic vehicle exception (e.g., San Francisco cable cars), the Department would not object to a request for application of the exception on a system-wide, as approved to car-by-car, basis.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.85 Purchase or Lease of New Intercity and Commuter Rail Cars</HD>
            <P>This section incorporates the statutory requirement that new intercity and commuter rail cars be accessible. The specific accessibility provisions of the statute (for example, there are slightly different requirements for intercity rail cars versus commuter rail cars) are specified in part 38 of this regulation. These standards are adopted from the voluntary guidelines issues by the Access Board. The section basically parallels the acquisition requirements for buses and other vehicles. It should be noted that the definition of commuter rail operator clearly allows for additional operators to qualify as commuter, since the definition describes the functional characteristics of an operator, as well as listing existing commuter rail operators.</P>
            <P>We would point out that the ADA applies this requirement to all new vehicles. This includes not only vehicles and systems that currently are being operated in the U.S., but new, experimental, or imported vehicles and systems. The ADA does not stand in the way of new technology, but it does require that new technology, and the benefits it brings, be accessible to all persons, including those with disabilities. This point applies to all vehicle acquisition provisions of this regulation, whether for rail or non-rail, private or public, fixed route or demand responsive vehicles and systems.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.87 Purchase or Lease of Used Intercity and Commuter Rail Cars</HD>
            <P>The section also parallels closely the requirements in the ADA for the purchase or lease of accessible used rail vehicles. We acknowledge that, in some situations, the statutory requirement for to make good faith efforts to acquire accessible used vehicles may create difficulties for rail operators attempting to lease rail cars quickly for a short time (e.g., as fill-ins for cars which need repairs). In some cases, it may be possible to mitigate these difficulties through means such as making good faith efforts with respect to an overall agreement between two rail operators to make cars available to one another when needed, rather than each time a car is provided under such an agreement.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.89 Remanufacture of Intercity and Commuter Rail Cars</HD>
            <P>This section requires generally that remanufactured cars be made accessible, to the maximum extent feasible. Feasible is defined in paragraph (c) of the section to be “unless an engineering analysis demonstrates that remanufacturing the car to be accessible would have a significant adverse effect on the structural integrity of the car.” Increased cost is not a reason for viewing other sections of this subpart concerning remanufactured vehicles.</P>
            <P>In addition, this section differs from the counterpart sections for non-rail vehicles and light and rapid rail vehicles in two ways. First, the extension of useful life needed to trigger the section is ten rather than five years. Second, there is no historic vehicle exception. Both of these differences are statutory.</P>

            <P>This section implements the statutory directive that all rail operators (light, rapid, commuter and intercity) have at least one car per train accessible to persons with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs by July 26, 1995. (See ADA sections 242(a)(1), 242(b)(1), 228(b)(1).) Section 37.93 contains this general requirement. In some cases, entities will meet the one-car-per train rule through the purchase of new cars. In this case, since all new rail vehicles have to be accessible, compliance with this provision is straightforward.</P>

            <P>However, certain entities may not be purchasing any new vehicles by July 26, 1995, or may not be purchasing enough vehicles to ensure that one car per train is accessible. In these cases, these entities will have to retrofit existing cars to meet this requirement. <PRTPAGE P="467"/>What a retrofitted car must look like to meet the requirement has been decided by the Access Board. These standards are contained in part 38 of this rule.</P>
            <P>We would point that, consistent with the Access Board standards, a rail system using mini-high platforms or wayside lifts is not required, in most circumstances, to “double-stop” in order to give passengers a chance to board the second or subsequent car in a train at the mini-high platform or way-side lift. The only exception to this would be a situation in which all the wheelchair positions spaces in the first car were occupied. In this case, the train would have to double-stop to allow a wheelchair user to board, rather than passing the person by when there was space available in other than the first car, except where doing is necessary to comply with the provisions of section 37.42 of this part.</P>

            <P>Equivalency, for purposes of these requirements, is spelled out in § 37.105. It is important to note that some portions of this section (referring to response time, reservations capacity, and restrictions on trip purpose) apply only to demand responsive systems. Another provision (schedules/headways) applies only to fixed route systems. This is because these points of comparison apply only to one or the other type system. The remaining provisions apply to both kinds of systems.</P>
            <P>In applying the provisions this section, it is important to note that they are only points of comparison, not substantive criteria. For example, unlike the response time criterion of § 37.131, this section does not require that a system provide any particular response time. All it says is that, in order for there to be equivalency, if the demand responsive system gets a van to a non-disabled person in 2 hours, or 8 hours, or a week and a half after a call for service, the system must get an accessible van to a person with a disability in 2 hours, or 8 hours, or a week and a half.</P>
            <P>The vehicle acquisition and equivalency provisions work together in the following way. A private entity is about to acquire a vehicle for a transportation service in one of the categories to which equivalency is relevant. The entity looks at its present service (considered without regard to the vehicle it plans to acquire). Does the present service meet the equivalency standard? (In answering this question, the point of reference is the next potential customer who needs an accessible vehicle. The fact that such persons have not called in the past is irrelevant). If not, the entity is required to acquire an accessible vehicle. If so, the entity may acquire an accessible or an inaccessible vehicle. This process must be followed every time the entity purchases or leases a vehicle. Given changes in the mixes of both customers and vehicles, the answer to the question about equivalency will probably not be the same for an entity every time it is asked.</P>

            <P>One difference between the requirements for “private, not primarily” and “private, primarily” entities is that the requirements apply to all vehicles purchased or leased for <PRTPAGE P="468"/>the former, but only to new vehicles for the latter. This means that entities in the latter category are not required to acquire accessible vehicles when they purchase or lease used vehicles. Another oddity in the statute which entities should note is that the requirement for “private, primarily” entities to acquire accessible vans with less than eight passenger capacity (or provide equivalent service) does not become effective until after February 25, 1992 (This also date also applies no private entities “primarily engaged” which purchase passenger rail cars). All other vehicle acquisition requirements became effective after August 25, 1990.</P>
            <P>The Department views the line between “private, primarily” and “private, not primarily” entities as being drawn with respect to the bus, van, or other service which the entity is providing. For example, there is an obvious sense in which an airline or car rental company is primarily engaged in the business of transporting people. If the airline or car rental agency runs a shuttle bus from the airport terminal to a downtown location or a rental car lot, however, the Department views that shuttle service as covered by the “private, not primarily” requirements of the rule (see discussion of the Applicability sections above). This is because the airline or car rental agency is not primarily engaged in the business of providing transportation by bus or van. The relationship of the bus or van service to an airline's main business is analogous to that of a shuttle to a hotel. For this purpose, it is of only incidental interest that the main business of the airline is flying people around the country instead of putting them up for the night.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.109 Ferries and Other Passenger Vessels</HD>
            <P>Although at this time there are no specific requirements for vessels, ferries and other passenger vessels operated by private entities are subject to the requirements of § 37.5 of this part and applicable requirements of 28 CFR part 36, the DOJ rule under title III of the ADA.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Subpart F—Paratransit as a Complement to Fixed Route Service</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.121 Requirement for Comparable Complementary Paratransit Service</HD>
            <P>This section sets forth the basic requirement that all public entities who operate a fixed route system have to provide paratransit service that is both comparable and complementary to the fixed route service. By “complementary,” we mean service that acts as a “safety net” for individuals with disabilities who cannot use the fixed route system. By “comparable,” we mean service that meets the service criteria of this subpart.</P>
            <P>This requirement applies to light and rapid rail systems as well as to bus systems, even when rail and bus systems share all or part of the same service area. Commuter bus, commuter rail and intercity rail systems do not have to provide paratransit, however. The remaining provisions of subpart F set forth the details of the eligibility requirements for paratransit, the service criteria that paratransit systems must meet, the planning process involved, and the procedures for applying for waivers based on undue financial burden.</P>
            <P>Paratransit may be provided by a variety of modes. Publicly operated dial-a-ride vans, service contracted out to a private paratransit provider, user-side subsidy programs, or any combination of these and other approaches is acceptable. Entities who feel it necessary to apply for an undue financial burden waiver should be aware that one of the factors FTA will examine in evaluating waiver requests is efficiencies the provider could realize in its paratransit service. Therefore, it is important for entities in this situation to use the most economical and efficient methods of providing paratransit they can devise.</P>
            <P>It is also important for them to establish and consistently implement strong controls against fraud, waste and abuse in the paratransit system. Fraud, waste and abuse can drain significant resources from a system and control of these problems is an important “efficiency for any paratransit system. It will be difficult for the Department to grant an undue financial burden waiver to entities which do not have a good means of determining if fraud, waste and abuse are problems and adequate methods of combating these problems, where they are found to exist.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.123 ADA Paratransit Eligibility—Standards</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">General Provisions</HD>
            <P>This section sets forth the minimum requirements for eligibility for complementary paratransit service. All fixed route operators providing complementary paratransit must make service available at least to individuals meeting these standards. The ADA does not prohibit providing paratransit service to anyone. Entities may provide service to additional persons as well. Since only service to ADA eligible persons is required by the rule, however, only the costs of this service can be counted in the context of a request for an undue financial burden waiver.</P>

            <P>When the rule says that ADA paratransit eligibility shall be strictly limited to persons in the eligible categories, then, it is not saying that entities are in any way precluded from serving other people. It is saying that the persons who must be provided service, and counting the costs of providing them service, in context of an undue burden waiver, are limited to the regulatory categories.<PRTPAGE P="469"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Temporary Disabilities</HD>
            <P>Eligibility may be based on a temporary as well as a permanent disability. The individual must meet one of the three eligibility criteria in any case, but can do so for a limited period of time. For example, if an individual breaks both legs and is in two casts for several weeks, becomes a wheelchair user for the duration, and the bus route that would normally take him to work is not accessible, the individual could be eligible under the second eligibility category. In granting eligibility to such a person, the entity should establish an expiration date for eligibility consistent with the expected end of the period disability.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Trip-by-Trip Eligibility</HD>
            <P>A person may be ADA paratransit eligible for some trips but not others. Eligibility does not inhere in the individual or his or her disability, as such, but in meeting the functional criteria of inability to use the fixed route system established by the ADA. This inability is likely to change with differing circumstances.</P>
            <P>For example, someone whose impairment-related condition is a severe sensitivity to temperatures below 20 degrees is not prevented from using fixed route transit when the temperature is 75 degrees. Someone whose impairment-related condition is an inability to maneuver a wheelchair through snow is not prevented from using fixed route transit when there is no snow on the ground. Someone with a cognitive disability may have learned to take the same bus route to a supported employment job every day. This individual is able to navigate the system for work purposes and therefore would not be eligible for paratransit for work trips. But the individual may be unable to get to other destinations on the bus system without getting lost, and would be eligible for paratransit for non-work trips. Someone who normally drives his own car to a rail system park and ride lot may have a specific impairment related condition preventing him from getting to the station when his car is in the shop. A person who can use accessible fixed route service can go to one destination on an accessible route; another destination would require the use of an inaccessible route. The individual would be eligible for the latter but not the former.</P>
            <P>In many cases, though the person is eligible for some trips but not others, eligibility determinations would not have to be made literally on a trip-by-trip basis. It may often be possible to establish the conditions on eligibility as part of the initial eligibility determination process. Someone with a temperature sensitivity might be granted seasonal eligibility. Somebody who is able to navigate the system for work but not non-work trips could have this fact noted in his or her eligibility documentation. Likewise, someone with a variable condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis, HIV disease, need for kidney dialysis) could have their eligibility based on the underlying condition, with paratransit need for a particular trip dependent on self-assessment or a set of medical standards (e.g., trip within a certain amount of time after a dialysis session). On the other hand, persons in the second eligibility category (people who can use accessible fixed route service where it exists) would be given service on the basis of the particular route they would use for a given trip.</P>
            <P>Because entities are not precluded from providing service beyond that required by the rule, an entity that believes it is too difficult to administer a program of trip-by-trip eligibility is not required to do so. Nothing prevents an entity from providing all requested trips to a person whom the ADA requires to receive service for only some trips. In this case, if the entity intends to request an undue financial burden waiver, the entity, as provided in the undue burden provisions of this rule, must estimate, by a statistically valid technique, the percentage of its paratransit trips that are mandated by the ADA. Only that percentage of its total costs will be counted in considering the undue burden waiver request.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Category 1 Eligibility</HD>
            <P>The first eligibility category includes, among others, persons with mental or visual impairments who, as a result, cannot “navigate the system.” This eligibility category includes people who cannot board, ride, or disembark from an accessible vehicle “without the assistance of another individual.” This means that, if an individual needs an attendant to board, ride, or disembark from an accessible fixed route vehicles (including “navigating the system”), the individual is eligible for paratransit. One implication of this language is that an individual does not lose paratransit eligibility based on “inability to navigate the system” because the individual chooses to travel with a friend on the paratransit system (even if the friend could help the person navigate the fixed route system). Eligibility in this category is based on ability to board, ride, and disembark independently.</P>

            <P>Mobility training (e.g., of persons with mental or visual impairments) may help to improve the ability of persons to navigate the system or to get to a bus stop. Someone who is successfully mobility trained to use the fixed route system for all or some trips need not be provided paratransit service for those trips. The Department encourages entities to sponsor such training as a means of assisting individuals to use fixed route rather than paratransit.<PRTPAGE P="470"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Category 2 Eligibility</HD>
            <P>The second eligibility criterion is the broadest, with respect to persons with mobility impairments, but its impact should be reduced over time as transit systems become more accessible. This category applies to persons who could use accessible fixed route transportation, but accessible transportation is not being used at the time, and on the route, the persons would travel. This concept is route based, not system based.</P>
            <P>Speaking first of bus systems, if a person is traveling from Point A to Point B on route 1, and route 1 is accessible, the person is not eligible for paratransit for the trip. This is true even though other portions of the system are still inaccessible. If the person is traveling from Point A to Point C on route 2, which is not accessible, the person is eligible for that trip. If the person is traveling from Point A to Point B on accessible route 1, with a transfer at B to go on inaccessible route 3 to Point D, then the person is eligible for the second leg of the trip. (The entity could choose to provide a paratransit trip from A to D or a paratransit or on-call bus trip from B to D.)</P>
            <P>For purposes of this standard, we view a route as accessible when all buses scheduled on the route are accessible. Otherwise, it is unlikely that an accessible vehicle could be provided “within a reasonable period of [a] time” when the individual wants to travel, as the provision requires. We recognize that some systems' operations may not be organized in a way that permits determining whether a given route is accessible, even though a route-by-route determination appears to be contemplated by the statute. In such cases, it may be that category 2 eligibility would persist until the entire system was eligible.</P>
            <P>With respect to a rail system, an individual is eligible under this standard if, on the route or line he or she wants to use, there is not yet one car per train accessible or if key stations are not yet accessible. This eligibility remains even if bus systems covering the area served by the rail system have become 100 percent accessible. This is necessary because people use rail systems for different kinds of trips than bus systems. It would often take much more in the way of time, trouble, and transfers for a person to go on the buses of one or more transit authorities than to have a direct trip provided by the rail operator. Since bus route systems are often designed to feed rail systems rather than duplicate them, it may often be true that “you can't get there from here” relying entirely on bus routes or the paratransit service area that parallels them.</P>
            <P>If the lift on a vehicle cannot be deployed at a particular stop, an individual is eligible for paratransit under this category with respect to the service to the inaccessible stop. If on otherwise accessible route 1, an individual wants to travel from Point A to Point E, and the lift cannot be deployed at E, the individual is eligible for paratransit for the trip. (On-call bus would not work as a mode of providing this trip, since a bus lift will not deploy at the stop.) This is true even though service from Point A to all other points on the line is fully accessible. In this circumstance, the entity should probably think seriously about working with the local government involved to have the stop moved or made accessible.</P>
            <P>When we say that a lift cannot be deployed, we mean literally that the mechanism will not work at the location to permit a wheelchair user or other person with a disability to disembark or that the lift will be damaged if it is used there. It is not consistent with the rule for a transit provider to declare a stop off-limits to someone who uses the lift while allowing other passengers to use the stop. However, if temporary conditions not under the operator's control (e.g., construction, an accident, a landslide) make it so hazardous for anyone to disembark that the stop is temporarily out of service for all passengers may the operator refuse to allow a passenger to disembark using the lift.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Category 3 Eligibility</HD>
            <P>The third eligibility criterion concerns individuals who have a specific impairment-related condition which prevents them from getting to or from a stop or station. As noted in the legislative history of the ADA, this is intended to be a “very narrow exception” to the general rule that difficulty in traveling to or from boarding or disembarking locations is not a basis for eligibility.</P>
            <P>What is a specific impairment-related condition? The legislative history mentions four examples: Chronic fatigue, blindness, a lack of cognitive ability to remember and follow directions, or a special sensitivity to temperature. Impaired mobility, severe communications disabilities (e.g., a combination of serious vision and hearing impairments), cardiopulmonary conditions, or various other serious health problems may have similar effects. The Department does not believe that it is appropriate, or even possible, to create an exhaustive list.</P>

            <P>What the rule uses as an eligibility criterion is not just the existence of a specific impairment-related condition. To be a basis for eligibility, the condition must prevent the individual from traveling to a boarding location or from a disembarking location. The word “prevent” is very important. For anyone, going to a bus stop and waiting for a bus is more difficult and less comfortable than waiting for a vehicle at one's home. This is likely to be all the more true for an individual with a disability. But for many persons with disabilities, in many circumstances, getting to a bus stop is possible. <PRTPAGE P="471"/>If an impairment related condition only makes the job of accessing transit more difficult than it might otherwise be, but does not prevent the travel, then the person is not eligible.</P>
            <P>For example, in many areas, there are not yet curb cuts. A wheelchair user can often get around this problem by taking a less direct route to a destination than an ambulatory person would take. That involves more time, trouble, and effort than for someone without a mobility impairment. But the person can still get to the bus stop. On the basis of these architectural barriers, the person would not be eligible.</P>
            <P>Entities are cautioned that, particularly in cases involving lack of curb cuts and other architectural barrier problems, assertions of eligibility should be given tight scrutiny. Only if it is apparent from the facts of a particular case that an individual cannot find a reasonable alternative path to a location should eligibility be granted.</P>
            <P>If we add a foot of snow to the scenario, then the same person taking the same route may be unable to get to the bus stop. It is not the snow alone that stops him; it is the interaction of the snow and the fact that the individual has a specific-impairment related condition that requires him to push a wheelchair through the snow that prevents the travel.</P>
            <P>Inevitably, some judgment is required to distinguish between situations in which travel is prevented and situations in which it is merely made more difficult. In the Department's view, a case of “prevented travel” can be made not only where travel is literally impossible (e.g., someone cannot find the bus stop, someone cannot push a wheelchair through the foot of snow or up a steep hill) but also where the difficulties are so substantial that a reasonable person with the impairment-related condition in question would be deterred from making the trip.</P>
            <P>The regulation makes the interaction between an impairment-related condition and the environmental barrier (whether distance, weather, terrain, or architectural barriers) the key to eligibility determinations. This is an individual determination. Depending on the specifics of their impairment-related condition, one individual may be able to get from his home to a bus stop under a given set of conditions, while his next-door neighbor may not.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Companions</HD>
            <P>The ADA requires entities to provide paratransit to one person accompanying the eligible individual, with others served on a space-available basis. The one individual who is guaranteed space on the vehicle can be anyone—family member, business associate, friend, date, etc. The provider cannot limit the eligible individual's choice of type of companion. The transit authority may require that the eligible individual reserve a space for the companion when the individual reserves his or her own ride. This one individual rides even if this means that there is less room for other eligible individuals. Additional individuals beyond the first companion are carried only on a space available basis; that is, they do not displace other ADA paratransit eligible individuals.</P>
            <P>A personal care attendant (i.e., someone designated or employed specifically to help the eligible individual meet his or her personal needs) always may ride with the eligible individual. If there is a personal care attendant on the trip, the eligible individual may still bring a companion, plus additional companions on a space available basis. The entity may require that, in reserving the trip, the eligible individual reserve the space for the attendant.</P>
            <P>To prevent potential abuse of this provision, the rule provides that a companion (e.g., friend or family member) does not count as a personal care attendant unless the eligible individual regularly makes use of a personal care attendant and the companion is actually acting in that capacity. As noted under § 37.125, a provider may require that, as part of the initial eligibility certification process, an individual indicate whether he or she travels with a personal care attendant. If someone does not indicate the use of an attendant, then any individual accompanying him or her would be regarded simply as a companion.</P>
            <P>To be viewed as “accompanying” the eligible individual, a companion must have the same origin and destination points as the eligible individual. In appropriate circumstances, entities may also wish to provide service to a companion who has either an origin or destination, but not both, with the eligible individual (e.g., the individual's date is dropped off at her own residence on the return trip from a concert).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.125 ADA Paratransit Eligibility—Process</HD>
            <P>This section requires an eligibilty process to be established by each operator of complementary paratransit. The details of the process are to be devised through the planning and public participation process of this subpart. The process may not impose unreasonable administrative burdens on applicants, and, since it is part of the entity's nondiscrimination obligations, may not involve “user fees” or application fees to the applicant.</P>

            <P>The process may include functional criteria related to the substantive eligibility criteria of § 37.123 and, where appropriate, functional evaluation or testing of applicants. The substantive eligibility process is not aimed at making a medical or diagnostic determination. While evaluation by a physician (or professionals in rehabilitation or <PRTPAGE P="472"/>other relevant fields) may be used as part of the process, a diagnosis of a disability is not dispositive. What is needed is a determination of whether, as a practical matter, the individual can use fixed route transit in his or her own circumstances. That is a transportation decision primarily, not a medical decision.</P>
            <P>The goal of the process is to ensure that only people who meet the regulatory criteria, strictly applied, are regarded as ADA paratransit eligible. The Department recognizes that transit entities may wish to provide service to other persons, which is not prohibited by this rule. However, the eligibility process should clearly distinguish those persons who are ADA eligible from those who are provided service on other grounds. For example, eligibility documentation must clearly state whether someone is ADA paratransit eligible or eligible on some other basis.</P>
            <P>Often, people tend to think of paratransit exclusively in terms of people with mobility impairments. Under the ADA, this is not accurate. Persons with visual impairments may be eligible under either the first or third eligibility categories. To accommodate them, all documents concerning eligibility must be made available in one or more accessible formats, on request. Accessible formats include computer disks, braille documents, audio cassettes, and large print documents. A document does not necessarily need to be made available in the format a requester prefers, but it does have to be made available in a format the person can use. There is no use giving a computer disk to someone who does not have a computer, for instance, or a braille document to a person who does not read braille.</P>
            <P>When a person applies for eligibility, the entity will provide all the needed forms and instructions. These forms and instructions may include a declaration of whether the individual travels with a personal care attendant. The entity may make further inquiries concerning such a declaration (e.g., with respect to the individual's actual need for a personal care attendant).</P>
            <P>When the application process is complete—all necessary actions by the applicant taken—the entity should process the application in 21 days. If it is unable to do so, it must begin to provide service to the applicant on the 22nd day, as if the application had been granted. Service may be terminated only if and when the entity denies the application. All determinations shall be in writing; in the case of a denial, reasons must be specified. The reasons must specifically relate the evidence in the matter to the eligibility criteria of this rule and of the entity's process. A mere recital that the applicant can use fixed route transit is not sufficient.</P>

            <P>For people granted eligibility, the documentation of eligibility shall include at least the following information:
            </P>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">—The individual's name</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">—The name of the transit provider</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">—The telephone number of the entity's paratransit coordinator</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">—An expiration date for eligibility</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">—Any conditions or limitations on the individual's eligibility, including the use of a personal care attendant.</FP>
            
            <P>The last point refers to the situation in which a person is eligible for some trips but not others. Or if the traveler is authorized to have a personal care attendant ride free of charge. For example, the documentation may say that the individual is eligible only when the temperature falls below a certain point, or when the individual is going to a destination not on an accessible bus route, or for non-work trips, etc.</P>
            <P>As the mention of an expiration date implies, certification is not forever. The entity may recertify eligibility at reasonable intervals to make sure that changed circumstances have not invalidated or changed the individual's eligibility. In the Department's view, a reasonable interval for recertification is probably between one and three years. Less than one year would probably be too burdensome for consumers; over three years would begin to lose the point of doing recertifications. The recertification interval should be stated in the entity's plan. Of course, a user of the service can apply to modify conditions on his or her eligibility at any time.</P>
            <P>The administrative appeal process is intended to give applicants who have been denied eligibility the opportunity to have their cases heard by some official other than the one who turned them down in the first place. In order to have appropriate separation of functions—a key element of administrative due process—not only must the same person not decide the case on appeal, but that person, to the extent practicable, should not have been involved in the first decision (e.g., as a member of the same office, or a supervisor or subordinate of the original decisionmaker). When, as in the case of a small transit operator, this degree of separation is not feasible, the second decisionmaker should at least be “bubbled” with respect to the original decision (i.e., not have participated in the original decision or discussed it with the original decisionmaker). In addition, there must be an opportunity to be heard in person as well as the chance to present written evidence and arguments. All appeals decisions must be in writing, stating the reasons for the decision.</P>

            <P>To prevent the filing of stale claims, the entity may establish a 60 day “statute of limitations” on filing of appeals, the time starting to run on the date the individual is <PRTPAGE P="473"/>notified on the negative initial decision. After the appeals process has been completed (i.e., the hearing and/or written submission completed), the entity should make a decision within 30 days. If it does not, the individual must be provided service beginning the 31st day, until and unless an adverse decision is rendered on his or her appeal.</P>
            <P>Under the eligibility criteria of the rule, an individual has a right to paratransit if he or she meets the eligibility criteria. As noted in the discussion of the nondiscrimination section, an entity may refuse service to anindividual with a disability who engages in violent, seriously disruptive, or illegal conduct, using the same standards for exclusion that would apply to any other person who acted in such an inappropriate way.</P>
            <P>The rule also allows an entity to establish a process to suspend, for a reasonable period of time, the provision of paratransit service to an ADA eligible person who establishes a pattern or practice of missing scheduled trips. The purpose of this process would be to deter or deal with chronic “no-shows.” The sanction system—articulated criteria for the imposition of sanctions, length of suspension periods, details of the administrative process, etc.—would be developed through the public planning and participation process for the entity's paratransit plan, and the result reflected in the plan submission to FTA.</P>
            <P>It is very important to note that sanctions could be imposed only for a “pattern or practice” of missed trips. A pattern or practice involves intentional, repeated or regular actions, not isolated, accidental, or singular incidents. Moreover, only actions within the control of the individual count as part of a pattern or practice. Missed trips due to operator error are not attributable to the individual passenger for this purpose. If the vehicle arrives substantially after the scheduled pickup time, and the passenger has given up on the vehicle and taken a taxi or gone down the street to talk to a neighbor, that is not a missed trip attributable to the passenger. If the vehicle does not arrive at all, or is sent to the wrong address, or to the wrong entrance to a building, that is not a missed trip attributable to the passenger. There may be other circumstances beyond the individual's control (e.g., a sudden turn for the worse in someone with a variable condition, a sudden family emergency) that make it impracticable for the individual to travel at the scheduled time and also for the individual to notify the entity in time to cancel the trip before the vehicle comes. Such circumstances also would not form part of a sanctionable pattern or practice.</P>
            <P>Once an entity has certified someone as eligible, the individual's eligibility takes on the coloration of a property right. (This is not merely a theoretical statement. If one depends on transportation one has been found eligible for to get to a job, and the eligibility is removed, one may lose the job. The same can be said for access to medical care or other important services.) Consequently, before eligibility may be removed “for cause” under this provision, the entity must provide administrative due process to the individual.</P>
            <P>If the entity proposes to impose sanctions on someone, it must first notify the individual in writing (using accessible formats where necessary). The notice must specify the basis of the proposed action (e.g., Mr. Smith scheduled trips for 8 a.m. on May 15, 2 p.m. on June 3, 9 a.m. on June 21, and 9:20 p.m. on July 10, and on each occasion the vehicle appeared at the scheduled time and Mr. Smith was nowhere to be found) and set forth the proposed sanction (e.g., Mr. Smith would not receive service for 15 days).</P>
            <P>The entity would provide the individual an opportunity to be heard (i.e., an in-person informal hearing before a decisionmaker) as well as to present written and oral information and arguments. All relevant entity records and personnel would be made available to the individual, and other persons could testify. It is likely that, in many cases, an important factual issue would be whether a missed trip was the responsibility of the provider or the passenger, and the testimony of other persons and the provider's records or personnel are likely to be relevant in deciding this issue. While the hearing is intended to be informal, the individual could bring a representative (e.g., someone from an advocacy organization, an attorney).</P>
            <P>The individual may waive the hearing and proceed on the basis of written presentations. If the individual does not respond to the notice within a reasonable time, the entity may make, in effect, a default finding and impose sanctions. If there is a hearing, and the individual needs paratransit service to attend the hearing, the entity must provide it. We would emphasize that, prior to a finding against the individual after this due process procedure, the individual must continue to receive service. The entity cannot suspend service while the matter is pending.</P>
            <P>The entity must notify the individual in writing about the decision, the reasons for it, and the sanctions imposed, if any. Again, this information would be made available in accessible formats. In the case of a decision adverse to the individual, the administrative appeals process of this section would apply. The sanction would be stayed pending an appeal.</P>

            <P>There are means other than sanctions, however, by which a transit provider can deal with a “no-show” problem in its system. Providers who use “real time scheduling” report that this technique is very effective in reducing no-shows and cancellations, and increasing the mix of real time scheduling in a system can probably be of benefit in this area. Calling the customer to reconfirm a <PRTPAGE P="474"/>reasonable time before pickup can head off some problems, as can educating consumers to call with cancellations ahead of time. Training of dispatch and operator personnel can help to avoid miscommunications that lead to missed trips.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.127 Complementary Paratransit for Visitors</HD>
            <P>This section requires each entity having a complementary paratransit system to provide service to visitors from out of town on the same basis as it is provided to local residents. By “on the same basis,” we mean under all the same conditions, service criteria, etc., without distinction. For the period of a visit, the visitor is treated exactly like an eligible local user, without any higher priority being given to either.</P>
            <P>A visitor is defined as someone who does not reside in the jurisdiction or jurisdictions served by the public entity or other public entities with which it coordinates paratransit service. For example, suppose a five-county metropolitan area provides coordinated paratransit service under a joint plan. A resident of any of the five counties would not be regarded as a visitor in any of them. Note that the rule talks in terms of “jurisdiction” rather than “service area.” If an individual lives in XYZ County, but outside the fixed route service area of that county's transit provider, the individual is still not a visitor for purposes of paratransit in PQR County, if PQR is one of the counties with which XYZ provides coordinated paratransit service.</P>
            <P>A visitor can become eligible in one of two ways. The first is to present documentation from his or her “home” jurisdiction's paratransit system. The local provider will give “full faith and credit” to the ID card or other documentation from the other entity. If the individual has no such documentation, the local provider may require the provision of proof of visitor status (i.e., proof of residence somewhere else) and, if the individual's disability is not apparent, proof of the disability (e.g., a letter from a doctor or rehabilitation professional). Once this documentation is presented and is satisfactory, the local provider will make service available on the basis of the individual's statement that he or she is unable to use the fixed route transit system.</P>
            <P>The local provider need serve someone based on visitor eligibility for no more than 21 days. After that, the individual is treated the same as a local person for eligibility purposes. This is true whether the 21 days are consecutive or parceled out over several shorter visits. The local provider may require the erstwhile visitor to apply for eligibility in the usual local manner. A visitor who expects to be around longer than 21 days should apply for regular eligibility as soon as he arrives. The same approach may be used for a service of requested visits totaling 21 days or more in a relating compact period of time. Preferably, this application process should be arranged before the visitor arrives, by letter, telephone or fax, so that a complete application can be processed expeditiously.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.129 Types of Service</HD>
            <P>The basic mode of service for complementary paratransit is demand responsive, origin-to-destination service. This service may be provided for persons in any one of the three eligibility categories, and must always be provided to persons in the first category (e.g., people who cannot navigate the system). The local planning process should decide whether, or in what circumstances, this service is to be provided as door-to-door or curb-to-curb service.</P>
            <P>For persons in the second eligibility category (e.g., persons who can use accessible buses, but do not have an accessible bus route available to take them to their destination), origin-to-destination service can be used. Alternatively, the entity can provide either of two other forms of service. One is on-call bus, in which the individual calls the provider and arranges for one or more accessible buses to arrive on the routes he needs to use at the appropriate time. On-call bus service must meet all the service criteria of § 37.131, except that on-call buses run only on fixed routes and the fare charged can be only the fixed route fare that anyone pays on the bus (including discounts).</P>
            <P>The second option is “feeder paratransit” to an accessible fixed route that will take the individual to his or her destination. Feeder paratransit, again, would have to meet all the criteria of § 37.131. With respect to fares, the paratransit fare could be charged, but the individual would not be double charged for the trip. That is, having paid the paratransit fare, the transfer to the fixed route would be free.</P>

            <P>For persons in the third eligibility category (e.g., persons who can use fixed route transit but who, because of a specific impairment-related condition, cannot get to or from a stop), the “feeder paratransit” option, under the conditions outlined above, is available. For some trips, it might be necessary to arrange for feeder service at both ends of the fixed route trip. Given the more complicated logistics of such arrangements, and the potential for a mistake that would seriously inconvenience the passenger, the transit provider should consider carefully whether such a “double feeder” system, while permissible, is truly workable in its system (as opposed to a simpler system that used feeder service only at one end of a trip when the bus let the person off at a place from which he or she could independently get to the destination). There may be some <PRTPAGE P="475"/>situations in which origin to destination service is easier and less expensive.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.131 Service Criteria for Complementary Paratransit Service Area</HD>
            <P>The basic bus system service area is a corridor with a width of <FR>3/4</FR> of a mile on each side of each fixed route. At the end of a route, there is a semicircular “cap” on the corridor, consisting of a three-quarter mile radius from the end point of the route to the parallel sides of the corridor.</P>
            <GPH DEEP="123" SPAN="2">
              <GID>EC02FE91.191</GID>
            </GPH>
            <P>Complementary paratransit must provide service to any origin or destination point within a corridor fitting this description around any route in the bus system. Note that this does not say that an eligible user must live within a corridor in order to be eligible. If an individual lives outside the corridor, and can find a way of getting to a pickup point within the corridor, the service must pick him up there. The same holds true at the destination end of the trip.</P>
            <P>Another concept involved in this service criterion is the core service area. Imagine a bus route map of a typical city. Color the bus routes and their corridors blue, against the white outline map. In the densely populated areas of the city, the routes (which, with their corridors attached, cut 1<FR>1/2</FR> mile swaths) merge together into a solid blue mass. There are few, if any, white spots left uncovered, and they are likely to be very small. Paratransit would serve all origins and destinations in the solid blue mass.</P>
            <P>But what of the little white spots surrounded by various bus corridors? Because it would make sense to avoid providing service to such small isolated areas, the rule requires paratransit service there as well. So color them in too.</P>
            <P>Outside the core area, though, as bus routes follow radial arteries into the suburbs and exurbs (we know real bus route maps are more complicated than this, but we simplify for purposes of illustration), there are increasingly wide white areas between the blue corridors, which may have corridors on either side of them but are not small areas completely surrounded by corridors. These white spaces are not part of the paratransit service area and the entity does not have to serve origins and destinations there. However, if, through the planning process, the entity wants to enlarge the width of one or more of the blue corridors from the <FR>3/4</FR> of a mile width, it can do so, to a maximum of 1<FR>1/2</FR> miles on each side of a route. The cost of service provided within such an expanded corridor can be counted in connection with an undue financial burden waiver request.</P>
            <P>There may be a part of the service area where part of one of the corridors overlaps a political boundary, resulting in a requirement to serve origins and destinations in a neighboring jurisdiction which the entity lacks legal authority to service. The entity is not required to serve such origins and destinations, even though the area on the other side of the political boundary is within a corridor. This exception to the service area criterion does not automatically apply whenever there is a political boundary, only when there is a legal bar to the entity providing service on the other side of the boundary.</P>
            <P>The rule requires, in this situation, that the entity take all practicable steps to get around the problem so that it can provide service throughout its service area. The entity should work with the state or local governments involved, via coordination plans, reciprocity agreements, memoranda of understanding or other means to prevent political boundaries from becoming barriers to the travel of individuals with disabilities.</P>
            <P>The definition of the service area for rail systems is somewhat different, though many of the same concepts apply.</P>
            <GPH DEEP="185" SPAN="2">
              <PRTPAGE P="476"/>
              <GID>EC02FE91.192</GID>
            </GPH>
            <P>Around each station on the line (whether or not a key station), the entity would draw a circle with a radius of <FR>3/4</FR> mile. Some circles may touch or overlap. The series of circles is the rail system's service area. (We recognize that, in systems where stations are close together, this could result in a service area that approached being a corridor like that of a bus line.) The rail system would provide paratransit service from any point in one circle to any point in any other circle. The entity would not have to provide service to two points within the same circle, since a trip between two points in the vicinity of the same station is not a trip that typically would be taken by train. Nor would the entity have to provide service to spaces between the circles. For example, a train trip would not get close to point x; one would have to take a bus or other mode of transportation to get from station E or F to point x. A paratransit system comparable to the rail service area would not be required to take someone there either.</P>
            <P>Rail systems typically provide trips that are not made, or cannot be made conveniently, on bus systems. For example, many rail systems cross jurisdictional boundaries that bus systems often do not. One can travel from Station A to a relatively distant Station E on a rail system in a single trip, while a bus trip between the same points, if possible at all, may involve a number of indirect routings and transfers, on two bus systems that may not interface especially well.</P>
            <P>Rail operators have an obligation to provide paratransit equivalents of trips between circles to persons who cannot use fixed route rail systems because they cannot navigate the system, because key stations or trains are not yet accessible, or because they cannot access stations from points within the circles because of a specific impairment-related condition. For individuals who are eligible in category 2 because they need an accessible key station to use the system, the paratransit obligation extends only to transportation among “circles” centered on designated key stations (since, even when the key station plan is fully implemented, these individuals will be unable to use non-key stations).</P>
            <P>It is not sufficient for a rail operator to refer persons with disabilities to an accessible bus system in the area. The obligation to provide paratransit for a rail system is independent of the operations of any bus system serving the same area, whether operated by the same entity that operates the rail system or a different entity. Obviously, it will be advantageous for bus and rail systems to coordinate their paratransit efforts, but a coordinated system would have to ensure coverage of trips comparable to rail trips that could not conveniently be taken on the fixed route bus system.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Response Time</HD>

            <P>Under this provision, an entity must make its reservation service available during the hours its administrative offices are open. If those offices are open 9 to 5, those are the hours during which the reservations service must be open, even if the entity's transit service operated 6 a.m. to midnight. On days prior to a service day on which the administrative offices are not open at all (e.g., a Sunday prior to a Monday service day), the reservation service would also be open 9 to 5. Note that the reservation service on any day <PRTPAGE P="477"/>does not have to be provided directly by a “real person.” An answering machine or other technology can suffice.</P>
            <P>Any caller reaching the reservation service during the 9 to 5 period, in this example, could reserve service for any time during the next 6 a.m. to 12 midnight service day. This is the difference between “next day scheduling” and a system involving a 24-hour prior reservation requirement, in which a caller would have to reserve a trip at 7 a.m. today if he or she wanted to travel at 7 a.m. tomorrow. The latter approach is not adequate under this rule.</P>
            <P>The entity may use real time scheduling for all or part of its service. Like the Moliere character who spoke prose all his life without knowing it, many entities may already be using some real time scheduling (e.g., for return trips which are scheduled on a when-needed basis, as opposed to in advance). A number of transit providers who have used real time scheduling believe that it is more efficient on a per-trip basis and reduces cancellations and no-shows significantly. We encourage entities to consider this form of service.</P>
            <P>Sometimes users want to schedule service well in advance, to be sure of traveling when they want to. The rule tells providers to permit reservations to be made as much as 14 days in advance. In addition, though an entity may negotiate with a user to adjust pickup and return trip times to make scheduling more efficient, the entity cannot insist on scheduling a trip more than one hour earlier or later than the individual desires to travel. Any greater deviation from desired trip would exceed the bounds of comparability.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Fares</HD>
            <P>To calculate the proper paratransit fare, the entity would determine the route(s) that an individual would take to get from his or her origin to his or her destination on the fixed route system. At the time of day the person was traveling, what is the fare for that trip on those routes? Applicable charges like transfer fees or premium service charges may be added to the amount, but discounts (e.g., the half-fare discount for off-peak fixed route travel by elderly and handicapped persons) would not be subtracted. The transit provider could charge up to twice the resulting amount for the paratransit trip.</P>
            <P>The mode through which paratransit is provided does not change the method of calculation. For example, if paratransit is provided via user side subsidy taxi service rather than publicly operated dial-a-ride van service, the cost to the user could still be only twice the applicable fixed route fare. The system operates the same regardless of whether the paratransit trip is being provided in place of a bus or a rail trip the user cannot make on the fixed route system. Where bus and rail systems are run by the same provider (or where the same bus provider runs parallel local and express buses along the same route), the comparison would be made to the mode on which a typical fixed route user would make the particular trip, based on schedule, length, convenience, avoidance of transfers, etc.</P>
            <P>Companions are charged the same fare as the eligible individual they are accompanying. Personal care attendants ride free.</P>
            <P>One exception to the fare requirement is made for social service agency (or other organization-sponsored) trips. This exception, which allows the transit provider to negotiate a price with the agency that is more than twice the relevant fixed route fare, applies to “agency trips,” by which we mean trips which are guaranteed to the agency for its use. That is, if an agency wants 12 slots for a trip to the mall on Saturday for clients with disabilities, the agency makes the reservation for the trips in its name, the agency will be paying for the transportation, and the trips are reserved to the agency, for whichever 12 people the agency designates, the provider may then negotiate any price it can with the agency for the trips. We distinguish this situation from one in which an agency employee, as a service, calls and makes an individual reservation in the name of a client, where the client will be paying for the transportation.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Restrictions and Priorities Based on Trip Purpose</HD>
            <P>This is a simple and straightforward requirement. There can be no restrictions or priorities based on trip purpose in a comparable complementary paratransit system. When a user reserves a trip, the entity will need to know the origin, destination, time of travel, and how many people are traveling. The entity does not need to know why the person is traveling, and should not even ask.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Hours and Days of Service</HD>
            <P>This criterion says simply that if a person can travel to a given destination using a given fixed route at a given time of day, an ADA paratransit eligible person must be able to travel to that same destination on paratransit at that time of day. This criterion recognizes that the shape of the service area can change. Late at night, for example, it is common for certain routes not to be run. Those routes, and their paratransit corridors, do not need to be served with paratransit when the fixed route system is not running on them. One couldn't get to destinations in that corridor by fixed route at those times, so paratransit service is not necessary either.</P>

            <P>It should be pointed out that service during low-demand times need not be by the same paratransit mode as during higher usage periods. For example, if a provider <PRTPAGE P="478"/>uses its own paratransit vans during high demand periods, it could use a private contractor or user-side subsidy provider during low demand periods. This would presumably be a more efficient way of providing late night service. A call-forwarding device for communication with the auxiliary carrier during these low demand times would be perfectly acceptable, and could reduce administrative costs.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Capacity Constraints</HD>
            <P>This provision specifically prohibits two common mechanisms that limit use of a paratransit system so as to constrain demand on its capacity. The first is a waiting list. Tyically, a waiting list involves a determination by a provider that it can provide service only to a given number of eligible persons. Other eligible persons are not able to receive service until one of the people being served moves away or otherwise no longer uses the service. Then the persons on the waiting list can move up. The process is analogous to the wait that persons in some cities have to endure to be able to buy season tickets to a sold-out slate of professional football games.</P>
            <P>The second mechanism specifically mentioned is a number limit on the trips a passenger can take in a given period of time. It is a kind of rationing in which, for example, if one has taken his quota of 30 trips this month, he cannot take further trips for the rest of the month.</P>
            <P>In addition, this paragraph prohibits any operational pattern or practice that significantly limits the availability of service of ADA paratransit eligible persons. As discussed under § 37.125 in the context of missed trips by passengers, a “pattern or practice” involves, regular, or repeated actions, not isolated, accidental, or singular incidents. A missed trip, late arrival, or trip denial now and then does not trigger this provision.</P>
            <P>Operational problems outside the control of the entity do not count as part of a pattern or practice under this provision. For example, if the vehicle has an accident on the way to pick up a passenger, the late arrival would not count as part of a pattern or practice. If something that could not have been anticipated at the time the trip was scheduled (e.g., a snowstorm, an accident or hazardous materials incident that traps the paratransit vehicle, like all traffic on a certain highway, for hours), the resulting missed trip would not count as part of a pattern or practice. On the other hand, if the entity regularly does not maintain its vehicles well, such that frequent mechanical breakdowns result in missed trips or late arrivals, a pattern or practice may exist. This is also true in a situation in which scheduling practices fail to take into account regularly occurring traffic conditions (e.g., rush hour traffic jams), resulting in frequent late arrivals.</P>
            <P>The rule mentions three specific examples of operational patterns or practices that would violate this provision. The first is a pattern or practice of substantial numbers of significantly untimely pickups (either for initial or return trips). To violate this provision, there must be both a substantial number of late arrivals and the late arrivals in question must be significant in length. For example, a DOT Inspector General's (IG) report on one city's paratransit system disclosed that around 30 percent of trips were between one and five hours late. Such a situation would trigger this provision. On the other hand, only a few instances of trips one to five hours late, or many instances of trips a few minutes late, would not trigger this provision.</P>
            <P>The second example is substantial numbers of trip denials or missed trips. For example, if on a regular basis the reservation phone lines open at 5 a.m. and callers after 7 a.m. are all told that they cannot travel, or the phone lines shut down after 7 a.m. and a recorded message says to call back the next day, or the phone lines are always so busy that no one can get through, this provision would be triggered. (Practices of this kind would probably violate the response time criterion as well.) Also, if, on a regular basis, the entity misses a substantial number of trips (e.g., a trip is scheduled, the passenger is waiting, but the vehicle never comes, goes to the wrong address, is extremely late, etc.), it would violate this provision.</P>
            <P>The third example is substantial numbers of trips with excessive trip lengths. Since paratransit is a shared ride service, paratransit rides between Point A and Point B will usually take longer, and involve more intermediate stops, than a taxi ride between the same two points. However, when the number of intermediate stops and the total trip time for a given passenger grows so large as to make use of the system prohibitively inconvenient, then this provision would be triggered. For example, the IG report referred to above mentioned a situation in which 9 percent of riders had one way trips averaging between two and four hours, with an average of 16 intermediate stops. Such a situation would probably trigger this provision.</P>

            <P>Though these three examples probably cover the most frequently cited problems in paratransit operations that directly or indirectly limit the provision of service that is theoretically available to eligible persons, the list is not exhaustive. Other patterns or practices could trigger this provision. For example, the Department has heard about a situation in which an entity's paratransit contractor was paid on a per-trip basis, regardless of the length of the trip. The contractor therefore had an economic incentive <PRTPAGE P="479"/>to provide as many trips as possible. As a result, the contractor accepted short trips and routinely denied longer trips. This would be a pattern or practice contrary to this provision (and contrary to the service area provision as well).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Additional Service</HD>
            <P>This provision emphasizes that entities may go beyond the requirements of this section in providing service to ADA paratransit individuals. For example, no one is precluded from offering service in a larger service area, during greater hours than the fixed route system, or without charge. However, costs of such additional service do not count with respect to undue financial burden waiver requests. Where a service criterion itself incorporates a range of actions the entity may take (e.g., providing wide corridors outside the urban core, using real time scheduling), however, costs of providing that optional service may be counted for undue financial burden waiver request purposes.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.133 Subscription Service</HD>
            <P>As part of its paratransit service, an entity may include a subscription service component. However, at any given time of day, this component may not absorb more than 50 percent of available capacity on the total system. For example, if, at 8 a.m., the system can provide 400 trips, no more than 200 of these can be subscription trips.</P>
            <P>The one exception to this rule would occur in a situation in which there is excess non-subscription capacity available. For example, if over a long enough period of time to establish a pattern, there were only 150 non-subscription trips requested at 8 a.m., the provider could begin to provide 250 subscription trips at that time. Subsequently, if non-subscription demand increased over a period of time, such that the 50 trips were needed to satisfy a regular non-subscription demand at that time, and overall system capacity had not increased, the 50 trips would have to be returned to the non-subscription category. During times of high subscription demand, entities could use the trip time negotiation discretion of § 37.131(c)(2) to shift some trips to other times.</P>
            <P>Because subscription service is a limited subcomponent of paratransit service, the rule permits restrictions to be imposed on its use that could not be imposed elsewhere. There may be a waiting list for provision of subscription service or the use of other capacity constraints. Also, there may be restrictions or priorities based on trip purpose. For example, subscription service under peak work trip times could be limited to work trips. We emphasize that these limitations apply only to subscription service. It is acceptable for a provider to put a person on a waiting list for access to subscription service at 8 a.m. for work trips; the same person could not be wait-listed for access to paratransit service in general.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.135 Submission of Paratransit Plans</HD>
            <P>This section contains the general requirements concerning the submission of paratransit plans. Each public entity operating fixed route service is required to develop and submit a plan for paratransit service. Where you send your plans depends on the type of entity you are. There are two categories of entities which should submit their plans to states—(1) FTA recipients and (2) entities who are administered by the state on behalf of FTA.</P>
            <P>These FTA grantees submit their plans to the states because the agency would like the benefit of the states' expertise before final review. The states' role is as a commenter, not as a reviewer.</P>
            <P>This section also specifies annual progress reports concerning the meeting of previously approved milestones, any slippage (with the reasons for it and plans to catch up), and any significant changes in the operator's environment, such as the withdrawal from the marketplace of a private paratransit provider or whose service the entity has relied upon to provide part of its paratransit service.</P>
            <P>Paragraph (d) of this section specifies a maximum time period for the phase-in of the implementation of paratransit plans. The Department recognizes that it is not reasonable to expect paratransit systems to spring into existence fully formed, like Athena from the head of Zeus. Under this paragraph, all entities must be in full compliance with all paratransit provisions by January 26, 1997, unless the entity has received a waiver from FTA based on undue financial burden (which applies only to the service criteria of § 37.131, not to eligibility requirements or other paratransit provisions).</P>
            <P>While the rule assumes that most entities will take a year to fully implement these provisions, longer than a year requires the paratransit plans to submit milestones that are susceptible to objective verification. Not all plans will be approved with a five-year lead-in period. Consistent with the proposed rule, the Department intends to look at each plan individually to see what is required for implementation in each case. DOT may approve only a shorter phase-in period in a given case.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.137 Paratransit Plan Development</HD>
            <P>Section 35.137 establishes three principal requirements in the development of paratransit plans.</P>

            <P>First is the requirement to survey existing paratransit services within the service area. This is required by section 223(c)(8) of the ADA. While the ADA falls short of explicitly <PRTPAGE P="480"/>requiring coordination, clearly this is one of the goals. The purpose of the survey is to determine what is being provided already, so that a transit provider can accurately assess what additional service is needed to meet the service criteria for comparable paratransit service. The plan does not have to discuss private paratransit providers whose services will not be used to help meet paratransit requirements under this rule. However, the public entity will need to know specifically what services are being provided by whom if the entity is to count the transportation toward the overall need.</P>
            <P>Since the public entity is required to provide paratransit to all ADA paratransit eligible individuals, there is some concern that currently provided service may be cut back or eliminated. It is possible that this may happen and such action would have a negative effect on transportation provided to persons with disabilities in general. The Department urges each entity required to submit a plan to work with current providers of transportation, not only to determine what transportation services they provide, but also to continue to provide service into the foreseeable future.</P>
            <P>Second, § 37.137 specifies requirements for public participation. First, the entity must perform outreach, to ensure that a wide range of persons anticipated to use the paratransit service know about and have the opportunity to participate in the development of the plan. Not only must the entity identify who these individuals or groups are, the entity also must contact the people at an early stage in the development process.</P>
            <P>The other public participation requirements are straightforward. There must be a public hearing and an opportunity to comment. The hearing must be accessible to those with disabilities, and notice of the hearing must be accessible as well. There is a special efforts test identified in this paragraph for comments concerning a multi-year phase-in of a paratransit plan.</P>
            <P>The final general requirement of the section specifies that efforts at public participation must be made permanent through some mechanism that provides for participation in all phases of paratransit plan development and submission. The Department is not requiring that there be an advisory committee established, although this is one method of institutionalizing participation. The Department is not as interested in the specific structure used to ensure public participation as we are interested in the effectiveness of the effort.</P>
            <P>The Department believes that public participation is a key element in the effective implementation of the ADA. The ADA is an opportunity to develop programs that will ensure the integration of all persons into not just the transportation system of America, but all of the opportunities transportation makes possible. This opportunity is not without tremendous challenges to the transit providers. It is only through dialogue, over the long term, that usable, possible plans can be developed and implemented.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.139 Plan Contents</HD>
            <P>This section contains substantive categories of information to be contained in the paratransit plan: Information on current and changing fixed route service; inventory of existing paratransit service; discussion of the discrepancies between existing paratransit and what is required under this regulation; a discussion of the public participation requirements and how they have been met; the plan for paratransit service; the budget for paratransit services; efforts to coordinate with other transportation providers; a description of the process in place or to be used to register ADA paratransit eligible individuals; a description of the documentation provided to each individual verifying eligibility; and a request for a waiver based on undue financial burden, if applicable. The final rule contains a reorganized and slightly expanded section on plan contents, reflecting requests to be more explicit, rather than less explicit.</P>
            <P>The list of required elements is the same for all entities required to submit paratransit plans. There is no document length requirement, however. Each entity (or group plan) is unique and we expect the plans to reflect this. While we would like the plan elements presented in the order listed in this section, the contents most likely will vary greatly, depending on the size, geographic area, budget, complexity of issues, etc. of the particular submitting agency.</P>
            <P>This section and § 37.139 provide for a maximum phase-in period of five years, with an assumed one-year phase-in for all paratransit programs. (The required budget has been changed to five years as well.) The Department has established a maximum five-year phase-in in the belief that not all systems will require that long, but that some, particularly those which had chosen to meet compliance with section 504 requirements with accessible fixed route service, may indeed need five years.</P>

            <P>We are confident that, through the public participation process, entities can develop a realistic plan for full compliance with the ADA. To help ensure this, the paratransit plan contents section now requires that any plan which projects full compliance after January 26, 1993 must include milestones which can be measured and which result in steady progress toward full compliance. For example, it is possible that the first part of year one is used to ensure comprehensive registration of all eligible persons with disabilities, training of transit provider staffs and the development and dissemination of information to users and potential users in <PRTPAGE P="481"/>accessible formats and some modest increase in paratransit service is provided. A plan would not be permitted to indicate that no activity was possible in the first year, but proportionately more progress could be planned for later years than for the first year. Implementation must begin in January 1992.</P>
            <P>Each plan, including its proposed phase-in period, will be the subject of examination by FTA. Not all providers who request a five-year phase-in will receive approval for a five-year phase-in. The plan must be careful, therefore, to explain what current services are, what the projections are, and what methods are in place to determine and provide accountability for progress toward full compliance.</P>
            <P>We have been asked for assistance in assessing what the demand for paratransit service will be. FTA's ADA Paratransit Manual provides detailed assistance in this and many other areas of the plan development process.</P>
            <P>The ADA itself contained a figure of 43 million persons with disabilities. It should be pointed out that many of these may not necessarily be eligible for ADA paratransit service. The Department's regulatory impact analysis discussing the probable costs involved in implementing this rule places the possible percentage of population who would be eligible for paratransit service at between 1.4 and 1.9 percent. This figure can vary depending on the type and variety of services you have available, or on such things as climate, proximity to medical care, family, etc. that a person with a disability may need. Clearly estimating demand is one of the most critical elements in the plan, since it will be used to make decisions about all of the various service criteria.</P>
            <P>Section 37.139 contains a new paragraph (j), spelling out in more detail requirements related to the annual submission of plans. Since there is now the possibility for five-year phase-ins, the annual plan demonstrates the progress made to date, and explains any delays.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.141 Requirements If a Joint Plan is Submitted</HD>
            <P>The Department believes that, particularly in large, multi-provider regions, a coordinated regional paratransit plan and system are extremely important. Such coordination can do much to ensure that the most comprehensive transportation can be provided with the most efficient use of available resources. We recognize that the effort of putting together such a coordinated system can be a lengthy one. This section is intended to facilitate the process of forming such a coordinated system.</P>
            <P>If a number of entities wish to submit a joint plan for a coordinated system, they must, like other entities, submit a document by January 26, 1992. At a minimum, this document must include the following:</P>
            <P>(1) A general statement that the participating entities intend to file a joint coordinated plan;</P>
            <P>(2) A certification from each participating entity that it is committed to providing paratransit as a part of a coordinated plan;</P>
            <P>(3) A certification from each participating entity that it will maintain at least current levels of paratransit service until the coordinated paratransit service called for by the joint plan is implemented;</P>
            <P>(4) As many elements of the plan as possible.</P>
            <P>These provisions ensure that significant planning will precede, and plan implementation will begin by, January 26, 1992, without precluding entities from cooperating because it was not possible to complete coordinating different public entities by that date. The entities involved in a joint plan are required to submit all elements of their plan by July 26, 1992.</P>
            <P>The final provision in the section notes that an entity may later join a coordinated plan, even if it has filed its own plan on January 26, 1992. An entity must submit its own plan by January 26, 1992, if it has not provided a certification of participation in a joint plan.). In this case, the entity must provide the assurances and certifications required of all of the other participating entities.</P>
            <P>The Department fully expects that many jurisdictions filing joint plans will be able to do so by January 26, 1992. For those who cannot, the regulatory provision ensures that there will be no decrease in paratransit service. Further, since we anticipate coordinated service areas to provide more effective service, complete implementation of a joint plan could be more rapid than if each entity was providing service on its own.</P>
            <P>Entities submitting a joint plan do not have any longer than any other entities to fully implement complementary paratransit service. In any case, all plans (joint or single) must be fully implemented by January 26, 1997, absent a waiver for undue financial burden (which would, in the case of a joint plan, be considered on a joint basis).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.143 Paratransit Plan Implementation</HD>
            <P>As already discussed under § 37.135, the states will receive FTA recipient plans for recipients of funding under 49 U.S.C. 5311 administered by the State or any small urbanized area recipient of funds under 49 U.S.C. 5307 administered by a state. Public entities who do not receive FTA funds will submit their plans directly to the applicable Regional Office (listed in appendix B to the rule).</P>

            <P>The role of the state is to accept the plans on behalf of FTA, to ensure that all plans are <PRTPAGE P="482"/>submitted to it and forward the plans, with any comments on the plans, to FTA. This comment is very important for FTA to receive, since states administer these programs on behalf of FTA. Each state's specific knowledge of FTA grantees it administers will provide helpful information to FTA in making its decisions.</P>
            <P>The rule lists five questions the states must answer when they forward the plans. These questions are gauged to capitalize on the working knowledge the states possess on the grantees. FTA will send a more specific letter of instruction to each state explaining its role.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.147 FTA Review of Plans</HD>
            <P>This provision spells out factors FTA will consider in reviewing each plan, including whether the submission is complete, whether the plan complies with the substance of the ADA regulation, whether the entity complied with the public participation requirements in developing the plan, efforts by the entity to coordinate with other entities in a plan submission, and any comments submitted by the states.</P>
            <P>These elements are not the only items that will be reviewed by FTA. Every portion of the plan will be reviewed and assessed for compliance with the regulation. This section merely highlights those provisions thought most important by the Department.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.151 Waiver for Undue Financial Burden</HD>
            <P>The Department has adopted a five-year phase-in for paratransit service. Under this scheme, each entity required to provide paratransit service will be able to design a phase-in of its service specifically geared to local circumstances. While all jurisdictions will not receive approval for plans with a five year phase-in, each entity will be able to request what it needs based on local circumstances. Generally, the section allows an entity to request a wavier at any time it determines that it will not be able to meet a five-year phase-in or make measured progress toward its full compliance date specified in its original plan.</P>
            <P>A waiver for undue financial burden should be requested if one of the following circumstances applies. First, when the entity submits its first plan on January 26, 1992, if the entity knows it will not be able to reach full compliance within five years, or if the entity cannot make measured progress the first year it may submit a waiver request. The entity also should apply for a waiver, if, during plan implementation, there are changed circumstances which make it unlikely that compliance will be possible.</P>
            <P>The concept of measured progress should be given its plain meaning. It is not acceptable to submit a plan which shows significant progress in implementing a plan in years four and five, but no progress in years one and two. Similarly, the progress must be susceptible to objective verification. An entity cannot merely “work toward” developing a particular aspect of a plan.</P>
            <P>The Department intends that undue burden waiver requests will be given close scrutiny, and waiver will not be granted highly. In reviewing requests, however, as the legislative history indicates, FTA will look at the individual financial constraints within which each public entity operates its fixed route system. “Any determination of undue financial burden cannot have assumed the collection of additional revenues, such as those received through increases in local taxes or legislative appropriations, which would not have otherwise been made available to the fixed route operator.” (H. Rept. 101-485, Pt. 1, at 31)</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.153 FTA Waiver Determination</HD>
            <P>If the FTA Administrator grants a waiver for undue financial burden, the waiver will be for a specified period of time and the Administrator will determine what the entity must do to meet its responsibilities under the ADA. Each determination will involve a judgment of what is appropriate on a case-by-case basis. Since each waiver will be granted based on individual circumstances, the Department does not deem it appropriate to specify a generally applicable duration for a waiver.</P>
            <P>When a waiver is granted, the rule calls for entities to look first at limiting the number of trips provided to each individual as a means of providing service that does not create an undue burden. This capacity constraint, unlike manipulations of other service criteria, will not result in a degradation of the quality of service. An entity intending to submit an undue burden waiver request should take this approach into account in its planning process.</P>
            <P>It should be noted that requiring an entity to provide paratransit service at least during core hours along key routes is one option that the Administrator has available in making a decision about the service to be provided. This requirement stems from the statutory provision that the Administrator can require the entity to provide a minimum level of service, even if to do so would be an undue financial burden. Certainly part of a request for a waiver could be a locally endorsed alternative to this description of basic service. The rule states explicitly the Administrator's discretion to return the application for more information if necessary.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.155 Factors in Decision To Grant an Undue Financial Burden Waiver</HD>

            <P>Factors the Administrator will consider in making a decision whether to grant an <PRTPAGE P="483"/>undue financial burden waiver request include effects on current fixed route service, reductions in other services, increases in fares, resources available to implement complementary paratransit over the period of the plan, current level of accessible service (fixed route and paratransit), cooperation among transit providers, evidence of increased efficiencies that have been or could be used, any unique circumstances that may affect the entity's ability to provide paratransit service, the level of per capita service being provided, both to the population as a whole and what is being or anticipated to be provided to persons who are eligible and registered to receive ADA paratransit service.</P>
            <P>This final element allows some measure of comparability, regardless of the specific service criteria and should assist in a general assessment of level of effort.</P>
            <P>It is only the costs associated with providing paratransit service to ADA-paratransit eligible persons that can be counted in assessing whether or not there is an undue financial burden. Two cost factors are included in the considerations which enhance the Administrator's ability to assess real commitment to these paratransit provisions.</P>
            <P>First, the Department will allow a statistically valid methodology for estimating number of trips mandated by the ADA. While the regulation calls for a trip-by-trip determination of eligibility, this provision recognizes that this is not possible for some systems, particularly the large systems. Since only those trips provided to a person when he or she is ADA eligible may be counted in determining an undue financial burden, this provision is necessary.</P>
            <P>Second, in determining costs to be counted toward providing paratransit service, paragraph (b)(3) allows an entity to include in its paratransit budget dollars to which it is legally entitled, but which, as a matter of state or local funding arrangements, are provided to another entity that is actually providing the paratransit service.</P>
            <P>For example, a state government may provide a certain formula allocation of the revenue from a certain tax to each jurisdiction for use in providing transportation service at the local level. The funds, depending on local arrangements, may flow either to a transit authority—a regulated entity under this rule—or to a city or county government. If the funds go to the transit authority, they clearly may be counted in an undue burden calculation. In addition, however, this provision also allows funds that flow through the city or county government to be counted in the undue burden calculation, since they are basically the same funds and should not be treated differently based on the accident of previously-determined local arrangements. On the other hand, this provision does not allow funds of a private non-profit or other organization who uses Department of Health and Human Services grant or private contributions to be counted toward the entity's financial commitment to paratransit.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Subpart G—Provision of Service</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.161 Maintenance of Accessible Features—General</HD>
            <P>This section applies to all entities providing transportation services, public and private. It requires those entities to maintain in operative condition those features or facilities and equipment that make facilities and vehicles accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.</P>
            <P>The ADA requires that, to the maximum extent feasible, facilities be accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. This section recognizes that it is not sufficient to provide features such as lift-equipped vehicles, elevators, communications systems to provide information to people with vision or hearing impairments, etc. if these features are not maintained in a manner that enables individuals with disabilities to use them. Inoperative lifts or elevators, locked accessible doors, accessible paths of travel that are blocked by equipment or boxes of materials are not accessible to or usable by individuals with disabilities.</P>
            <P>The rule points out that temporary obstructions or isolated instances of mechanical failure would not be considered violations of the ADA or this rule. Repairs must be made “promptly.” The rule does not, and probably could not, state a time limit for making particular repairs, given the variety of circumstances involved. However, repairing accessible features must be made a high priority. Allowing obstructions or out of order accessibility equipment to persist beyond a reasonable period of time would violate this Part, as would mechanical failures due to improper or inadequate maintenance. Failure of the entity to ensure that accessible routes are free of obstruction and properly maintained, or failure to arrange prompt repair of inoperative elevators, lifts, or other accessibility-related equipment, would also violate this part.</P>

            <P>The rule also requires that accommodations be made to individuals with disabilities who would otherwise use an inoperative accessibility feature. For example, when a rail system discovers that an elevator is out of order, blocking access to one of its stations, it could accommodate users of the station by announcing the problem at other stations to alert passengers and offer accessible shuttle bus service around the temporarily inaccessible station. If a public address system were out of order, the entity could designate personnel to provide information to customers with visual impairments.<PRTPAGE P="484"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.163 Keeping Vehicle Lifts in Operative Condition—Public Entities</HD>
            <P>This section applies only to public entities. Of course, like vehicle acquisition requirements and other provisions applying to public entities, these requirements also apply when private entities “stand in the shoes” of public entities in contracting situations, as provided in § 37.23.</P>
            <P>This section's first requirement is that the entity establish a system of regular and frequent maintenance checks of lifts sufficient to determine if they are operative.</P>
            <P>Vehicle and equipment maintenance is an important component of successful accessible service. In particular, an aggressive preventive maintenance program for lifts is essential. Lifts remain rather delicate pieces of machinery, with many moving parts, which often must operate in a harsh environment of potholes, dust and gravel, variations in temperature, snow, slush, and deicing compounds. It is not surprising that they sometimes break down.</P>
            <P>The point of a preventive maintenance program is to prevent breakdowns, of course. But it is also important to catch broken lifts as soon as possible, so that they can be repaired promptly. Especially in a bus system with relatively low lift usage, it is possible that a vehicle could go for a number of days without carrying a passenger who uses the lift. It is highly undesirable for the next passenger who needs a lift to be the person who discovers that the lift is broken, when a maintenance check by the operator could have discovered the problem days earlier, resulting in its repair.</P>
            <P>Therefore, the entity must have a system for regular and frequent checks, sufficient to determine if lifts are actually operative. This is not a requirement for the lift daily. (Indeed, it is not, as such, a requirement for lift cycling at all. If there is another means available of checking the lift, it may be used.) If alternate day checks, for example, are sufficient to determine that lifts are actually working, then they are permitted. If a lift is used in service on a given day, that may be sufficient to determine that the lift is operative with respect to the next day. It would be a violation of this part, however, for the entity to neglect to check lifts regularly and frequently, or to exhibit a pattern of lift breakdowns in service resulting in stranded passengers when the lifts had not been checked before the vehicle failed to provide required accessibility to passengers that day.</P>
            <P>When a lift breaks down in service, the driver must let the entity know about the problem by the most immediate means available. If the vehicle is equipped with a radio or telephone, the driver must call in the problem on the spot. If not, then the driver would have to make a phone call at the first opportunity (e.g., from a phone booth during the turnaround time at the end of the run). It is not sufficient to wait until the end of the day and report the problem when the vehicle returns to the barn.</P>
            <P>When a lift is discovered to be inoperative, either because of an in-service failure or as the result of a maintenance check, the entity must take the vehicle out of service before the beginning of its next service day (with the exception discussed below) and repair the lift before the vehicle is put back into service. In the case of an in-service failure, this means that the vehicle can continue its runs on that day, but cannot start a new service day before the lift is repaired. If a maintenance check in the evening after completion of a day's run or in the morning before a day's runs discloses the problem, then the bus would not go into service until the repair had taken place.</P>
            <P>The Department realizes that, in the years before bus fleets are completely accessible, taking buses with lifts out of service for repairs in this way would probably result in an inaccessible spare bus being used on the route, but at least attention would have to be paid quickly to the lift repair, resulting in a quicker return to service of a working accessible bus.</P>
            <P>The rule provides an exception for those situations in which there is no spare vehicle (either accessible or inaccessible) available to take the place of the vehicle with an operative lift, such that putting the latter vehicle into the shop would result in a reduction of service to the public (e.g., a scheduled run on a route could not be made). The Department would emphasize that the exception does not apply when there is any spare vehicle available.</P>
            <P>Where the exception does apply, the provider may keep the vehicle with the inoperative lift in service for a maximum of three days (for providers operating in an area of over 50,000 population) or five days (for providers operating in an area of 50,000 population or less). After these times have elapsed, the vehicle must go into the shop, not to return until the lift is repaired. Even during the three- or five-day period, if an accessible spare bus becomes available at any time, it must be used in place of the bus with the inoperative lift or an inaccessible spare that is being used in its place.</P>

            <P>In a fixed route system, if a bus is operating without a working lift (either on the day when the lift fails in service or as the result of the exception discussed above) and headways between accessible buses on the route on which the vehicle is operating exceed 30 minutes, the entity must accommodate passengers who would otherwise be inconvenienced by the lack of an accessible bus. This accommodation would be by a paratransit or other special vehicle that would pick up passengers with disabilities <PRTPAGE P="485"/>who cannot use the regular bus because its lift is inoperative. Passengers who need lifts in this situation would, in effect, be ADA paratransit eligible under the second eligibility category. However, since they would have no way of knowing that the bus they sought to catch would not be accessible that day, the transit authority must actively provide alternative service to them. This could be done, for example, by having a “shadow” accessible service available along the route or having the bus driver call in the minute he saw an accessible passenger he could not pick up (including the original passenger stranded by an in-service lift failure), with a short (i.e., less than 30-minute) response from an accessible vehicle dispatched to pick up the stranded passenger. To minimize problems in providing such service, when a transit authority is using the “no spare vehicles” exception, the entity could place the vehicle with the inoperative lift on a route with headways between accessible buses shorter than 30 minutes.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.165 Lift and Securement Use</HD>
            <P>This provision applies to both public and private entities.</P>
            <P>All people using wheelchairs, as defined in the rule, and other powered mobility devices, under the circumstances provided in the rule, are to be allowed to ride the entity's vehicles.</P>
            <P>Entities may require wheelchair users to ride in designated securement locations. That is, the entity is not required to carry wheelchair users whose wheelchairs would have to park in an aisle or other location where they could obstruct other persons' passage or where they could not be secured or restrained. An entity's vehicle is not required to pick up a wheelchair user when the securement locations are full, just as the vehicle may pass by other passengers waiting at the stop if the bus is full.</P>

            <P>The entity may require that wheelchair users make use of securement systems for their mobility devices. The entity, in other words, can require wheelchair users to “buckle up” their mobility devices. The entity is required, on a vehicle meeting part 38 standards, to use the securement system to secure wheelchairs as provided in that part. On other vehicles (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> existing vehicles with securement systems which do not comply with part 38 standards), the entity must provide and use a securement system to ensure that the mobility device remains within the securement area. This latter requirement is a mandate to use best efforts to restrain or confine the wheelchair to the securement area. The entity does the best it can, given its securement technology and the nature of the wheelchair. The Department encourages entities with relatively less adequate securement systems on their vehicles, where feasible, to retrofit the vehicles with better securement systems, that can successfully restrain a wide variety of wheelchairs. It is our understanding that the cost of doing so is not enormous.</P>
            <P>An entity may not, in any case, deny transportation to a wheelchair and its user because the wheelchair cannot be secured or restrained by a vehicle's securement system, to the entity's satisfaction. The same point applies to an OPMD and its user, subject to legitimate safety requirements.</P>
            <P>Entities have often recommended or required that a wheelchair user transfer out of his or her own device into a vehicle seat. Under this rule, it is no longer permissible to require such a transfer. The entity may provide information on risks and make a recommendation with respect to transfer, but the final decision on whether to transfer is up to the passenger.</P>

            <P>The entity's personnel have an obligation to ensure that a passenger with a disability is able to take advantage of the accessibility and safety features on vehicles. Consequently, the driver or other personnel must provide assistance with the use of lifts, ramps, and securement devices. For example, the driver must deploy the lift properly and safely. If the passenger cannot do so independently, the driver must assist the passenger with using the securement device. On a vehicle which uses a ramp for entry, the driver may have to assist in pushing a manual wheelchair up the ramp (particularly where the ramp slope is relatively steep). All these actions may involve a driver leaving his seat. Even in entities whose drivers traditionally do not leave their seats (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> because of labor-management agreements or company rules), this assistance must be provided. This rule overrides any requirements to the contrary.</P>

            <P>Wheelchair users, especially those using electric wheelchairs, often have a preference for entering a lift platform and vehicle in a particular direction (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> backing on or going on frontwards). Except where the only way of successfully maneuvering a device onto a vehicle or into its securement area or an overriding safety concern (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a direct threat) requires one way of doing this or another, the transit provider should respect the passenger's preference. We note that most electric wheelchairs are usually not equipped with rearview mirrors, and that many persons who use them are not able to rotate their heads sufficiently to see behind. People using canes or walkers and other standees with disabilities who do not use wheelchairs but have difficulty using steps (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> an elderly person who can walk on a level surface without use of a mobility aid but cannot raise his or her legs sufficiently to climb bus steps) must also be permitted to use the lift, on request.</P>

            <P>A lift conforming to Access Board requirements has a platform measuring at least 30″ <PRTPAGE P="486"/>× 48″, with a design load of at least 600 pounds (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> capable of lifting a wheelchair/occupant combination of up to 600 pounds). Working parts upon which the lift depends for support of the load, such as cables, pulleys, and shafts, must have a safety factor of at least six times the design load; nonworking parts such as the platform, frame, and attachment hardware, which would not be expected to wear, must have a safety factor of at least three times the design load.</P>
            <P>If a transportation provider has a vehicle and equipment that meets or exceeds standards based on Access Board guidelines, and the vehicle and equipment can in fact safely accommodate a given wheelchair, then it is not appropriate, under disability nondiscrimination law, for the transportation provider to refuse to transport the device and its user. Transportation providers must carry a wheelchair and its user, as long as the lift can accommodate the size and weight of the wheelchair and its user and there is space for the wheelchair on the vehicle. However, if in fact a lift or vehicle is unable to accommodate the wheelchair and its user, the transportation provider is not required to carry it.</P>

            <P>For example, suppose that a bus or paratransit vehicle lift will safely accommodate an 800-pound wheelchair/passenger combination, but not a combination exceeding 800 pounds (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a design load of 800 lbs.). The lift is one that exceeds the part 38 design standard, which requires lifts to be able to accommodate a 600-pound wheelchair/passenger combination. The transportation provider could limit use of that lift to a combination of 800 pounds or less. Likewise, if a wheelchair or its attachments extends beyond the 30 × 48 inch footprint found in part 38's design standards but fits onto the lift and into the wheelchair securement area of the vehicle, the transportation provider would have to accommodate the wheelchair. However, if such a wheelchair was of a size that would block an aisle and interfere with the safe evacuation of passengers in an emergency, the operator could deny carriage of that wheelchair based on a legitimate safety requirement.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.167 Other Service Requirements</HD>
            <P>The requirements in this section apply to both public and private entities.</P>
            <P>On fixed route systems, the entity must announce stops. These stops include transfer points with other fixed routes. This means that any time a vehicle is to stop where a passenger can get off and transfer to another bus or rail line (or to another form of transportation, such as commuter rail or ferry), the stop would be announced. The announcement can be made personally by the vehicle operator or can be made by a recording system. If the vehicle is small enough so that the operator can make himself or herself heard without a P.A. system, it is not necessary to use the system.</P>
            <P>Announcements also must be made at major intersections or destination points. The rule does not define what major intersections or destination points are. This is a judgmental matter best left to the local planning process. In addition, the entity must make announcements at sufficient intervals along a route to orient a visually impaired passenger to his or her location. The other required announcements may serve this function in many instances, but if there is a long distance between other announcements, fill-in orientation announcements would be called for. The entity must announce any stop requested by a passenger with a disability, even if it does not meet any of the other criteria for announcement.</P>
            <P>When vehicles from more than one route serve a given stop or station, the entity must provide a means to assist an individual with a visual impairment or other disability in determining which is the proper vehicle to enter. Some entities have used external speakers. FTA is undertaking a study to determine what is the best available technology in this area. Some transit properties have used colored mitts, or numbered cards, to allow passengers to inform drivers of what route they wanted to use. The idea is to prevent, at a stop where vehicles from a number of routes arrive, a person with a visual impairment from having to ask every driver whether the bus is the right one. The rule does not prescribe what means is to be used, only that some effective means be provided.</P>
            <P>Service animals shall always be permitted to accompany their users in any private or public transportation vehicle or facility. One of the most common misunderstandings about service animals is that they are limited to being guide dogs for persons with visual impairments. Dogs are trained to assist people with a wide variety of disabilities, including individuals with hearing and mobility impairments. Other animals (e.g., monkeys) are sometimes used as service animals as well. In any of these situations, the entity must permit the service animal to accompany its user.</P>
            <P>Part 38 requires a variety of accessibility equipment. This section requires that the entity use the equipment it has. For example, it would be contrary to this provision for a transit authority to bolt its bus lifts shut because transit authority had difficulty maintaining the lifts. It does little good to have a public address system on a vehicle if the operator does not use it to make announcements (except, as noted above, in the situation where the driver can make himself or herself heard without recourse to amplification.)</P>

            <P>Entities must make communications and information available, using accessible formats and technology (e.g., Braille, large <PRTPAGE P="487"/>print, TDDs) to obtain information about transportation services. Someone cannot adequately use the bus system if schedule and route information is not available in a form he or she can use. If there is only one phone line on which ADA paratransit eligible individuals can reserve trips, and the line is chronically busy, individuals cannot schedule service. Such obstacles to the use of transportation service are contrary to this section. (The latter could, in some circumstances, be viewed as a capacity constraint.)</P>
            <P>It is inconsistent with this section for a transit provider to refuse to let a passenger use a lift at any designated stop, unless the lift is physically unable to deploy or the lift would be damaged if it did deploy (see discussion under § 37.123). In addition, if a temporary situation at the stop (e.g., construction, an accident, a landslide) made the stop unsafe for anyone to use, the provider could decline to operate the lift there (just as it refused to open the door for other passengers at the same point). The provider could not, however, declare a stop “off limits” to persons with disabilities that is used for other persons. If the transit authority has concerns about barriers or safety hazards that peculiarly affect individuals with disabilities that would use the stop, it should consider making efforts to move the stop.</P>
            <P>Under DOT hazardous materials rules, a passenger may bring a portable medical oxygen supply on board a vehicle. Since the hazardous materials rules permit this, transit providers cannot prohibit it. For further information on hazardous materials rules, as they may affect transportation of assistive devices, entities may contact the Department's Research and Special Programs Administration, Office of Hazardous Materials Transportation (202-366-0656).</P>
            <P>One concern that has been expressed is that transportation systems (particularly some rail systems) may make it difficult for persons with disabilities to board or disembark from vehicles by very rapidly closing doors on the vehicles before individuals with disabilities (who may move more slowly through crowds in the vehicle or platform than other persons) have a chance to get on or off the vehicle. Doing so is contrary to the rule; operators must make appropriate provision to give individuals with disabilities adequate time to board or disembark.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.169 Interim Requirements for Over-the-Road Bus Service Operated by Private Entities</HD>
            <P>Private over-the-road bus (OTRB) service is, first of all, subject to all the other private entity requirements of the rule. The requirements of this section are in addition to the other applicable provisions.</P>
            <P>Boarding assistance is required. The Department cannot require any particular boarding assistance devices at this time. Each operator may decide what mode of boarding assistance is appropriate for its operation. We agree with the discussion in the DOJ Title II rule's preamble that carrying is a disfavored method of providing assistance to an individual with a disability. However, since accessible private OTRBs cannot be required by this rule, there may be times when carrying is the only available means of providing access to an OTRB, if the entity does not exercise its discretion to provide an alternative means. It is required by the rule that any employee who provides boarding assistance—above all, who may carry or otherwise directly physically assist a passenger—must be trained to provide this assistance appropriately and safely.</P>
            <P>The baggage priority provision for wheelchairs and other assistive devices involves a similar procedure to that established in the Department's Air Carrier Access Act rule (14 CFR part 382). In brief, it provides that, at any given stop, a person with a wheelchair or other assistive device would have the device loaded before other items at this stop. An individual traveling with a wheelchair is not similarly situated to a person traveling with luggage. For the wheelchair user, the wheelchair is an essential mobility device, without which travel is impossible. The rationale of this provision is that, while no one wants his or her items left behind, carrying the wheelchair is more important to its user than ordinary luggage to a traveler. If it comes to an either/or choice (the wheelchair user's luggage would not have any priority over other luggage, however). There would be no requirement, under this provision, for “bumping” baggage already on the bus from previous stops in order to make room for the wheelchair.</P>

            <P>The entity could require advance notice from a passenger in only one circumstance. If a passenger needed boarding assistance, the entity could require up to 48 hours' advance notice for the purpose of providing needed assistance. While advance notice requirements are generally undesirable, this appears to be a case in which a needed accommodation may be able to be provided successfully only if the transportation provider knows in advance that some extra staffing is needed to accomplish it. While the primary need for advance notice appears to be in the situation of an unstaffed station, there could be other situations in which advance notice was needed in order to ensure that the accommodation could be made. Entities should not ask for advance notice in all cases, but just in those cases in which it is really needed for this purpose. Even if advance notice is not provided, the entity has the obligation to provide boarding assistance if it can be provided with available staff.<PRTPAGE P="488"/>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.171 Equivalency Requirement for Demand Responsive Service Operated by Private Entities Not Primarily in the Business of Transporting People</HD>
            <P>This provision is a service requirement closely related to the private entity requirements for §§ 37.101-37.105 of this part. Entities in this category are always required to provide equivalent service, regardless of what they are doing with respect to the acquisition of vehicles. The effect of this provision may be to require some entities to arrange, either through acquiring their own accessible vehicles or coordinating with other providers, to have accessible vehicles available to meet the equivalency standards of § 37.105 or otherwise to comply with those standards.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 37.173 Training</HD>

            <P>A well-trained workforce is essential in ensuring that the accessibility-related equipment and accommodations required by the ADA actually result in the delivery of good transportation service to individuals with disabilities. The utility of training was recognized by Congress as well. (<E T="03">See</E> S. Rept. 100-116 at 48.) At the same time, we believe that training should be conducted in an efficient and effective manner, with appropriate flexibility allowed to the organizations that must carry it out. Each transportation provider is to design a training program which suits the needs of its particular operation. While we are confident of this approach, we are mindful that the apparent lack of training has been a source of complaint to FTA and transit providers. Good training is difficult and it is essential.</P>
            <P>Several points of this section deserve emphasis. First, the requirements for training apply to private as well as to public providers, of demand responsive as well as of fixed route service. Training is just as necessary for the driver of a taxicab, a hotel shuttle, or a tour bus as it is for a driver in an FTA-funded city bus system.</P>
            <P>Second, training must be to proficiency. The Department is not requiring a specific course of training or the submission of a training plan for DOT approval. However, every employee of a transportation provider who is involved with service to persons with disabilities must have been trained so that he or she knows what needs to be done to provide the service in the right way. When it comes to providing service to individuals with disabilities, ignorance is no excuse for failure.</P>
            <P>While there is no specific requirement for recurrent or refresher training, there is an obligation to ensure that, at any given time, employees are trained to proficiency. An employee who has forgotten what he was told in past training sessions, so that he or she does not know what needs to be done to serve individuals with disabilities, does not meet the standard of being trained to proficiency.</P>
            <P>Third, training must be appropriate to the duties of each employee. A paratransit dispatcher probably must know how to use a TDD and enough about various disabilities to know what sort of vehicle to dispatch. A bus driver must know how to operate lifts and securement devices properly. A mechanic who works on lifts must know how to maintain them. Cross-training, while useful in some instances, is not required, so long as each employee is trained to proficiency in what he or she does with respect to service to individuals with disabilities.</P>
            <P>Fourth, the training requirement goes both to technical tasks and human relations. Employees obviously need to know how to run equipment the right way. If an employee will be assisting wheelchair users in transferring from a wheelchair to a vehicle seat, the employee needs training in how to do this safely. But every public contact employee also has to understand the necessity of treating individuals with disabilities courteously and respectfully, and the details of what that involves.</P>
            <P>One of the best sources of information on how best to train personnel to interact appropriately with individuals with disabilities is the disability community itself. Consequently, the Department urges entities to consult with disability organizations concerning how to train their personnel. Involving these groups in the process of establishing training programs, in addition to providing useful information, should help to establish or improve working relationships among transit providers and disability groups that, necessarily, will be of long duration. We note that several transit providers use persons with disabilities to provide the actual training. Others have reported that role playing is an effective method to instill an appreciation of the particular perspective of one traveling with a disability.</P>

            <P>Finally, one of the important points in training concerns differences among individuals with disabilities. All individuals with disabilities, of course, are not alike. The appropriate ways one deals with persons with various kinds of disabilities (e.g., mobility, vision, hearing, or mental impairments) are likely to differ and, while no one expects bus drivers to be trained as disability specialists, recognizing relevant differences and responding to them appropriately is extremely significant. Public entities who contract with private entities to have service provided—above all, complementary paratransit—are responsible for ensuring that contractor personnel receive the appropriate training.<PRTPAGE P="489"/>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Appendix A to Part 37—Standards for Accessible Transportation Facilities</HD>
            <P>Sections 504(a) and (b) of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) require the Access Board to adopt accessibility guidelines; sections 204(c) and 306(c) of the ADA require the Department of Transportation to adopt regulatory standards “consistent with the minimum guidelines and requirements” issued by the Access Board. In the original 1991 publication of part 37, the Department complied with this requirement by reproducing the Access Board's Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) in their entirety as Appendix A.</P>
            <P>The Access Board revised ADAAG in July 2004. ADAAG, including technical amendments issued in July 2005, is codified in Appendices B and D to 36 CFR part 1191. In order to avoid duplication of material that the Access Board has already included in the CFR, and which is now readily available on the Internet, the Department has adopted ADAAG by cross-reference in part 37, rather than reproducing the lengthy Access Board publication. However, there are certain provisions of ADAAG that the Department is modifying for clarity or to preserve requirements that have been in effect under the existing standards. Under the ADA, the Department, in adopting standards, has the discretion to depart from the language of ADAAG as long as the Department's standards remain consistent with the Access Board's minimum guidelines. In addition, this appendix provides additional guidance concerning some sections of the DOT standards as they apply to transportation facilities.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 201.1</HD>
            <P>The basic scoping requirement requires all areas of newly designed and newly constructed buildings and facilities to be accessible. Former § 4.1.1(5) provided a “structural impracticability” exception to the requirements for new buildings and facilities. The Access Board deleted this exception to avoid duplication with an existing requirement to the same effect in Department of Justice regulations (see 28 CFR § 36.401(c)). For consistency with the approach taken by the Access Board and Department of Justice, and to ensure consistency between facilities subject to Titles II and III of the ADA under part 37, the Department has added the language of the Department of Justice regulation to § 37.41 of this part.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 206.3</HD>
            <P>This section concerns the location of accessible paths. The Department is retaining language from former § 10.3.1(1), which provides that “Elements such as ramps, elevators, or other circulation devices, fare vending or other ticketing areas, and fare collection areas shall be placed to minimize the distance which wheelchair users and other persons who cannot negotiate steps may have to travel compared to the general public.” This concept, in our view, is implicit in the language of § 206.3. However, we believe it is useful to make explicit the concept that, in transportation facilities such as rail stations, important facility elements are placed so as to minimize the distance persons with disabilities must travel to use them. This requirement is intended to affect decisions about where to locate entrances, boarding locations (e.g., where a mini-high platform is used for boarding), and other key elements of a facility.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 406.8</HD>
            <P>To maintain the <E T="03">status quo</E> with respect to detectable warnings in pedestrian facilities, the Department is adding a provision (not found in the current version of the new ADAAG) requiring curb ramps to have detectable warnings.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 810.2.2</HD>
            <P>The Department recognizes that there will be some situations in which the full dimensions of a bus boarding and alighting area complying with the § 810.2.2 may not be able to be achieved (e.g., there is less than 96 inches of perpendicular space available from the curb or roadway edge, because of buildings or terrain features). The Department is adding language from former § 37.9 (c) of this part, which provides that “Public entities shall ensure the construction of bus boarding and alighting areas comply with 810.2.2, to the extent the construction specifications are within their control.” Where it is not feasible to fully comply with § 810.2.2, the Department expects compliance to the greatest extent feasible.</P>
            <P>We note that there may be some instances in which it will be necessary to make operational adjustments where sufficient clearance is not available to permit the deployment of lifts or ramps on vehicles. For example, a bus driver could position the bus at a nearby point—even if not the precise location of the designated stop—so that a passenger needing a lift or ramp to get on or off the bus can do so. To avoid the need for such operational adjustments, it is important to place bus shelters, signs, etc. so that they do not intrude into the required clearances.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 810.5.3</HD>

            <P>This section concerns coordination between rail platforms and rail vehicles. The Department is adding language from the former § 10.3.1 (9) (Exception 2), which provides that “In light rail, commuter rail, and intercity rail systems where it is not operationally or structurally feasible to meet the horizontal gap or vertical difference requirements, mini-high platforms, car-borne or <PRTPAGE P="490"/>platform-mounted lifts, ramps or bridge plates or similarly manually deployed devices, meeting the requirements of 49 CFR Part 38 shall be permitted.”</P>
            <P>In September 2005, the Department issued guidance concerning the relationship of its ADA and 504 rules in the context of rail platform accessibility This guidance emphasized that access to all cars of a train is significant because, if passengers with disabilities are unable to enter all cars from the platform, the passengers will have access only to segregated service. This would be inconsistent with the nondiscrimination mandate of the ADA. It would also, in the case of Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)-assisted projects (including Amtrak), be inconsistent with the requirement of the Department's section 504 regulation (49 CFR § 27.7), which requires service in the most integrated setting reasonably achievable. This guidance states the Department's views of the meaning of its existing rules, and the Department will continue to use this guidance in applying the provisions of this rule.</P>

            <P>The Department notes that a related section of 49 CFR part 38 has been the source of some misunderstanding. Section 38.71(b)(2) provides that “Vehicles designed for, and operated on, pedestrian malls, city streets, or other areas where level-entry boarding is not practicable shall provide wayside or car-borne lifts, mini-high platforms, or other means of access in compliance with § 38.83 (b) or (c) of this part.” The Department has received some suggestions that this provision should be interpreted to mean that, if there is any portion of a system in which level-entry boarding is not practicable, then the <E T="03">entire</E> system can use some method other than level-entry boarding. Such an interpretation is incorrect. The authority to use alternatives to level-entry boarding pertains only to those portions of a system in which rail vehicles are “operated on” an area where level-entry boarding is not practicable.</P>
            <P>For example, suppose a light rail system's first three stops are on a pedestrian/transit mall where it is infeasible to provide level-entry boarding. The transit system could use car-borne lifts, mini-high platforms, etc. to provide access at those three stops. The system's next ten stops are part of a right-of-way in which level-entry boarding is practicable. In such a case, level-entry boarding would have to be provided at those ten stops. There is nothing inappropriate about the same system having different means of boarding in different locations, in such a case.</P>
            <P>We also caution against a potential misunderstanding of the sentence in § 810.5.3 that provides that “Low-level platforms shall be 8 inches minimum (205 mm) above top of rail.” This does not mean that high-level platforms are prohibited or that low-level platforms are the only design consistent with the rules. It simply means that where low-level platforms are otherwise permitted, such platforms must be at least 8 inches above the top of rail, except where vehicles are boarded from the street or a sidewalk.</P>

          <APPENDIX>
            <EAR>Pt. 37, App. E</EAR>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix E to Part 37—Reasonable Modification Requests</HD>
            <P>A. This appendix explains the Department's interpretation of §§ 37.5(i) and 37.169. It is intended to be used as the official position of the Department concerning the meaning and implementation of these provisions. The Department also issues guidance by other means, as provided in § 37.15. The Department also may update this appendix periodically, provided in response to inquiries about specific situations that are of general relevance or interest.</P>

            <P>B. The Department's ADA regulations contain numerous requirements concerning fixed route, complementary paratransit, and other types of transportation service. Transportation entities necessarily formulate policies and practices to meet these requirements (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> providing fixed route bus service that people with disabilities can use to move among stops on the system, providing complementary paratransit service that gets eligible riders from their point of origin to their point of destination). There may be certain situations, however, in which the otherwise reasonable policies and practices of entities do not suffice to achieve the regulation's objectives. Implementing a fixed route bus policy in the normal way may not allow a passenger with a disability to access and use the system at a particular location. Implementing a paratransit policy in the usual way may not allow a rider to get from his or her origin to his or her destination. In these situations, subject to the limitations discussed below, the transportation provider must make reasonable modifications of its service in order to comply with the underlying requirements of the rule. These underlying provisions tell entities the end they must achieve; the reasonable modification provision tells entities how to achieve that end in situations in which normal policies and practices do not succeed in doing so.</P>

            <P>C. As noted above, the responsibility of entities to make requested reasonable modifications is not without some limitations. There are four classes of situations in which a request may legitimately be denied. The first is where granting the request would fundamentally alter the entity's services, <PRTPAGE P="491"/>programs, or activities. The second is where granting the request would create a direct threat to the health or safety of others. The third is where without the requested modification, the individual with a disability is able to fully use the entity's services, programs, or activities for their intended purpose. The fourth, which applies only to recipients of Federal financial assistance, is where granting the request would cause an undue financial and administrative burden. In the examples that follow, these limitations are taken into account.</P>
            <P>D. The examples included in this appendix are neither exhaustive nor exclusive. Transportation entities may need to make determinations about requests for reasonable modification that are not described in this appendix. Importantly, reasonable modification applies to an entities' own policies and practices, and not regulatory requirements contained in 49 CFR parts 27, 37, 38, and 39, such as complementary paratransit service going beyond <FR>3/4</FR> mile of the fixed route, providing same day complementary paratransit service, etc.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Examples</HD>
            <P>
              <E T="03">1. Snow and Ice.</E> Except in extreme conditions that rise to the level of a direct threat to the driver or others, a passenger's request for a paratransit driver to walk over a pathway that has not been fully cleared of snow and ice should be granted so that the driver can help the passenger with a disability navigate the pathway. For example, ambulatory blind passengers often have difficulty in icy conditions, and allowing the passenger to take the driver's arm will increase both the speed and safety of the passenger's walk from the door to the vehicle. Likewise, if snow or icy conditions at a bus stop make it difficult or impossible for a fixed route passenger with a disability to get to a lift, or for the lift to deploy, the driver should move the bus to a cleared area for boarding, if such is available within reasonable proximity to the stop (see Example 4 below).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">2. Pick Up and Drop Off Locations with Multiple Entrances.</E> A paratransit rider's request to be picked up at home, but not at the front door of his or her home, should be granted, as long as the requested pick-up location does not pose a direct threat. Similarly, in the case of frequently visited public places with multiple entrances (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> shopping malls, employment centers, schools, hospitals, airports), the paratransit operator should pick up and drop off the passenger at the entrance requested by the passenger, rather than meet them in a location that has been predetermined by the transportation agency, again assuming that doing so does not involve a direct threat.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">3. Private Property.</E> Paratransit passengers may sometimes seek to be picked up on private property (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> in a gated community or parking lot, mobile home community, business or government facility where vehicle access requires authorized passage through a security barrier). Even if the paratransit operator does not generally have a policy of picking up passengers on such private property, the paratransit operator should make every reasonable effort to gain access to such an area (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> work with the passenger to get the permission of the property owner to permit access for the paratransit vehicle). The paratransit operator is not required to violate the law or lawful access restrictions to meet the passenger's requests. A public or private entity that unreasonably denies access to a paratransit vehicle may be subject to a complaint to the U.S. Department of Justice or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for discriminating against services for persons with disabilities.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">4. Obstructions.</E> For fixed route services, a passenger's request for a driver to position the vehicle to avoid obstructions to the passenger's ability to enter or leave the vehicle at a designated stop location, such as parked cars, snow banks, and construction, should be granted so long as positioning the vehicle to avoid the obstruction does not pose a direct threat. To be granted, such a request should result in the vehicle stopping in reasonably close proximity to the designated stop location. Transportation entities are not required to pick up passengers with disabilities at nondesignated locations. Fixed route operators would not have to establish flag stop or route-deviation policies, as these would be fundamental alterations to a fixed route system rather than reasonable modifications of a system. Likewise, subject to the limitations discussed in the introduction to this appendix, paratransit operators should be flexible in establishing pick up and drop off points to avoid obstructions.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">5. Fare Handling.</E> A passenger's request for transit personnel (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the driver, station attendant) to handle the fare media when the passenger with a disability cannot pay the fare by the generally established means should be granted on fixed route or paratransit service (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> in a situation where a bus passenger cannot reach or insert a fare into the farebox). Transit personnel are not required to reach into pockets or backpacks in order to extract the fare media.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">6. Eating and Drinking.</E> If a passenger with diabetes or another medical condition requests to eat or drink aboard a vehicle or in a transit facility in order to avoid adverse health consequences, the request should be granted, even if the transportation provider has a policy that prohibits eating or drinking. For example, a person with diabetes may need to consume a small amount of orange juice in a closed container or a candy bar in order to maintain blood sugar levels.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">7. Medicine.</E> A passenger's request to take medication while aboard a fixed route or <PRTPAGE P="492"/>paratransit vehicle or in a transit facility should be granted. For example, transit agencies should modify their policies to allow individuals to administer insulin injections and conduct finger stick blood glucose testing. Transit staff need not provide medical assistance, however, as this would be a fundamental alteration of their function.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">8. Boarding Separately From Wheelchair.</E> A wheelchair user's request to board a fixed route or paratransit vehicle separately from his or her device when the occupied weight of the device exceeds the design load of the vehicle lift should generally be granted. (Note, however, that under § 37.165(b), entities are required to accommodate device/user loads and dimensions that exceed the former “common wheelchair” standard, as long as the vehicle and lift will accommodate them.)</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">9. Dedicated vehicles or special equipment in a vehicle.</E> A paratransit passenger's request for special equipment (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the installation of specific hand rails or a front seat in a vehicle for the passenger to avoid nausea or back pain) can be denied so long as the requested equipment is not required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Department's rules. Likewise, a request for a dedicated vehicle (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> to avoid residual chemical odors) or a specific type or appearance of vehicle (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a sedan rather than a van, in order to provide more comfortable service) can be denied. In all of these cases, the Department views meeting the request as involving a fundamental alteration of the provider's service.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">10. Exclusive or Reduced Capacity Paratransit Trips.</E> A passenger's request for an exclusive paratransit trip may be denied as a fundamental alteration of the entity's services. Paratransit is by nature a shared-ride service.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">11. Outside of the Service Area or Operating Hours.</E> A person's request for fixed route or paratransit service may be denied when honoring the request would require the transportation provider to travel outside of its service area or to operate outside of its operating hours. This request would not be a reasonable modification because it would constitute a fundamental alteration of the entity's service.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">12. Personal Care Attendant (PCA).</E> While PCAs may travel with a passenger with a disability, transportation agencies are not required to <E T="03">provide</E> a personal care attendant or personal care attendant services to meet the needs of passengers with disabilities on paratransit or fixed route trips. For example, a passenger's request for a transportation entity's driver to remain with the passenger who, due to his or her disability, cannot be left alone without an attendant upon reaching his or her destination may be denied. It would be a fundamental alteration of the driver's function to provide PCA services of this kind.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">13. Intermediate Stops.</E> The Department views granting a paratransit passenger's request for a driver to make an intermediate stop, where the driver would be required to wait, as optional. For example, a passenger with a disability arranges to be picked up at a medical facility and dropped off at home. On the way, the passenger with a disability wishes to stop by a pharmacy and requests that the driver park outside of the pharmacy, wait for the passenger to return, and then continue the ride home. While this can be a very useful service to the rider, and in some cases can save the provider's time and money (by scheduling and providing a separate trip to and from the drug store), such a stop in the context of a shared ride system is not required. Since paratransit is, by its nature, a shared ride system, requests that could disrupt schedules and inconvenience other passengers could rise to the level of a fundamental alteration.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">14. Payment.</E> A passenger's request for a fixed route or paratransit driver to provide the transit service when the passenger with a disability cannot or refuses to pay the fare may be denied. If the transportation agency requires payment to ride, then to provide a free service would constitute a fundamental alteration of the entity's service.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">15. Caring for Service Animals.</E> A paratransit or fixed route passenger's request that the driver take charge of a service animal may be denied. Caring for a service animal is the responsibility of the passenger or a PCA.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">16. Opening Building Doors.</E> For paratransit services, a passenger's request for the driver to open an exterior entry door to a building to provide boarding and/or alighting assistance to a passenger with a disability should generally be granted as long as providing this assistance would not pose a direct threat, or leave the vehicle unattended or out of visual observation for a lengthy period of time.<SU>1</SU>

              <FTREF/> Note that a request for “door-through-door” service (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> assisting the passenger past the door to the building) generally would not need to be granted because it could rise to the level of a fundamental alteration.</P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>

                <SU>1</SU> Please see guidance issued on this topic. U.S. Department of Transportation, <E T="03">Origin-to-Destination Service,</E> September 1, 2005, <E T="03">available at http://www.fta.dot.gov/12325_3891.html</E> (explaining that, “the Department does not view transit providers' obligations as extending to the provision of personal services. . . . Nor would drivers, for lengthy periods of time, have to leave their vehicles unattended or lose the ability to keep their vehicles under visual observation, or take actions that would be clearly unsafe . . .”).</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>
              <E T="03">17. Exposing Vehicle to Hazards.</E> If the passenger requests that a vehicle follow a path <PRTPAGE P="493"/>to a pick up or drop off point that would expose the vehicle and its occupants to hazards, such as running off the road, getting stuck, striking overhead objects, or reversing the vehicle down a narrow alley, the request can be denied as creating a direct threat.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">18. Hard-to-Maneuver Stops.</E> A passenger may request that a paratransit vehicle navigate to a pick-up point to which it is difficult to maneuver a vehicle. A passenger's request to be picked up in a location that is difficult, but not impossible or impracticable, to access should generally be granted as long as picking up the passenger does not expose the vehicle to hazards that pose a direct threat (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> it is unsafe for the vehicle and its occupants to get to the pick-up point without getting stuck or running off the road).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">19. Specific Drivers.</E> A passenger's request for a specific driver may be denied. Having a specific driver is not necessary to afford the passenger the service provided by the transit operator.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">20. Luggage and Packages.</E> A passenger's request for a fixed route or paratransit driver to assist with luggage or packages may be denied in those instances where it is not the normal policy or practice of the transportation agency to assist with luggage or packages. Such assistance is a matter for the passenger or PCA, and providing this assistance would be a fundamental alteration of the driver's function.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">21. Request to Avoid Specific Passengers.</E> A paratransit passenger's request not to ride with certain passengers may be denied. Paratransit is a shared-ride service. As a result, one passenger may need to share the vehicle with people that he or she would rather not.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">22. Navigating an Incline, or Around Obstacles.</E> A paratransit passenger's request for a driver to help him or her navigate an incline (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a driveway or sidewalk) with the passenger's wheeled device should generally be granted. Likewise, assistance in traversing a difficult sidewalk (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> one where tree roots have made the sidewalk impassible for a wheelchair) should generally be granted, as should assistance around obstacles (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> snowdrifts, construction areas) between the vehicle and a door to a passenger's house or destination should generally be granted. These modifications would be granted subject, of course, to the proviso that such assistance would not cause a direct threat, or leave the vehicle unattended or out of visual observation for a lengthy period of time.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">23. Extreme Weather Assistance.</E> A passenger's request to be assisted from his or her door to a vehicle during extreme weather conditions should generally be granted so long as the driver leaving the vehicle to assist would not pose a direct threat, or leave the vehicle unattended or out of visual observation for a lengthy period of time. For example, in extreme weather (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> very windy or stormy conditions), a person who is blind or vision-impaired or a frail elderly person may have difficulty safely moving to and from a building.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">24. Unattended Passengers.</E> Where a passenger's request for assistance means that the driver will need to leave passengers aboard a vehicle unattended, transportation agencies should generally grant the request as long as accommodating the request would not leave the vehicle unattended or out of visual observation for a lengthy period of time, both of which could involve direct threats to the health or safety of the unattended passengers. It is important to keep in mind that, just as a driver is not required to act as a PCA for a passenger making a request for assistance, so a driver is not intended to act as a PCA for other passengers in the vehicle, such that he or she must remain in their physical presence at all times.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">25. Need for Return Trip Assistance.</E> A passenger with a disability may need assistance for a return trip when he or she did not need that assistance on the initial trip. For example, a dialysis patient may have no problem waiting at the curb for a ride to go to the dialysis center, but may well require assistance to the door on his or her return trip because of physical weakness or fatigue. To the extent that this need is predictable, it should be handled in advance, either as part of the eligibility process or the provider's reservations process. If the need arises unexpectedly, then it would need to be handled on an ad hoc basis. The paratransit operator should generally provide such assistance, unless doing so would create a direct threat, or leave the vehicle unattended or out of visual observation for a lengthy period of time.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">26. Five-Minute Warning or Notification of Arrival Calls.</E> A passenger's request for a telephone call 5 minutes (or another reasonable interval) in advance or at time of vehicle arrival generally should be granted. As a matter of courtesy, such calls are encouraged as a good customer service model and can prevent “no shows.” Oftentimes, these calls can be generated through an automated system. In those situations where automated systems are not available and paratransit drivers continue to rely on hand-held communication devices (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> cellular telephones) drivers should comply with any State or Federal laws related to distracted driving.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">27. Hand-Carrying.</E> Except in emergency situations, a passenger's request for a driver to lift the passenger out of his or her mobility device should generally be denied because of the safety, dignity, and privacy issues implicated by hand-carrying a passenger. Hand-<PRTPAGE P="494"/>carrying a passenger is also a PCA-type service which is outside the scope of driver duties, and hence a fundamental alteration.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) New, used or remanufactured buses and vans (except over-the-road buses covered by subpart G of this part), to be considered accessible by regulations in part 37 of this title shall comply with the applicable provisions of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(b) If portions of the vehicle are modified in a way that affects or could affect accessibility, each such portion shall comply, to the extent practicable, with the applicable provisions of this subpart. This provision does not require that inaccessible buses be retrofitted with lifts, ramps or other boarding devices.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 38.23</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Mobility aid accessibility.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> All vehicles covered by this subpart shall provide a level-change mechanism or boarding device (e.g., lift or ramp) complying with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section and sufficient clearances to permit a wheelchair or other mobility aid user to reach a securement location. At least two securement locations and devices, complying with paragraph (d) of this section, shall be provided on vehicles in excess of 22 feet in length; at least one securement location and device, complying with paragraph (d) of this section, shall be provided on vehicles 22 feet in length or less.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Vehicle lift</E>—(1) <E T="03">Design load.</E> The design load of the lift shall be at least 600 pounds. Working parts, such as cables, pulleys, and shafts, which can be expected to wear, and upon which the lift depends for support of the load, shall have a safety factor of at least six, based on the ultimate strength of the material. Nonworking parts, such as platform, frame, and attachment hardware which would not be expected to wear, shall have a safety factor of at least three, based on the ultimate strength of the material.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Controls</E>—(i) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> The controls shall be interlocked with the vehicle brakes, transmission, or door, or shall provide other appropriate mechanisms or systems, to ensure that the vehicle cannot be moved when the lift is not stowed and so the lift cannot be deployed unless the interlocks or systems are engaged. The lift shall deploy to all levels (i.e., ground, curb, and intermediate positions) normally encountered in the operating environment. Where provided, each control for deploying, lowering, raising, and stowing the lift and lowering the roll-off barrier shall be of a momentary contact type requiring continuous manual pressure by the operator and shall not allow improper lift sequencing when the lift platform is occupied. The controls shall allow reversal of the lift operation sequence, such as raising or lowering a platform that is part way down, without allowing an occupied <PRTPAGE P="496"/>platform to fold or retract into the stowed position.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Exception.</E> Where the lift is designed to deploy with its long dimension parallel to the vehicle axis and which pivots into or out of the vehicle while occupied (i.e., “rotary lift”), the requirements of this paragraph prohibiting the lift from being stowed while occupied shall not apply if the stowed position is within the passenger compartment and the lift is intended to be stowed while occupied.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Emergency operation.</E> The lift shall incorporate an emergency method of deploying, lowering to ground level with a lift occupant, and raising and stowing the empty lift if the power to the lift fails. No emergency method, manual or otherwise, shall be capable of being operated in a manner that could be hazardous to the lift occupant or to the operator when operated according to manufacturer's instructions, and shall not permit the platform to be stowed or folded when occupied, unless the lift is a rotary lift and is intended to be stowed while occupied.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Power or equipment failure.</E> Platforms stowed in a vertical position, and deployed platforms when occupied, shall have provisions to prevent their deploying, falling, or folding any faster than 12 inches/second or their dropping of an occupant in the event of a single failure of any load carrying component.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Platform barriers.</E> The lift platform shall be equipped with barriers to prevent any of the wheels of a wheelchair or mobility aid from rolling off the platform during its operation. A movable barrier or inherent design feature shall prevent a wheelchair or mobility aid from rolling off the edge closest to the vehicle until the platform is in its fully raised position. Each side of the lift platform which extends beyond the vehicle in its raised position shall have a barrier a minimum 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches high. Such barriers shall not interfere with maneuvering into or out of the aisle. The loading-edge barrier (outer barrier) which functions as a loading ramp when the lift is at ground level, shall be sufficient when raised or closed, or a supplementary system shall be provided, to prevent a power wheelchair or mobility aid from riding over or defeating it. The outer barrier of the lift shall automatically raise or close, or a supplementary system shall automatically engage, and remain raised, closed, or engaged at all times that the platform is more than 3 inches above the roadway or sidewalk and the platform is occupied. Alternatively, a barrier or system may be raised, lowered, opened, closed, engaged, or disengaged by the lift operator, provided an interlock or inherent design feature prevents the lift from rising unless the barrier is raised or closed or the supplementary system is engaged.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Platform surface.</E> The platform surface shall be free of any protrusions over <FR>1/4</FR> inch high and shall be slip resistant. The platform shall have a minimum clear width of 28<FR>1/2</FR> inches at the platform, a minimum clear width of 30 inches measured from 2 inches above the platform surface to 30 inches above the platform, and a minimum clear length of 48 inches measured from 2 inches above the surface of the platform to 30 inches above the surface of the platform. (See Fig. 1)</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Platform gaps.</E> Any openings between the platform surface and the raised barriers shall not exceed <FR>5/8</FR> inch in width. When the platform is at vehicle floor height with the inner barrier (if applicable) down or retracted, gaps between the forward lift platform edge and the vehicle floor shall not exceed <FR>1/2</FR> inch horizontally and <FR>5/8</FR> inch vertically. Platforms on semi-automatic lifts may have a hand hold not exceeding 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches by 4<FR>1/2</FR> inches located between the edge barriers.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Platform entrance ramp.</E> The entrance ramp, or loading-edge barrier used as a ramp, shall not exceed a slope of 1:8, measured on level ground, for a maximum rise of 3 inches, and the transition from roadway or sidewalk to ramp may be vertical without edge treatment up to <FR>1/4</FR> inch. Thresholds between <FR>1/4</FR> inch and <FR>1/2</FR> inch high shall be beveled with a slope no greater than 1:2.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Platform deflection.</E> The lift platform (not including the entrance ramp) shall not deflect more than 3 degrees (exclusive of vehicle roll or pitch) in any direction between its unloaded position and its position when loaded with 600 pounds applied through a 26 <PRTPAGE P="497"/>inch by 26 inch test pallet at the centroid of the platform.</P>
            <P>(10) <E T="03">Platform movement.</E> No part of the platform shall move at a rate exceeding 6 inches/second during lowering and lifting an occupant, and shall not exceed 12 inches/second during deploying or stowing. This requirement does not apply to the deployment or stowage cycles of lifts that are manually deployed or stowed. The maximum platform horizontal and vertical acceleration when occupied shall be 0.3g.</P>
            <P>(11) <E T="03">Boarding direction.</E> The lift shall permit both inboard and outboard facing of wheelchair and mobility aid users.</P>
            <P>(12) <E T="03">Use by standees.</E> Lifts shall accommodate persons using walkers, crutches, canes or braces or who otherwise have difficulty using steps. The platform may be marked to indicate a preferred standing position.</P>
            <P>(13) <E T="03">Handrails.</E> Platforms on lifts shall be equipped with handrails on two sides, which move in tandem with the lift, and which shall be graspable and provide support to standees throughout the entire lift operation. Handrails shall have a usable component at least 8 inches long with the lowest portion a minimum 30 inches above the platform and the highest portion a maximum 38 inches above the platform. The handrails shall be capable of withstanding a force of 100 pounds concentrated at any point on the handrail without permanent deformation of the rail or its supporting structure. The handrail shall have a cross-sectional diameter between 1<FR>1/4</FR> inches and 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches or shall provide an equivalent grasping surface, and have eased edges with corner radii of not less than <FR>1/8</FR> inch. Handrails shall be placed to provide a minimum 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches knuckle clearance from the nearest adjacent surface. Handrails shall not interfere with wheelchair or mobility aid maneuverability when entering or leaving the vehicle.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Vehicle ramp</E>—(1) <E T="03">Design load.</E> Ramps 30 inches or longer shall support a load of 600 pounds, placed at the centroid of the ramp distributed over an area of 26 inches by 26 inches, with a safety factor of at least 3 based on the ultimate strength of the material. Ramps shorter than 30 inches shall support a load of 300 pounds.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Ramp surface.</E> The ramp surface shall be continuous and slip resistant; shall not have protrusions from the surface greater than <FR>1/4</FR> inch high; shall have a clear width of 30 inches; and shall accommodate both four-wheel and three-wheel mobility aids.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Ramp threshold.</E> The transition from roadway or sidewalk and the transition from vehicle floor to the ramp may be vertical without edge treatment up to <FR>1/4</FR> inch. Changes in level between <FR>1/4</FR> inch and <FR>1/2</FR> inch shall be beveled with a slope no greater than 1:2.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Ramp barriers.</E> Each side of the ramp shall have barriers at least 2 inches high to prevent mobility aid wheels from slipping off.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Slope.</E> Ramps shall have the least slope practicable and shall not exceed 1:4 when deployed to ground level. If the height of the vehicle floor from which the ramp is deployed is 3 inches or less above a 6-inch curb, a maximum slope of 1:4 is permitted; if the height of the vehicle floor from which the ramp is deployed is 6 inches or less, but greater than 3 inches, above a 6-inch curb, a maximum slope of 1:6 is permitted; if the height of the vehicle floor from which the ramp is deployed is 9 inches or less, but greater than 6 inches, above a 6-inch curb, a maximum slope of 1:8 is permitted; if the height of the vehicle floor from which the ramp is deployed is greater than 9 inches above a 6-inch curb, a slope of 1:12 shall be achieved. Folding or telescoping ramps are permitted provided they meet all structural requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Attachment.</E> When in use for boarding or alighting, the ramp shall be firmly attached to the vehicle so that it is not subject to displacement when loading or unloading a heavy power mobility aid and that no gap between vehicle and ramp exceeds <FR>5/8</FR> inch.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Stowage.</E> A compartment, securement system, or other appropriate method shall be provided to ensure that stowed ramps, including portable ramps stowed in the passenger area, do not impinge on a passenger's wheelchair or mobility aid or pose any hazard to passengers in the event of a sudden stop or maneuver.<PRTPAGE P="498"/>
            </P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Handrails.</E> If provided, handrails shall allow persons with disabilities to grasp them from outside the vehicle while starting to board, and to continue to use them throughout the boarding process, and shall have the top between 30 inches and 38 inches above the ramp surface. The handrails shall be capable of withstanding a force of 100 pounds concentrated at any point on the handrail without permanent deformation of the rail or its supporting structure. The handrail shall have a cross-sectional diameter between 1<FR>1/4</FR> inches and 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches or shall provide an equivalent grasping surface, and have eased edges with corner radii of not less than <FR>1/8</FR> inch. Handrails shall not interfere with wheelchair or mobility aid maneuverability when entering or leaving the vehicle.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Securement devices</E>—(1) <E T="03">Design load.</E> Securement systems on vehicles with GVWRs of 30,000 pounds or above, and their attachments to such vehicles, shall restrain a force in the forward longitudinal direction of up to 2,000 pounds per securement leg or clamping mechanism and a minimum of 4,000 pounds for each mobility aid. Securement systems on vehicles with GVWRs of up to 30,000 pounds, and their attachments to such vehicles, shall restrain a force in the forward longitudinal direction of up to 2,500 pounds per securement leg or clamping mechanism and a minimum of 5,000 pounds for each mobility aid.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Location and size.</E> The securement system shall be placed as near to the accessible entrance as practicable and shall have a clear floor area of 30 inches by 48 inches. Such space shall adjoin, and may overlap, an access path. Not more than 6 inches of the required clear floor space may be accommodated for footrests under another seat provided there is a minimum of 9 inches from the floor to the lowest part of the seat overhanging the space. Securement areas may have fold-down seats to accommodate other passengers when a wheelchair or mobility aid is not occupying the area, provided the seats, when folded up, do not obstruct the clear floor space required. (See Fig. 2)</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Mobility aids accommodated.</E> The securement system shall secure common wheelchairs and mobility aids and shall either be automatic or easily attached by a person familiar with the system and mobility aid and having average dexterity.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Orientation.</E> In vehicles in excess of 22 feet in length, at least one securement device or system required by paragraph (a) of this section shall secure the wheelchair or mobility aid facing toward the front of the vehicle. Additional securement devices or systems shall secure the wheelchair or mobility aid facing forward, or rearward with a padded barrier, extending from a height of 38 inches from the vehicle floor to a height of 56 inches from the vehicle floor with a width of 18 inches, laterally centered immediately in back of the seated individual. In vehicles 22 feet in length or less, the required securement device may secure the wheelchair or mobility aid either facing toward the front of the vehicle or facing rearward, with a padded barrier as described. Additional securement locations shall be either forward or rearward facing with a padded barrier. Such barriers need not be solid provided equivalent protection is afforded.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Movement.</E> When the wheelchair or mobility aid is secured in accordance with manufacturer's instructions, the securement system shall limit the movement of an occupied wheelchair or mobility aid to no more than 2 inches in any direction under normal vehicle operating conditions.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Stowage.</E> When not being used for securement, or when the securement area can be used by standees, the securement system shall not interfere with passenger movement, shall not present any hazardous condition, shall be reasonably protected from vandalism, and shall be readily accessed when needed for use.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Seat belt and shoulder harness.</E> For each wheelchair or mobility aid securement device provided, a passenger seat belt and shoulder harness, complying with all applicable provisions of part 571 of this title, shall also be provided for use by wheelchair or mobility aid users. Such seat belts and shoulder harnesses shall not be used in lieu of a device which secures the wheelchair or mobility aid itself.</P>

Each side of the lift platform which extends beyond the vehicle in its raised position shall have a barrier a minimum 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches high. Such barriers shall not interfere with maneuvering into or out of the aisle. The loading-edge barrier (outer barrier) which functions as a loading ramp when the lift is at ground level, shall be sufficient when raised or closed, or a supplementary system shall be provided, to prevent a power wheelchair or mobility aid from riding over or defeating it. The outer barrier on the outboard of the lift shall automatically rise or close, or a supplementary system shall automatically engage, and remain raised, closed, or engaged at all times that the lift is more than 3 inches above the station platform or roadway and the lift is occupied. Alternatively, a barrier or system may be raised, lowered, opened, closed, engaged or disengaged by the lift operator provided an interlock or inherent design feature prevents the lift from <PRTPAGE P="506"/>rising unless the barrier is raised or closed or the supplementary system is engaged.</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Location and size.</E> The securement system shall be placed as near to the accessible entrance as practicable and shall have a clear floor area of 30 inches (760 mm) by 48 inches (1220 mm). Such space shall adjoin, and may overlap, an access path. Not more than 6 inches (150 mm) of the required clear floor space may be accommodated for footrests under another seat, modesty panel, or other fixed element provided there is a minimum of 9 inches (230 mm) from the floor to the lowest part of the seat overhanging the space. Securement areas may have fold-down seats to accommodate other passengers when a wheelchair or mobility aid is not occupying the area, provided the seats, when folded up, do not obstruct the clear floor space required. (See Figure 2 to this part.)</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Mobility aids accommodated.</E> The securement system shall secure common wheelchairs and mobility aids and shall either be automatic or easily attached by a person familiar with the system and mobility aid and having average dexterity.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Orientation.</E> At least one securement device or system required by paragraph (a) of this section shall secure the wheelchair or mobility aid facing toward the front of the vehicle. Additional securement devices or systems shall secure the wheelchair or mobility aid facing forward or rearward. Where the wheelchair or mobility aid is secured facing the rear of the vehicle, a padded barrier shall be provided. The padded barrier shall extend from a height of 38 inches (965 mm) from the vehicle floor to a height of 56 inches (1420 mm) from the vehicle floor with a width of 18 inches (455 mm), laterally centered immediately in back of the seated individual. Such barriers need not be solid provided equivalent protection is afforded.</P>

          <APPENDIX>
            <EAR>Pt. 38, App.</EAR>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix to Part 38—Guidance Material</HD>
            <P>This appendix contains materials of an advisory nature and provides additional information that should help the reader to understand the minimum requirements of the standards or to design vehicles for greater accessibility. Each entry is applicable to all subparts of this part except where noted. Nothing in this appendix shall in any way obviate any obligation to comply with the requirements of the standards themselves.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. Slip Resistant Surface—Aisles, Steps, Floor Areas Where People Walk, Floor Areas in Securement Locations, Lift Platforms, Ramps</HD>

            <P>Slip resistance is based on the frictional force necessary to keep a shoe heel or crutch tip from slipping on a walking surface under conditions likely to be found on the surface. While the dynamic coefficient of friction during walking varies in a complex and non-uniform way, the static coefficient of friction, which can be measured in several ways, provides a close approximation of the slip resistance of a surface. Contrary to popular belief, some slippage is necessary to walking, <PRTPAGE P="530"/>especially for persons with restricted gaits; a truly “non-slip” surface could not be negotiated.</P>
            <P>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends that walking surfaces have a static coefficient of friction of 0.5. A research project sponsored by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) conducted tests with persons with disabilities and concluded that a higher coefficient of friction was needed by such persons. A static coefficient of friction of 0.6 is recommended for steps, floors, and lift platforms and 0.8 for ramps.</P>
            <P>It is recognized that the coefficient of friction varies considerably due to the presence of contaminants, water, floor finishes, and other factors not under the control of transit providers and may be difficult to measure. Nevertheless, many common materials suitable for flooring are now labeled with information on the static coefficient of friction. While it may not be possible to compare one product directly with another, or to guarantee a constant measure, transit operators or vehicle designers and manufacturers are encouraged to specify materials with appropriate values. As more products include information on slip resistance, improved uniformity in measurement and specification is likely. The Access Board's advisory guidelines on Slip Resistant Surfaces provides additional information on this subject.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">II. Color Contrast—Step Edges, Lift Platform Edges</HD>

            <P>The material used to provide contrast should contrast by at least 70%. Contrast in percent is determined by:
            </P>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Contrast=[B−B)/B] × 100</FP>
            
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Where B = light reflectance value (LRV) of the lighter area</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">and B = light reflectance value (LRV) of the darker area.</FP>
            
            <FP>Note that in any application both white and black are never absolute; thus, B never equals 100 and B is always greater than 0.</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">III. Handrails and Stanchions</HD>
            <P>In addition to the requirements for handrails and stanchions for rapid, light, and commuter rail vehicles, consideration should be given to the proximity of handrails or stanchions to the area in which wheelchair or mobility aid users may position themselves. When identifying the clear floor space where a wheelchair or mobility aid user can be accommodated, it is suggested that at least one such area be adjacent or in close proximity to a handrail or stanchion. Of course, such a handrail or stanchion cannot encroach upon the required 32 inch width required for the doorway or the route leading to the clear floor space which must be at least 30 by 48 inches in size.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">IV. Priority Seating Signs and Other Signage</HD>
            <P>A. <E T="03">Finish and Contrast.</E> The characters and background of signs should be eggshell, matte, or other non-glare finish. An eggshell finish (11 to 19 degree gloss on 60 degree glossimeter) is recommended. Characters and symbols shall contrast with their background—either light characters on a dark background or dark characters on a light background. Research indicates that signs are more legible for persons with low vision when characters contrast with their background by at least 70 percent. Contrast in percent shall be determined by:
            </P>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Contrast=[B−B)/B] × 100</FP>
            
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Where B = light reflectance value (LRV) of the lighter area</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">and B = light reflectance value (LRV) of the darker area.</FP>
            
            <FP>Note that in any application both white and black are never absolute; thus, B never equals 100 and B is always greater than 0.</FP>
            <P>The greatest readability is usually achieved through the use of light-colored characters or symbols on a dark background.</P>
            <P>B. <E T="03">Destination and Route Signs.</E> (The following specifications, which are required for buses (§ 38.39), are recommended for other types of vehicles, particularly light rail vehicles, were appropriate.)</P>
            <P>1. Where destination or route information is displayed on the exterior of a vehicle, each vehicle shall have illuminated signs on the front and boarding side of the vehicle.</P>
            <P>2. Characters on signs required by paragraph IV.B.1 of this appendix shall have a width-to-height ratio between 3:5 and 1:1 and a stroke width-to-height ratio between 1:5 and 1:10, with a minimum character height (using an upper case “X”) of 1 inch for signs on the boarding side and a minimum character height of 2 inches for front “headsigns,” with “wide” spacing (generally, the space between letters shall be <FR>1/16</FR> the height of upper case letters), and shall contrast with the background, either dark-on-light or light-on-dark, or as recommended above.</P>
            <P>C. <E T="03">Designation of Accessible Vehicles.</E> The International Symbol of Accessibility should be displayed as shown in Figure 6.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">V. Public Information Systems</HD>

            <P>Entities are encouraged to employ any available services, signage, or alternative systems or devices that are capable of providing the same or equivalent information to persons with hearing loss. Two possible types of devices are visual display systems and listening systems. However, it should be noted that while visual display systems accommodate persons who are deaf or are hearing impaired, assistive listening systems aid only those with a partial loss of hearing.<PRTPAGE P="531"/>
            </P>
            <P>A. <E T="03">Visual Display Systems.</E> Announcements may be provided in a visual format by the use of electronic message boards or video monitors.</P>
            <P>Electronic message boards using a light emitting diode (LED) or “flip-dot” display are currently provided in some transit stations and terminals and may be usable in vehicles. These devices may be used to provide real time or pre-programmed messages; however, real time message displays require the availability of an employee for keyboard entry of the information to be announced.</P>
            <P>Video monitor systems, such as visual paging systems provided in some airports (e.g., Baltimore-Washington International Airport), are another alternative. The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) can provide technical assistance and information on these systems (“Airport TDD Access: Two Case Studies,” (1990)).</P>
            <P>B. <E T="03">Assistive Listening Systems.</E> Assistive listening systems (ALS) are intended to augment standard public address and audio systems by providing signals which can be received directly by persons with special receivers or their own hearing aids and which eliminate or filter background noise. Magnetic induction loops, infra-red and radio frequency systems are types of listening systems which are appropriate for various applications.</P>
            <P>An assistive listening system appropriate for transit vehicles, where a group of persons or where the specific individuals are not known in advance, may be different from the system appropriate for a particular individual provided as an auxiliary aid or as part of a reasonable accommodation. The appropriate device for an individual is the type that individual can use, whereas the appropriate system for a station or vehicle will necessarily be geared toward the “average” or aggregate needs of various individuals. Earphone jacks with variable volume controls can benefit only people who have slight hearing loss and do not help people who use hearing aids. At the present time, magnetic induction loops are the most feasible type of listening system for people who use hearing aids equipped with “T-coils”, but people without hearing aids or those with hearing aids not equipped with inductive pick-ups cannot use them without special receivers. Radio frequency systems can be extremely effective and inexpensive. People without hearing aids can use them, but people with hearing aids need a special receiver to use them as they are presently designed. If hearing aids had a jack to allow a by-pass of microphones, then radio frequency systems would be suitable for people with and without hearing aids. Some listening systems may be subject to interference from other equipment and feedback from hearing aids of people who are using the systems. Such interference can be controlled by careful engineering design that anticipates feedback sources in the surrounding area.</P>
            <P>The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) has published a pamphlet on Assistive Listening Systems which lists demonstration centers across the country where technical assistance can be obtained in selecting and installing appropriate systems. The State of New York has also adopted a detailed technical specification which may be useful.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">VI. Over-the-Road Buses</HD>
            <P>A. <E T="03">Door Width.</E> Achieving a 30 inch wide front door on an over-the-road bus is considered not feasible if doing so would necessitate reduction of the bus approach angle, relocating the front axle rearward, or increasing the bus overall length.</P>
            <P>B. <E T="03">Restrooms.</E> The following is provided to assist manufacturers and designers to create restrooms which can be used by people with disabilities. These specifications are derived from requirements for rail vehicles and represent compromises between space needed for use and constraints imposed by vehicle dimensions. As a result, some persons with disabilities cannot use a restroom which meets these specifications and operators who do provide such restrooms should provide passengers with disabilities sufficient advance information about design so that those passengers can assess their ability to use them. Designers should provide additional space beyond these minimum specifications whenever possible.</P>
            <P>(1) If an accessible restroom is provided, it should be designed so as to allow a person using a wheelchair or mobility aid to enter and use such restroom as specified in paragraphs (1)(a) through (e) of section VI.B of this appendix.</P>
            <P>(a) The minimum clear floor area should be 35 inches (890 mm) by 60 inches (1525 mm). Permanently installed fixtures may overlap this area a maximum of 6 inches (150 mm), if the lowest portion of the fixture is a minimum of 9 inches (230 mm) above the floor, and may overlap a maximum of 19 inches (485 mm), if the lowest portion of the fixture is a minimum of 29 inches (740 mm) above the floor, provided such fixtures do not interfere with access to the water closet. Fold-down or retractable seats or shelves may overlap the clear floor space at a lower height provided they can be easily folded up or moved out of the way.</P>

            <P>(a) As a PVO, you must not do any of the following things, either directly or through a contractual, licensing, or other arrangement:</P>
            <P>(1) You must not discriminate against any qualified individual with a disability, by reason of such disability, with respect to the individual's use of a vessel;</P>
            <P>(2) You must not require a qualified individual with a disability to accept special services that the individual does not request;</P>

            <P>(b)(1) As a PVO that is a private entity, you must make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when such modifications are necessary to afford such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to individuals with disabilities, unless you can demonstrate that making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations.</P>
            <P>(2) As a PVO that is a public entity, you must make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless you can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the services, programs, or activities you offer.</P>

            <P>(b) As a PVO, you must include an assurance of compliance with this Part in your contracts or agreements with any contractors who provide to the public services that are subject to the requirements of this Part. Noncompliance with this assurance is a material breach of the contract on the contractor's part. With respect to contracts or agreements existing on November 3, 2010, you must ensure the inclusion of this assurance by November 3, 2011 or on the next occasion on which the contract or agreement is renewed or amended, whichever comes first.</P>
            <P>(1) This assurance must commit the contractor to compliance with all applicable provisions of this Part in activities performed on behalf of the PVO.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Can a PVO take action to deny transportation or restrict services to a passenger with a disability based on safety concerns?</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) As a PVO, you may take action to deny transportation or restrict services to a passenger with a disability if necessitated by legitimate safety requirements. Safety requirements must be based on actual risks and not on mere speculation, stereotypes, or generalizations about individuals with disabilities.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1 to paragraph 39.27(a):</HD>
              <P>You may take such action in order to comply with Coast Guard safety regulations.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2 to paragraph 39.27(a):</HD>
              <P>You may take such action if accommodating a large or heavy wheelchair would, together with its occupant, create weight and balance problem that could affect adversely the seaworthiness of the vessel or impede emergency egress from the vessel.</P>

            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 3 to paragraph 39.27(a):</HD>
              <P>You could restrict access to a lifeboat for a mobility device that would limit access to the lifeboat for other passengers.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>(b) In taking action pursuant to legitimate safety requirements, you must take the action that imposes the minimum feasible burdens or limitations from the point of view of the passenger. For example, if you can meet legitimate safety requirements by a means short of refusing transportation to a passenger, you must do so.</P>
            <P>(c) You may take action to deny transportation or restrict services to a passenger if the passenger poses a direct threat to others. In determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others, the PVO must make an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence, to ascertain: The nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures will mitigate the risk.</P>

            <P>As a PVO, you must not limit the number of passengers with a disability other than individuals with a mobility disability on your vessel. However, if in the Captain's judgment, weight or stability issues are presented by the presence of mobility devices and would conflict with legitimate safety requirements pertaining to the vessel and its passengers, then the number of passengers with mobility aids may be limited, but only to the extent reasonable to prevent a avoid such a conflict.</P>

            <P>(a) You must not take any of the following actions on the basis that a passenger has a communicable disease or infection, unless one of the conditions of paragraph (b) of this section exists:</P>
            <P>(1) Refuse to provide transportation or use of a vessel to the passenger;</P>

            <P>(2) Delay the passenger's transportation or use of the vessel (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> require the passenger to take a later trip);</P>
            <P>(3) Impose on the passenger any condition, restriction, or requirement not imposed on other passengers; or</P>

            <P>(4) Require the passenger to provide a medical certificate.<PRTPAGE P="539"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) You may take actions listed in paragraph (a) of this section only if either or both of the conditions listed in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section are met. The action you take must be the least restrictive from the point of view of the passenger, consistent with protecting the health of other passengers.</P>
            <P>(1) U.S. or international public health authorities (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the Centers for Disease Control, Public Health Service, World Health Organization) have determined that persons with a particular condition should not be permitted to travel or should travel only under conditions specified by the public health authorities;</P>

            <P>(2) An individual has a condition that is both readily transmissible by casual contact in the context of traveling on or using a passenger vessel and has serious health consequences.
            </P>

              <P>A passenger has a condition that is not readily transmissible by casual contact to or does not have serious health consequences for the general passenger population. However, it is possible that it could be readily transmitted by casual contact with and have serious health consequences for an individual with a severe allergy or severely compromised immune system. You may not take any of the actions listed in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            

            <P>(c) Any action of those listed in paragraph (a) of this section that you take under paragraph (b) of this section must be the least drastic action you can take to protect the health of other passengers. For example, if you can protect the health of other passenger by imposing a condition on the transportation of a passenger with a communicable disease (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> limiting the passenger's access to certain facilities on the vessel for a period of time), you cannot totally deny transportation on the vessel.</P>
            <P>(d) For purposes of paragraph (a)(4) of this section, a medical certificate is a written statement from the passenger's physician saying that the passenger's disease or infection would not, under the present conditions in the particular passenger's case, be readily communicable to other persons by casual contact during the normal course of the passenger's transportation or use of the vessel. Such a medical certificate must state any conditions or precautions that would have to be observed to prevent the transmission of the disease or infection to other persons in the normal course of the passenger's transportation on or use of the vessel. It must be sufficiently recent to pertain directly to the communicable disease presented by the passenger at the time the passenger seeks to board the vessel.</P>
            <P>(e) If your action under this section results in the postponement of a passenger's transportation or use of the vessel, you must permit the passenger to travel or use the vessel at a later available time (up to one year from the date of the postponed trip or use of the vessel) at the cost that would have applied to the passenger's originally scheduled trip or use of the vessel without penalty or, at the passenger's discretion, provide a refund for any unused transportation or use of the vessel. If there is no available reservation within one year, you must provide a refund.</P>
            <P>(f) If you take any action under this section that restricts a passenger's transportation or use of the vessel, you must, on the passenger's request, provide a written explanation within 10 days of the request.</P>

            <P>(a) As a PVO operating a vessel that has accessible cabins, you must follow the requirements of this Part to ensure that passengers with disabilities who need accessible cabins have nondiscriminatory access to them.</P>

            <P>(b) You must, with respect to reservations made by any means (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> telephone, Internet, in person, or through a third party):</P>
            <P>(1) Modify your policies, practices, or procedures to ensure that individuals with disabilities can make reservations for accessible cabins during the same hours and in the same manner as individuals who do not need accessible cabins;</P>
            <P>(2) Identify and describe accessible features in the cabins offered through your reservations service in enough detail to permit individuals with disabilities to assess independently whether a given cabin meets his or her accessibility needs.</P>
            <P>(3) Ensure that accessible cabins are held for use by individuals with disabilities until all other cabins in that class of service have been rented;</P>
            <P>(4) Reserve accessible cabins upon request by a passenger with disabilities and ensure that the specific accessible cabin reserved by that passenger is held for him or her, even you do not normally hold specific cabins for passengers who make reservations.</P>
            <P>(c) You may release unsold accessible cabins to persons without disabilities for their own use when all other cabins in the same class of service and price for a voyage have been reserved.</P>
            <P>(d) If a passenger with a disability seeks to reserve an accessible cabin in a given class of service, and there is not an available accessible cabin in that class of service, but there is an available accessible cabin in a different class of service, you must allow the passenger to reserve that accessible cabin at the price of the requested class of service of the class of service in which the accessible cabin exists, whichever is lower.</P>
            <P>(e) As a PVO, you are never required to deny transportation to any passenger who has already reserved passage in order to accommodate a passenger with a disability in an accessible cabin.</P>
            <P>(f) You must not require proof of disability, including, for example, a doctor's note, before reserving an accessible cabin.</P>

            <P>(g) To prevent fraud in the assignment of accessible cabins (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> attempts by individuals who do not have <PRTPAGE P="541"/>disabilities to reserve accessible cabins because they have greater space, you—</P>
            <P>(1) Must inquire of persons seeking to reserve such cabins whether the individual (or an individual for whom the cabin is being reserved) has a mobility disability or a disability that requires the use of the accessible features that are provided in the cabin.</P>
            <P>(2) May require a written attestation from the individual that accessible cabin is for a person who has a mobility disability or a disability that requires the use of the accessible features that are provided in the cabin.</P>
            <P>(h) You must investigate the potential misuse of accessible cabins where there is good cause to believe that such cabins have been purchased fraudulently, and you may take appropriate action against someone who has reserved or purchased such a cabin fraudulently. For example, if an individual who does not have a disability reserves an accessible cabin, after having attested that he or she has a mobility disability, you may deny transportation to the individual.</P>

            <P>(iv) Whether legitimate safety requirements can be established to permit the safe operation of a device in the specific vessel; and</P>
            <P>(c)(1) As a PVO subject to Title III of the ADA, you must not ask an individual using a wheelchair or other power-driven mobility device questions about the nature and extent of the individual's disability.</P>
            <P>(2) You may ask a person using an other power-driven mobility device to provide a credible assurance that the mobility device is required because of the person's disability. In response to this inquiry, you must accept the presentation of a valid, State-issued disability parking placard or card, or State-issued proof of disability as a credible assurance that the use of the other power-driven mobility device is for the individual's mobility disability. In lieu of a valid, State-issued disability parking placard or card, or State-issued proof of disability, a PVO shall accept as a credible assurance a verbal representation not contradicted by observable fact, that the other power-driven mobility device is being used for a mobility disability.</P>
            <P>(d) As a PVO subject to Title II of the ADA, you must follow the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. In addition, any restriction you impose on the use of an other powered mobility device on your vessel must be limited to the minimum necessary to meet a legitimate safety requirement. For example, if a device can be accommodated in some spaces of the vessel but not others because of a legitimate safety requirement, you could not completely exclude the device from the vessel.</P>
            <P>(e) As a PVO, you are not required to permit passengers with a disability to bring wheelchairs or other powered mobility devices into lifeboats or other survival craft, in the context of an emergency evacuation of the vessel.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What are the general responsibilities of employers under this regulation?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As an employer, you are responsible for meeting all applicable requirements and procedures of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) You are responsible for all actions of your officials, representatives, and agents (including service agents) in carrying out the requirements of the DOT agency regulations.</P>
            <P>(c) All agreements and arrangements, written or unwritten, between and among employers and service agents concerning the implementation of DOT drug and alcohol testing requirements are deemed, as a matter of law, to require compliance with all applicable provisions of this part and DOT agency drug and alcohol testing regulations. Compliance with these provisions is a material term of all such agreements and arrangements.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 40.13</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How do DOT drug and alcohol tests relate to non-DOT tests?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) DOT tests must be completely separate from non-DOT tests in all respects.</P>

            <P>(b) DOT tests must take priority and must be conducted and completed before a non-DOT test is begun. For example, you must discard any excess urine left over from a DOT test and <PRTPAGE P="557"/>collect a separate void for the subsequent non-DOT test.</P>
            <P>(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, you must not perform any tests on DOT urine or breath specimens other than those specifically authorized by this part or DOT agency regulations. For example, you may not test a DOT urine specimen for additional drugs, and a laboratory is prohibited from making a DOT urine specimen available for a DNA test or other types of specimen identity testing.</P>

            <P>(d) The single exception to paragraph (c) of this section is when a DOT drug test collection is conducted as part of a physical examination required by DOT agency regulations. It is permissible to conduct required medical tests related to this physical examination (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> for glucose) on any urine remaining in the collection container after the drug test urine specimens have been sealed into the specimen bottles.</P>
            <P>(e) No one is permitted to change or disregard the results of DOT tests based on the results of non-DOT tests. For example, as an employer you must not disregard a verified positive DOT drug test result because the employee presents a negative test result from a blood or urine specimen collected by the employee's physician or a DNA test result purporting to question the identity of the DOT specimen.</P>
            <P>(f) As an employer, you must not use the CCF or the ATF in your non-DOT drug and alcohol testing programs. This prohibition includes the use of the DOT forms with references to DOT programs and agencies crossed out. You also must always use the CCF and ATF for all your DOT-mandated drug and alcohol tests.</P>

            <P>(a) Full name of the employee being tested.</P>
            <P>(b) Employee SSN or ID number.</P>
            <P>(c) Laboratory name and address (can be pre-printed on the CCF).</P>

            <P>(i) Whether the test is to be observed or not (see § 40.67 of this part).</P>

            <SUBJECT>May an employer use a service agent to meet DOT drug and alcohol testing requirements?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As an employer, you may use a service agent to perform the tasks needed to comply with this part and DOT agency drug and alcohol testing regulations, consistent with the requirements of Subpart Q and other applicable provisions of this part.</P>

            <P>(b) As an employer, you are responsible for ensuring that the service agents you use meet the qualifications set forth in this part (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> § 40.121 for MROs). You may require service agents to show you documentation that they meet the requirements of this part (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> documentation of MRO qualifications required by § 40.121(e)).</P>

            <P>(c) You remain responsible for compliance with all applicable requirements of this part and other DOT drug and alcohol testing regulations, even when you use a service agent. If you violate this part or other DOT drug and alcohol testing regulations because a service agent has not provided services as our rules require, a DOT agency can subject you to sanctions. Your good faith use of a service agent is not a defense in an enforcement action initiated by a DOT agency in which your alleged noncompliance with this part or <PRTPAGE P="558"/>a DOT agency drug and alcohol regulation may have resulted from the service agent's conduct.</P>

            <P>Yes, as an employer, you are responsible for obtaining information required by this part from your service agents. This is true whether or not you choose to use a C/TPA as an intermediary in transmitting information to you. For example, suppose an applicant for a safety-sensitive job takes a pre-employment drug test, but there is a significant delay in your receipt of the test result from an MRO or C/TPA. You must not assume that “no news is good news” and permit the applicant to perform safety-sensitive duties before receiving the result. This is a violation of the Department's regulations.</P>

            <SUBJECT>May an employer stand down an employee before the MRO has completed the verification process?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As an employer, you are prohibited from standing employees down, except consistent with a waiver a DOT agency grants under this section.</P>
            <P>(b) You may make a request to the concerned DOT agency for a waiver from the prohibition of paragraph (a) of this section. Such a waiver, if granted, permits you to stand an employee down following the MRO's receipt of a laboratory report of a confirmed positive test for a drug or drug metabolite, an adulterated test, or a substituted test pertaining to the employee.</P>
            <P>(1) For this purpose, the concerned DOT agency is the one whose drug and alcohol testing rules apply to the majority of the covered employees in your organization. The concerned DOT agency uses its applicable procedures for considering requests for waivers.</P>
            <P>(2) Before taking action on a waiver request, the concerned DOT agency coordinates with other DOT agencies that regulate the employer's other covered employees.</P>
            <P>(3) The concerned DOT agency provides a written response to each employer that petitions for a waiver, setting forth the reasons for the agency's decision on the waiver request.</P>
            <P>(c) Your request for a waiver must include, as a minimum, the following elements:</P>
            <P>(1) Information about your organization:</P>
            <P>(i) Your determination that standing employees down is necessary for safety in your organization and a statement of your basis for it, including any data on safety problems or incidents that could have been prevented if a stand-down procedure had been in place;</P>
            <P>(ii) Data showing the number of confirmed laboratory positive, adulterated, and substituted test results for your employees over the two calendar years preceding your waiver request, and the number and percentage of those test results that were verified positive, adulterated, or substituted by the MRO;</P>
            <P>(iii) Information about the work situation of the employees subject to stand-down, including a description of the size and organization of the unit(s) in which the employees work, the process through which employees will be informed of the stand-down, whether there is an in-house MRO, and whether your organization has a medical disqualification or stand-down policy for employees in situations other than drug and alcohol testing; and</P>
            <P>(iv) A statement of which DOT agencies regulate your employees.</P>
            <P>(2) Your proposed written company policy concerning stand-down, which must include the following elements:</P>
            <P>(i) Your assurance that you will distribute copies of your written policy to all employees that it covers;</P>
            <P>(ii) Your means of ensuring that no information about the confirmed positive, adulterated, or substituted test result or the reason for the employee's temporary removal from performance of safety-sensitive functions becomes available, directly or indirectly, to anyone in your organization (or subsequently to another employer) other than the employee, the MRO and the DER;</P>

            <P>(iii) Your means of ensuring that all covered employees in a particular job category in your organization are <PRTPAGE P="559"/>treated the same way with respect to stand-down;</P>
            <P>(iv) Your means of ensuring that a covered employee will be subject to stand-down only with respect to the actual performance of safety-sensitive duties;</P>
            <P>(v) Your means of ensuring that you will not take any action adversely affecting the employee's pay and benefits pending the completion of the MRO's verification process. This includes continuing to pay the employee during the period of the stand-down in the same way you would have paid him or her had he or she not been stood down;</P>
            <P>(vi) Your means of ensuring that the verification process will commence no later than the time an employee is temporarily removed from the performance of safety-sensitive functions and that the period of stand-down for any employee will not exceed five days, unless you are informed in writing by the MRO that a longer period is needed to complete the verification process; and</P>
            <P>(vii) Your means of ensuring that, in the event that the MRO verifies the test negative or cancels it—</P>
            <P>(A) You return the employee immediately to the performance of safety-sensitive duties;</P>
            <P>(B) The employee suffers no adverse personnel or financial consequences as a result; and</P>

            <P>(C) You maintain no individually identifiable record that the employee had a confirmed laboratory positive, adulterated, or substituted test result (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> you maintain a record of the test only as a negative or cancelled test).</P>
            <P>(d) The Administrator of the concerned DOT agency, or his or her designee, may grant a waiver request only if he or she determines that, in the context of your organization, there is a high probability that the procedures you propose will effectively enhance safety and protect the interests of employees in fairness and confidentiality.</P>
            <P>(1) The Administrator, or his or her designee, may impose any conditions he or she deems appropriate on the grant of a waiver.</P>
            <P>(2) The Administrator, or his or her designee, may immediately suspend or revoke the waiver if he or she determines that you have failed to protect effectively the interests of employees in fairness and confidentiality, that you have failed to comply with the requirements of this section, or that you have failed to comply with any other conditions the DOT agency has attached to the waiver.</P>
            <P>(e) You must not stand employees down in the absence of a waiver, or inconsistent with the terms of your waiver. If you do, you are in violation of this part and DOT agency drug testing regulations, and you are subject to enforcement action by the DOT agency just as you are for other violations of this part and DOT agency rules.</P>

            <P>(a) As an employer who receives a verified positive drug test result, you must immediately remove the employee involved from performing safety-sensitive functions. You must take this action upon receiving the initial report of the verified positive test result. Do not wait to receive the written report or the result of a split specimen test.</P>
            <P>(b) As an employer who receives a verified adulterated or substituted drug test result, you must consider this a refusal to test and immediately remove the employee involved from performing safety-sensitive functions. You must take this action on receiving the initial report of the verified adulterated or substituted test result. Do not wait to receive the written report or the result of a split specimen test.</P>
            <P>(c) As an employer who receives an alcohol test result of 0.04 or higher, you must immediately remove the employee involved from performing safety-sensitive functions. If you receive an alcohol test result of 0.02-0.039, you must temporarily remove the employee involved from performing safety-sensitive functions, as provided in applicable DOT agency regulations. Do not wait to receive the written report of the result of the test.</P>

            <P>(d) As an employer, when an employee has a verified positive, adulterated, or substituted test result, or has otherwise violated a DOT agency drug and alcohol regulation, you must not return the employee to the performance of safety-sensitive functions until <PRTPAGE P="560"/>or unless the employee successfully completes the return-to-duty process of Subpart O of this part.</P>
            <P>(e) As an employer who receives a drug test result indicating that the employee's specimen was dilute, take action as provided in § 40.197.</P>
            <P>(f) As an employer who receives a drug test result indicating that the employee's urine specimen test was cancelled because it was invalid and that a second collection must take place under direct observation—</P>
            <P>(1) You must immediately direct the employee to provide a new specimen under direct observation.</P>
            <P>(2) You must not attach consequences to the finding that the test was invalid other than collecting a new specimen under direct observation.</P>
            <P>(3) You must not give any advance notice of this test requirement to the employee.</P>

            <P>(4) You must instruct the collector to note on the CCF the same reason (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> random test, post-accident test) and DOT Agency (e.g., check DOT and FMCSA) as for the original collection.</P>
            <P>(5) You must ensure that the collector conducts the collection under direct observation.</P>

            <P>(g) As an employer who receives a cancelled test result when a negative result is required (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> pre-employment, return-to-duty, or follow-up test), you must direct the employee to provide another specimen immediately.</P>

            <P>(h) As an employer, you may also be required to take additional actions required by DOT agency regulations (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> FAA rules require some positive drug tests to be reported to the Federal Air Surgeon).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Must an employer check on the drug and alcohol testing record of employees it is intending to use to perform safety-sensitive duties?</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Yes, as an employer, you must, after obtaining an employee's written consent, request the information about the employee listed in paragraph (b) of this section. This requirement applies only to employees seeking to begin performing safety-sensitive duties for you for the first time (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a new hire, an employee transfers into a safety-sensitive position). If the employee refuses to provide this written consent, you must not permit the employee to perform safety-sensitive functions.</P>
            <P>(b) You must request the information listed in this paragraph (b) from DOT-regulated employers who have employed the employee during any period during the two years before the date of the employee's application or transfer:</P>
            <P>(1) Alcohol tests with a result of 0.04 or higher alcohol concentration;</P>
            <P>(2) Verified positive drug tests;</P>
            <P>(3) Refusals to be tested (including verified adulterated or substituted drug test results);</P>
            <P>(4) Other violations of DOT agency drug and alcohol testing regulations; and</P>

            <P>(5) With respect to any employee who violated a DOT drug and alcohol regulation, documentation of the employee's successful completion of DOT return-to-duty requirements (including follow-up tests). If the previous employer does not have information about the return-do-duty process (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> an employer who did not hire an employee who tested positive on a pre-employment test), you must seek to obtain this information from the employee.</P>
            <P>(c) The information obtained from a previous employer includes any drug or alcohol test information obtained from previous employers under this section or other applicable DOT agency regulations.</P>
            <P>(d) If feasible, you must obtain and review this information before the employee first performs safety-sensitive functions. If this is not feasible, you must obtain and review the information as soon as possible. However, you must not permit the employee to perform safety-sensitive functions after 30 days from the date on which the employee first performed safety-sensitive functions, unless you have obtained or made and documented a good faith effort to obtain this information.</P>

            <P>(e) If you obtain information that the employee has violated a DOT agency drug and alcohol regulation, you must <PRTPAGE P="561"/>not use the employee to perform safety-sensitive functions unless you also obtain information that the employee has subsequently complied with the return-to-duty requirements of Subpart O of this part and DOT agency drug and alcohol regulations.</P>
            <P>(f) You must provide to each of the employers from whom you request information under paragraph (b) of this section written consent for the release of the information cited in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

            <P>(g) The release of information under this section must be in any written form (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> fax, e-mail, letter) that ensures confidentiality. As the previous employer, you must maintain a written record of the information released, including the date, the party to whom it was released, and a summary of the information provided.</P>
            <P>(h) If you are an employer from whom information is requested under paragraph (b) of this section, you must, after reviewing the employee's specific, written consent, immediately release the requested information to the employer making the inquiry.</P>
            <P>(i) As the employer requesting the information required under this section, you must maintain a written, confidential record of the information you obtain or of the good faith efforts you made to obtain the information. You must retain this information for three years from the date of the employee's first performance of safety-sensitive duties for you.</P>
            <P>(j) As the employer, you must also ask the employee whether he or she has tested positive, or refused to test, on any pre-employment drug or alcohol test administered by an employer to which the employee applied for, but did not obtain, safety-sensitive transportation work covered by DOT agency drug and alcohol testing rules during the past two years. If the employee admits that he or she had a positive test or a refusal to test, you must not use the employee to perform safety-sensitive functions for you, until and unless the employee documents successful completion of the return-to-duty process (see paragraphs (b)(5) and (e) of this section).</P>

            <P>(d) Your collection site must include a facility for urination described in either paragraph (e) or paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) The first, and preferred, type of facility for urination that a collection site may include is a single-toilet room, having a full-length privacy door, within which urination can occur.</P>
            <P>(1) No one but the employee may be present in the room during the collection, except for the observer in the event of a directly observed collection.</P>

            <P>(2) You must have a source of water for washing hands, that, if practicable, should be external to the closed room where urination occurs. If an external source is not available, you may meet this requirement by securing all sources of water and other substances that could be used for adulteration and substitution (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> water faucets, soap dispensers) and providing moist towelettes outside the closed room.</P>
            <P>(f) The second type of facility for urination that a collection site may include is a multistall restroom.</P>

            <P>(1) Such a site must provide substantial visual privacy (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a toilet stall with a partial-length door) and meet all other applicable requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) If you use a multi-stall restroom, you must either—</P>

            <P>(i) Secure all sources of water and other substances that could be used for adulteration and substitution (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> water faucets, soap dispensers) and place bluing agent in all toilets or secure the toilets to prevent access; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Conduct all collections in the facility as monitored collections (see § 40.69 for procedures). This is the only circumstance in which you may conduct a monitored collection.</P>
            <P>(3) No one but the employee may be present in the multistall restroom during the collection, except for the monitor in the event of a monitored collection or the observer in the event of a directly observed collection.</P>

            <P>(b) As a collector, you must do the following before each collection to deter tampering with specimens:</P>

            <P>(1) Secure any water sources or otherwise make them unavailable to employees (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> turn off water inlet, tape handles to prevent opening faucets);</P>
            <P>(2) Ensure that the water in the toilet is blue;</P>
            <P>(3) Ensure that no soap, disinfectants, cleaning agents, or other possible adulterants are present;</P>
            <P>(4) Inspect the site to ensure that no foreign or unauthorized substances are present;</P>
            <P>(5) Tape or otherwise secure shut any movable toilet tank top, or put bluing in the tank;</P>
            <P>(6) Ensure that undetected access (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> through a door not in your view) is not possible;</P>
            <P>(7) Secure areas and items (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> ledges, trash receptacles, paper towel holders, under-sink areas) that appear suitable for concealing contaminants; and</P>

            <P>(8) Recheck items in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section following each collection to ensure the site's continued integrity.<PRTPAGE P="565"/>
            </P>
            <P>(c) If the collection site uses a facility normally used for other purposes, like a public rest room or hospital examining room, you must, as a collector, also ensure before the collection that:</P>
            <P>(1) Access to collection materials and specimens is effectively restricted; and</P>
            <P>(2) The facility is secured against access during the procedure to ensure privacy to the employee and prevent distraction of the collector. Limited-access signs must be posted.</P>
            <P>(d) As a collector, you must take the following additional steps to ensure security during the collection process:</P>
            <P>(1) To avoid distraction that could compromise security, you are limited to conducting a collection for only one employee at a time. However, during the time one employee is in the period for drinking fluids in a “shy bladder” situation (see § 40.193(b)), you may conduct a collection for another employee.</P>
            <P>(2) To the greatest extent you can, keep an employee's collection container within view of both you and the employee between the time the employee has urinated and the specimen is sealed.</P>
            <P>(3) Ensure you are the only person in addition to the employee who handles the specimen before it is poured into the bottles and sealed with tamper-evident seals.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What form is used to document a DOT urine collection?</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form (CCF) must be used to document every urine collection required by the DOT drug testing program. You may view this form on the Department's Web site (<E T="03">http://www.transportation.gov/odapc</E>) or the HHS Web site (<E T="03">http://www.workplace.samhsa.gov</E>).</P>
            <P>(b) You must not use a non-Federal form or an expired CCF to conduct a DOT urine collection. As a laboratory, C/TPA or other party that provides CCFs to employers, collection sites, or other customers, you must not provide copies of an expired CCF to these participants. You must also affirmatively notify these participants that they must not use an expired CCF.</P>
            <P>(c) As a participant in the DOT drug testing program, you are not permitted to modify or revise the CCF except as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) You may include, in the area outside the border of the form, other information needed for billing or other purposes necessary to the collection process.</P>

            <P>(2) The CCF must include the names, addresses, telephone numbers and fax numbers of the employer and the MRO, which may be preprinted, typed, or handwritten. The MRO information must include the specific physician's name and address, as opposed to only a generic clinic, health care organization, or company name. This information is required, and it is prohibited for an employer, collector, service agent or any other party to omit it. In addition, a C/TPA's name, address, fax number, and telephone number may be <PRTPAGE P="566"/>included, but is not required. The employer may use a C/TPA's address in place of its own, but must continue to include its name, telephone number, and fax number.</P>
            <P>(3) As an employer, in Step 1-D of the CCF you may preprint the box for the DOT Agency under whose authority the test will occur.</P>
            <P>(4) As a collector, you may use a CCF with your name, address, telephone number, and fax number preprinted, but under no circumstances may you sign the form before the collection event.</P>
            <P>(5) When using an electronic CCF, you must establish adequate confidentiality and security measures to ensure that confidential employee records are not available to unauthorized persons. This includes protecting the physical security of records, access controls, and computer security measures to safeguard confidential data in electronic form.</P>
            <P>(d) Under no circumstances may the CCF transmit personal identifying information about an employee (other than a social security number (SSN) or other employee identification (ID) number) to a laboratory.</P>
            <P>(e) As an employer, you may use an equivalent foreign-language version of the CCF approved by ODAPC. You may use such a non-English language form only in a situation where both the employee and collector understand and can use the form in that language.</P>
            <P>(f) An employer who uses an electronic CCF must ensure that the collection site, the primary and split laboratories, and MRO have compatible systems, and that the employee and any other program participants in the testing process will receive a legible copy of the CCF.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What are the preliminary steps in the collection process?</SUBJECT>
            <P>As the collector, you must take the following steps before actually beginning a collection:</P>

            <P>(a) When a specific time for an employee's test has been scheduled, or the collection site is at the employee's work site, and the employee does not appear at the collection site at the scheduled time, contact the DER to determine the appropriate interval within which the DER has determined the employee is authorized to arrive. If the employee's arrival is delayed beyond <PRTPAGE P="567"/>that time, you must notify the DER that the employee has not reported for testing. In a situation where a C/TPA has notified an owner/operator or other individual employee to report for testing and the employee does not appear, the C/TPA must notify the employee that he or she has refused to test (see § 40.191(a)(1)).</P>
            <P>(b) Ensure that, when the employee enters the collection site, you begin the testing process without undue delay. For example, you must not wait because the employee says he or she is not ready or is unable to urinate or because an authorized employer or employee representative is delayed in arriving.</P>

            <P>(1) If the employee is also going to take a DOT alcohol test, you must, to the greatest extent practicable, ensure that the alcohol test is completed before the urine collection process begins.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example to paragraph (b)(1):</HD>

              <P>An employee enters the test site for both a drug and an alcohol test. Normally, the collector would wait until the BAT had completed the alcohol test process before beginning the drug test process. However, there are some situations in which an exception to this normal practice would be reasonable. One such situation might be if several people were waiting for the BAT to conduct alcohol tests, but a drug testing collector in the same facility were free. Someone waiting might be able to complete a drug test without unduly delaying his or her alcohol test. Collectors and BATs should work together, however, to ensure that post-accident and reasonable suspicion alcohol tests happen as soon as possible (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> by moving the employee to the head of the line for alcohol tests).</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>(2) If the employee needs medical attention (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> an injured employee in an emergency medical facility who is required to have a post-accident test), do not delay this treatment to collect a specimen.</P>
            <P>(3) You must not collect, by catheterization or other means, urine from an unconscious employee to conduct a drug test under this part. Nor may you catheterize a conscious employee. However, you must inform an employee who normally voids through self-catheterization that the employee is required to provide a specimen in that manner.</P>
            <P>(4) If, as an employee, you normally void through self-catheterization, and decline to do so, this constitutes a refusal to test.</P>

            <P>(c) Require the employee to provide positive identification. You must see a photo ID issued by the employer (other than in the case of an owner-operator or other self-employed individual) or a Federal, state, or local government (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a driver's license). You may not accept faxes or photocopies of identification. Positive identification by an employer representative (not a co-worker or another employee being tested) is also acceptable. If the employee cannot produce positive identification, you must contact a DER to verify the identity of the employee.</P>
            <P>(d) If the employee asks, provide your identification to the employee. Your identification must include your name and your employer's name, but does not have to include your picture, address, or telephone number.</P>
            <P>(e) Explain the basic collection procedure to the employee, including showing the employee the instructions on the back of the CCF.</P>
            <P>(f) Direct the employee to remove outer clothing (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> coveralls, jacket, coat, hat) that could be used to conceal items or substances that could be used to tamper with a specimen. You must also direct the employee to leave these garments and any briefcase, purse, or other personal belongings with you or in a mutually agreeable location. You must advise the employee that failure to comply with your directions constitutes a refusal to test.</P>
            <P>(1) If the employee asks for a receipt for any belongings left with you, you must provide one.</P>
            <P>(2) You must allow the employee to keep his or her wallet.</P>

            <P>(3) You must not ask the employee to remove other clothing (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> shirts, pants, dresses, underwear), to remove all clothing, or to change into a hospital or examination gown (unless the urine collection is being accomplished simultaneously with a DOT agency-authorized medical examination).</P>

            <P>(4) You must direct the employee to empty his or her pockets and display the items in them to ensure that no items are present which could be used to adulterate the specimen. If nothing <PRTPAGE P="568"/>is there that can be used to adulterate a specimen, the employee can place the items back into his or her pockets. As the employee, you must allow the collector to make this observation.</P>
            <P>(5) If, in your duties under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, you find any material that could be used to tamper with a specimen, you must:</P>
            <P>(i) Determine if the material appears to be brought to the collection site with the intent to alter the specimen, and, if it is, conduct a directly observed collection using direct observation procedures (see § 40.67); or</P>

            <P>(ii) Determine if the material appears to be inadvertently brought to the collection site (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> eye drops), secure and maintain it until the collection process is completed and conduct a normal (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> unobserved) collection.</P>
            <P>(g) You must instruct the employee not to list medications that he or she is currently taking on the CCF. (The employee may make notes of medications on the back of the employee copy of the form for his or her own convenience, but these notes must not be transmitted to anyone else.)</P>

            <SUBJECT>What steps does the collector take in the collection process before the employee provides a urine specimen?</SUBJECT>
            <P>As the collector, you must take the following steps before the employee provides the urine specimen:</P>
            <P>(a) Complete Step 1 of the CCF.</P>
            <P>(b) Instruct the employee to wash and dry his or her hands at this time. You must tell the employee not to wash his or her hands again until after delivering the specimen to you. You must not give the employee any further access to water or other materials that could be used to adulterate or dilute a specimen.</P>
            <P>(c) Select, or allow the employee to select, an individually wrapped or sealed collection container from collection kit materials. Either you or the employee, with both of you present, must unwrap or break the seal of the collection container. You must not unwrap or break the seal on any specimen bottle at this time. You must not allow the employee to take anything from the collection kit into the room used for urination except the collection container.</P>
            <P>(d) Direct the employee to go into the room used for urination, provide a specimen of at least 45 mL, not flush the toilet, and return to you with the specimen as soon as the employee has completed the void.</P>
            <P>(1) Except in the case of an observed or a monitored collection (see §§ 40.67 and 40.69), neither you nor anyone else may go into the room with the employee.</P>
            <P>(2) As the collector, you may set a reasonable time limit for voiding.</P>

            <P>(e) You must pay careful attention to the employee during the entire collection process to note any conduct that clearly indicates an attempt to tamper with a specimen (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> substitute urine in plain view or an attempt to bring into the collection site an adulterant or urine substitute). If you detect such conduct, you must require that a collection take place immediately under direct observation (<E T="03">see</E> § 40.67) and complete Step 2 by noting the conduct in the “Remarks” line of the CCF and the fact that the collection was observed by checking the “Observed” box. You must also, as soon as possible, inform the DER and collection site supervisor that a collection took place under direct observation and the reason for doing so.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What does the collector check for when the employee presents a specimen?</SUBJECT>
            <P>As a collector, you must check the following when the employee gives the collection container to you:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Sufficiency of specimen.</E> You must check to ensure that the specimen contains at least 45 mL of urine.</P>
            <P>(1) If it does not, you must follow “shy bladder” procedures (see § 40.193(b)).</P>

            <P>(2) When you follow “shy bladder” procedures, you must discard the original specimen, unless another problem (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> temperature out of range, signs of tampering) also exists.</P>

            <P>(3) You are never permitted to combine urine collected from separate voids to create a specimen.<PRTPAGE P="569"/>
            </P>
            <P>(4) You must discard any excess urine.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Temperature.</E> You must check the temperature of the specimen no later than four minutes after the employee has given you the specimen.</P>
            <P>(1) The acceptable temperature range is 32-38 °C/90-100 °F.</P>
            <P>(2) You must determine the temperature of the specimen by reading the temperature strip attached to the collection container.</P>
            <P>(3) If the specimen temperature is within the acceptable range, you must mark the “Yes” box on the CCF (Step 2).</P>
            <P>(4) If the specimen temperature is outside the acceptable range, you must mark the “No” box and enter in the “Remarks” line (Step 2) your findings about the temperature.</P>
            <P>(5) If the specimen temperature is outside the acceptable range, you must immediately conduct a new collection using direct observation procedures (see § 40.67).</P>
            <P>(6) In a case where a specimen is collected under direct observation because of the temperature being out of range, you must process both the original specimen and the specimen collected using direct observation and send the two sets of specimens to the laboratory. This is true even in a case in which the original specimen has insufficient volume but the temperature is out of range. You must also, as soon as possible, inform the DER and collection site supervisor that a collection took place under direct observation and the reason for doing so.</P>
            <P>(7) In a case where the employee refuses to provide another specimen (see § 40.191(a)(3)) or refuses to provide another specimen under direct observation (see § 40.191(a)(4)), you must notify the DER. As soon as you have notified the DER, you must discard any specimen the employee has provided previously during the collection procedure.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Signs of tampering.</E> You must inspect the specimen for unusual color, presence of foreign objects or material, or other signs of tampering (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> if you notice any unusual odor).</P>

            <P>(1) If it is apparent from this inspection that the employee has tampered with the specimen (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> blue dye in the specimen, excessive foaming when shaken, smell of bleach), you must immediately conduct a new collection using direct observation procedures (see § 40.67).</P>
            <P>(2) In a case where a specimen is collected under direct observation because of showing signs of tampering, you must process both the original specimen and the specimen collected using direct observation and send the two sets of specimens to the laboratory.

            <P>(1) You must mark the “reason for test” block (Step 1) the same as for the first collection.</P>
            <P>(2) You must check the “Observed, (Enter Remark)” box and enter the reason (see § 40.67(b)) in the “Remarks” line (Step 2).</P>

            <P>(f) In a case where two sets of specimens are being sent to the laboratory because of suspected tampering with the specimen at the collection site, enter on the “Remarks” line of the CCF (Step 2) for each specimen a notation to this effect (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> collection 1 of 2, or 2 of 2) and the specimen ID number of the other specimen.</P>

            <P>(b) As the collector, you must ensure that the monitor is the same gender as the employee, unless the monitor is a medical professional (e.g., nurse, doctor, physician's assistant, technologist, or technician licensed or certified to <PRTPAGE P="571"/>practice in the jurisdiction in which the collection takes place). The monitor can be a different person from the collector and need not be a qualified collector.</P>
            <P>(c) As the collector, if someone else is to monitor the collection (e.g., in order to ensure a same-gender monitor), you must verbally instruct that person to follow the procedures of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. If you, the collector, are the monitor, you must follow these procedures.</P>
            <P>(d) As the monitor, you must not watch the employee urinate into the collection container. If you hear sounds or make other observations indicating an attempt to tamper with a specimen, there must be an additional collection under direct observation (see §§ 40.63(e), 40.65(c), and 40.67(b)).</P>
            <P>(e) As the monitor, you must ensure that the employee takes the collection container directly to the collector as soon as the employee has exited the enclosure.</P>
            <P>(f) As the collector, when someone else has acted as the monitor, you must note that person's name in the “Remarks” line of the CCF (Step 2).</P>
            <P>(g) As the employee being tested, if you decline to permit a collection authorized under this section to be monitored, it is a refusal to test.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How does the collector prepare the specimens?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) All collections under DOT agency drug testing regulations must be split specimen collections.</P>
            <P>(b) As the collector, you must take the following steps, in order, after the employee brings the urine specimen to you. You must take these steps in the presence of the employee.</P>
            <P>(1) Check the box on the CCF (Step 2) indicating that this was a split specimen collection.</P>
            <P>(2) You, not the employee, must first pour at least 30 mL of urine from the collection container into one specimen bottle, to be used for the primary specimen.</P>
            <P>(3) You, not the employee, must then pour at least 15 mL of urine from the collection container into the second specimen bottle to be used for the split specimen.</P>
            <P>(4) You, not the employee, must place and secure (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> tighten or snap) the lids/caps on the bottles.</P>
            <P>(5) You, not the employee, must seal the bottles by placing the tamper-evident bottle seals over the bottle caps/lids and down the sides of the bottles.</P>
            <P>(6) You, not the employee, must then write the date on the tamper-evident bottle seals.</P>
            <P>(7) You must then ensure that the employee initials the tamper-evident bottle seals for the purpose of certifying that the bottles contain the specimens he or she provided. If the employee fails or refuses to do so, you must note this in the “Remarks” line of the CCF (Step 2) and complete the collection process.</P>
            <P>(8) You must discard any urine left over in the collection container after both specimen bottles have been appropriately filled and sealed. There is one exception to this requirement: you may use excess urine to conduct clinical tests (e.g., protein, glucose) if the collection was conducted in conjunction with a physical examination required by a DOT agency regulation. Neither you nor anyone else may conduct further testing (such as adulteration testing) on this excess urine and the employee has no legal right to demand that the excess urine be turned over to the employee.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How is the collection process completed?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As the collector, when using the paper CCF, you must do the following things to complete the collection process. You must complete the steps called for in paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section in the employee's presence.</P>

            <P>(1) Direct the employee to read and sign the certification statement on Copy 2 (Step 5) of the CCF and provide date of birth, printed name, and day and evening contact telephone numbers. If the employee refuses to sign the CCF or to provide date of birth, printed name, or telephone numbers, you must note this in the “Remarks” line (Step 2) of the CCF, and complete <PRTPAGE P="572"/>the collection. If the employee refuses to fill out any information, you must, as a minimum, print the employee's name in the appropriate place.</P>
            <P>(2) Complete the chain of custody on the CCF (Step 4) by printing your name (note: you may pre-print your name), recording the time and date of the collection, signing the statement, and entering the name of the delivery service transferring the specimen to the laboratory,</P>
            <P>(3) Ensure that all copies of the CCF are legible and complete.</P>
            <P>(4) Remove Copy 5 of the CCF and give it to the employee.</P>
            <P>(5) Place the specimen bottles and Copy 1 of the CCF in the appropriate pouches of the plastic bag.</P>
            <P>(6) Secure both pouches of the plastic bag.</P>
            <P>(7) Advise the employee that he or she may leave the collection site.</P>
            <P>(8) To prepare the sealed plastic bag containing the specimens and CCF for shipment you must:</P>

            <P>(i) Place the sealed plastic bag in a shipping container (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> standard courier box) designed to minimize the possibility of damage during shipment. (More than one sealed plastic bag can be placed into a single shipping container if you are doing multiple collections.)</P>
            <P>(ii) Seal the container as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(iii) If a laboratory courier hand-delivers the specimens from the collection site to the laboratory, prepare the sealed plastic bag for shipment as directed by the courier service.</P>
            <P>(9) Send Copy 2 of the CCF to the MRO and Copy 4 to the DER. You must fax or otherwise transmit these copies to the MRO and DER within 24 hours or during the next business day. Keep Copy 3 for at least 30 days, unless otherwise specified by applicable DOT agency regulations.</P>
            <P>(b) As a collector, when using other forms of the CCF as approved by the Office of Management and Budget, you must follow the procedures approved for that form.</P>
            <P>(c) As a collector or collection site, you must ensure that each specimen you collect is shipped to a laboratory as quickly as possible, but in any case, within 24 hours or during the next business day.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How do laboratories process incoming specimens?</SUBJECT>
            <P>As the laboratory, you must do the following when you receive a DOT specimen:</P>
            <P>(a) You are authorized to receive only Copy 1 of the CCF. You are not authorized to receive other copies of the CCF or any copies of the alcohol testing form.</P>
            <P>(b) You must comply with applicable provisions of the HHS Guidelines concerning accessioning and processing urine drug specimens.</P>
            <P>(c) You must inspect each specimen and CCF for the following “fatal flaws”:</P>
            <P>(1) There is no CCF;</P>
            <P>(2) In cases where a specimen has been collected, there is no specimen submitted with the CCF;</P>
            <P>(3) There is no printed collector's name and no collector's signature;</P>
            <P>(4) Two separate collections are performed using one CCF;</P>
            <P>(5) The specimen ID numbers on the specimen bottle and the CCF do not match;</P>
            <P>(6) The specimen bottle seal is broken or shows evidence of tampering, unless a split specimen can be redesignated (see paragraph (h) of this section);</P>
            <P>(7) There is an insufficient amount of urine in the primary bottle for analysis, unless the specimens can be redesignated (see paragraph (h) of this section).</P>
            <P>(d) When you find a specimen meeting the criteria of paragraph (c) of this section, you must document your findings and stop the testing process. Report the result in accordance with § 40.97(a)(3) .</P>
            <P>(e) You must inspect each CCF for the presence of the collector's signature on the certification statement in Step 4 of the CCF. Upon finding that the signature is omitted, document the flaw and continue the testing process.</P>
            <P>(1) In such a case, you must retain the specimen for a minimum of 5 business days from the date on which you initiated action to correct the flaw.</P>
            <P>(2) You must then attempt to correct the flaw by following the procedures of § 40.205(b)(1).</P>
            <P>(3) If the flaw is not corrected, report the result as rejected for testing in accordance with § 40.97(a)(3).</P>
            <P>(f) If you determine that the specimen temperature was not checked and the “Remarks” line did not contain an entry regarding the temperature being outside of range, you must then attempt to correct the problem by following the procedures of § 40.208.</P>
            <P>(1) In such a case, you must continue your efforts to correct the problem for five business days, before you report the result.</P>
            <P>(2) When you have obtained the correction, or five business days have elapsed, report the result in accordance with § 40.97(a).</P>
            <P>(g) If you determine that a CCF that fails to meet the requirements of § 40.45(a) (e.g., a non-Federal form or an expired Federal form was used for the collection), you must attempt to correct the use of the improper form by following the procedures of § 40.205(b)(2).</P>
            <P>(1) In such a case, you must retain the specimen for a minimum of 5 business days from the date on which you initiated action to correct the problem.</P>
            <P>(2) If the problem(s) is not corrected, you must reject the test and report the result in accordance with § 40.97(a)(3).</P>
            <P>(h) If the CCF is marked indicating that a split specimen collection was collected and if the split specimen does not accompany the primary, has leaked, or is otherwise unavailable for testing, you must still test the primary specimen and follow appropriate procedures outlined in § 40.175(b) regarding the unavailability of the split specimen for testing.</P>

            <P>(1) The primary specimen and the split specimen can be redesignated (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> Bottle B is redesignated as Bottle A, and vice-versa) if:</P>
            <P>(i) The primary specimen appears to have leaked out of its sealed bottle and the laboratory believes a sufficient amount of urine exists in the split specimen to conduct all appropriate primary laboratory testing; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The primary specimen is labeled as Bottle B, and the split specimen as Bottle A; or</P>

            <P>(iii) The laboratory opens the split specimen instead of the primary specimen, the primary specimen remains sealed, and the laboratory believes a sufficient amount of urine exists in the <PRTPAGE P="574"/>split specimen to conduct all appropriate primary laboratory testing; or</P>
            <P>(iv) The primary specimen seal is broken but the split specimen remains sealed and the laboratory believes a sufficient amount of urine exists in the split specimen to conduct all appropriate primary laboratory testing.</P>

            <P>As an MRO, you have the following basic responsibilities:</P>
            <P>(a) Acting as an independent and impartial “gatekeeper” and advocate for the accuracy and integrity of the drug testing process.</P>
            <P>(b) Providing a quality assurance review of the drug testing process for the specimens under your purview. This includes, but is not limited to:</P>
            <P>(1) Ensuring the review of the CCF on all specimen collections for the purposes of determining whether there is a problem that may cause a test to be cancelled (see §§ 40.199-40.203). As an MRO, you are not required to review laboratory internal chain of custody documentation. No one is permitted to cancel a test because you have not reviewed this documentation;</P>
            <P>(2) Providing feedback to employers, collection sites and laboratories regarding performance issues where necessary; and</P>
            <P>(3) Reporting to and consulting with the ODAPC or a relevant DOT agency when you wish DOT assistance in resolving any program issue. As an employer or service agent, you are prohibited from limiting or attempting to limit the MRO's access to DOT for this purpose and from retaliating in any way against an MRO for discussing drug testing issues with DOT.</P>
            <P>(c) You must determine whether there is a legitimate medical explanation for confirmed positive, adulterated, substituted, and invalid drug tests results from the laboratory.</P>
            <P>(d) While you provide medical review of employees' test results, this part does not deem that you have established a doctor-patient relationship with the employees whose tests you review.</P>

            <P>(e) You must act to investigate and correct problems where possible and notify appropriate parties (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> HHS, DOT, employers, service agents) where assistance is needed, (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> cancelled or problematic tests, incorrect results).</P>
            <P>(f) You must ensure the timely flow of test results and other information to employers.</P>
            <P>(g) You must protect the confidentiality of the drug testing information.</P>
            <P>(h) You must perform all your functions in compliance with this part and other DOT agency regulations.</P>

            <P>(a) As the MRO, you must do the following with respect to confirmed positive, adulterated, substituted, or invalid drug tests you receive from a laboratory, before you verify the result and release it to the DER:</P>
            <P>(1) Review Copy 2 of the CCF to determine if there are any fatal or correctable errors that may require you to cancel the test (see §§ 40.199 and 40.203). Staff under your direct, personal supervision may conduct this administrative review for you, but only you may verify or cancel a test.</P>

            <P>(2) Review Copy 1 of the CCF and ensure that it is consistent with the information contained on Copy 2, that the test result is legible, and that the certifying scientist signed the form. You are not required to review any other documentation generated by the laboratory during their analysis or handling of the specimen (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the laboratory internal chain of custody).</P>
            <P>(3) If the copy of the documentation provided to you by the collector or laboratory appears unclear, you must request that the collector or laboratory send you a legible copy.</P>
            <P>(4) Except in the circumstances spelled out in § 40.133 , conduct a verification interview. This interview must include direct contact in person or by telephone between you and the employee. You may initiate the verification process based on the laboratory results report.</P>
            <P>(5) Verify the test result, consistent with the requirements of §§ 40.135 through 40.145, 40.159, and 40.160, as:</P>
            <P>(i) Negative; or</P>

            <P>(2) A legible copy (fax, photocopy, image) of Copy 1 of the CCF, containing the certifying scientist's signature.</P>
            <P>(c) With respect to verified positive test results, place a checkmark in the “Positive” box in Step 6 on Copy 2 of the CCF, indicate the drug(s)/metabolite(s) verified positive, and sign and date the verification statement.</P>
            <P>(d) If you cancel a laboratory confirmed positive, adulterated, substituted, or invalid drug test report, check the “test cancelled” box (Step 6) on Copy 2 of the CCF, make appropriate annotation in the “Remarks” line, sign, provide your name, and date the verification statement.</P>
            <P>(e) Report the result in a confidential manner (see §§ 40.163-40.167).</P>
            <P>(f) With respect to adulteration or substitution test results, check the “refusal to test because:” box (Step 6) on Copy 2 of the CCF, check the “Adulterated” or “Substituted” box, as appropriate, make appropriate annotation in the “Remarks” line, sign and date the verification statement.</P>
            <P>(g) As the MRO, your actions concerning reporting confirmed positive, adulterated, or substituted results to the employer before you have completed the verification process are also governed by the stand-down provisions of § 40.21 .</P>

            <P>(1) If an employer has a stand-down policy that meets the requirements of § 40.21 , you may report to the DER that you have received an employee's laboratory confirmed positive, adulterated, or substituted test result, consistent with the terms of the waiver the employer received. You must not provide any further details about the test result (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the name of the drug involved).</P>
            <P>(2) If the employer does not have a stand-down policy that meets the requirements of § 40.21, you must not inform the employer that you have received an employee's laboratory confirmed positive, adulterated, or substituted test result until you verify the test result. For example, as an MRO employed directly by a company, you must not tell anyone on the company's staff or management that you have received an employee's laboratory confirmed test result.</P>

            <P>(a) When, as the MRO, you receive a confirmed positive, adulterated, substituted, or invalid test result from the laboratory, you must contact the employee directly (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> actually talk to the employee), on a confidential basis, to determine whether the employee wants to discuss the test result. In making this contact, you must explain to the employee that, if he or she declines to discuss the result, you will verify the test as positive or as a refusal to test because of adulteration or substitution, as applicable.</P>
            <P>(b) As the MRO, staff under your personal supervision may conduct this initial contact for you.</P>

            <P>(1) This staff contact must be limited to scheduling the discussion between you and the employee and explaining the consequences of the employee's declining to speak with you (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> that the MRO will verify the test without input from the employee). If the employee declines to speak with you, the staff person must document the employee's decision, including the date and time.</P>
            <P>(2) A staff person must not gather any medical information or information concerning possible explanations for the test result.</P>

            <P>(3) A staff person may advise an employee to have medical information (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> prescriptions, information forming the basis of a legitimate medical explanation for a confirmed positive test result) ready to present at the interview with the MRO.</P>

            <P>(4) Since you are required to speak personally with the employee, face-to-face or on the phone, your staff must not inquire if the employee wishes to speak with you.<PRTPAGE P="583"/>
            </P>
            <P>(c) As the MRO, you or your staff must make reasonable efforts to reach the employee at the day and evening telephone numbers listed on the CCF. Reasonable efforts include, as a minimum, three attempts, spaced reasonably over a 24-hour period, to reach the employee at the day and evening telephone numbers listed on the CCF. If you or your staff cannot reach the employee directly after making these efforts, you or your staff must take the following steps:</P>

            <P>(1) Document the efforts you made to contact the employee, including dates and times. If both phone numbers are incorrect (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> disconnected, wrong number), you may take the actions listed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section without waiting the full 24-hour period.</P>
            <P>(2) Contact the DER, instructing the DER to contact the employee.</P>
            <P>(i) You must simply direct the DER to inform the employee to contact you.</P>
            <P>(ii) You must not inform the DER that the employee has a confirmed positive, adulterated, substituted, or invalid test result.</P>
            <P>(iii) You must document the dates and times of your attempts to contact the DER, and you must document the name of the DER you contacted and the date and time of the contact.</P>
            <P>(d) As the DER, you must attempt to contact the employee immediately, using procedures that protect, as much as possible, the confidentiality of the MRO's request that the employee contact the MRO. If you successfully contact the employee (i.e., actually talk to the employee), you must document the date and time of the contact, and inform the MRO. You must inform the employee that he or she should contact the MRO immediately. You must also inform the employee of the consequences of failing to contact the MRO within the next 72 hours (see § 40.133(a)(2)).</P>
            <P>(1) As the DER, you must not inform anyone else working for the employer that you are seeking to contact the employee on behalf of the MRO.</P>
            <P>(2) If, as the DER, you have made all reasonable efforts to contact the employee but failed to do so, you may place the employee on temporary medically unqualified status or medical leave. Reasonable efforts include, as a minimum, three attempts, spaced reasonably over a 24-hour period, to reach the employee at the day and evening telephone numbers listed on the CCF.</P>
            <P>(i) As the DER, you must document the dates and times of these efforts.</P>

            <P>(ii) If, as the DER, you are unable to contact the employee within this 24-hour period, you must leave a message for the employee by any practicable means (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> voice mail, e-mail, letter) to contact the MRO and inform the MRO of the date and time of this attempted contact.</P>

            <P>(a) As the MRO, you normally may verify a confirmed positive test (for any drug or drug metabolite, including opiates), or as a refusal to test because of adulteration or substitution, only after interviewing the employee as provided in §§ 40.135-40.145 . However, there are three circumstances in which you may verify such a result without an interview:</P>
            <P>(1) You may verify a test result as a positive or refusal to test, as applicable, if the employee expressly declines the opportunity to discuss the test with you. You must maintain complete documentation of this occurrence, including notation of informing, or attempting to inform, the employee of the consequences of not exercising the option to speak with the you.</P>
            <P>(2) You may verify a test result as a positive or refusal to test, as applicable, if the DER has successfully made and documented a contact with the employee and instructed the employee to contact you and more than 72 hours have passed since the time the DER contacted the employee.</P>

            <P>(3) You may verify a test result as a positive or refusal to test, as applicable, if neither you nor the DER, after making and documenting all reasonable efforts, has been able to contact the employee within ten days of the date on which the MRO receives the <PRTPAGE P="584"/>confirmed test result from the laboratory.</P>
            <P>(b) As the MRO, you may verify an invalid test result as cancelled (with instructions to recollect immediately under direct observation) without interviewing the employee, as provided at § 40.159:</P>
            <P>(1) If the employee expressly declines the opportunity to discuss the test with you;</P>
            <P>(2) If the DER has successfully made and documented a contact with the employee and instructed the employee to contact you and more than 72 hours have passed since the time the DER contacted the employee; or</P>
            <P>(3) If neither you nor the DER, after making and documenting all reasonable efforts, has been able to contact the employee within ten days of the date on which you received the confirmed invalid test result from the laboratory.</P>
            <P>(c) As the MRO, after you verify a test result as a positive or as a refusal to test under this section, you must document the date and time and reason, following the instructions in § 40.163. For a cancelled test due to an invalid result under this section, you must follow the instructions in § 40.159(a)(5).</P>
            <P>(d) As the MRO, after you have verified a test result under this section and reported the result to the DER, you must allow the employee to present information to you within 60 days of the verification to document that serious illness, injury, or other circumstances unavoidably precluded contact with the MRO and/or DER in the times provided. On the basis of such information, you may reopen the verification, allowing the employee to present information concerning whether there is a legitimate medical explanation of the confirmed test result.</P>

            <P>(a) As the MRO, you must tell the employee that the laboratory has determined that the employee's test result was positive, adulterated, substituted, or invalid, as applicable. You must also tell the employee of the drugs for which his or her specimen tested positive, or the basis for the finding of adulteration or substitution.</P>
            <P>(b) You must explain the verification interview process to the employee and inform the employee that your decision will be based on information the employee provides in the interview.</P>
            <P>(c) You must explain that, if further medical evaluation is needed for the verification process, the employee must comply with your request for this evaluation and that failure to do so is equivalent of expressly declining to discuss the test result.</P>
            <P>(d) As the MRO, you must warn an employee who has a confirmed positive, adulterated, substituted or invalid test that you are required to provide to third parties drug test result information and medical information affecting the performance of safety-sensitive duties that the employee gives you in the verification process without the employee's consent (see § 40.327).</P>
            <P>(1) You must give this warning to the employee before obtaining any medical information as part of the verification process.</P>
            <P>(2) For purposes of this paragraph (d), medical information includes information on medications or other substances affecting the performance of safety-sensitive duties that the employee reports using or medical conditions the employee reports having.</P>

            <P>(3) For purposes of this paragraph (d), the persons to whom this information may be provided include the employer, a SAP evaluating the employee as part of the return to duty process (see § 40.293(g)), DOT, another Federal safety agency (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the NTSB), or any state safety agency as required by state law.</P>

            <P>(e) You must also advise the employee that, before informing any third party about any medication the employee is using pursuant to a legally valid prescription consistent with the Controlled Substances Act, you will allow 5 business days from the date you report the verified negative result for the employee to have the prescribing physician contact you to determine if the medication can be changed to one <PRTPAGE P="585"/>that does not make the employee medically unqualified or does not pose a significant safety risk. If, in your reasonable medical judgment, a medical qualification issue or a significant safety risk remains after you communicate with the employee's prescribing physician or after 5 business days, whichever is shorter, you must follow § 40.327. If, as the MRO, you receive information that eliminates the medical qualification issue or significant safety risk, you must transmit this information to any third party to whom you previously provided information under § 40.327.</P>

In determining whether an employee's legally valid prescription consistent with the Controlled Substances Act for a substance in these categories constitutes a legitimate medical explanation, you must not question whether the prescribing physician should have prescribed the substance.</P>
            <P>(b) You must offer the employee an opportunity to present a legitimate medical explanation in all cases.</P>
            <P>(c) The employee has the burden of proof that a legitimate medical explanation exists. The employee must present information meeting this burden at the time of the verification interview. As the MRO, you have discretion to extend the time available to the employee for this purpose for up to five days before verifying the test result, if you determine that there is a reasonable basis to believe that the employee will be able to produce relevant evidence concerning a legitimate medical explanation within that time.</P>
            <P>(d) If you determine that there is a legitimate medical explanation, you must verify the test result as negative. Otherwise, you must verify the test result as positive.</P>
            <P>(e) In determining whether a legitimate medical explanation exists, you may consider the employee's use of a medication from a foreign country. You must exercise your professional judgment consistently with the following principles:</P>
            <P>(1) There can be a legitimate medical explanation only with respect to a substance that is obtained legally in a foreign country.</P>

            <P>(2) There can be a legitimate medical explanation only with respect to a substance that has a legitimate medical use. Use of a drug of abuse (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> heroin, PCP, marijuana) or any other substance (see § 40.151(f) and (g)) that cannot be viewed as having a legitimate medical use can never be the basis for a legitimate medical explanation, even if the substance is obtained legally in a foreign country.</P>
            <P>(3) Use of the substance can form the basis of a legitimate medical explanation only if it is used consistently with its proper and intended medical purpose.</P>
            <P>(4) Even if you find that there is a legitimate medical explanation under this paragraph (e) and verify a test negative, you may have a responsibility to raise fitness-for-duty considerations with the employer (see § 40.327).</P>

            <P>(a) If the laboratory confirms the presence of 6-acetylmorphine (6-AM) in the specimen, you must verify the test result positive.</P>

            <P>(b) In the absence of 6-AM, if the laboratory confirms the presence of either morphine or codeine at 15,000 ng/mL or above, you must verify the test result positive unless the employee presents a legitimate medical explanation for the <PRTPAGE P="586"/>presence of the drug or drug metabolite in his or her system, as in the case of other drugs (see § 40.137). Consumption of food products (e.g., poppy seeds) must not be considered a legitimate medical explanation for the employee having morphine or codeine at these concentrations.</P>

            <P>(c) For all other codeine and morphine positive results, you must verify a confirmed positive test result only if you determine that there is clinical evidence, in addition to the urine test, of unauthorized use of any opium, opiate, or opium derivative (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> morphine, codeine, or heroin).</P>
            <P>(1) As an MRO, it is your responsibility to use your best professional and ethical judgement and discretion to determine whether there is clinical evidence of unauthorized use of opiates. Examples of information that you may consider in making this judgement include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Recent needle tracks;</P>
            <P>(ii) Behavioral and psychological signs of acute opiate intoxication or withdrawal;</P>
            <P>(iii) Clinical history of unauthorized use recent enough to have produced the laboratory test result;</P>
            <P>(iv) Use of a medication from a foreign country. See § 40.137(e) for guidance on how to make this determination.</P>
            <P>(2) In order to establish the clinical evidence referenced in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, personal observation of the employee is essential.</P>
            <P>(i) Therefore, you, as the MRO, must conduct, or cause another physician to conduct, a face-to-face examination of the employee.</P>
            <P>(ii) No face-to-face examination is needed in establishing the clinical evidence referenced in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) or (iv) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) To be the basis of a verified positive result for codeine or morphine, the clinical evidence you find must concern a drug that the laboratory found in the specimen. (For example, if the test confirmed the presence of codeine, and the employee admits to unauthorized use of hydrocodone, you must not verify the test positive for codeine. The admission must be for the substance that was found through the actual drug test.)</P>
            <P>(4) As the MRO, you have the burden of establishing that there is clinical evidence of unauthorized use of opiates referenced in this paragraph (c). If you cannot make this determination (e.g., there is not sufficient clinical evidence or history), you must verify the test as negative. The employee does not need to show you that a legitimate medical explanation exists if no clinical evidence is established.</P>

            <P>As the MRO, you must do the following as you make the determinations needed for a verification decision:</P>
            <P>(a) You must conduct a medical interview. You must review the employee's medical history and any other relevant biomedical factors presented to you by the employee. You may direct the employee to undergo further medical evaluation by you or another physician.</P>

            <P>(b) If the employee asserts that the presence of a drug or drug metabolite in his or her specimen results from taking prescription medication (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a legally valid prescription consistent with the Controlled Substances Act), you must review and take all reasonable and necessary steps to verify the authenticity of all medical records the employee provides. You may contact the employee's physician or other relevant medical personnel for further information. You may request an HHS-certified laboratory with validated protocols (see § 40.81(c)) to conduct testing for D,L stereoisomers of amphetamine and methamphetamine or testing for tetrahydrocannabivarin (THC- V) when verifying lab results, as you determine necessary.</P>

            <SUBJECT>On what basis does the MRO verify test results involving adulteration or substitution?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As an MRO, when you receive a laboratory report that a specimen is adulterated or substituted, you must treat that report in the same way you treat the laboratory's report of a confirmed positive for a drug or drug metabolite.</P>
            <P>(b) You must follow the same procedures used for verification of a confirmed positive test for a drug or drug metabolite (see §§ 40.129-40.135, 40.141, 40.151), except as otherwise provided in this section.</P>
            <P>(c) In the verification interview, you must explain the laboratory findings to the employee and address technical questions or issues the employee may raise.</P>
            <P>(d) You must offer the employee the opportunity to present a legitimate medical explanation for the laboratory findings with respect to presence of the adulterant in, or the creatinine and specific gravity findings for, the specimen.</P>
            <P>(e) The employee has the burden of proof that there is a legitimate medical explanation.</P>
            <P>(1) To meet this burden in the case of an adulterated specimen, the employee must demonstrate that the adulterant found by the laboratory entered the specimen through physiological means.</P>
            <P>(2) To meet this burden in the case of a substituted specimen, the employee must demonstrate that he or she did produce or could have produced urine through physiological means, meeting the creatinine concentration criterion of less than 2 mg/dL and the specific gravity criteria of less than or equal to 1.0010 or greater than or equal to 1.0200 (see § 40.93(b)).</P>
            <P>(3) The employee must present information meeting this burden at the time of the verification interview. As the MRO, you have discretion to extend the time available to the employee for this purpose for up to five days before verifying the specimen, if you determine that there is a reasonable basis to believe that the employee will be able to produce relevant evidence supporting a legitimate medical explanation within that time.</P>
            <P>(f) As the MRO or the employer, you are not responsible for arranging, conducting, or paying for any studies, examinations or analyses to determine whether a legitimate medical explanation exists.</P>
            <P>(g) As the MRO, you must exercise your best professional judgment in deciding whether the employee has established a legitimate medical explanation.</P>
            <P>(1) If you determine that the employee's explanation does not present a reasonable basis for concluding that there may be a legitimate medical explanation, you must report the test to the DER as a verified refusal to test because of adulteration or substitution, as applicable.</P>
            <P>(2) If you believe that the employee's explanation may present a reasonable basis for concluding that there is a legitimate medical explanation, you must direct the employee to obtain, within the five-day period set forth in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, a further medical evaluation. This evaluation must be performed by a licensed physician (the “referral physician”), acceptable to you, with expertise in the medical issues raised by the employee's explanation. (The MRO may perform this evaluation if the MRO has appropriate expertise.)</P>
            <P>(i) As the MRO or employer, you are not responsible for finding or paying a referral physician. However, on request of the employee, you must provide reasonable assistance to the employee's efforts to find such a physician. The final choice of the referral physician is the employee's, as long as the physician is acceptable to you.</P>
            <P>(ii) As the MRO, you must consult with the referral physician, providing guidance to him or her concerning his or her responsibilities under this section. As part of this consultation, you must provide the following information to the referral physician:</P>

            <P>(A) That the employee was required to take a DOT drug test, but the laboratory reported that the specimen was adulterated or substituted, which is treated as a refusal to test;<PRTPAGE P="588"/>
            </P>
            <P>(B) The consequences of the appropriate DOT agency regulation for refusing to take the required drug test;</P>
            <P>(C) That the referral physician must agree to follow the requirements of paragraphs (g)(3) through (g)(4) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(D) That the referral physician must provide you with a signed statement of his or her recommendations.</P>
            <P>(3) As the referral physician, you must evaluate the employee and consider any evidence the employee presents concerning the employee's medical explanation. You may conduct additional tests to determine whether there is a legitimate medical explanation. Any additional urine tests must be performed in an HHS-certified laboratory.</P>
            <P>(4) As the referral physician, you must then make a written recommendation to the MRO about whether the MRO should determine that there is a legitimate medical explanation. As the MRO, you must seriously consider and assess the referral physician's recommendation in deciding whether there is a legitimate medical explanation.</P>

            <P>(5) As the MRO, if you determine that there is a legitimate medical explanation, you must cancel the test and inform ODAPC in writing of the determination and the basis for it (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> referral physician's findings, evidence produced by the employee).</P>
            <P>(6) As the MRO, if you determine that there is not a legitimate medical explanation, you must report the test to the DER as a verified refusal to test because of adulteration or substitution.</P>
            <P>(h) The following are examples of types of evidence an employee could present to support an assertion of a legitimate medical explanation for a substituted result.</P>
            <P>(1) Medically valid evidence demonstrating that the employee is capable of physiologically producing urine meeting the creatinine and specific gravity criteria of § 40.93(b).</P>
            <P>(i) To be regarded as medically valid, the evidence must have been gathered using appropriate methodology and controls to ensure its accuracy and reliability.</P>

            <P>(ii) Assertion by the employee that his or her personal characteristics (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> with respect to race, gender, weight, diet, working conditions) are responsible for the substituted result does not, in itself, constitute a legitimate medical explanation. To make a case that there is a legitimate medical explanation, the employee must present evidence showing that the cited personal characteristics actually result in the physiological production of urine meeting the creatinine and specific gravity criteria of § 40.93(b).</P>
            <P>(2) Information from a medical evaluation under paragraph (g) of this section that the individual has a medical condition that has been demonstrated to cause the employee to physiologically produce urine meeting the creatinine and specific gravity criteria of § 40.93(b).</P>
            <P>(i) A finding or diagnosis by the physician that an employee has a medical condition, in itself, does not constitute a legitimate medical explanation.</P>
            <P>(ii) To establish there is a legitimate medical explanation, the employee must demonstrate that the cited medical condition actually results in the physiological production of urine meeting the creatinine and specific gravity criteria of § 40.93(b).</P>

            <P>(a) As the MRO, you may change a verified test result only in the following situations:</P>
            <P>(1) When you have reopened a verification that was done without an interview with an employee (see § 40.133(d)).</P>

            <P>(2) If you receive information, not available to you at the time of the original verification, demonstrating that the laboratory made an error in identifying (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a paperwork mistake) or testing (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a false positive or negative) the employee's primary or split specimen. For example, suppose the laboratory originally reported a positive test result for Employee X and a negative result for Employee Y. You <PRTPAGE P="589"/>verified the test results as reported to you. Then the laboratory notifies you that it mixed up the two test results, and X was really negative and Y was really positive. You would change X's test result from positive to negative and contact Y to conduct a verification interview.</P>
            <P>(3) If, within 60 days of the original verification decision—</P>
            <P>(i) You receive information that could not reasonably have been provided to you at the time of the decision demonstrating that there is a legitimate medical explanation for the presence of drug(s)/metabolite(s) in the employee's specimen; or</P>

            <P>(ii) You receive credible new or additional evidence that a legitimate medical explanation for an adulterated or substituted result exists.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example to paragraph (a)(3):</HD>
              <P>If the employee's physician provides you a valid prescription that he or she failed to find at the time of the original verification, you may change the test result from positive to negative if you conclude that the prescription provides a legitimate medical explanation for the drug(s)/ metabolite(s) in the employee's specimen.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>(4) If you receive the information in paragraph (a)(3) of this section after the 60-day period, you must consult with ODAPC prior to changing the result.</P>
            <P>(5) When you have made an administrative error and reported an incorrect result.</P>
            <P>(b) If you change the result, you must immediately notify the DER in writing, as provided in §§ 40.163-40.165.</P>
            <P>(c) You are the only person permitted to change a verified test result, such as a verified positive test result or a determination that an individual has refused to test because of adulteration or substitution. This is because, as the MRO, you have the sole authority under this part to make medical determinations leading to a verified test (e.g., a determination that there was or was not a legitimate medical explanation for a laboratory test result). For example, an arbitrator is not permitted to overturn the medical judgment of the MRO that the employee failed to present a legitimate medical explanation for a positive, adulterated, or substituted test result of his or her specimen.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What are MROs prohibited from doing as part of the verification process?</SUBJECT>
            <P>As an MRO, you are prohibited from doing the following as part of the verification process:</P>

            <P>(a) You must not consider any evidence from tests of urine samples or other body fluids or tissues (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> blood or hair samples) that are not collected or tested in accordance with this part. For example, if an employee tells you he went to his own physician, provided a urine specimen, sent it to a laboratory, and received a negative test result or a DNA test result questioning the identity of his DOT specimen, you are required to ignore this test result.</P>
            <P>(b) It is not your function to make decisions about factual disputes between the employee and the collector concerning matters occurring at the collection site that are not reflected on the CCF (e.g., concerning allegations that the collector left the area or left open urine containers where other people could access them).</P>
            <P>(c) It is not your function to determine whether the employer should have directed that a test occur. For example, if an employee tells you that the employer misidentified her as the subject of a random test, or directed her to take a reasonable suspicion or post-accident test without proper grounds under a DOT agency drug or alcohol regulation, you must inform the employee that you cannot play a role in deciding these issues.</P>

            <P>(d) It is not your function to consider explanations of confirmed positive, adulterated, or substituted test results that would not, even if true, constitute a legitimate medical explanation. For example, an employee may tell you that someone slipped amphetamines into her drink at a party, that she unknowingly ingested a marijuana brownie, or that she traveled in a closed car with several people smoking crack. MROs are unlikely to be able to verify the facts of such passive or unknowing ingestion stories. Even if true, <PRTPAGE P="590"/>such stories do not present a legitimate medical explanation. Consequently, you must not declare a test as negative based on an explanation of this kind.</P>

            <P>(e) You must not verify a test negative based on information that a physician recommended that the employee use a drug listed in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> under a state law that purports to authorize such recommendations, such as the “medical marijuana” laws that some states have adopted).</P>
            <P>(f) You must not accept an assertion of consumption or other use of a hemp or other non-prescription marijuana-related product as a basis for verifying a marijuana test negative. You also must not accept such an explanation related to consumption of coca teas as a basis for verifying a cocaine test result as negative. Consuming or using such a product is not a legitimate medical explanation.</P>
            <P>(g) You must not accept an assertion that there is a legitimate medical explanation for the presence of PCP, 6-AM, MDMA, MDA, or MDEA in a specimen.</P>
            <P>(h) You must not accept, as a legitimate medical explanation for an adulterated specimen, an assertion that soap, bleach, or glutaraldehyde entered a specimen through physiological means. There are no physiological means through which these substances can enter a specimen.</P>
            <P>(i) You must not accept, as a legitimate medical explanation for a substituted specimen, an assertion that an employee can produce urine with no detectable creatinine. There are no physiological means through which a person can produce a urine specimen having this characteristic.</P>

You must also notify the employee of the procedures for requesting a test of the split specimen.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What does the MRO do when a drug test result is invalid?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As the MRO, when the laboratory reports that the test result is an invalid result, you must do the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Discuss the laboratory results with a certifying scientist to determine if the primary specimen should be tested at another HHS certified laboratory. If the laboratory did not contact you as required by §§ 40.91(e) and 40.96(c), you must contact the laboratory.</P>
            <P>(2) If you and the laboratory have determined that no further testing is necessary, contact the employee and inform the employee that the specimen was invalid. In contacting the employee, use the procedures set forth in § 40.131.</P>
            <P>(3) After explaining the limits of disclosure (see §§ 40.135(d) and 40.327), you must determine if the employee has a medical explanation for the invalid result. You must inquire about the medications the employee may have taken.</P>
            <P>(4) If the employee gives an explanation that is acceptable, you must:</P>
            <P>(i) Place a check mark in the “Test Cancelled” box (Step 6) on Copy 2 of the CCF and enter “Invalid Result” and “direct observation collection not required” on the “Remarks” line.</P>

            <P>(ii) Report to the DER that the test is cancelled, the reason for cancellation, and that no further action is required unless a negative test result is required (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> pre-employment, return-to-duty, or follow-up tests).</P>
            <P>(iii) If a negative test result is required and the medical explanation concerns a situation in which the employee has a permanent or long-term medical condition that precludes him or her from providing a valid specimen, as the MRO, you must follow the procedures outlined at § 40.160 for determining if there is clinical evidence that the individual is an illicit drug user.</P>
            <P>(5) If the employee is unable to provide an explanation and/or a valid prescription for a medication that interfered with the immunoassay test but denies having adulterated the specimen, you must:</P>
            <P>(i) Place a check mark in the “Test Cancelled” box (Step 6) on Copy 2 of the CCF and enter “Invalid Result” and “direct observation collection required” on the “Remarks” line.</P>
            <P>(ii) Report to the DER that the test is cancelled, the reason for cancellation, and that a second collection must take place immediately under direct observation.</P>
            <P>(iii) Instruct the employer to ensure that the employee has the minimum possible advance notice that he or she must go to the collection site.</P>
            <P>(6) When the test result is invalid because pH is greater than or equal to 9.0 but less than or equal to 9.5 and the employee has no other medical explanation for the pH, you should consider whether there is evidence of elapsed time and increased temperature that could account for the pH value.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What does the MRO do when a valid test result cannot be produced and a negative result is required?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If a valid test result cannot be produced and a negative result is required, (under § 40.159 (a)(5)(iii) and (e)(4)), as the MRO, you must determine if there is clinical evidence that the individual is currently an illicit drug user. You must make this determination by personally conducting, or causing to be conducted, a medical evaluation. In addition, if appropriate, you may also consult with the employee's physician to gather information you need to reach this determination.</P>
            <P>(b) If you do not personally conduct the medical evaluation, as the MRO, you must ensure that one is conducted by a licensed physician acceptable to you.</P>

            <P>(c) For purposes of this section, the MRO or the physician conducting the evaluation may conduct an alternative <PRTPAGE P="593"/>test (e.g., blood) as part of the medically appropriate procedures in determining clinical evidence of drug use.</P>
            <P>(d) If the medical evaluation reveals no clinical evidence of drug use, as the MRO, you must report this to the employer as a negative test result with written notations regarding the medical examination. The report must also state why the medical examination was required (i.e., either the basis for the determination that a permanent or long-term medical condition exists or because the recollection under direct observation resulted in another invalid result for the same reason, as appropriate) and for the determination that no signs and symptoms of drug use exist.</P>
            <P>(1) Check “Negative” (Step 6) on the CCF.</P>
            <P>(2) Sign and date the CCF.</P>
            <P>(e) If the medical evaluation reveals clinical evidence of drug use, as the MRO, you must report the result to the employer as a cancelled test with written notations regarding the results of the medical examination. The report must also state why the medical examination was required (i.e., either the basis for the determination that a permanent or long-term medical condition exists or because the recollection under direct observation resulted in another invalid result for the same reason, as appropriate) and state the reason for the determination that signs and symptoms of drug use exist. Because this is a cancelled test, it does not serve the purpose of an actual negative test result (i.e., the employer is not authorized to allow the employee to begin or resume performing safety-sensitive functions, because a negative test result is needed for that purpose).</P>

            <P>As the MRO, when the laboratory reports that the specimen is rejected for testing (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> because of a fatal or uncorrected flaw), you must do the following:</P>
            <P>(a) Place a check mark in the “Test Cancelled” box (Step 6) on Copy 2 of the CCF and enter the reason on the “Remarks” line.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What must MROs do with multiple verified results for the same testing event?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If the testing event is one in which there was one specimen collection with multiple verified non-negative results, as the MRO, you must report them all to the DER. For example, if you verified the specimen as being positive for marijuana and cocaine and as being a refusal to test because the specimen was also adulterated, as the MRO, you should report the positives and the refusal to the DER.</P>
            <P>(b) If the testing event was one in which two separate specimen collections (e.g., a specimen out of temperature range and the subsequent observed collection) were sent to the laboratory, as the MRO, you must:</P>
            <P>(1) If both specimens were verified negative, report the result as negative.</P>
            <P>(2) If either of the specimens was verified negative and the other was verified as one or more non-negative(s), report the non-negative result(s) only. For example, if you verified one specimen as negative and the other as a refusal to test because the second specimen was substituted, as the MRO you should report only the refusal to the DER.</P>
            <P>(i) If the first specimen is reported as negative, but the result of the second specimen has not been reported by the laboratory, as the MRO, you should hold—not report—the result of the first specimen until the result of the second specimen is received.</P>

            <P>(ii) If the first specimen is reported as non-negative, as the MRO, you should report the result immediately <PRTPAGE P="594"/>and not wait to receive the result of the second specimen.</P>
            <P>(3) If both specimens were verified non-negative, report all of the non-negative results. For example, if you verified one specimen as positive and the other as a refusal to test because the specimen was adulterated, as the MRO, you should report the positive and the refusal results to the DER.</P>

            <P>(e) You must retain a signed or stamped and dated copy of Copy 2 of the CCF in your records. If you do not use Copy 2 for reporting results, you must maintain a copy of the signed or stamped and dated letter in addition to the signed or stamped and dated Copy 2. If you use the electronic data file to report negatives, you must maintain a retrievable copy of that report in a format suitable for inspection and auditing by a DOT representative.</P>

            <P>(a) As an employee, when the MRO has notified you that you have a verified positive drug test and/or refusal to test because of adulteration or substitution, you have 72 hours from the time of notification to request a test of the split specimen. The request may be verbal or in writing. If you make this request to the MRO within 72 hours, you trigger the requirements of this section for a test of the split specimen. There is no split specimen testing for an invalid result.</P>

            <P>(b)(1) If, as an employee, you have not requested a test of the split specimen within 72 hours, you may present to the MRO information documenting that serious injury, illness, lack of actual notice of the verified test result, inability to contact the MRO (e.g., there was no one in the MRO's office and the answering machine was not <PRTPAGE P="596"/>working), or other circumstances unavoidably prevented you from making a timely request.</P>
            <P>(2) As the MRO, if you conclude from the employee's information that there was a legitimate reason for the employee's failure to contact you within 72 hours, you must direct that the test of the split specimen take place, just as you would when there is a timely request.</P>
            <P>(c) When the employee makes a timely request for a test of the split specimen under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, you must, as the MRO, immediately provide written notice to the laboratory that tested the primary specimen, directing the laboratory to forward the split specimen to a second HHS-certified laboratory. You must also document the date and time of the employee's request.</P>

            <P>(a) As the employer, you are responsible for making sure (e.g., by establishing appropriate accounts with laboratories for testing split specimens) that the MRO, first laboratory, and second laboratory perform the functions noted in §§ 40.175-40.185 in a timely manner, once the employee has made a timely request for a test of the split specimen.</P>
            <P>(b) As the employer, you must not condition your compliance with these requirements on the employee's direct payment to the MRO or laboratory or the employee's agreement to reimburse you for the costs of testing. For example, if you ask the employee to pay for some or all of the cost of testing the split specimen, and the employee is unwilling or unable to do so, you must ensure that the test takes place in a timely manner, even though this means that you pay for it.</P>
            <P>(c) As the employer, you may seek payment or reimbursement of all or part of the cost of the split specimen from the employee (e.g., through your written company policy or a collective bargaining agreement). This part takes no position on who ultimately pays the cost of the test, so long as the employer ensures that the testing is conducted as required and the results released appropriately.</P>

            <P>(b) If the split specimen is unavailable or appears insufficient, you must then do the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Continue the testing process for the primary specimen as you would normally. Report the results for the primary specimen without providing the MRO information regarding the unavailable split specimen.</P>
            <P>(2) Upon receiving a letter from the MRO instructing you to forward the split specimen to another laboratory for testing, report to the MRO that the split specimen is unavailable for testing. Provide as much information as you can about the cause of the unavailability.</P>
            <P>(c) As the laboratory that tested the primary specimen, you are not authorized to open the split specimen under any circumstances (except when the split specimen is redesignated as provided in § 40.83).</P>
            <P>(d) When you receive written notice from the MRO instructing you to send the split specimen to another HHS-certified laboratory, you must forward the following items to the second laboratory:</P>
            <P>(1) The split specimen in its original specimen bottle, with the seal intact;</P>

            <P>As the MRO, the split specimen laboratory results you receive will fall into five categories. You must take the following action, as appropriate, when a laboratory reports split specimen results to you.<PRTPAGE P="598"/>
            </P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Category 1:</E> The laboratory reconfirmed one or more of the primary specimen results. As the MRO, you must report to the DER and the employee the result(s) that was/were reconfirmed.</P>
            <P>(1) In the case of a reconfirmed positive test(s) for drug(s) or drug metabolite(s), the positive is the final result.</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of a reconfirmed adulterated or substituted result, the refusal to test is the final result.</P>
            <P>(3) In the case of a combination positive and refusal to test results, the final result is both positive and refusal to test.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Category 2:</E> The laboratory failed to reconfirm all of the primary specimen results because, as appropriate, drug(s)/drug metabolite(s) were not detected; adulteration criteria were not met; and/or substitution criteria were not met. As the MRO, you must report to the DER and the employee that the test must be cancelled.</P>
            <P>(1) As the MRO, you must inform ODAPC of the failure to reconfirm using the format in Appendix D to this part.</P>
            <P>(2) In a case where the split failed to reconfirm because the substitution criteria were not met and the split specimen creatinine concentration was equal to or greater than 2mg/dL but less than or equal to 5mg/dL, as the MRO, you must, in addition to step (b)(1) of this paragraph, direct the DER to ensure the immediate collection of another specimen from the employee under direct observation, with no notice given to the employee of this collection requirement until immediately before the collection.</P>
            <P>(3) In a case where the split failed to reconfirm and the primary specimen's result was also invalid, direct the DER to ensure the immediate collection of another specimen from the employee under direct observation, with no notice given to the employee of this collection requirement until immediately before the collection.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Category 3:</E> The laboratory failed to reconfirm all of the primary specimen results, and also reported that the split specimen was invalid, adulterated, and/or substituted.</P>
            <P>(1) In the case where the laboratory failed to reconfirm all of the primary specimen results and the split was reported as invalid, as the MRO, you must:</P>
            <P>(i) Report to the DER and the employee that the test must be cancelled and the reason for the cancellation.</P>
            <P>(ii) Direct the DER to ensure the immediate collection of another specimen from the employee under direct observation, with no notice given to the employee of this collection requirement until immediately before the collection.</P>
            <P>(iii) Inform ODAPC of the failure to reconfirm using the format in Appendix D to this part.</P>
            <P>(2) In the case where the laboratory failed to reconfirm any of the primary specimen results, and the split was reported as adulterated and/or substituted, as the MRO, you must:</P>
            <P>(i) Contact the employee and inform the employee that the laboratory has determined that his or her split specimen is adulterated and/or substituted, as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(ii) Follow the procedures of § 40.145 to determine if there is a legitimate medical explanation for the laboratory finding of adulteration and/or substitution, as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(iii) If you determine that there is a legitimate medical explanation for the adulterated and/or substituted test result, report to the DER and the employee that the test must be cancelled; and inform ODAPC of the failure to reconfirm using the format in Appendix D to this part.</P>
            <P>(iv) If you determine that there is not a legitimate medical explanation for the adulterated and/or substituted test result, you must take the following steps:</P>
            <P>(A) Report the test to the DER and the employee as a verified refusal to test. Inform the employee that he or she has 72 hours to request a test of the primary specimen to determine if the adulterant found in the split specimen is also present in the primary specimen and/or to determine if the primary specimen meets appropriate substitution criteria.</P>

            <P>(B) Except when the request is for a test of the primary specimen and is being made to the laboratory that tested the primary specimen, follow the <PRTPAGE P="599"/>procedures of §§ 40.153, 40.171, 40.173, 40.179, 40.181, and 40.185, as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(C) As the laboratory that tests the primary specimen to reconfirm the presence of the adulterant found in the split specimen and/or to determine that the primary specimen meets appropriate substitution criteria, report your result to the MRO on a photocopy (faxed, mailed, scanned, couriered) of Copy 1 of the CCF.</P>
            <P>(D) If the test of the primary specimen reconfirms the adulteration and/or substitution finding of the split specimen, as the MRO you must report the result as a refusal to test as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(E) If the test of the primary specimen fails to reconfirm the adulteration and/or substitution finding of the split specimen, as the MRO you must cancel the test, following procedures in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Category 4:</E> The laboratory failed to reconfirm one or more but not all of the primary specimen results, and also reported that the split specimen was invalid, adulterated, and/or substituted. As the MRO, in the case where the laboratory reconfirmed one or more of the primary specimen result(s), you must follow procedures in paragraph (a) of this section and:</P>
            <P>(1) Report that the split was also reported as being invalid, adulterated, and/or substituted (as appropriate).</P>
            <P>(2) Inform the DER to take action only on the reconfirmed result(s).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Category 5:</E> The split specimen was not available for testing or there was no split laboratory available to test the specimen. As the MRO, you must:</P>
            <P>(1) Report to the DER and the employee that the test must be cancelled and the reason for the cancellation;</P>
            <P>(2) Direct the DER to ensure the immediate recollection of another specimen from the employee under direct observation, with no notice given to the employee of this collection requirement until immediately before the collection; and</P>

            <P>(a) As an employee, you have refused to take a drug test if you:</P>
            <P>(1) Fail to appear for any test (except a pre-employment test) within a reasonable time, as determined by the employer, consistent with applicable DOT agency regulations, after being directed to do so by the employer. This includes the failure of an employee (including an owner-operator) to appear for a test when called by a C/TPA (see § 40.61(a));</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Fail to remain at the testing site until the testing process is complete; Provided,</E> That an employee who leaves the testing site before the testing process <PRTPAGE P="600"/>commences (see § 40.63 (c)) for a pre-employment test is not deemed to have refused to test;</P>

            <P>(3) Fail to provide a urine specimen for any drug test required by this part or DOT agency regulations; <E T="03">Provided,</E> That an employee who does not provide a urine specimen because he or she has left the testing site before the testing process commences (see § 40.63 (c)) for a pre-employment test is not deemed to have refused to test;</P>
            <P>(4) In the case of a directly observed or monitored collection in a drug test, fail to permit the observation or monitoring of your provision of a specimen (see §§ 40.67(l) and 40.69(g));</P>
            <P>(5) Fail to provide a sufficient amount of urine when directed, and it has been determined, through a required medical evaluation, that there was no adequate medical explanation for the failure (see § 40.193(d)(2));</P>
            <P>(6) Fail or decline to take an additional drug test the employer or collector has directed you to take (see, for instance, § 40.197(b));</P>
            <P>(7) Fail to undergo a medical examination or evaluation, as directed by the MRO as part of the verification process, or as directed by the DER under § 40.193(d). In the case of a pre-employment drug test, the employee is deemed to have refused to test on this basis only if the pre-employment test is conducted following a contingent offer of employment. If there was no contingent offer of employment, the MRO will cancel the test; or</P>
            <P>(8) Fail to cooperate with any part of the testing process (e.g., refuse to empty pockets when directed by the collector, behave in a confrontational way that disrupts the collection process, fail to wash hands after being directed to do so by the collector).</P>
            <P>(9) For an observed collection, fail to follow the observer's instructions to raise your clothing above the waist, lower clothing and underpants, and to turn around to permit the observer to determine if you have any type of prosthetic or other device that could be used to interfere with the collection process.</P>
            <P>(10) Possess or wear a prosthetic or other device that could be used to interfere with the collection process.</P>
            <P>(11) Admit to the collector or MRO that you adulterated or substituted the specimen.</P>
            <P>(b) As an employee, if the MRO reports that you have a verified adulterated or substituted test result, you have refused to take a drug test.</P>
            <P>(c) As an employee, if you refuse to take a drug test, you incur the consequences specified under DOT agency regulations for a violation of those DOT agency regulations.</P>
            <P>(d) As a collector or an MRO, when an employee refuses to participate in the part of the testing process in which you are involved, you must terminate the portion of the testing process in which you are involved, document the refusal on the CCF (including, in the case of the collector, printing the employee's name on Copy 2 of the CCF), immediately notify the DER by any means (e.g., telephone or secure fax machine) that ensures that the refusal notification is immediately received. As a referral physician (e.g., physician evaluating a “shy bladder” condition or a claim of a legitimate medical explanation in a validity testing situation), you must notify the MRO, who in turn will notify the DER.</P>
            <P>(1) As the collector, you must note the refusal in the “Remarks” line (Step 2), and sign and date the CCF.</P>
            <P>(2) As the MRO, you must note the refusal by checking the “Refusal to Test” box in Step 6 on Copy 2 of the CCF, checking whether the specimen was adulterated or substituted and, if adulterated, noting the adulterant/reason. If there was another reason for the refusal, check “Other” in Step 6 on Copy 2 of the CCF, and note the reason next to the “Other” box and on the “Remarks” lines, as needed. You must then sign and date the CCF.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What happens when an employee does not provide a sufficient amount of urine for a drug test?</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) This section prescribes procedures for situations in which an employee does not provide a sufficient amount of urine to permit a drug test (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> 45 mL of urine).</P>
            <P>(b) As the collector, you must do the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Discard the insufficient specimen, except where the insufficient specimen was out of temperature range or showed evidence of adulteration or tampering (see § 40.65(b) and (c)).</P>
            <P>(2) Urge the employee to drink up to 40 ounces of fluid, distributed reasonably through a period of up to three hours, or until the individual has provided a sufficient urine specimen, whichever occurs first. It is not a refusal to test if the employee declines to drink. Document on the Remarks line of the CCF (Step 2), and inform the employee of, the time at which the three-hour period begins and ends.</P>
            <P>(3) If the employee refuses to make the attempt to provide a new urine specimen or leaves the collection site before the collection process is complete, you must discontinue the collection, note the fact on the “Remarks” line of the CCF (Step 2), and immediately notify the DER. This is a refusal to test.</P>
            <P>(4) If the employee has not provided a sufficient specimen within three hours of the first unsuccessful attempt to provide the specimen, you must discontinue the collection, note the fact on the “Remarks” line of the CCF (Step 2), and immediately notify the DER. You must also discard any specimen the employee previously provided to include any specimen that is “out of temperature range” or shows signs of tampering. In the remarks section of the CCF that you will distribute to the MRO and DER, note the fact that the employee provided an “out of temperature range specimen” or “specimen that shows signs of tampering” and that it was discarded because the employee did not provide a second sufficient specimen.</P>
            <P>(5) Send Copy 2 of the CCF to the MRO and Copy 4 to the DER. You must send or fax these copies to the MRO and DER within 24 hours or the next business day.</P>
            <P>(c) As the DER, when the collector informs you that the employee has not provided a sufficient amount of urine (see paragraph (b)(4) of this section), you must, after consulting with the MRO, direct the employee to obtain, within five days, an evaluation from a licensed physician, acceptable to the MRO, who has expertise in the medical issues raised by the employee's failure to provide a sufficient specimen. (The MRO may perform this evaluation if the MRO has appropriate expertise.)</P>
            <P>(1) As the MRO, if another physician will perform the evaluation, you must provide the other physician with the following information and instructions:</P>
            <P>(i) That the employee was required to take a DOT drug test, but was unable to provide a sufficient amount of urine to complete the test;</P>
            <P>(ii) The consequences of the appropriate DOT agency regulation for refusing to take the required drug test;</P>
            <P>(iii) That the referral physician must agree to follow the requirements of paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(d) As the referral physician conducting this evaluation, you must recommend that the MRO make one of the following determinations:</P>
            <P>(1) A medical condition has, or with a high degree of probability could have, precluded the employee from providing a sufficient amount of urine. As the MRO, if you accept this recommendation, you must:</P>
            <P>(i) Check “Test Cancelled” (Step 6) on the CCF; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Sign and date the CCF.</P>
            <P>(2) There is not an adequate basis for determining that a medical condition has, or with a high degree of probability could have, precluded the employee from providing a sufficient amount of urine. As the MRO, if you accept this recommendation, you must:</P>
            <P>(i) Check the “Refusal to Test” box and “Other” box in Step 6 on Copy 2 of the CCF and note the reason next to the “Other” box and on the “Remarks” lines, as needed.</P>
            <P>(ii) Sign and date the CCF.<PRTPAGE P="602"/>
            </P>
            <P>(e) For purposes of this paragraph, a medical condition includes an ascertainable physiological condition (e.g., a urinary system dysfunction) or a medically documented pre-existing psychological disorder, but does not include unsupported assertions of “situational anxiety” or dehydration.</P>
            <P>(f) As the referral physician making the evaluation, after completing your evaluation, you must provide a written statement of your recommendations and the basis for them to the MRO. You must not include in this statement detailed information on the employee's medical condition beyond what is necessary to explain your conclusion.</P>
            <P>(g) If, as the referral physician making this evaluation in the case of a pre-employment test, you determine that the employee's medical condition is a serious and permanent or long-term disability that is highly likely to prevent the employee from providing a sufficient amount of urine for a very long or indefinite period of time, you must set forth your determination and the reasons for it in your written statement to the MRO. As the MRO, upon receiving such a report, you must follow the requirements of § 40.195, where applicable.</P>
            <P>(h) As the MRO, you must seriously consider and assess the referral physician's recommendations in making your determination about whether the employee has a medical condition that has, or with a high degree of probability could have, precluded the employee from providing a sufficient amount of urine. You must report your determination to the DER in writing as soon as you make it.</P>
            <P>(i) As the employer, when you receive a report from the MRO indicating that a test is cancelled as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, you take no further action with respect to the employee. The employee remains in the random testing pool.</P>

            <P>(a) This section concerns a situation in which an employee has a medical condition that precludes him or her from providing a sufficient specimen for a pre-employment follow-up or return-to-duty test and the condition involves a permanent or long-term disability. As the MRO in this situation, you must do the following:</P>
            <P>(1) You must determine if there is clinical evidence that the individual is an illicit drug user. You must make this determination by personally conducting, or causing to be conducted, a medical evaluation and through consultation with the employee's physician and/or the physician who conducted the evaluation under § 40.193(d).</P>
            <P>(2) If you do not personally conduct the medical evaluation, you must ensure that one is conducted by a licensed physician acceptable to you.</P>

            <P>(3) For purposes of this section, the MRO or the physician conducting the evaluation may conduct an alternative test (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> blood) as part of the medically appropriate procedures in determining clinical evidence of drug use.</P>
            <P>(b) If the medical evaluation reveals no clinical evidence of drug use, as the MRO, you must report the result to the employer as a negative test with written notations regarding results of both the evaluation conducted under § 40.193(d) and any further medical examination. This report must state the basis for the determination that a permanent or long-term medical condition exists, making provision of a sufficient urine specimen impossible, and for the determination that no signs and symptoms of drug use exist.</P>
            <P>(1) Check “Negative” (Step 6) on the CCF.</P>
            <P>(2) Sign and date the CCF.</P>

            <P>(c) If the medical evaluation reveals clinical evidence of drug use, as the MRO, you must report the result to the employer as a cancelled test with written notations regarding results of both the evaluation conducted under § 40.193(d) and any further medical examination. This report must state that <PRTPAGE P="603"/>a permanent or long-term medical condition exists, making provision of a sufficient urine specimen impossible, and state the reason for the determination that signs and symptoms of drug use exist. Because this is a cancelled test, it does not serve the purposes of a negative test (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the employer is not authorized to allow the employee to begin or resume performing safety-sensitive functions, because a negative test is needed for that purpose).</P>
            <P>(d) For purposes of this section, permanent or long-term medical conditions are those physiological, anatomic, or psychological abnormalities documented as being present prior to the attempted collection, and considered not amenable to correction or cure for an extended period of time, if ever.</P>
            <P>(1) Examples would include destruction (any cause) of the glomerular filtration system leading to renal failure; unrepaired traumatic disruption of the urinary tract; or a severe psychiatric disorder focused on genito-urinary matters.</P>
            <P>(2) Acute or temporary medical conditions, such as cystitis, urethritis or prostatitis, though they might interfere with collection for a limited period of time, cannot receive the same exceptional consideration as the permanent or long-term conditions discussed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What happens when an employer receives a report of a dilute specimen?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As the employer, if the MRO informs you that a positive drug test was dilute, you simply treat the test as a verified positive test. You must not direct the employee to take another test based on the fact that the specimen was dilute.</P>
            <P>(b) As an employer, if the MRO informs you that a negative test was dilute, take the following action:</P>

            <P>(1) If the MRO directs you to conduct a recollection under direct observation (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> because the creatinine concentration of the specimen was equal to or greater than 2mg/dL, but less than or equal to 5 mg/dL (<E T="03">see</E> § 40.155(c)), you must do so immediately.</P>
            <P>(2) Otherwise (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> if the creatinine concentration of the dilute specimen is greater than 5 mg/dL), you may, but are not required to, direct the employee to take another test immediately.</P>
            <P>(i) Such recollections must not be collected under direct observation, unless there is another basis for use of direct observation (see § 40.67 (b) and (c)).</P>

            <P>(ii) You must treat all employees the same for this purpose. For example, you must not retest some employees and not others. You may, however, establish different policies for different types of tests (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> conduct retests in pre-employment situations, but not in random test situations). You must inform your employees in advance of your decisions on these matters.</P>
            <P>(c) The following provisions apply to all tests you direct an employee to take under paragraph (b) of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) You must ensure that the employee is given the minimum possible advance notice that he or she must go to the collection site;</P>
            <P>(2) You must treat the result of the test you directed the employee to take under paragraph (b) of this section—and not a prior test—as the test result of record, on which you rely for purposes of this part;</P>
            <P>(3) If the result of the test you directed the employee to take under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is also negative and dilute, you are not permitted to make the employee take an additional test because the result was dilute.</P>
            <P>(4) If the result of the test you directed the employee to take under paragraph (b)(2) of this section is also negative and dilute, you are not permitted to make the employee take an additional test because the result was dilute. Provided, however, that if the MRO directs you to conduct a recollection under direct observation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, you must immediately do so.</P>

            <P>(5) If the employee declines to take a test you directed him or her to take under paragraph (b) of this section, the <PRTPAGE P="604"/>employee has refused the test for purposes of this part and DOT agency regulations.</P>

            <P>As the MRO, you must cancel a drug test when a laboratory reports that any of the following problems have occurred. You must inform the DER that the test was cancelled. You must also direct the DER to ensure that an additional collection occurs immediately, if required by the applicable procedures specified in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.</P>

Both these cases require recollection under direct observation.</P>
            <P>(d) The laboratory reports that the split specimen failed to reconfirm all of the primary specimen results, and that the split specimen was invalid. You must follow the procedures in § 40.187(c)(1)—recollection under direct observation is required in this case.</P>
            <P>(e) The laboratory reports that the split specimen failed to reconfirm all of the primary specimen results because the split specimen was not available for testing or there was no split laboratory available to test the specimen. You must follow the applicable procedures in § 40.187(e)—recollection under direct observation is required in this case.</P>
            <P>(f) The examining physician has determined that there is an acceptable medical explanation of the employee's failure to provide a sufficient amount of urine. You must follow applicable procedures in § 40.193(d)(1) (no recollection is required in this case).</P>

            <P>(d) The following are correctable flaws that you must attempt to correct:</P>
            <P>(1) The employee's signature is omitted from the certification statement, unless the employee's failure or refusal to sign is noted on the “Remarks” line of the CCF.</P>

            <P>(a) As a collector, you have the responsibility of trying to successfully complete a collection procedure for each employee.</P>

            <P>(1) If, during or shortly after the collection process, you become aware of any event that prevents the completion of a valid test or collection (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a procedural or paperwork error), you must try to correct the problem promptly, if doing so is practicable. You may conduct another collection as part of this effort.</P>
            <P>(2) If another collection is necessary, you must begin the new collection procedure as soon as possible, using a new CCF and a new collection kit.</P>
            <P>(b) If, as a collector, laboratory, MRO, employer, or other person implementing these drug testing regulations, you become aware of a problem that can be corrected (see § 40.203), but which has not already been corrected under paragraph (a) of this section, you must take all practicable action to correct the problem so that the test is not cancelled.</P>
            <P>(1) If the problem resulted from the omission of required information, you must, as the person responsible for providing that information, supply in writing the missing information and a statement that it is true and accurate. For example, suppose you are a collector, and you forgot to make a notation on the “Remarks” line of the CCF that the employee did not sign the certification. You would, when the problem is called to your attention, supply a signed statement that the employee failed or refused to sign the certification and that your statement is true and accurate. You must supply this information on the same business day on which you are notified of the problem, transmitting it by fax or courier.</P>
            <P>(2) If the problem is the use of a non-Federal form or an expired Federal form, you must provide a signed statement (i.e., a memorandum for the record). It must state that the incorrect form contains all the information needed for a valid DOT drug test, and that the incorrect form was used inadvertently or as the only means of conducting a test, in circumstances beyond your control. The statement must also list the steps you have taken to prevent future use of non-Federal forms or expired Federal forms for DOT tests. For this flaw to be corrected, the test of the specimen must have occurred at a HHS-certified laboratory where it was tested consistent with the requirements of this part. You must supply this information on the same business day on which you are notified of the problem, transmitting it by fax or courier.</P>
            <P>(3) You must maintain the written documentation of a correction with the CCF.</P>
            <P>(4) You must mark the CCF in such a way (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> stamp noting correction) as to make it obvious on the face of the CCF that you corrected the flaw.<PRTPAGE P="606"/>

            <P>(3) However, as an employer, you must not direct a recollection for an employee because a test has been cancelled, except in the situations cited in paragraph (a)(2) of this section or other provisions of this part that require another test to be conducted (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> §§ 40.159(a)(5) and 40.187(b)(2), (c)(1), and (e).</P>

            <P>(b) A cancelled test does not count toward compliance with DOT requirements (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> being applied toward the number of tests needed to meet the employer's minimum random testing rate).</P>

Decisions about the ultimate impact of these errors will be determined by other administrative or legal proceedings, subject to the limitations of paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) No person concerned with the testing process may declare a test cancelled based on an error that does not have a significant adverse effect on the right of the employee to have a fair and accurate test. Matters that do not result in the cancellation of a test include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(1) A minor administrative mistake (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the omission of the employee's middle initial, a transposition of numbers in the employee's social security number, the omission of the DOT Agency in Step 1-D of the CCF.)</P>

            <P>(2) An error that does not affect employee protections under this part (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the collector's failure to add bluing agent to the toilet bowl, which adversely affects only the ability of the collector to detect tampering with the specimen by the employee);</P>
            <P>(3) The collection of a specimen by a collector who is required to have been trained (see § 40.33), but who has not met this requirement;</P>
            <P>(4) A delay in the collection process (see § 40.61(a));</P>

            <P>(a) A DOT alcohol test must take place at an alcohol testing site meeting the requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) If you are operating an alcohol testing site, you must ensure that it meets the security requirements of § 40.223.</P>
            <P>(c) If you are operating an alcohol testing site, you must ensure that it provides visual and aural privacy to the employee being tested, sufficient to prevent unauthorized persons from seeing or hearing test results.</P>
            <P>(d) If you are operating an alcohol testing site, you must ensure that it has all needed personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities to provide for the collection and analysis of breath and/or saliva samples, and a suitable clean surface for writing.</P>
            <P>(e) If an alcohol testing site fully meeting all the visual and aural privacy requirements of paragraph (c) is not readily available, this part allows a reasonable suspicion or post-accident test to be conducted at a site that partially meets these requirements. In this case, the site must afford visual and aural privacy to the employee to the greatest extent practicable.</P>

            <P>(f) An alcohol testing site can be in a medical facility, a mobile facility (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a van), a dedicated collection facility, or any other location meeting the requirements of this section.</P>

            <P>(a) If you are a BAT, STT, or other person operating an alcohol testing site, you must prevent unauthorized personnel from entering the testing site.</P>

            <P>(1) The only people you are to treat as authorized persons are employees being tested, BATs, STTs, and other alcohol testing site workers, DERs, employee representatives authorized by the employer (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> on the basis of employer policy or labor-management agreement), and DOT agency representatives.</P>
            <P>(2) You must ensure that all persons are under the supervision of a BAT or STT at all times when permitted into the site.</P>
            <P>(3) You may remove any person who obstructs, interferes with, or causes unnecessary delay in the testing process.</P>
            <P>(b) As the BAT or STT, you must not allow any person other than you, the employee, or a DOT agency representative to actually witness the testing process (see §§ 40.241-40.255).</P>
            <P>(c) If you are operating an alcohol testing site, you must ensure that when an EBT or ASD is not being used for testing, you store it in a secure place.</P>
            <P>(d) If you are operating an alcohol testing site, you must ensure that no one other than BATs or other employees of the site have access to the site when an EBT is unsecured.</P>

            <P>(e) As a BAT or STT, to avoid distraction that could compromise security, you are limited to conducting an alcohol test for only one employee at a time.<PRTPAGE P="610"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) When an EBT screening test on an employee indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or higher, and the same EBT will be used for the confirmation test, you are not allowed to use the EBT for a test on another employee before completing the confirmation test on the first employee.</P>
            <P>(2) As a BAT who will conduct both the screening and the confirmation test, you are to complete the entire screening and confirmation process on one employee before starting the screening process on another employee.</P>
            <P>(3) You are not allowed to leave the alcohol testing site while the testing process for a given employee is in progress, except to notify a supervisor or contact a DER for assistance in the case an employee or other person who obstructs, interferes with, or unnecessarily delays the testing process.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What form is used for an alcohol test?</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The DOT Alcohol Testing Form (ATF) must be used for every DOT alcohol test. The ATF must be a three-part carbonless manifold form. The ATF is found in Appendix G to this part. You may view this form on the ODAPC web site (<E T="03">http://www.transportation.gov/odapc</E>).</P>
            <P>(b) As an employer in the DOT alcohol testing program, you are not permitted to modify or revise the ATF except as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) You may include other information needed for billing purposes, outside the boundaries of the form.</P>
            <P>(2) You may use a ATF directly generated by an EBT which omits the space for affixing a separate printed result to the ATF, provided the EBT prints the result directly on the ATF.</P>
            <P>(3) You may use an ATF that has the employer's name, address, and telephone number preprinted. In addition, a C/TPA's name, address, and telephone number may be included, to assist with negative results.</P>
            <P>(4) You may use an ATF in which all pages are printed on white paper. You may modify the ATF by using colored paper, or have clearly discernable borders or designation statements on Copy 2 and Copy 3. When colors are used, they must be green for Copy 2 and blue for Copy 3.</P>
            <P>(5) As a BAT or STT, you may add, on the “Remarks” line of the ATF, the name of the DOT agency under whose authority the test occurred.</P>
            <P>(6) As a BAT or STT, you may use a ATF that has your name, address, and telephone number preprinted, but under no circumstances can your signature be preprinted.</P>
            <P>(c) As an employer, you may use an equivalent foreign-language version of the ATF approved by ODAPC. You may use such a non-English language form only in a situation where both the employee and BAT/STT understand and can use the form in that language.</P>

            <P>As the BAT or STT you will take the following steps to begin all alcohol screening tests, regardless of the type of testing device you are using:</P>
            <P>(a) When a specific time for an employee's test has been scheduled, or the collection site is at the employee's worksite, and the employee does not appear at the collection site at the scheduled time, contact the DER to determine the appropriate interval within which the DER has determined the employee is authorized to arrive. If the employee's arrival is delayed beyond that time, you must notify the DER that the employee has not reported for testing. In a situation where a C/TPA has notified an owner/operator or other individual employee to report for testing and the employee does not appear, the C/TPA must notify the employee that he or she has refused to test.</P>
            <P>(b) Ensure that, when the employee enters the alcohol testing site, you begin the alcohol testing process without undue delay. For example, you must not wait because the employee says he or she is not ready or because an authorized employer or employee representative is delayed in arriving.</P>
            <P>(1) If the employee is also going to take a DOT drug test, you must, to the greatest extent practicable, ensure that the alcohol test is completed before the urine collection process begins.</P>
            <P>(2) If the employee needs medical attention (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> an injured employee in an emergency medical facility who is required to have a post-accident test), do not delay this treatment to conduct a test.</P>

            <P>(c) Require the employee to provide positive identification. You must see a photo ID issued by the employer (other than in the case of an owner-operator or other self-employer individual) or a Federal, state, or local government (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a driver's license). You may not accept faxes or photocopies of identification. Positive identification by an employer representative (not a co-worker or another employee being tested) is also acceptable. If the employee cannot produce positive identification, you must contact a DER to verify the identity of the employee.</P>
            <P>(d) If the employee asks, provide your identification to the employee. Your identification must include your name and your employer's name but is not required to include your picture, address, or telephone number.</P>
            <P>(e) Explain the testing procedure to the employee, including showing the employee the instructions on the back of the ATF.</P>
            <P>(f) Complete Step 1 of the ATF.</P>
            <P>(g) Direct the employee to complete Step 2 on the ATF and sign the certification. If the employee refuses to sign this certification, you must document this refusal on the “Remarks” line of the ATF and immediately notify the DER. This is a refusal to test.</P>

            <P>(b) Open the individually wrapped or sealed mouthpiece in view of the employee and insert it into the device in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</P>

            <P>(c) Instruct the employee to blow steadily and forcefully into the mouthpiece for at least six seconds or until <PRTPAGE P="613"/>the device indicates that an adequate amount of breath has been obtained.</P>
            <P>(d) Show the employee the displayed test result.</P>
            <P>(e) If the device is one that prints the test number, testing device name and serial number, time, and result directly onto the ATF, you must check to ensure that the information has been printed correctly onto the ATF.</P>
            <P>(f) If the device is one that prints the test number, testing device name and serial number, time and result, but on a separate printout rather than directly onto the ATF, you must affix the printout of the information to the designated space on the ATF with tamper-evident tape or use a self-adhesive label that is tamper-evident.</P>
            <P>(g) If the device is one that does not print the test number, testing device name and serial number, time, and result, or it is a device not being used with a printer, you must record this information in Step 3 of the ATF.</P>

            <P>(1) Check the expiration date on the device or on the package containing the device and show it to the employee. You may not use the device after its expiration date.</P>
            <P>(2) Open an individually wrapped or sealed package containing the device in the presence of the employee.</P>
            <P>(3) Offer the employee the opportunity to use the device. If the employee uses it, you must instruct the employee to insert it into his or her mouth and use it in a manner described by the device's manufacturer.</P>
            <P>(4) If the employee chooses not to use the device, or in all cases in which a new test is necessary because the device did not activate (see paragraph (a)(7) of this section), you must insert the device into the employee's mouth and gather saliva in the manner described by the device's manufacturer.

            <SUBJECT>What are the first steps in an alcohol confirmation test?</SUBJECT>
            <P>As the BAT for an alcohol confirmation test, you must follow these steps to begin the confirmation test process:</P>
            <P>(a) You must carry out a requirement for a waiting period before the confirmation test, by taking the following steps:</P>
            <P>(1) You must ensure that the waiting period lasts at least 15 minutes, starting with the completion of the screening test. After the waiting period has elapsed, you should begin the confirmation test as soon as possible, but not more than 30 minutes after the completion of the screening test.</P>
            <P>(i) If the confirmation test is taking place at a different location from the screening test (see § 40.247(b)(3)) the time of transit between sites counts toward the waiting period if the STT or BAT who conducted the screening test provided the waiting period instructions.</P>
            <P>(ii) If you cannot verify, through review of the ATF, that waiting period instructions were provided, then you must carry out the waiting period requirement.</P>
            <P>(iii) You or another BAT or STT, or an employer representative, must observe the employee during the waiting period.</P>
            <P>(2) Concerning the waiting period, you must tell the employee:</P>
            <P>(i) Not to eat, drink, put anything (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> cigarette, chewing gum) into his or her mouth, or belch;</P>
            <P>(ii) The reason for the waiting period (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> to prevent an accumulation of mouth alcohol from leading to an artificially high reading);</P>
            <P>(iii) That following your instructions concerning the waiting period is to the employee's benefit; and</P>
            <P>(iv) That the confirmation test will be conducted at the end of the waiting period, even if the instructions have not been followed.</P>

            <P>(3) If you become aware that the employee has not followed the instructions, you must note this on the “Remarks” line of the ATF.<PRTPAGE P="616"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) If you did not conduct the screening test for the employee, you must require positive identification of the employee, explain the confirmation procedures, and use a new ATF. You must note on the “Remarks” line of the ATF that a different BAT or STT conducted the screening test.</P>
            <P>(c) Complete Step 1 of the ATF.</P>
            <P>(d) Direct the employee to complete Step 2 on the ATF and sign the certification. If the employee refuses to sign this certification, you must document this refusal on the “Remarks” line of the ATF and immediately notify the DER. This is a refusal to test.</P>
            <P>(e) Even if more than 30 minutes have passed since the screening test result was obtained, you must begin the confirmation test procedures in § 40.253, not another screening test.</P>
            <P>(f) You must note on the “Remarks” line of the ATF the time that elapsed between the two events, and if the confirmation test could not begin within 30 minutes of the screening test, the reason why.</P>
            <P>(g) Beginning the confirmation test procedures after the 30 minutes have elapsed does not invalidate the screening or confirmation tests, but it may constitute a regulatory violation subject to DOT agency sanction.</P>

            <P>(a) In the presence of the employee, you must conduct an air blank on the EBT you are using before beginning the confirmation test and show the reading to the employee.</P>
            <P>(1) If the reading is 0.00, the test may proceed. If the reading is greater than 0.00, you must conduct another air blank.</P>
            <P>(2) If the reading on the second air blank is 0.00, the test may proceed. If the reading is greater than 0.00, you must take the EBT out of service.</P>
            <P>(3) If you take an EBT out of service for this reason, no one may use it for testing until the EBT is found to be within tolerance limits on an external check of calibration.</P>
            <P>(4) You must proceed with the test of the employee using another EBT, if one is available.</P>
            <P>(b) You must open a new individually wrapped or sealed mouthpiece in view of the employee and insert it into the device in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</P>
            <P>(c) You must ensure that you and the employee read the unique test number displayed on the EBT.</P>
            <P>(d) You must instruct the employee to blow steadily and forcefully into the mouthpiece for at least six seconds or until the device indicates that an adequate amount of breath has been obtained.</P>
            <P>(e) You must show the employee the result displayed on the EBT.</P>
            <P>(f) You must show the employee the result and unique test number that the EBT prints out either directly onto the ATF or onto a separate printout.</P>

            <P>As an employer, a BAT, or an STT, you must cancel an alcohol test if any of the following problems occur. These are “fatal flaws.” You must inform the DER that the test was cancelled and must be treated as if the test never occurred. These problems are:</P>
            <P>(a) In the case of a screening test conducted on a saliva ASD or a breath tube ASD:</P>
            <P>(1) The STT or BAT reads the result either sooner than or later than the time allotted by the manufacturer and this Part (see § 40.245(a)(8) for the saliva ASD and § 40.245(b)(8) for the breath tube ASD).</P>
            <P>(2) The saliva ASD does not activate (<E T="03">see</E> § 40.245(a)(7); or</P>
            <P>(3) The device is used for a test after the expiration date printed on the device or on its package (see § 40.245(a)(1) for the saliva ASD and § 40.245(b)(1) for the breath tube ASD).</P>
            <P>(4) The breath tube ASD is tested with an analyzer which has not been pre-calibrated for that device's specific lot (see § 40.245(b)(1)).</P>
            <P>(b) In the case of a screening or confirmation test conducted on an EBT, the sequential test number or alcohol concentration displayed on the EBT is not the same as the sequential test number or alcohol concentration on the printed result (see § 40.253(c), (e) and (f)).</P>
            <P>(c) In the case of a confirmation test:</P>
            <P>(1) The BAT conducts the confirmation test before the end of the minimum 15-minute waiting period (see § 40.251(a)(1));</P>
            <P>(2) The BAT does not conduct an air blank before the confirmation test (see § 40.253(a));</P>
            <P>(3) There is not a 0.00 result on the air blank conducted before the confirmation test (see § 40.253(a)(1) and (2));</P>
            <P>(4) The EBT does not print the result (see § 40.253(f)); or</P>
            <P>(5) The next external calibration check of the EBT produces a result that differs by more than the tolerance stated in the QAP from the known value of the test standard. In this case, every result of 0.02 or above obtained on the EBT since the last valid external calibration check is cancelled (see § 40.233(a)(1) and (c)(3)).</P>

            <P>As a BAT or STT, or employer, you must cancel an alcohol test if any of the following problems occur, unless they are corrected. These are “correctable flaws.” These problems are:</P>
            <P>(a) The BAT or STT does not sign the ATF (see §§ 40.247(a)(1) and 40.255(a)(1)).</P>
            <P>(b) The BAT or STT fails to note on the “Remarks” line of the ATF that the employee has not signed the ATF after the result is obtained (see § 40.255(a)(3)).</P>

            <SUBJECT>How are alcohol testing problems corrected?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As a BAT or STT, you have the responsibility of trying to complete successfully an alcohol test for each employee.</P>

            <P>(1) If, during or shortly after the testing process, you become aware of any event that will cause the test to be cancelled (see § 40.267), you must try to <PRTPAGE P="620"/>correct the problem promptly, if practicable. You may repeat the testing process as part of this effort.</P>

            <P>(2) If repeating the testing process is necessary, you must begin a new test as soon as possible. You must use a new ATF, a new sequential test number, and, if needed, a new ASD and/or a new EBT. It is permissible to use additional technical capabilities of the EBT (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> manual operation) if you have been trained to do so in accordance with § 40.213(c) .</P>
            <P>(3) If repeating the testing process is necessary, you are not limited in the number of attempts to complete the test, provided that the employee is making a good faith effort to comply with the testing process.</P>
            <P>(4) If another testing device is not available for the new test at the testing site, you must immediately notify the DER and advise the DER that the test could not be completed. As the DER who receives this information, you must make all reasonable efforts to ensure that the test is conducted at another testing site as soon as possible.</P>
            <P>(b) If, as an STT, BAT, employer or other service agent administering the testing process, you become aware of a “correctable flaw” (see § 40.269) that has not already been corrected, you must take all practicable action to correct the problem so that the test is not cancelled.</P>
            <P>(1) If the problem resulted from the omission of required information, you must, as the person responsible for providing that information, supply in writing the missing information and a signed statement that it is true and accurate. For example, suppose you are a BAT and you forgot to make a notation on the “Remarks” line of the ATF that the employee did not sign the certification. You would, when the problem is called to your attention, supply a signed statement that the employee failed or refused to sign the certification after the result was obtained, and that your signed statement is true and accurate.</P>
            <P>(2) If the problem is the use of a non-DOT form, you must, as the person responsible for the use of the incorrect form, certify in writing that the incorrect form contains all the information needed for a valid DOT alcohol test. You must also provide a signed statement that the incorrect form was used inadvertently or as the only means of conducting a test, in circumstances beyond your control, and the steps you have taken to prevent future use of non-DOT forms for DOT tests. You must supply this information on the same business day on which you are notified of the problem, transmitting it by fax or courier.</P>
            <P>(c) If you cannot correct the problem, you must cancel the test.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What is the effect of a cancelled alcohol test?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A cancelled alcohol test is neither positive nor negative.</P>

            <P>(1) As an employer, you must not attach to a cancelled test the consequences of a test result that is 0.02 or greater (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> removal from a safety-sensitive position).</P>

            <P>(2) As an employer, you must not use a cancelled test in a situation where an employee needs a test result that is below 0.02 (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> in the case of a return-to-duty or follow-up test to authorize the employee to perform safety-sensitive functions).</P>
            <P>(3) As an employer, you must not direct a recollection for an employee because a test has been cancelled, except in the situations cited in paragraph (a)(2) of this section or other provisions of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) A cancelled test does not count toward compliance with DOT requirements, such as a minimum random testing rate.</P>
            <P>(c) When a test must be cancelled, if you are the BAT, STT, or other person who determines that the cancellation is necessary, you must inform the affected DER within 48 hours of the cancellation.</P>

            <P>(d) A cancelled DOT test does not provide a valid basis for an employer to conduct a non-DOT test (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a test under company authority).</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 40.275</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What is the effect of procedural problems that are not sufficient to cancel an alcohol test?</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) As an STT, BAT, employer, or a service agent administering the testing process, you must document any errors in the testing process of which you become aware, even if they are not “fatal <PRTPAGE P="621"/>flaws” or “correctable flaws” listed in this subpart. Decisions about the ultimate impact of these errors will be determined by administrative or legal proceedings, subject to the limitation of paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

            <P>(b) No person concerned with the testing process may declare a test cancelled based on a mistake in the process that does not have a significant adverse effect on the right of the employee to a fair and accurate test. For example, it is inconsistent with this part to cancel a test based on a minor administrative mistake (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the omission of the employee's middle initial) or an error that does not affect employee protections under this part. Nor does the failure of an employee to sign in Step 4 of the ATF result in the cancellation of the test. Nor is a test to be cancelled on the basis of a claim by an employee that he or she was improperly selected for testing.</P>
            <P>(c) As an employer, these errors, even though not sufficient to cancel an alcohol test result, may subject you to enforcement action under DOT agency regulations.</P>

            <P>(c) There are four exceptions to the prohibitions contained in paragraph (b) of this section. You may refer an employee to any of the following providers of assistance, regardless of your relationship with them:</P>
            <P>(1) A public agency (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> treatment facility) operated by a state, county, or municipality;</P>

            <P>(2) The employer or a person or organization under contract to the employer to provide alcohol or drug treatment and/or education services (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the employer's contracted treatment provider);</P>

            <P>(3) The sole source of therapeutically appropriate treatment under the employee's health insurance program (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the single substance abuse in-patient treatment program made available by the employee's insurance coverage plan); or</P>

            <P>(4) The sole source of therapeutically appropriate treatment reasonably available to the employee (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the only treatment facility or education program reasonably located within the general commuting area).</P>

            <SUBJECT>What is the SAP's function in the follow-up evaluation of an employee?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As a SAP, after you have prescribed assistance under § 40.293, you must re-evaluate the employee to determine if the employee has successfully carried out your education and/or treatment recommendations.</P>
            <P>(1) This is your way to gauge for the employer the employee's ability to demonstrate successful compliance with the education and/or treatment plan.</P>
            <P>(2) Your evaluation may serve as one of the reasons the employer decides to return the employee to safety-sensitive duty.</P>
            <P>(b) As the SAP making the follow-up evaluation determination, you must:</P>
            <P>(1) Confer with or obtain appropriate documentation from the appropriate education and/or treatment program professionals where the employee was referred; and</P>
            <P>(2) Conduct a face-to-face clinical interview with the employee to determine if the employee demonstrates successful compliance with your initial evaluation recommendations.</P>
            <P>(c) (1) If the employee has demonstrated successful compliance, you must provide a written report directly to the DER highlighting your clinical determination that the employee has done so with your initial evaluation recommendation (see § 40.311(d)).</P>
            <P>(2) You may determine that an employee has successfully demonstrated compliance even though the employee has not yet completed the full regimen of education and/or treatment you recommended or needs additional assistance. For example, if the employee has successfully completed the 30-day in-patient program you prescribed, you may make a “successful compliance” determination even though you conclude that the employee has not yet completed the out-patient counseling you recommended or should continue in an aftercare program.</P>
            <P>(d)(1) As the SAP, if you believe, as a result of the follow-up evaluation, that the employee has not demonstrated successful compliance with your recommendations, you must provide written notice directly to the DER (see § 40.311(e)).</P>
            <P>(2) As an employer who receives the SAP's written notice that the employee has not successfully complied with the SAP's recommendations, you must not return the employee to the performance of safety-sensitive duties.</P>
            <P>(3) As the SAP, you may conduct additional follow-up evaluation(s) if the employer determines that doing so is consistent with the employee's progress as you have reported it and with the employer's policy and/or labor-management agreements.</P>
            <P>(4) As the employer, following a SAP report that the employee has not demonstrated successful compliance, you may take personnel action consistent with your policy and/or labor-management agreements.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What happens if the SAP believes the employee needs additional treatment, aftercare, or support group services even after the employee returns to safety-sensitive duties?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As a SAP, if you believe that ongoing services (in addition to follow-up tests) are needed to assist an employee to maintain sobriety or abstinence from drug use after the employee resumes the performance of safety-sensitive duties, you must provide recommendations for these services in your follow-up evaluation report (see § 40.311(d)(10)).</P>
            <P>(b) As an employer receiving a recommendation for these services from a SAP, you may, as part of a return-to-duty agreement with the employee, require the employee to participate in the recommended services. You may monitor and document the employee's participation in the recommended services. You may also make use of SAP and employee assistance program (EAP) services in assisting and monitoring employees' compliance with SAP recommendations. Nothing in this section permits an employer to fail to carry out its obligations with respect to follow-up testing (see § 40.309).</P>
            <P>(c) As an employee, you are obligated to comply with the SAP's recommendations for these services. If you fail or refuse to do so, you may be subject to disciplinary action by your employer.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How does the return-to-duty process conclude?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As the employer, if you decide that you want to permit the employee to return to the performance of safety-sensitive functions, you must ensure that the employee takes a return-to-duty test. This test cannot occur until after the SAP has determined that the employee has successfully complied with prescribed education and/or treatment. The employee must have a negative drug test result and/or an alcohol test with an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02 before resuming performance of safety-sensitive duties.</P>
            <P>(b) As an employer, you must not return an employee to safety-sensitive duties until the employee meets the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section. However, you are not required to return an employee to safety-sensitive duties because the employee has met these conditions. That is a personnel decision that you have the discretion to make, subject to collective bargaining agreements or other legal requirements.</P>
            <P>(c) As a SAP or MRO, you must not make a “fitness for duty” determination as part of this re-evaluation unless required to do so under an applicable DOT agency regulation. It is the employer, rather than you, who must decide whether to put the employee back to work in a safety-sensitive position.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 40.307</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What is the SAP's function in prescribing the employee's follow-up tests?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As a SAP, for each employee who has committed a DOT drug or alcohol regulation violation, and who seeks to resume the performance of safety-sensitive functions, you must establish a written follow-up testing plan. You do not establish this plan until after you determine that the employee has successfully complied with your recommendations for education and/or treatment.</P>
            <P>(b) You must present a copy of this plan directly to the DER (see § 40.311(d)(9)).</P>
            <P>(c) You are the sole determiner of the number and frequency of follow-up tests and whether these tests will be for drugs, alcohol, or both, unless otherwise directed by the appropriate DOT agency regulation. For example, if the employee had a positive drug test, but your evaluation or the treatment program professionals determined that the employee had an alcohol problem as well, you should require that the employee have follow-up tests for both drugs and alcohol.</P>
            <P>(d) However, you must, at a minimum, direct that the employee be subject to six unannounced follow-up tests in the first 12 months of safety-sensitive duty following the employee's return to safety-sensitive functions.</P>

            <P>(1) You may require a greater number of follow-up tests during the first 12-month period of safety-sensitive duty (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> you may require one test a month during the 12-month period; you may require two tests per month during the first 6-month period and one test per month during the final 6-month period).</P>
            <P>(2) You may also require follow-up tests during the 48 months of safety-sensitive duty following this first 12-month period.</P>
            <P>(3) You are not to establish the actual dates for the follow-up tests you prescribe. The decision on specific dates to test is the employer's.</P>

            <P>(4) As the employer, you must not impose additional testing requirements (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> under company authority) on the employee that go beyond the SAP's follow-up testing plan.</P>

            <P>(e) The requirements of the SAP's follow-up testing plan “follow the employee” to subsequent employers or through breaks in service.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1 to paragraph (e):</HD>
              <P>The employee returns to duty with Employer A. Two months afterward, after completing the first two of six follow-up tests required by the SAP's plan, the employee quits his job with Employer A and begins to work in a similar position for Employer B. The employee remains obligated to complete the four additional tests during the next 10 months of safety-sensitive duty, and Employer B is responsible for ensuring that the employee does so. Employer B learns of this obligation through the inquiry it makes under § 40.25.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2 to paragraph (e):</HD>

              <P>The employee returns to duty with Employer A. Three months later, after the employee completes the first two of six follow-up tests required by the SAP's plan, Employer A lays the employee off for economic or seasonal employment reasons. Four months later, Employer <PRTPAGE P="627"/>A recalls the employee. Employer A must ensure that the employee completes the remaining four follow-up tests during the next nine months.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>(f) As the SAP, you may modify the determinations you have made concerning follow-up tests. For example, even if you recommended follow-up testing beyond the first 12-months, you can terminate the testing requirement at any time after the first year of testing. You must not, however, modify the requirement that the employee take at least six follow-up tests within the first 12 months after returning to the performance of safety-sensitive functions.</P>

            <P>(a) As the employer, you must carry out the SAP's follow-up testing requirements. You may not allow the employee to continue to perform safety-sensitive functions unless follow-up testing is conducted as directed by the SAP.</P>
            <P>(b) You should schedule follow-up tests on dates of your own choosing, but you must ensure that the tests are unannounced with no discernable pattern as to their timing, and that the employee is given no advance notice.</P>

            <P>(b) “Specific written consent” means a statement signed by the employee that he or she agrees to the release of a particular piece of information to a particular, explicitly identified, person or organization at a particular time. “Blanket releases,” in which an employee agrees to a release of a category of information (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> all test results) or to release information to a category of parties (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> other employers who are members of a C/TPA, companies to which the employee may apply for employment), are prohibited under this part.</P>

            <P>(a) As an employer, you may release information pertaining to an employee's drug or alcohol test without the employee's consent in certain legal proceedings.</P>
            <P>(1) These proceedings include a lawsuit (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a wrongful discharge action), grievance (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> an arbitration concerning disciplinary action taken by the employer), or administrative proceeding (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> an unemployment compensation hearing) brought by, or on behalf of, an employee and resulting from a positive DOT drug or alcohol test or a refusal to test (including, but <PRTPAGE P="629"/>not limited to, adulterated or substituted test results).</P>
            <P>(2) These proceedings also include a criminal or civil action resulting from an employee's performance of safety-sensitive duties, in which a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the drug or alcohol test information sought is relevant to the case and issues an order directing the employer to produce the information. For example, in personal injury litigation following a truck or bus collision, the court could determine that a post-accident drug test result of an employee is relevant to determining whether the driver or the driver's employer was negligent. The employer is authorized to respond to the court's order to produce the records.</P>

            <P>(b) In such a proceeding, you may release the information to the decisionmaker in the proceeding (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the court in a lawsuit). You may release the information only with a binding stipulation that the decisionmaker to whom it is released will make it available only to parties to the proceeding.</P>

            <P>(c) If you are a service agent, and the employer requests its employee's drug or alcohol testing information from you to use in a legal proceeding as authorized in paragraph (a) of this section (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the laboratory's data package), you must provide the requested information to the employer.</P>

            <P>(1) Access to your facilities used for this part and DOT agency drug and alcohol program functions.</P>
            <P>(2) All written, printed, and computer-based drug and alcohol program records and reports (including copies of name-specific records or reports), files, materials, data, documents/documentation, agreements, contracts, policies, and statements that are required by this part and DOT agency regulations. You must provide this information at your principal place of business in the time required by the DOT agency.</P>
            <P>(3) All items in paragraph (c)(2) of this section must be easily accessible, legible, and provided in an organized manner. If electronic records do not meet these standards, they must be converted to printed documentation that meets these standards.</P>
            <P>(d) If requested by the National Transportation Safety Board as part of an accident investigation, you must provide information concerning post-accident tests administered after the accident.</P>
            <P>(e) If requested by a Federal, state or local safety agency with regulatory authority over you or the employee, you must provide drug and alcohol test records concerning the employee.</P>

            <P>(f) Except as otherwise provided in this part, as a laboratory you must not release or provide a specimen or a part of a specimen to a requesting party, without first obtaining written consent from ODAPC. DNA testing and other types of identity testing are not authorized and ODAPC will not give permission for such testing. If a party seeks a court order directing you to release a specimen or part of a specimen contrary to any provision of this part, you must take necessary legal steps to contest the issuance of the order (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> seek to quash a subpoena, citing the requirements of § 40.13).

            <SUBJECT>What records must employers keep?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As an employer, you must keep the following records for the following periods of time:</P>
            <P>(1) You must keep the following records for five years:</P>
            <P>(i) Records of alcohol test results indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater;</P>
            <P>(ii) Records of verified positive drug test results;</P>
            <P>(iii) Documentation of refusals to take required alcohol and/or drug tests (including substituted or adulterated drug test results);</P>
            <P>(iv) SAP reports; and</P>
            <P>(v) All follow-up tests and schedules for follow-up tests.</P>
            <P>(2) You must keep records for three years of information obtained from previous employers under § 40.25 concerning drug and alcohol test results of employees.</P>
            <P>(3) You must keep records of the inspection, maintenance, and calibration of EBTs, for two years.</P>
            <P>(4) You must keep records of negative and cancelled drug test results and alcohol test results with a concentration of less than 0.02 for one year.</P>

            <P>(b) You do not have to keep records related to a program requirement that does not apply to you (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a maritime employer who does not have a DOT-mandated random alcohol testing program need not maintain random alcohol testing records).</P>
            <P>(c) You must maintain the records in a location with controlled access.</P>
            <P>(d) A service agent may maintain these records for you. However, you must ensure that you can produce these records at your principal place of business in the time required by the DOT agency. For example, as a motor carrier, when an FMCSA inspector requests your records, you must ensure that you can provide them within two business days.</P>
            <P>(e) If you store records electronically, where permitted by this part, you must ensure that the records are easily accessible, legible, and formatted and stored in an organized manner. If electronic records do not meet these criteria, you must convert them to printed documentation in a rapid and readily auditable manner, at the request of DOT agency personnel.</P>

            <SUBJECT>In what circumstances may a C/TPA act as an intermediary in the transmission of drug and alcohol testing information to employers?</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) As a C/TPA or other service agent, you may act as an intermediary in the transmission of drug and alcohol testing information in the circumstances specified in this section only if the employer chooses to have you do so. Each employer makes the decision about whether to receive some or all of this information from you, acting as an intermediary, rather than directly from the service agent who originates the information (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> an MRO or BAT).</P>
            <P>(b) The specific provisions of this part concerning which you may act as an intermediary are listed in Appendix F to this part. These are the only situations in which you may act as an intermediary. You are prohibited from doing so in all other situations.</P>

            <P>(c) In every case, you must ensure that, in transmitting information to employers, you meet all requirements <PRTPAGE P="632"/>(<E T="03">e.g.,</E> concerning confidentiality and timing) that would apply if the service agent originating the information (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> an MRO or collector) sent the information directly to the employer. For example, if you transmit drug testing results from MROs to DERs, you must transmit each drug test result to the DER in compliance with the MRO requirements set forth in § 40.167 .</P>

            <P>As a C/TPA, except as otherwise specified in this part, you may perform the following functions for employers concerning random selection and other selections for testing.</P>

            <P>(a) You may operate random testing programs for employers and may assist (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> through contracting with laboratories or collection sites, conducting collections) employers with other types of testing (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> pre-employment, post-accident, reasonable suspicion, return-to-duty, and follow-up).</P>
            <P>(b) You may combine employees from more than one employer or one transportation industry in a random pool if permitted by all the DOT agency drug and alcohol testing regulations involved.</P>
            <P>(1) If you combine employees from more than one transportation industry, you must ensure that the random testing rate is at least equal to the highest rate required by each DOT agency.</P>
            <P>(2) Employees not covered by DOT agency regulations may not be part of the same random pool with DOT covered employees.</P>
            <P>(c) You may assist employers in ensuring that follow-up testing is conducted in accordance with the plan established by the SAP. However, neither you nor the employer are permitted to randomly select employees from a “follow-up pool” for follow-up testing.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 40.349</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What records may a service agent receive and maintain?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Except where otherwise specified in this part, as a service agent you may receive and maintain all records concerning DOT drug and alcohol testing programs, including positive, negative, and refusal to test individual test results. You do not need the employee's consent to receive and maintain these records.</P>

            <P>(b) You may maintain all information needed for operating a drug/alcohol program (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> CCFs, ATFs, names of employees in random pools, random selection lists, copies of notices to employers of selected employees) on behalf of an employer.</P>
            <P>(c) If a service agent originating drug or alcohol testing information, such as an MRO or BAT, sends the information directly to the DER, he or she may also provide the information simultaneously to you, as a C/TPA or other service agent who maintains this information for the employer.</P>
            <P>(d) If you are serving as an intermediary in transmitting information that is required to be provided to the employer, you must ensure that it reaches the employer in the same time periods required elsewhere in this part.</P>
            <P>(e) You must ensure that you can make available to the employer within two business days any information the employer is asked to produce by a DOT agency representative.</P>
            <P>(f) On request of an employer, you must, at any time on the request of an employer, transfer immediately all records pertaining to the employer and its employees to the employer or to any other service agent the employer designates. You must carry out this transfer as soon as the employer requests it. You are not required to obtain employee consent for this transfer. You must not charge more than your reasonable administrative costs for conducting this transfer. You may not charge a fee for the release of these records.</P>

            <P>(g) If you are planning to go out of business or your organization will be bought by or merged with another organization, you must immediately notify all employers and offer to transfer all records pertaining to the employer and its employees to the employer or to any other service agent the employer designates. You must carry out this transfer as soon as the employer requests it. You are not required to obtain employee consent for this transfer. You must not charge more than your reasonable administrative costs for conducting this transfer. You may <PRTPAGE P="633"/>not charge a fee for the release of these records.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What confidentiality requirements apply to service agents?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Except where otherwise specified in this part, as a service agent the following confidentiality requirements apply to you:</P>

            <P>(a) When you receive or maintain confidential information about employees (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> individual test results), you must follow the same confidentiality regulations as the employer with respect to the use and release of this information.</P>
            <P>(b) You must follow all confidentiality and records retention requirements applicable to employers.</P>
            <P>(c) You may not provide individual test results or other confidential information to another employer without a specific, written consent from the employee. For example, suppose you are a C/TPA that has employers X and Y as clients. Employee Jones works for X, and you maintain Jones' drug and alcohol test for X. Jones wants to change jobs and work for Y. You may not inform Y of the result of a test conducted for X without having a specific, written consent from Jones. Likewise, you may not provide this information to employer Z, who is not a C/TPA member, without this consent.</P>
            <P>(d) You must not use blanket consent forms authorizing the release of employee testing information.</P>
            <P>(e) You must establish adequate confidentiality and security measures to ensure that confidential employee records are not available to unauthorized persons. This includes protecting the physical security of records, access controls, and computer security measures to safeguard confidential data in electronic data bases.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What principles govern the interaction between MROs and other service agents?</SUBJECT>
            <P>As a service agent other than an MRO (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a C/TPA), the following principles govern your interaction with MROs:</P>
            <P>(a) You may provide MRO services to employers, directly or through contract, if you meet all applicable provisions of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) If you employ or contract for an MRO, the MRO must perform duties independently and confidentially. When you have a relationship with an MRO, you must structure the relationship to ensure that this independence and confidentiality are not compromised. Specific means (including both physical and operational measures, as appropriate) to separate MRO functions and other service agent functions are essential.</P>
            <P>(c) Only your staff who are actually under the day-to-day supervision and control of an MRO with respect to MRO functions may perform these functions. This does not mean that those staff may not perform other functions at other times. However, the designation of your staff to perform MRO functions under MRO supervision must be limited and not used as a subterfuge to circumvent confidentiality and other requirements of this part and DOT agency regulations. You must ensure that MRO staff operate under controls sufficient to ensure that the independence and confidentiality of the MRO process are not compromised.</P>
            <P>(d) Like other MROs, an MRO you employ or contract with must personally conduct verification interviews with employees and must personally make all verification decisions. Consequently, your staff cannot perform these functions.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What limitations apply to the activities of service agents?</SUBJECT>
            <P>As a service agent, you are subject to the following limitations concerning your activities in the DOT drug and alcohol testing program.</P>
            <P>(a) You must not require an employee to sign a consent, release, waiver of liability, or indemnification agreement with respect to any part of the drug or alcohol testing process covered by this part (including, but not limited to, collections, laboratory testing, MRO, and SAP services). No one may do so on behalf of a service agent.</P>

            <P>(b) You must not act as an intermediary in the transmission of drug test results from the laboratory to the MRO. That is, the laboratory may not send results to you, with you in turn <PRTPAGE P="634"/>sending them to the MRO for verification. For example, a practice in which the laboratory transmits results to your computer system, and you then assign the results to a particular MRO, is not permitted.</P>
            <P>(c) You must not transmit drug test results directly from the laboratory to the employer (by electronic or other means) or to a service agent who forwards them to the employer. All confirmed laboratory results must be processed by the MRO before they are released to any other party.</P>
            <P>(d) You must not act as an intermediary in the transmission of alcohol test results of 0.02 or higher from the STT or BAT to the DER.</P>
            <P>(e) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, you must not act as an intermediary in the transmission of individual SAP reports to the actual employer. That is, the SAP may not send such reports to you, with you in turn sending them to the actual employer. However, you may maintain individual SAP summary reports and follow-up testing plans after they are sent to the DER, and the SAP may transmit such reports to you simultaneously with sending them to the DER.</P>
            <P>(f) As an exception to paragraph (e) of this section, you may act as an intermediary in the transmission of SAP report from the SAP to an owner-operator or other self-employed individual.</P>
            <P>(g) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, you must not make decisions to test an employee based upon reasonable suspicion, post-accident, return-to-duty, and follow-up determination criteria. These are duties the actual employer cannot delegate to a C/TPA. You may, however, provide advice and information to employers regarding these testing issues and how the employer should schedule required testing.</P>
            <P>(h) As an exception to paragraph (g) of this section, you may make decisions to test an employee based upon reasonable suspicion, post-accident, return-to-duty, and follow-up determination criteria with respect to an owner-operator or other self-employed individual.</P>
            <P>(i) Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, you must not make a determination that an employee has refused a drug or alcohol test. This is a non-delegable duty of the actual employer. You may, however, provide advice and information to employers regarding refusal-to-test issues.</P>
            <P>(j) As an exception to paragraph (i) of this section, you may make a determination that an employee has refused a drug or alcohol test, if:</P>
            <P>(1) You schedule a required test for an owner-operator or other self-employed individual, and the individual fails to appear for the test without a legitimate reason; or</P>
            <P>(2) As an MRO, you determine that an individual has refused to test on the basis of adulteration or substitution.</P>
            <P>(k) You must not act as a DER. For example, while you may be responsible for transmitting information to the employer about test results, you must not act on behalf of the employer in actions to remove employees from safety-sensitive duties.</P>
            <P>(l) In transmitting documents to laboratories, you must ensure that you send to the laboratory that conducts testing only Copy 1 of the CCF. You must not transmit other copies of the CCF or any ATFs to the laboratory.</P>
            <P>(m) You must not impose conditions or requirements on employers that DOT regulations do not authorize. For example, as a C/TPA serving employers in the pipeline or motor carrier industry, you must not require employers to have provisions in their DOT plans that PHMSA or FMCSA regulations do not require.</P>

            <P>(n) You must not intentionally delay the transmission of drug or alcohol testing-related documents concerning actions you have performed, because of a payment dispute or other reasons.

            <P>(a) To protect the public interest, including protecting transportation employers and employees from serious noncompliance with DOT drug and alcohol testing rules, the Department's policy is to ensure that employers conduct business only with responsible service agents.</P>
            <P>(b) The Department therefore uses PIEs to exclude from participation in DOT's drug and alcohol testing program any service agent who, by serious noncompliance with this part or other DOT agency drug and alcohol testing regulations, has shown that it is not currently acting in a responsible manner.</P>
            <P>(c) A PIE is a serious action that the Department takes only to protect the public interest. We intend to use PIEs only to remedy situations of serious noncompliance. PIEs are not used for the purpose of punishment.</P>
            <P>(d) Nothing in this subpart precludes a DOT agency or the Inspector General from taking other action authorized by its regulations with respect to service agents or employers that violate its regulations.</P>

            <P>(a) If you are a service agent, the Department may issue a PIE concerning you if we determine that you have failed or refused to provide drug or alcohol testing services consistent with the requirements of this part or a DOT agency drug and alcohol regulation.</P>
            <P>(b) The Department also may issue a PIE if you have failed to cooperate with DOT agency representatives concerning inspections, complaint investigations, compliance and enforcement reviews, or requests for documents and other information about compliance with this part or DOT agency drug and alcohol regulations.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What is the Department's policy concerning starting a PIE proceeding?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) It is the Department's policy to start a PIE proceeding only in cases of serious, uncorrected noncompliance with the provisions of this part, affecting such matters as safety, the outcomes of test results, privacy and confidentiality, due process and fairness for employees, the honesty and integrity of the testing program, and cooperation with or provision of information to DOT agency representatives.</P>
            <P>(b) The following are examples of the kinds of serious noncompliance that, as a matter of policy, the Department views as appropriate grounds for starting a PIE proceeding. These examples are not intended to be an exhaustive or exclusive list of the grounds for starting a PIE proceeding. We intend them to illustrate the level of seriousness that the Department believes supports starting a PIE proceeding. The examples follow:</P>
            <P>(1) For an MRO, verifying tests positive without interviewing the employees as required by this part or providing MRO services without meeting the qualifications for an MRO required by this part;</P>

            <P>(2) For a laboratory, refusing to provide information to the Department, an employer, or an employee as required by this part; failing or refusing to conduct a validity testing program when required by this part; or a pattern or practice of testing errors that result in the cancellation of tests. (As a general matter of policy, the Department does not intend to initiate a PIE proceeding concerning a laboratory with respect to matters on which HHS initiates certification actions under its laboratory guidelines.);<PRTPAGE P="636"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) For a collector, a pattern or practice of directly observing collections when doing so is unauthorized, or failing or refusing to directly observe collections when doing so is mandatory;</P>
            <P>(4) For collectors, BATs, or STTs, a pattern or practice of using forms, testing equipment, or collection kits that do not meet the standards in this part;</P>
            <P>(5) For a collector, BAT, or STT, a pattern or practice of “fatal flaws” or other significant uncorrected errors in the collection process;</P>
            <P>(6) For a laboratory, MRO or C/TPA, failing or refusing to report tests results as required by this part or DOT agency regulations;</P>
            <P>(7) For a laboratory, falsifying, concealing, or destroying documentation concerning any part of the drug testing process, including, but not limited to, documents in a “litigation package”;</P>

            <P>The following DOT officials may initiate a PIE proceeding:</P>
            <P>(a) The drug and alcohol program manager of a DOT agency;</P>

            <SUBJECT>What is the discretion of an initiating official in starting a PIE proceeding?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Initiating officials have broad discretion in deciding whether to start a PIE proceeding.</P>
            <P>(b) In exercising this discretion, the initiating official must consider the Department's policy regarding the seriousness of the service agent's conduct (see § 40.365) and all information he or she has obtained to this point concerning the facts of the case. The initiating official may also consider the availability of the resources needed to pursue a PIE proceeding.</P>
            <P>(c) A decision not to initiate a PIE proceeding does not necessarily mean that the Department regards a service agent as being in compliance or that the Department may not use other applicable remedies in a situation of noncompliance.</P>

            <SUBJECT>On what information does an initiating official rely in deciding whether to start a PIE proceeding?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) An initiating official may rely on credible information from any source as the basis for starting a PIE proceeding.</P>

            <P>(b) Before sending a correction notice (see § 40.373), the initiating official informally contacts the service agent to determine if there is any information that may affect the initiating official's <PRTPAGE P="637"/>determination about whether it is necessary to send a correction notice. The initiating official may take any information resulting from this contact into account in determining whether to proceed under this subpart.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Before starting a PIE proceeding, does the initiating official give the service agent an opportunity to correct problems?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If you are a service agent, the initiating official must send you a correction notice before starting a PIE proceeding.</P>
            <P>(b) The correction notice identifies the specific areas in which you must come into compliance in order to avoid being subject to a PIE proceeding.</P>
            <P>(c) If you make and document changes needed to come into compliance in the areas listed in the correction notice to the satisfaction of the initiating official within 60 days of the date you receive the notice, the initiating official does not start a PIE proceeding. The initiating official may conduct appropriate fact finding to verify that you have made and maintained satisfactory corrections. When he or she is satisfied that you are in compliance, the initiating official sends you a notice that the matter is concluded.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How does the initiating official start a PIE proceeding?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As a service agent, if your compliance matter is not correctable (see § 40.373(a)), or if have not resolved compliance matters as provided in § 40.373(c), the initiating official starts a PIE proceeding by sending you a notice of proposed exclusion (NOPE). The NOPE contains the initiating official's recommendations concerning the issuance of a PIE, but it is not a decision by the Department to issue a PIE.</P>
            <P>(b) The NOPE includes the following information:</P>
            <P>(1) A statement that the initiating official is recommending that the Department issue a PIE concerning you;</P>
            <P>(2) The factual basis for the initiating official's belief that you are not providing drug and/or alcohol testing services to DOT-regulated employers consistent with the requirements of this part or are in serious noncompliance with a DOT agency drug and alcohol regulation;</P>
            <P>(3) The factual basis for the initiating official's belief that your noncompliance has not been or cannot be corrected;</P>
            <P>(4) The initiating official's recommendation for the scope of the PIE;</P>
            <P>(5) The initiating official's recommendation for the duration of the PIE; and</P>
            <P>(6) A statement that you may contest the issuance of the proposed PIE, as provided in § 40.379.</P>
            <P>(c) The initiating official sends a copy of the NOPE to the ODAPC Director at the same time he or she sends the NOPE to you.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Who decides whether to issue a PIE?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The ODAPC Director, or his or her designee, decides whether to issue a PIE. If a designee is acting as the decisionmaker, all references in this subpart to the Director refer to the designee.</P>
            <P>(b) To ensure his or her impartiality, the Director plays no role in the initiating official's determination about whether to start a PIE proceeding.</P>
            <P>(c) There is a “firewall” between the initiating official and the Director. This means that the initiating official and the Director are prohibited from having any discussion, contact, or exchange of information with one another about the matter, except for documents and discussions that are part of the record of the proceeding.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How do you contest the issuance of a PIE?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If you receive a NOPE, you may contest the issuance of the PIE.</P>
            <P>(b) If you want to contest the proposed PIE, you must provide the Director information and argument in opposition to the proposed PIE in writing, in person, and/or through a representative. To contest the proposed PIE, you must take one or more of the steps listed in this paragraph (b) within 30 days after you receive the NOPE.</P>

            <P>(1) You may request that the Director dismiss the proposed PIE without further proceedings, on the basis that <PRTPAGE P="638"/>it does not concern serious noncompliance with this part or DOT agency regulations, consistent with the Department's policy as stated in § 40.365.</P>
            <P>(2) You may present written information and arguments, consistent with the provisions of § 40.381, contesting the proposed PIE.</P>
            <P>(3) You may arrange with the Director for an informal meeting to present your information and arguments.</P>

            <P>(c) If you do not take any of the actions listed in paragraph (b) of this section within 30 days after you receive the NOPE, the matter proceeds as an uncontested case. In this event, the Director makes his or her decision based on the record provided by the initiating official (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the NOPE and any supporting information or testimony) and any additional information the Director obtains.</P>

            <P>(1) Specific facts that contradict the statements contained in the NOPE (see § 40.375(b)(2) and (3)). A general denial is insufficient to raise a genuine dispute over facts material to the issuance of a PIE;</P>
            <P>(2) Identification of any existing, proposed or prior PIE; and</P>
            <P>(3) Identification of your affiliates, if any.</P>
            <P>(b) You may provide any information and arguments you wish concerning the proposed issuance, scope and duration of the PIE (see § 40.375(b)(4) and (5)).</P>
            <P>(c) You may provide any additional relevant information or arguments concerning any of the issues in the matter.</P>

            <P>(a) DOT conducts PIE proceedings in a fair and informal manner. The Director may use flexible procedures to allow you to present matters in opposition. The Director is not required to follow formal rules of evidence or procedure in creating the record of the proceeding.</P>
            <P>(b) The Director will consider any information or argument he or she determines to be relevant to the decision on the matter.</P>
            <P>(c) You may submit any documentary evidence you want the Director to consider. In addition, if you have arranged an informal meeting with the Director, you may present witnesses and confront any person the initiating official presents as a witness against you.</P>
            <P>(d) In cases where there are material factual issues in dispute, the Director or his or her designee may conduct additional fact-finding.</P>
            <P>(e) If you have arranged a meeting with the Director, the Director will make a transcribed record of the meeting available to you on your request. You must pay the cost of transcribing and copying the meeting record.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Who bears the burden of proof in a PIE proceeding?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As the proponent of issuing a PIE, the initiating official bears the burden of proof.</P>
            <P>(b) This burden is to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the service agent was in serious noncompliance with the requirements of this part for drug and/or alcohol testing-related services or with the requirements of another DOT agency drug and alcohol testing regulation.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 40.387</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What matters does the Director decide concerning a proposed PIE?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Following the service agent's response (see § 40.379(b)) or, if no response is received, after 30 days have passed from the date on which the service agent received the NOPE, the Director may take one of the following steps:</P>
            <P>(1) In response to a request from the service agent (see § 40.379(b)(1)) or on his or her own motion, the Director may dismiss a PIE proceeding if he or she determines that it does not concern serious noncompliance with this part or DOT agency regulations, consistent with the Department's policy as stated in § 40.365.</P>

            <P>(i) If the Director dismisses a proposed PIE under this paragraph (a), the <PRTPAGE P="639"/>action is closed with respect to the noncompliance alleged in the NOPE.</P>
            <P>(ii) The Department may initiate a new PIE proceeding against you on the basis of different or subsequent conduct that is in noncompliance with this part or other DOT drug and alcohol testing rules.</P>
            <P>(2) If the Director determines that the initiating official's submission does not have complete information needed for a decision, the Director may remand the matter to the initiating official. The initiating official may resubmit the matter to the Director when the needed information is complete. If the basis for the proposed PIE has changed, the initiating official must send an amended NOPE to the service agent.</P>
            <P>(b) The Director makes determinations concerning the following matters in any PIE proceeding that he or she decides on the merits:</P>
            <P>(1) Any material facts that are in dispute;</P>
            <P>(2) Whether the facts support issuing a PIE;</P>
            <P>(3) The scope of any PIE that is issued; and</P>
            <P>(4) The duration of any PIE that is issued.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What factors may the Director consider?</SUBJECT>
            <P>This section lists examples of the kind of mitigating and aggravating factors that the Director may consider in determining whether to issue a PIE concerning you, as well as the scope and duration of a PIE. This list is not exhaustive or exclusive. The Director may consider other factors if appropriate in the circumstances of a particular case. The list of examples follows:</P>
            <P>(a) The actual or potential harm that results or may result from your noncompliance;</P>
            <P>(b) The frequency of incidents and/or duration of the noncompliance;</P>
            <P>(c) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of noncompliance;</P>
            <P>(d) Whether the noncompliance was pervasive within your organization, including such factors as the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Whether and to what extent your organization planned, initiated, or carried out the noncompliance;</P>
            <P>(2) The positions held by individuals involved in the noncompliance, and whether your principals tolerated their noncompliance; and</P>
            <P>(3) Whether you had effective standards of conduct and control systems (both with respect to your own organization and any contractors or affiliates) at the time the noncompliance occurred;</P>
            <P>(e) Whether you have demonstrated an appropriate compliance disposition, including such factors as the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Whether you have accepted responsibility for the noncompliance and recognize the seriousness of the conduct that led to the cause for issuance of the PIE;</P>
            <P>(2) Whether you have cooperated fully with the Department during the investigation. The Director may consider when the cooperation began and whether you disclosed all pertinent information known to you;</P>
            <P>(3) Whether you have fully investigated the circumstances of the noncompliance forming the basis for the PIE and, if so, have made the result of the investigation available to the Director;</P>
            <P>(4) Whether you have taken appropriate disciplinary action against the individuals responsible for the activity that constitutes the grounds for issuance of the PIE; and</P>
            <P>(5) Whether your organization has taken appropriate corrective actions or remedial measures, including implementing actions to prevent recurrence;</P>
            <P>(f) With respect to noncompliance with a DOT agency regulation, the degree to which the noncompliance affects matters common to the DOT drug and alcohol testing program;</P>
            <P>(g) Other factors appropriate to the circumstances of the case.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 40.391</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What is the scope of a PIE?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The scope of a PIE is the Department's determination about the divisions, organizational elements, types of services, affiliates, and/or individuals (including direct employees of a service agent and its contractors) to which a PIE applies.</P>

            <P>(b) If, as a service agent, the Department issues a PIE concerning you, the <PRTPAGE P="640"/>PIE applies to all your divisions, organizational elements, and types of services that are involved with or affected by the noncompliance that forms the factual basis for issuing the PIE.</P>
            <P>(c) In the NOPE (see § 40.375(b)(4)), the initiating official sets forth his or her recommendation for the scope of the PIE. The proposed scope of the PIE is one of the elements of the proceeding that the service agent may contest (see § 40.381(b)) and about which the Director makes a decision (see § 40.387(b)(3)).</P>
            <P>(d) In recommending and deciding the scope of the PIE, the initiating official and Director, respectively, must take into account the provisions of paragraphs (e) through (j) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) The pervasiveness of the noncompliance within a service agent's organization (see § 40.389(d)) is an important consideration in determining the scope of a PIE. The appropriate scope of a PIE grows broader as the pervasiveness of the noncompliance increases.</P>
            <P>(f) The application of a PIE is not limited to the specific location or employer at which the conduct that forms the factual basis for issuing the PIE was discovered.</P>
            <P>(g) A PIE applies to your affiliates, if the affiliate is involved with or affected by the conduct that forms the factual basis for issuing the PIE.</P>
            <P>(h) A PIE applies to individuals who are officers, employees, directors, shareholders, partners, or other individuals associated with your organization in the following circumstances:</P>
            <P>(1) Conduct forming any part of the factual basis of the PIE occurred in connection with the individual's performance of duties by or on behalf of your organization; or</P>
            <P>(2) The individual knew of, had reason to know of, approved, or acquiesced in such conduct. The individual's acceptance of benefits derived from such conduct is evidence of such knowledge, acquiescence, or approval.</P>
            <P>(i) If a contractor to your organization is solely responsible for the conduct that forms the factual basis for a PIE, the PIE does not apply to the service agent itself unless the service agent knew or should have known about the conduct and did not take action to correct it.</P>
            <P>(j) PIEs do not apply to drug and alcohol testing that DOT does not regulate.</P>

            <P>(k) The following examples illustrate how the Department intends the provisions of this section to work:
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1 to § 40.391.</HD>
              <P>Service Agent P provides a variety of drug testing services. P's SAP services are involved in a serious violation of this Part 40. However, P's other services fully comply with this part, and P's overall management did not plan or concur in the noncompliance, which in fact was contrary to P's articulated standards. Because the noncompliance was isolated in one area of the organization's activities, and did not pervade the entire organization, the scope of the PIE could be limited to SAP services.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2 to § 40.391.</HD>
              <P>Service Agent Q provides a similar variety of services. The conduct forming the factual basis for a PIE concerns collections for a transit authority. As in Example 1, the noncompliance is not pervasive throughout Q's organization. The PIE would apply to collections at all locations served by Q, not just the particular transit authority or not just in the state in which the transit authority is located.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 3 to § 40.391.</HD>
              <P>Service Agent R provides a similar array of services. One or more of the following problems exists: R's activities in several areas—collections, MROs, SAPs, protecting the confidentiality of information—are involved in serious noncompliance; DOT determines that R's management knew or should have known about serious noncompliance in one or more areas, but management did not take timely corrective action; or, in response to an inquiry from DOT personnel, R's management refuses to provide information about its operations. In each of these three cases, the scope of the PIE would include all aspects of R's services.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 4 to § 40.391.</HD>
              <P>Service Agent W provides only one kind of service (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> laboratory or MRO services). The Department issues a PIE concerning these services. Because W only provides this one kind of service, the PIE necessarily applies to all its operations.</P>

            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 5 to § 40.391.</HD>
              <P>Service Agent X, by exercising reasonably prudent oversight of its collection contractor, should have known that the contractor was making numerous “fatal flaws” in tests. Alternatively, X received a correction notice pointing out these problems in its contractor's collections. In neither case did X take action to correct the problem. X, as well as the contractor, would be subject to a PIE with respect to collections.</P>

              <P>Service Agent Y could not reasonably have known that one of its MROs was regularly failing to interview employees before verifying tests positive. When it received a correction notice, Y immediately dismissed the erring MRO. In this case, the MRO would be subject to a PIE but Y would not.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 7 to § 40.391.</HD>
              <P>The Department issues a PIE with respect to Service Agent Z. Z provides services for DOT-regulated transportation employers, a Federal agency under the HHS-regulated Federal employee testing program, and various private businesses and public agencies that DOT does not regulate. The PIE applies only to the DOT-regulated transportation employers with respect to their DOT-mandated testing, not to the Federal agency or the other public agencies and private businesses. The PIE does not prevent the non-DOT regulated entities from continuing to use Z's services.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How does the Department notify employers and the public about a PIE?</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The Department maintains a document called the “List of Excluded Drug and Alcohol Service Agents.” This document may be found on the Department's web site (<E T="03">http://www.transportation.gov/odapc</E>) . You may also request a copy of the document from ODAPC.</P>
            <P>(b) When the Director issues a PIE, he or she adds to the List the name and address of the service agent, and any other persons or organizations, to whom the PIE applies and information about the scope and duration of the PIE.</P>
            <P>(c) When a service agent ceases to be subject to a PIE, the Director removes this information from the List.</P>
            <P>(d) The Department also publishes a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice to inform the public on any occasion on which a service agent is added to or taken off the List.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Must a service agent notify its clients when the Department issues a PIE?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As a service agent, if the Department issues a PIE concerning you, you must notify each of your DOT-regulated employer clients, in writing, about the issuance, scope, duration, and effect of the PIE. You may meet this requirement by sending a copy of the Director's PIE decision or by a separate notice. You must send this notice to each client within three business days of receiving from the Department the notice provided for in § 40.399(b).</P>
            <P>(b) As part of the notice you send under paragraph (a) of this section, you must offer to transfer immediately all records pertaining to the employer and its employees to the employer or to any other service agent the employer designates. You must carry out this transfer as soon as the employer requests it.</P>

            <SUBJECT>May the Federal courts review PIE decisions?</SUBJECT>

            <P>The Director's decision is a final administrative action of the Department. Like all final administrative actions of Federal agencies, the Director's decision is subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 <E T="03">et. seq</E>).</P>

            <SUBJECT>May a service agent ask to have a PIE reduced or terminated?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Yes, as a service agent concerning whom the Department has issued a PIE, you may request that the Director terminate a PIE or reduce its duration and/or scope. This process is limited to the issues of duration and scope. It is not an appeal or reconsideration of the decision to issue the PIE.</P>
            <P>(b) Your request must be in writing and supported with documentation.</P>
            <P>(c) You must wait at least nine months from the date on which the Director issued the PIE to make this request.</P>
            <P>(d) The initiating official who was the proponent of the PIE may provide information and arguments concerning your request to the Director.</P>
            <P>(e) If the Director verifies that the sources of your noncompliance have been eliminated and that all drug or alcohol testing-related services you would provide to DOT-regulated employers will be consistent with the requirements of this part, the Director may issue a notice terminating or reducing the PIE.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 40.409</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What does the issuance of a PIE mean to transportation employers?</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) As an employer, you are deemed to have notice of the issuance of a PIE when it appears on the List mentioned in § 40.401(a) or the notice of the PIE appears in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as provided in § 40.401(d). You should check this List to ensure that any service agents you are using or planning to use are not subject to a PIE.</P>

            <P>(b) As an employer who is using a service agent concerning whom a PIE is issued, you must stop using the services of the service agent no later than 90 days after the Department has published the decision in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or posted it on its web site. You may apply to the ODAPC Director for an extension of 30 days if you demonstrate that you cannot find a substitute service agent within 90 days.</P>

            <P>(c) Except during the period provided in paragraph (b) of this section, you must not, as an employer, use the services of a service agent that are covered by a PIE that the Director has issued under this subpart. If you do so, you are in violation of the Department's regulations and subject to applicable DOT agency sanctions (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> civil penalties, withholding of Federal financial assistance).</P>

            <P>(d) You also must not obtain drug or alcohol testing services through a contractor or affiliate of the service agent to whom the PIE applies.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example to paragraph (d):</HD>
              <P>Service Agent R was subject to a PIE with respect to SAP services. As an employer, not only must you not use R's own SAP services, but you also must not use SAP services you arrange through R, such as services provided by a subcontractor or affiliate of R or a person or organization that receives financial gain from its relationship with R.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            

            <P>(e) This section's prohibition on using the services of a service agent concerning which the Director has issued a PIE applies to employers in all <PRTPAGE P="643"/>industries subject to DOT drug and alcohol testing regulations.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example to paragraph (e):</HD>
              <P>The initiating official for a PIE was the FAA drug and alcohol program manager, and the conduct forming the basis of the PIE pertained to the aviation industry. As a motor carrier, transit authority, pipeline, railroad, or maritime employer, you are also prohibited from using the services of the service agent involved in connection with the DOT drug and alcohol testing program.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            

            <P>(f) The issuance of a PIE does not result in the cancellation of drug or alcohol tests conducted using the service agent involved before the issuance of the Director's decision or up to 90 days following its publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or posting on the Department's web site, unless otherwise specified in the Director's PIE decision or the Director grants an extension as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

            </P>
            <P>a. Single-use container, made of plastic, large enough to easily catch and hold at least 55 mL of urine voided from the body.</P>
            <P>b. Must have graduated volume markings clearly noting levels of 45 mL and above.</P>

            <P>c. Must have a temperature strip providing graduated temperature readings 32-38 °C/90-100 °F, that is affixed or can be affixed at a proper level on the outside of the collection container. Other methodologies (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> temperature device built into the wall of the container) are acceptable provided the temperature measurement is accurate and such that there is no potential for contamination of the specimen.</P>
            <P>d. Must be individually wrapped in a sealed plastic bag or shrink wrapping; or must have a peelable, sealed lid or other easily visible tamper-evident system.</P>
            <P>e. May be made available separately at collection sites to address shy bladder situations when several voids may be required to complete the testing process.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Plastic Specimen Bottles</E>
            </P>
            <P>a. Each bottle must be large enough to hold at least 35 mL; or alternatively, they may be two distinct sizes of specimen bottles provided that the bottle designed to hold the primary specimen holds at least 35 mL of urine and the bottle designed to hold the split specimen holds at least 20 mL.</P>
            <P>b. Must have screw-on or snap-on caps that prevent seepage of the urine from the bottles during shipment.</P>

            <P>c. Must have markings clearly indicating the appropriate levels (30 mL for the primary specimen and 15 mL for the split) of urine that must be poured into the bottles.<PRTPAGE P="644"/>
            </P>
            <P>d. Must be designed so that the required tamper-evident bottle seals made available on the CCF fit with no damage to the seal when the employee initials it nor with the chance that the seal overlap would conceal printed information.</P>
            <P>e. Must be wrapped (with caps) together in a sealed plastic bag or shrink wrapping separate from the collection container; or must be wrapped (with cap) individually in sealed plastic bags or shrink wrapping; or must have peelable, sealed lid or other easily visible tamper-evident system.</P>
            <P>f. Plastic material must be leach resistant.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Leak-Resistant Plastic Bag</E>
            </P>
            <P>a. Must have two sealable compartments or pouches which are leak-resistant; one large enough to hold two specimen bottles and the other large enough to hold the CCF paperwork.</P>
            <P>b. The sealing methodology must be such that once the compartments are sealed, any tampering or attempts to open either compartment will be evident.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Absorbent material</E>
            </P>
            <P>Each kit must contain enough absorbent material to absorb the entire contents of both specimen bottles. Absorbent material must be designed to fit inside the leak-resistant plastic bag pouch into which the specimen bottles are placed.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Shipping Container</E>
            </P>

            <P>a. Must be designed to adequately protect the specimen bottles from shipment damage in the transport of specimens from the collection site to the laboratory (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> standard courier box, small cardboard box, plastic container).</P>
            <P>b. May be made available separately at collection sites rather than being part of an actual kit sent to collection sites.</P>
            <P>c. A shipping container is not necessary if a laboratory courier hand-delivers the specimen bottles in the plastic leak-proof bags from the collection site to the laboratory.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix E to Part 40—SAP Equivalency Requirements for Certification Organizations</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Experience:</E> Minimum requirements are for three years of full-time supervised experience or 6,000 hours of supervised experience as an alcoholism and/or drug abuse counselor. The supervision must be provided by a licensed or certified practitioner. Supervised experience is important if the individual is to be considered a professional in the field of alcohol and drug abuse evaluation and counseling.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Education:</E> There exists a requirement of 270 contact hours of education and training in alcoholism and/or drug abuse or related training. These hours can take the form of formal education, in-service training, and professional development courses. Part of any professional counselor's development is participation in formal and non-formal education opportunities within the field.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Continuing Education:</E> The certified counselor must receive at least 40-60 hours of continuing education units (CEU) during each two year period. These CEUs are important to the counselor's keeping abreast of changes and improvements in the field.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Testing:</E> A passing score on a national test is a requirement. The test must accurately measure the application of the knowledge, skills, and abilities possessed by the counselor. The test establishes a national standard that must be met to practice.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Testing Validity:</E> The certification examination must be reviewed by an independent authority for validity (examination reliability and relationship to the knowledge, skills, and abilities required by the counseling field). The reliability of the exam is paramount if counselor attributes are to be accurately measured. The examination passing score point must be placed at an appropriate minimal level score as gauged by statistically reliable methodology.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Measurable Knowledge Base:</E> The certification process must be based upon measurable knowledge possessed by the applicant and verified through collateral data and testing. That level of knowledge must be of sufficient quantity to ensure a high quality of SAP evaluation and referral services.</P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Measurable Skills Base:</E> The certification process must be based upon measurable skills possessed by the applicant and verified through collateral data and testing. That level of skills must be of sufficient quality to ensure a high quality of SAP evaluation and referral services.</P>
            <P>8. <E T="03">Quality Assurance Plan:</E> The certification agency must ensure that a means exists to determine that applicant records are verified as being true by the certification staff. This is an important check to ensure that true information is being accepted by the certifying agency.<PRTPAGE P="646"/>
            </P>
            <P>9. <E T="03">Code of Ethics:</E> Certified counselors must pledge to adhere to an ethical standard for practice. It must be understood that code violations could result in de-certification. These standards are vital in maintaining the integrity of practitioners. High ethical standards are required to ensure quality of client care and confidentiality of client information as well as to guard against inappropriate referral practices.</P>
            <P>10. <E T="03">Re-certification Program:</E> Certification is not just a one-time event. It is a continuing privilege with continuing requirements. Among these are continuing education, continuing state certification, and concomitant adherence to the code of ethics. Re-certification serves as a protector of client interests by removing poor performers from the certified practice.</P>
            <P>11. <E T="03">Fifty State Coverage:</E> Certification must be available to qualified counselors in all 50 states and, therefore, the test must be available to qualified applicants in all 50 states. Because many companies are multi-state operators, consistency in SAP evaluation quality and opportunities is paramount. The test need not be given in all 50 states but should be accessible to candidates from all states.</P>
            <P>12. <E T="03">National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA) Accreditation:</E> Having NCCA accreditation is a means of demonstrating to the Department of Transportation that your certification has been reviewed by a panel of impartial experts that have determined that your examination(s) has met stringent and appropriate testing standards.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix F to Part 40—Drug and Alcohol Testing Information that C/TPAs May Transmit to Employers</HD>
            <P>1. If you are a C/TPA, you may, acting as an intermediary, transmit the information in the following sections of this part to the DER for an employer, if the employer chooses to have you do so. These are the only items that you are permitted to transmit to the employer as an intermediary. The use of C/TPA intermediaries is prohibited in all other cases, such as transmission of laboratory drug test results to MROs, the transmission of medical information from MROs to employers, the transmission of SAP reports to employers, the transmission of positive alcohol test results, and the transmission of medical information from MROs to employers.</P>

            <P>2. In every case, you must ensure that, in transmitting the information, you meet all requirements (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> concerning confidentiality and timing) that would apply if the party originating the information (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> an MRO or collector) sent the information directly to the employer. For example, if you transmit MROs' drug testing results to DERs, you must transmit each drug test result to the DER in compliance with the requirements for MROs set forth in § 40.167.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Acceptable model codes.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) This section describes the standards that must be used to meet the seismic design and construction requirements of this part.</P>
          <P>(b)(1) The following are model codes which have been found to provide a level of seismic safety substantially equivalent to that provided by use of the 1988 National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) Recommended Provisions (Copies are available from the Office of Earthquakes and Natural Hazards, Federal Emergency Management Agency, 500 C Street, SW., Washington, DC 20472.):</P>
          <P>(i) The 1991 International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO) Uniform Building Code, published by the International Conference of Building Officials, 5360 South Workman Mill Rd., Whittier, Cal. 90601;</P>
          <P>(ii) The 1992 Supplement to the Building Officials and Code Administrators International (BOCA) National Building Code, published by the Building Officials and Code Administrators, 4051 West Flossmoor Rd., Country Club Hills, Ill. 60478-5795; and</P>
          <P>(iii) The 1992 Amendments to the Southern Building Code Congress (SBCC) Standard Building Code, published by the Southern Building Code Congress International, 900 Montclair Rd., Birmingham, Ala. 35213-1206.</P>
          <P>(2) Versions of the NEHRP seismic maps have been adopted along with the NEHRP Recommended Provisions into the BOCA National and SBCC Standard building codes. The seismic zone map in the ICBO Uniform Building Code is also based on one of the USGS maps of horizontal ground acceleration. However, the ICBO map should be used only with the ICBO code. Also, it is not appropriate to use the NEHRP maps with the ICBO Uniform Building Code, because the design requirements of building codes are keyed to the numerical values of the map they reference.</P>
          <P>(c) Revisions to the model codes listed in paragraph (b) of this section that are substantially equivalent to or exceed the then current or immediately preceding edition of the NEHRP recommended provisions, as it is updated, may be approved by a DOT Operating Administration to meet the requirements in this part.</P>
          <P>(d) State, county, local, or other jurisdictional building ordinances adopting and enforcing the model codes, listed in paragraph (b) of this section, in their entirety, without significant revisions or changes in the direction of less seismic safety, meet the requirements in this part. For ordinances that do not adopt the model codes listed in paragraph (b) of this section, substantial equivalency of the ordinances to the seismic safety level contained in the NEHRP recommended provisions must be determined by the DOT Operating Administration before the ordinances may be used to meet the requirements of this part.</P>
          <P>(e) DOT Operating Administrations that, as of January 5, 1990, required seismic safety levels higher than those imposed by this part in new building construction programs will continue to maintain such levels in force.</P>
          <P>(f) Emergencies. Nothing in this part applies to assistance provided for emergency work or for assistance essential to save lives and protect property and public health and safety performed pursuant to sections 402, 403, 502, and 503 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act), 42 U.S.C. 5170a, 5170b, 5192, and 5193, or for temporary housing assistance programs and individual and family grants performed pursuant to Sections 408 and 411 of the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5174 and 5178. However, this part applies to other provisions of the Stafford Act after a Presidentially declared major disaster or emergency when assistance actions involve new construction or total replacement of a building.</P>

          <P>(a) The Uniform Time Act of 1966 (15 U.S.C. 260a(a)), as amended, requires that the standard time of each State observing Daylight Saving Time shall be advanced 1 hour beginning at 2 a.m. on the second Sunday in March of each year and ending at 2 a.m. on the first Sunday in November. This advanced time shall be the standard time of each zone during such period. The Act authorizes any State to exempt itself from this requirement. States in two or more time zones may exempt either the entire State or may exempt the entire area of the State lying within either time zone.</P>
          <P>(b) Section 3(b) of the Uniform Time Act of 1966 (15 U.S.C. 260a(b)) provides that “it is the express intent of Congress * * * to supersede any and all laws of the States or political subdivisions thereof insofar as they may now or hereafter provide for advances in time or changeover dates different from those specified in [section 3(a) of that Act]”, which are those specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 80.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Limitations on assistance.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The total amount of credit assistance offered to any project under this part shall not exceed 33 percent of the anticipated eligible project costs, as measured on an aggregate cash (year-of-expenditure) basis.</P>

          <P>(b) Costs incurred prior to a project sponsor's submission of an application for credit assistance may be considered in calculating eligible project costs only upon approval of the Secretary. In addition, applicants shall not include application charges or any other expenses associated with the application process (such as charges associated <PRTPAGE P="664"/>with obtaining the required preliminary rating opinion letter) among the eligible project costs.</P>
          <P>(c) No costs financed internally or with interim funding may be refinanced under this part later than a year following substantial completion of the project.</P>
          <P>(d)(1) Within the overall credit assistance limitation of 33 percent of eligible project costs, the Secretary may consider making future-year or multi-year contingent commitments of budget authority and associated credit assistance for projects temporarily lacking certain requirements or with extended construction periods and financing needs. The TIFIA's effectiveness in stimulating private investment in transportation infrastructure depends, in large part, on investor recognition that TIFIA credit instruments represent solid and reliable Federal commitments. Therefore, the Secretary shall make any future-year or multi-year contingent commitment of funds for a project using a conditional term sheet. The conditional term sheet will resemble the standard term sheet that enables the obligation of budget authority, but will also specify the additional actions necessary to trigger subsequent obligation(s). The conditional term sheet will include fixed dates by which any requirements must be met in order for the reserved funding to be obligated.</P>
          <P>(2) Upon execution of the conditional term sheet, the Secretary shall reserve budget authority attributable to the appropriate year(s). This reservation will ensure that a project with a conditional commitment will have a priority claim (along with that of any other projects receiving such contingent commitments) on budget authority becoming available in the specified year(s), provided that the project sponsor satisfies each condition outlined in the conditional term sheet. The Secretary will limit such reservations to not more than 50 percent of the budget authority becoming available in the applicable year(s). If a multi-year contingent commitment is made, each year's loan will be tied to distinct, clearly identified project segments or stages or other milestones as specified in the credit agreement.</P>
          <P>(e) The obligor may draw upon the line of credit only if net project revenues (including, among other sources, any debt service reserve fund) are insufficient to pay costs specified in 23 U.S.C. 184(a)(2) under the line of credit, including debt service costs. Debt service costs include direct payments of principal and interest as well as reimbursements for such payments in the form of legally required deposits to a debt service reserve fund.</P>
          <P>(f) The Secretary shall not obligate funds in favor of a project that has not received an environmental Categorical Exclusion, Finding of No Significant Impact, or Record of Decision.</P>
          <P>(g) The Secretary shall fund a secured loan based on the project's financing needs. The credit agreement shall include the anticipated schedule for such loan disbursements.</P>

          <P>(a) Public and private applicants for credit assistance under this part will be required to submit applications to the DOT in order to be considered for approval by the Secretary.</P>
          <P>(b) At a minimum, such applications shall provide:</P>
          <P>(1) Documentation sufficient to demonstrate that the project satisfies each of the threshold criteria in § 80.13 and describe the extent to which the project satisfies each of the selection criteria in § 80.15;</P>
          <P>(2) Background information on the project for which assistance is sought, such as the project's description, status of environmental and other major governmental permits and approvals, and construction schedule;</P>
          <P>(3) Background information on the applicant (project sponsor);</P>
          <P>(4) Historical information, if applicable, concerning the applicant's financial condition, including, for example, independently audited financial statements and certifications concerning bankruptcies or delinquencies on other debt; and</P>

          <P>(5) Current financial information concerning both the project and the applicant, such as sources and uses of funds for the project and a forecast of <PRTPAGE P="665"/>cash flows available to service all debt instruments.</P>
          <P>(c) An application for a project located in or sponsored by more than one State or other entity shall be submitted to the DOT by just one State or entity. The sponsoring States or entities shall designate a single obligor for purposes of applying for, receiving, and repaying TIFIA credit assistance.</P>

          <P>(d) Each fiscal year for which Federal assistance is available under this part, the DOT shall publish a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice to solicit applications for credit assistance. Such notice will specify the relevant due dates, the estimated amount of funding available to support TIFIA credit instruments for the current and future fiscal years, contact name(s), and other details for that year's application submissions and funding approvals.</P>

          <P>(a) The relevant requirements of title 23, U.S.C., for highway projects, chapter 53 of title 49, U.S.C., for transit projects, and section 5333(a) of title 49 for rail projects, as appropriate;</P>

          <P>(b) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d <E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>

          <P>(c) The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 <E T="03">et seq.</E>);</P>

          <P>(d) The Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4601 <E T="03">et seq.</E>); and</P>

          <SUBJECT>Investment-grade ratings.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) At the time a project sponsor submits an application, the DOT shall require a preliminary rating opinion letter. This letter is a conditional credit assessment from a nationally recognized credit rating agency that provides a preliminary indication of the project's overall creditworthiness and that specifically addresses the potential of the project's senior debt obligations (those obligations having a lien senior to that of the TIFIA credit instrument on the pledged security) to achieve an investment-grade rating.</P>
          <P>(b) The full funding of a secured (direct) loan, loan guarantee, or line of credit shall be contingent on the assignment of an investment-grade rating by a nationally recognized bond rating agency to all project obligations that have a lien senior to that of the Federal credit instrument on the pledged security.</P>
          <P>(c) Neither the preliminary rating opinion letter nor the formal credit rating should reflect the effect of bond insurance, unless that insurance provides credit enhancement that secures the TIFIA obligation.</P>
          <P>(d) The project sponsor must annually provide, at no cost to the Federal Government, ongoing credit evaluations of the project and related debt obligations, including an annual assessment of the TIFIA credit instrument. The evaluations are to be performed by a nationally recognized credit rating agency and provided to the DOT throughout the life of the TIFIA credit instrument. In addition, the project sponsor will furnish the DOT with any other credit surveillance reports on the TIFIA-assisted project as soon as they are available.</P>

          <P>(c) With respect to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the Secretary may accept general obligation pledges or general corporate promissory pledges and will determine the acceptability of other pledges and forms of collateral as dedicated revenue sources on a case-by-case basis. The Secretary shall not accept a pledge of Federal funds, regardless of source, as security for the TIFIA credit instrument.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Selection criteria.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The Secretary shall assign weights as indicated to the following eight selection criteria in evaluating and selecting among eligible projects to receive credit assistance:</P>
          <P>(1) The extent to which the project is nationally or regionally significant, in terms of generating economic benefits, supporting international commerce, or otherwise enhancing the national transportation system (20 percent);</P>
          <P>(2) The creditworthiness of the project, including a determination by the Secretary that any financing for the project has appropriate security features, such as a rate covenant, to ensure repayment (12.5 percent);</P>
          <P>(3) The extent to which such assistance would foster innovative public-private partnerships and attract private debt or equity investment (20 percent);</P>
          <P>(4) The likelihood that such assistance would enable the project to proceed at an earlier date than the project would otherwise be able to proceed (12.5 percent);</P>
          <P>(5) The extent to which the project uses new technologies, including Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), that enhance the efficiency of the project (5 percent);</P>
          <P>(6) The amount of budget authority required to fund the Federal credit instrument made available (5 percent);</P>
          <P>(7) The extent to which the project helps maintain or protect the environment (20 percent); and</P>
          <P>(8) The extent to which such assistance would reduce the contribution of Federal grant assistance to the project (5 percent).</P>
          <P>(b) In addition, 23 U.S.C. 182(b)(2)(B) conditions a project's approval for credit assistance on receipt of a preliminary rating opinion letter indicating that the project's senior debt obligations have the potential to attain an investment-grade rating.</P>

          <P>(c) The Secretary may also give preference to applications for loan guarantees rather than other forms of Federal credit assistance. This preference is consistent with Federal policy that, when Federal credit assistance is necessary to meet a Federal objective, loan guarantees should be favored over direct loans, unless attaining the Federal objective requires a subsidy, as defined by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (2 U.S.C. 661 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), deeper than can be provided by a loan guarantee.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 80.17</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Fees.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) The DOT will require a non-refundable application fee for each project applying for credit assistance under the TIFIA. The DOT may also require an additional credit processing fee for projects selected to receive TIFIA assistance. Any required application initiation or credit processing fee must be paid by the project sponsor <PRTPAGE P="667"/>applying for TIFIA assistance and cannot be paid by another party on behalf of the project sponsor. The proceeds of any such fees will equal a portion of the costs to the Federal Government of soliciting and evaluating applications, selecting projects to receive assistance, and negotiating credit agreements. For FY 2000, the DOT will require payment of a fee of $5,000 for each project applying for credit assistance under the TIFIA, to be submitted concurrently with the formal application. The DOT will not impose any credit processing fees for FY 2000. For each application and approval cycle in FY 2001 and beyond, the DOT may adjust the amount of the application fee and will determine the appropriate amount of the credit processing fee based on program implementation experience. The DOT will publish these amounts in each <E T="04">Federal Register</E> solicitation for applications.</P>
          <P>(b) Applicants shall not include application initiation or credit processing fees or any other expenses associated with the application process (such as fees associated with obtaining the required preliminary rating opinion letter) among eligible project costs for the purpose of calculating the maximum 33 percent credit amount referenced in § 80.5(a).</P>
          <P>(c) If, in any given year, there is insufficient budget authority to fund the credit instrument for a qualified project that has been selected to receive assistance under TIFIA, the DOT and the approved applicant may agree upon a supplemental fee to be paid by or on behalf of the approved applicant at the time of execution of the term sheet to reduce the subsidy cost of that project. No such fee may be included among eligible project costs for the purpose of calculating the maximum 33 percent credit amount referenced in § 80.5(a).</P>

          <P>(d) The DOT will require borrowers to pay servicing fees for each credit instrument approved for funding. Separate fees may apply for each type of credit instrument (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a loan guarantee, a secured loan with a single disbursement, a secured loan with multiple disbursements, or a line of credit), depending on the costs of servicing the credit instrument as determined by the Secretary. Such fees will be set at a level to enable the DOT to recover all or a portion of the costs to the Federal Government of TIFIA credit instruments.</P>

          <P>At a minimum, any recipient of Federal credit assistance under this part shall submit an annual project performance report and audited financial statements to the DOT within no more than 180 days following the recipient's fiscal year-end for each year during which the recipient's obligation to the Federal Government remains in effect. The DOT may conduct periodic financial and compliance audits of the recipient of credit assistance, as determined necessary by the DOT. The specific credit agreement between the recipient of credit assistance and the DOT may contain additional reporting requirements.</P>

The DOT may, however, use an administrative offset in cases of fraud, misrepresentation, false claims, or similar criminal acts or acts of malfeasance or wrongdoing.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>This part implements the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, 31 U.S.C. 3701-3720 A, as amended primarily by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749) and the Debt Collection Amendments of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-578, 100 Stat. 3305). It supplements the Federal Claims Collection Standards (FCCS), 4 CFR parts 101-105, issued jointly by the Comptroller General of the United States and the Attorney General of the United States under 31 U.S.C. 3711(e)(2). Pursuant to the Federal Claims Collection Act, as amended, and the FCCS, this part sets forth procedures by which the Department of Transportation (DOT) and its operating elements (see 49 CFR 1.3) through designated officials:</P>
            <P>(a) Collect claims owed to the United States arising from activities under its jurisdiction;</P>
            <P>(b) Determine and collect interest and other charges on those claims;</P>
            <P>(c) Compromise claims; and</P>
            <P>(d) Refer unpaid claims for litigation.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 89.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Applicability.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The part applies to collection of all claims due the United States under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 as amended by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and the Debt Collection Amendments of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-578), arising from activities under the jurisdiction of DOT including amounts due the United States from fees, overpayments, fines, civil penalties, loans, damages, interest, and other sources.</P>
            <P>(b) This part does not apply to collection, settlement or compromise of debts owed the United States pursuant to authority other than Title 31, Chapter 37, Subchapter II: for example, application of this part to the enforcement of contracts under 46 U.S.C. 1117, delegated to the DOT Maritime Administration, is not required.</P>
            <P>(c) Section 89.23 (interest, late payment penalties, and collection charges) and § 89.25 (collection by administrative offset) of this part do not apply to debts which other United States government agencies or state governments or units of general local government owe the Department (see 31 U.S.C. 3701(c)); however, other statutory or common law may provide legal authority. Neither does the proposed rule apply to recovery of debts owed by current or former employees of the United States governed by 5 U.S.C. 5514.</P>
            <P>(d) Claims arising out of contracts that contain specific provisions relating to claims are governed by those specific provisions to the extent that those provisions comply with existing law and with 4 CFR chapter II.</P>
            <P>(e) As used in this part, the terms debt and claims are interchangeable and have the meaning defined in 4 CFR 101.2(a). A debtor's liability arising out of a particular incident or adjudication exclusive of interest, administrative costs, and late payment penalties, is a single claim.</P>
            <P>(f) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section the provisions of this part shall apply to the collection of all debts and claims owed to any DOT operating element. A claim arising from the assessment of civil penalty or fine is not subject to the procedures of this subpart until the claim has been reduced to a liquidated debt by a signed settlement agreement, a court order or judgment, or a final administrative determination.</P>

            <P>(2) The amount of the claim;</P>
            <P>(3) That domestic and overseas payment in excess of ten thousand dollars or more shall be made by wire transfer through the Federal Reserve communications, commonly known as Fedwire, to the account of the U.S. Treasury in accordance with the instructions provided in the demand letter; payments originating in foreign countries shall be made by wire transfer to the extent practicable.</P>

            <P>(c) If the debtor fails to respond to the demands for payment by the due date specified in the notice, the Department may take further action under this part or the FCCS under 4 CFR parts 101 through 105, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3701-3720A. These actions may include reports to commercial credit bureaus, consumer reporting agencies, contracts with commercial collection agencies, revocation of licenses, or the use of administrative offset, as authorized in 31 U.S.C. 3701-3720A.</P>
            <P>(d) DOT may collect by administrative offset, (see § 89.25, Collection by administrative offset), if the debtor:</P>
            <P>(1) Has not made payment by the payment due date;</P>
            <P>(2) Has not requested a review of the claim within the agency as set out in paragraph (f) of this section; or</P>
            <P>(3) Has not made an arrangement for payment by the payment due date;</P>
            <P>(e) Except for information that may properly be withheld under 49 CFR part 7, the debtor may inspect and copy the records of the agency related to the claim. Any reasonable costs associated with the copying and inspection of the records shall be borne by the debtor. (Payment of cost is governed by 49 CFR part 7, subpart I.) The debtor shall give reasonable notice in advance to the agency of the date on which it intends to inspect and copy the records involved;</P>

            <P>(f)(1) Except for debts established by settlement agreement, court order or judgment, or final administrative decision, the debtor may request review of the validity or amount of a claim. To do so, the debtor shall make a request in writing for review of the claim prior to it becoming delinquent. (<E T="03">See</E> 4 CFR 101.2 for definition of when a debt is considered delinquent.) The debtor's written response shall state the basis for the dispute, and provide all factual information, documents, citation to authority, argument and any other matters to be considered. If only part of the claim is disputed, the undisputed portion shall be paid by the delinquency date stated in the initial demand. During the period that the claim <PRTPAGE P="671"/>is being reviewed, the amount of the debt is owed, but the accrual of interest and accrual of time to delinquency may be suspended on the disputed portion of the debt.</P>
            <P>(2) Review of claims shall be based upon the written record unless an oral hearing is required by 4 CFR 102.3(c). Upon completion of review, within 30 days whenever feasible, the Department shall advise the debtor whether the debt has been found to be valid in any amount, or that collection will be terminated. If the claim is found to be valid in any amount, the accrual of interest and time to delinquency shall commence 15 days after mailing of the notification of the review results. The notification of the review may also include notice of a specific collection action to be undertaken if payment is not received.</P>
            <P>(g) The debtor may offer to make a written agreement to pay the amount of the claim. The acceptance of such an agreement is discretionary with DOT. If the debtor requests an installment payment arrangement because a lump sum payment would create a financial hardship, DOT may agree to a written installment payment schedule with the debtor (see 4 CFR 102.11(a)). The debtor shall execute a confess-judgment note which specifies all of the terms of the arrangement and includes a provision accelerating the debt in the event the debtor defaults. The size and frequency of installment payments shall bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to pay. Interest shall be provided in the note (see § 89.23). The debtor shall be provided with a written explanation of the consequences of signing a confess-judgment note. The debtor shall sign a statement acknowledging receipt of the written explanation, which shall recite that the statement was read and understood before execution of the note and that the note is being signed knowingly and voluntarily. Evidence of these facts shall be maintained in DOT's file on the debtor in accordance with the practice of the DOT operating element.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Interest, late payment penalties, and collection charges.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) DOT shall charge interest on an outstanding debt at the Treasury Current Value of Funds Rate published by the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717 and 4 CFR 102.13(c), unless DOT determines that a higher rate is necessary to protect the interests of the United States. DOT shall charge a late payment penalty at a rate of six percent a year on any portion of a debt that is more than 90 days past due. DOT shall also assess administrative charges to cover additional cost incurred in processing and handling the debt beyond the payment due date. The imposition of interest, collection charges, and late payment penalty charges shall be made in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717, 4 CFR 102.13 (see § 89.3(c) regarding payment of such charges by Federal, state and local government agencies).</P>
            <P>(b) Interest on debt shall begin to accrue on the date on which the debtor is mailed or delivered notice of the debt and the interest requirements or, in the case of advance billings, on the calendar day following the specified due date of the debt, provided the advance billing gives notice of the interest requirements for late payment. Interest on the debt shall continue to accrue until payment is received. Interest shall be calculated only on the principal of the debt (simple interest). The rate of interest assessed shall be the rate in effect on the date from which interest begins to accrue, and will remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness. The rate of interest assessed will generally be the Treasury Current Value of Funds Rate.</P>
            <P>(c) The Department shall waive interest on debt that is paid within 30 calendar days after the date on which interest began to accrue.</P>

            <P>(d) Collection charges on debt shall be computed to cover the cost of processing and handling the delinquent debt. It shall be either the actual cost to process the particular delinquent debt to which it is applied, or operating elements may set the amount of such monthly charge by cost analysis establishing the average of actual additional <PRTPAGE P="672"/>costs incurred by the operating element in processing similar debts. Collection charges may also include the expense of obtaining credit reports and of using a professional debt collection contractor.</P>
            <P>(e) DOT may waive interest, collection charges, or late payment penalty charges if it finds that:</P>
            <P>(1) The debtor would be eligible for compromise under standards set forth in 4 CFR 103.2 with regard to the amount of the debt;</P>
            <P>(2) Collection of interest, administrative charges, or penalties will jeopardize collection of the principal of the debt; or</P>
            <P>(3) It is otherwise in the best interests of the United States, including the situation in which an offset or installment payment agreement is in effect.</P>

            <P>(a) Whenever feasible, after a debtor fails to pay a claim, request a review of a claim, or make an arrangement for payment following a demand made in accordance with § 89.21, DOT shall collect claims under this part by means of administrative offset against obligations of the United States to the debtor pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 4 CFR 102.3. Salary offset against present or former employees of the United States is not governed by this part (see 49 CFR part 92).</P>
            <P>(b) The Department shall notify the debtor in writing in conformance with 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the FCCS of its intent to collect the debt by offset, unless the debtor pays the debt in full, including all interest, administrative charges, and penalties, or executes an agreement to pay the debt by installment at terms acceptable to DOT.</P>
            <P>(c) In making collection by administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716, DOT must do so in accordance with the requirements set forth in § 89.21(b)(1-6). (See also procedures for recovery of debts to the United States by salary offset, 49 CFR part 92.)</P>

            <P>(b) For purposes of this subpart, a past-due legally enforceable debt referable to the IRS is:</P>
            <P>(1) A debt which:</P>
            <P>(i) Is owed to the United States;</P>
            <P>(ii) Is at least $25.00;</P>

            <P>(v) Is ineligible for administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by reason of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2) or cannot be collected by administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by the Department against amounts payable to or on behalf of the debtor by or on behalf of the Department;</P>
            <P>(vi) Has been disclosed by the Department to a consumer reporting agency as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3711(f), unless a consumer reporting agency would be prohibited from using such information by 15 U.S.C. 1681c, or unless the amount of the debt does not exceed $100.00; and</P>

            <SUBJECT>Review within the Department.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Notification by debtor.</E> A debtor who receives a Notice of Intent may present, for 60 days from the date of the Notice of Intent, information that <PRTPAGE P="674"/>all or part of the debt is not past-due or legally enforceable. (However, this does not extend the regulatory period for submitting written statements or for requesting an administrative hearing on the merits of an alleged violation, nor does it extend the period to appeal an assessed civil penalty.) To comply with this procedure, the debtor must:</P>
            <P>(1) Send a written request for a review of the information to the address provided in the notice.</P>
            <P>(2) State in the request the amount disputed and the reasons why the debtor believes that the debt is not past-due or legally enforceable.</P>
            <P>(3) Include in the request any documents which the debtor wishes to be considered or state that additional information will be submitted within the remainder of the 60 day period.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Submission of information.</E> The debtor may submit information showing that all or part of the debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable along with the notification required by paragraph (a) of this section. Failure to submit the information within the remainder of the 60 day period will be interpreted as there is no additional information for consideration.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Review of the information.</E> The Department considers all available information related to the issue of whether the debt is past-due and the issue of whether the debt is legally enforceable. After a decision has been reached, the Department notifies the debtor whether the Department has sustained amended, or cancelled its determination that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable.</P>

            <P>(b) If the Department either sustains or amends its determination, it shall notify the debtor that the debt is being referred to the IRS for offset against the debtor's Federal income tax refund. If the Department determines that there is no legally enforceable debt or that full payment has been made, the case will be closed.</P>

          <P>The purpose of this part is to prescribe the Secretary's role in executing his responsibilities under sections 2 and 3 of the International Air Transportation Fair Competitive Practices Act of 1974 to the end that U.S. flag air carriers operating in foreign air transportation are protected from all forms of discrimination or unfair competitive practices and are compensated for excessive or otherwise discriminatory charges levied by foreign governments or other foreign entities for the use of airport or airway property.</P>

          <P>The Assistant Secretary for Policy, Plans and International Affairs (Assistant Secretary), in coordination with the General Counsel and the Federal Aviation Administrator (Administrator), on complaint of any U.S. flag air carrier or on their own initiative, <PRTPAGE P="675"/>shall investigate: (a) Instances of alleged excessive or otherwise discriminatory user charges or (b) discriminatory or unfair competitive practices to which U.S. flag air carriers are subjected by a foreign government or other foreign entity. Excessive or otherwise discriminatory charges include, but are not limited to, unreasonable landing fees, unreasonable monopoly ground handling fees and unreasonable air navigation charges. Discriminatory or unfair competitive practices include, but are not limited to, unreasonably differentiated fuel allocations, cargo, charter or currency restrictions and inferior monopoly ground handling services.</P>

          <P>(a) Upon finding that a foreign government or entity imposes excessive or otherwise discriminatory charges against U.S. flag air carriers or causes such carriers to be subjected to discriminatory or unfair competitive practices, the Assistant Secretary, in coordination with the General Counsel and the Administrator, shall determine the extent of the discrimination or unfair competitive practices.</P>
          <P>(b) Where the matter involves excessive or otherwise discriminatory charges, the Assistant Secretary shall prepare a report and recommend that the Secretary promptly submit a report of the case to the Secretary of State and the Civil Aeronautics Board in accordance with section 11 of the International Aviation Facilities Act, 49 U.S.C. 1159a.</P>
          <P>(c) Where the matter involves discrimination or unfair competitive practices other than user charges, the Assistant Secretary shall prepare a report and recommend that the Secretary take such other action within the jurisdiction of the Department as is appropriate under the circumstances in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 1159b.</P>
          <P>(d) If the Secretary determines, after review of the report and recommendations made under paragraph (b) of this section, that unreasonably excessive or otherwise discriminatory charges exist, the Secretary will submit a report on the matter to the Secretary of State and the Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 1159a.</P>
          <P>(e) If the Secretary determines, after review of the report and recommendations made under paragraph (c) of this section, that discriminatory or unfair competitive practices exist, the Secretary will commence all appropriate action within his jurisdiction in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 1159b.</P>

          <P>(a) On or after January 1 and July 1 of each year, each U.S. flag air carrier which has been subjected to excessive or otherwise discriminatory charges for which compensatory charges have been collected shall, upon compliance with paragraph (c) of this section, be entitled to pro rata reimbursement for excessive or otherwise discriminatory charges incurred to date, not to exceed the amount of such charges actually paid by that carrier.</P>
          <P>(b) The Secretary will publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> at least 30 days before a U.S. flag air carrier becomes entitled to reimbursement, a notice setting forth the procedures to be followed in making claims for reimbursement. This notice will specify the form in which application shall be made and the specific items of proof, if any, to be submitted.</P>

          <P>(c) On or after January 1 and July 1 of each year, each U.S. flag carrier claiming a right to reimbursement shall apply for such reimbursement in accordance with the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice referred to in paragraph (b) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="676"/>
          </P>
          <P>(d) The Assistant Secretary shall, on the basis of the application and such other data as may be available, compute the amount to which such carrier is entitled.</P>
          <P>(e) Subject to the provisions of § 91.13(b), upon approving the computation made by the Assistant Secretary, the Secretary shall issue such certificate as will entitle each such carrier to payment from the account maintained by the Secretary of the Treasury for this purpose.</P>

          <P>(a) To minimize the burden of implementing this part on the United States, on U.S. flag air carriers and on foreign air carriers, estimates and periodic adjustments will be used to determine the amount of discrimination and compensatory charges therefor.</P>
          <P>(b) For the purpose of determining the amount of excessive or otherwise discriminatory charges imposed upon U.S. flag air carriers by an entity:</P>
          <P>(1) A service or use of airport or airway property includes, but is not limited to, fueling, food service, ticketing, baggage handling, runways, ramps, parking areas, navigational aids, communications facilities or any other service necessary and incidental to the conduct of a flight.</P>

          <P>(2) An excessive or otherwise discriminatory charge includes, but is not limited to, a charge substantially above the cost of providing a service or any charge for a service that is substantially inferior to that which the U.S. flag air carrier could have provided for itself, at the same cost, by contract or otherwise (<E T="03">see also</E> § 91.3).</P>
          <P>(c) In determining the amount of compensatory charge:</P>
          <P>(1) The total amount of excessive or otherwise discriminatory charges levied against U.S. flag air carriers will be estimated in dollars.</P>
          <P>(2) The total volume of operations to the United States by air carriers of the nation concerned will be estimated for the succeeding six-month period.</P>
          <P>(3) The total amount of excessive or otherwise discriminatory charges in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be divided by the total volume of operations in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and</P>
          <P>(4) The quotient thus computed (which may be adjusted to reflect the type of aircraft) will constitute the compensatory charge to be collected as a condition to acceptance of the general declaration at the time of landing or takeoff of such air carriers of the nation concerned.</P>

          <P>(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 91.9(e) the Secretary may suspend for a reasonable time the issuance of a certificate of entitlement upon a showing by a payor of compensatory charges that there is a substantial likelihood that the payor will make a showing of good cause under § 91.13(a).</P>
          <P>(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the issuance of a certificate of entitlement under § 91.9(e) or the distribution to U.S. flag air carriers of funds collected under this part shall be with prejudice to any claim for refund under this section.</P>

          <P>(l) <E T="03">Salary offset</E> means an administrative offset to collect a debt under 5 U.S.C. 5514 by deduction(s) at one or more officially established pay intervals from the current pay account of a present or former employee with or without his or her consent.

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 92.7</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Notice, hearing, written response and decision.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Except as provided in § 92.9 of this part, each employee from whom the department proposes to offset a debt against the Federal pay of an employee who is indebted to the United States under a program administrated by DOT under these regulations is entitled to receive a minimum of 30 days written notice as described in § 92.11 of this part (see also § 92.21(a)).</P>
          <P>(b) Each employee owing a debt to the United States which will be collected by salary offset is entitled to petition for a hearing before collection starts. This petition shall be filed directly with the accounting or finance office of the DOT creditor operating element which shall make appropriate hearing arrangements consistent with law and regulations. The DOT creditor operating element shall provide an explanation of the rights of the employee. If a hearing is provided, the following issues shall be heard:</P>
          <P>(1) The determination of the DOT creditor operating element concerning the existence and amount of the debt; and</P>
          <P>(2) The terms of the repayment schedule, if not previously established by written agreement between the employee and the DOT creditor operating element. (See § 92.21(c) regarding copy of written decision by hearing officer describing method and amount of salary offset).</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 92.9</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Exceptions to notice, hearing, written response, and final decision.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> The procedural requirements of 5 U.S.C. 5514 do not apply to recovery by way of retroactive <PRTPAGE P="679"/>deductions for administrative adjustments associated with the Federal benefits program. In such cases the content of the notification to employees is stated in § 92.9(b).</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Simplified procedures to be followed.</E> In the event that a retroactive deduction from pay or allowances is required to recover an insufficiency of deductions arising through normal processing delays, and those insufficient deductions did not occur in more than four pay periods, rather than following the specific procedures required by 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(2), and set forth in § § 92.11 through 92.17 of this part, the DOT creditor operating element shall issue in advance of the collection a simplified notice to the employee that:</P>
          <P>(1) Because of the employee's election for changes in voluntary payroll deduction, corresponding deductions shall be imposed on the employee's salary to cover the period between the effective date of the election and the first regular withholding. The employee may dispute the amount of the retroactive collection by notifying his or her accounting or finance officer; or</P>
          <P>(2) Due to a normal ministerial adjustment in pay or allowances which could not be placed into effect immediately, future pay will be reduced to permit the DOT creditor operating element to recover any excess pay or allowances received by the employee. The employee may dispute the amount of the retroactive collection by notifying his or her accounting or finance officer.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Limitation on exceptions.</E> The exceptions described in paragraph (a) of this section shall not include a recovery required to be made for any reason other than routine processing delays in putting the change into effect, even if the period of time for which the amounts must be retroactively recovered is less than four pay periods. If normal processing delays exceed four pay periods, then the full procedures prescribed under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and §§ 92.11 through 92.17 of this part will be extended to the employee.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 92.11</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Demand for payment.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The DOT creditor operating element shall send a debtor a total of three progressively stronger written demands at not more than 30-day intervals, unless a response to the first or second demand indicates that a further demand would be futile and the debtor's response does not require rebuttal (see also § 92.21(a)). Other information may also indicate that additional written demands are unnecessary.</P>
          <P>(b) The initial written demand for payment shall inform the debtor of:</P>
          <P>(1) The basis for the indebtedness;</P>
          <P>(2) The amount of the claim;</P>
          <P>(3) The date by which payment is to be made:</P>
          <P>(4) The debtor's liability for interest, penalties and administrative charges in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717 and § 92.35 of this part, if payment is not received within 30 days of the due date (see § 92.35 for details regarding interest, penalties and administrative costs);</P>
          <P>(5) The intent of the agency to collect by salary offset, including asking the assistance of other Federal agencies to help in the offset whenever possible, if the debtor:</P>
          <P>(i) Has not made payment by the payment due date;</P>
          <P>(ii) Has not requested a review of the claim within the agency as set out in paragraph (b)(8) of this section; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Has not made an arrangement for payment by the payment due date:</P>
          <P>(6) The possible submission of claims to a collection agency or referral to the General Accounting Office or the Department of Justice for litigation in accordance with the procedures in 4 CFR part 105.</P>
          <P>(7) The right of the debtor to inspect and copy the records of the agency related to the claim. Any reasonable costs associated with the inspection and copying of these records shall be borne by the debtor. The debtor shall give reasonable notice in advance to the agency of the date upon which he or she intends to inspect and copy the records involved.</P>

          <P>(8) The right of the debtor to a review of the claim within the agency. If the claim is disputed in full or in part, the debtor shall respond to the demand by <PRTPAGE P="680"/>making a request in writing for a review of the claim within the agency by the payment due date stated in the demand. The debtor's written response shall state the basis for the dispute. If only part of the claim is disputed, the undisputed portion shall be paid by the due date. The DOT creditor operating element shall acknowledge receipt of the request for a review, and upon completion of consideration shall notify the debtor whether its determination has been sustained, amended, or canceled within 15 days of the receipt of the request for a review. If the DOT operating element either sustains or amends its determination, it shall notify the debtor of its intent to collect by salary offset unless payment is received within 15 days of the mailing of the notification of its decision following a review of the claim.</P>
          <P>(9) The right of the debtor to offer to make a written agreement to repay the amount of the claim (see § 92.23). The acceptance of such an agreement is discretionary with the agency. If the debtor requests a repayment arrangement because a payment of the amount due would create a financial hardship, the DOT creditor operating element will analyze the debtor's financial condition. Depending on its evaluation of the financial strength of the debtor, the DOT operating element may agree to a written installment repayment schedule with the debtor. The debtor shall execute a confession of judgment note which specifies all of the terms of the arrangement. The size and frequency of installment payments should bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to pay. Interest, penalties and administrative charges shall be provided in the note (see § 92.35). The debtor shall be provided with a written explanation of the consequences of signing a confession of judgment note. The debtor shall sign a statement acknowledging receipt of the written explanation which shall recite that the statement was read and understood before execution of the note and that the note is being signed knowingly and voluntarily. Some form of evidence of these facts shall be maintained in the agency's file on the debtor.</P>
          <P>(10) The right to an oral hearing or a hearing based on written submissions conducted by an administrative law judge or by a hearing official not under the control of the head of the Department in accordance with § 92.13 of this part.</P>
          <P>(11) The consequences of any knowingly false statements, representations, or evidence provided by the employee, which may include:</P>
          <P>(i) Disciplinary procedures under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, 5 CFR part 752, or any other applicable statutes or regulations;</P>
          <P>(ii) Criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 1001 and 1002, or any other applicable statute; or,</P>

          <P>(iii) Penalties under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729, <E T="03">et seq.</E>, or any other applicable statute.</P>
          <P>(12) Proceedings under any other statutory authority for the collection of claims of the DOT operating element.</P>
          <P>(13) The fact that amounts paid on or deducted from the debt which are later waived or found not owed to the United States will be promptly refunded to the employee unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions to the contrary.</P>
          <P>(14) The name, address, and telephone number of the accounting or finance officer who may be contacted if the employee wishes to review the records or to obtain information.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 92.13</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Request for hearing.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The employee shall be advised in the notification that a hearing may be requested by filing a written petition within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notification, addressed to the chief of the paying agency's accounting or finance office.</P>
          <P>(b) The petition shall state the grounds upon which the employee disputes the proposed collection of the alleged debt. The petition shall identify and explain with reasonable specificity the facts, evidence which, and witnesses who the employee believes support his or her position.</P>

          <P>(c) The timely filing of a petition for hearing shall stay any further collection proceedings. A decision by the administrative law judge or other hearing official (see § 92.5(j)) will be issued at <PRTPAGE P="681"/>the earliest practical date, but no later than 60 days after the filing of a petition for hearing, unless a delay is granted at the request of the employee.</P>

          <P>The Department may accept late requests for a hearing if the employee can show that delay in requesting a hearing beyond the period provided in the notice described in § 92.11 of this part was caused by circumstances beyond his or her control or because of failure to receive notice of the time limit (unless he or she was otherwise aware of it) or because of new information.</P>

          <P>(a) Hearings shall consist of informal conferences before an administrative law judge or other hearing official (see § 92.5(j)) in which the employee and the DOT creditor operating element are given full opportunity to present evidence, witnesses, and argument. The DOT operating element will maintain a summary record of a hearing provided under these procedures.</P>
          <P>(b) Written decisions provided after a request for hearing shall, at a minimum, summarize the evidence alleged to substantiate the nature and origin of the alleged debt; the administrative law judge's or other hearing official's analysis, findings, and conclusions; the amount and validity of the alleged debt; and, where applicable, the repayment schedule.</P>
          <P>(c) A copy of the administrative law judge's or other hearing official's final decision shall be provided to the employee as well as the chief of the office authorized to collect debts by deduction from salary.</P>
          <P>(d) The decision of the administrative law judge or other hearing official shall be final and binding on the parties.</P>

          <P>(b) If another (non-DOT) agency is the creditor agency, then it is the responsibility of that agency to arrange for a hearing if one is requested.</P>
          <P>(c) Agents for the paying agency are designated in appendix A to 5 CFR part 581. (This appendix lists the agents designated to accept legal process for the executive branch, the U.S. Postal Service, the Postal Rate Commission, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and the Smithsonian Institution.)</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 92.21</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Deduction from pay.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) After other, less severe collection actions have failed, the DOT operating element (see § 92.5(g)) may implement steps to obtain collection by salary offset. The method and the amount of the salary offset shall be the method and amount stated in the creditor agency's demand letter (see § 92.11) or notice (see § 92.7), or, if applicable, in the decision of an administrative law judge or other hearing official after an employee-requested hearing on the matter. If a DOT operating element is the creditor, the procedures stated in § 92.11 shall be followed.</P>
          <P>(b) Before a collection by salary offset may be made, the chief of the accounting or finance office of the paying DOT operating element shall be furnished with certified documentation by the creditor agency indicating that the creditor agency has sent the employee a demand letter pursuant to § 92.11 of this part stating as a minimum:</P>
          <P>(1) The nature and amount of the indebtedness and the intention of the agency to initiate, at the expiration of thirty days, a proceeding to collect the debt by salary offset; and an explanation of the rights of the employee under this subsection;</P>
          <P>(2) That the employee has the opportunity to inspect and copy Government records relating to the debt;</P>
          <P>(3) That the employee has an opportunity to enter into a written agreement with the agency to establish a schedule for the repayment of the debt;</P>

          <P>(a) Where a DOT creditor operating element (see § 92.5(g)) is the creditor, it shall charge interest on an outstanding debt at the rate published by the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717. The rate of interest <PRTPAGE P="683"/>assessed shall be the rate of the current value of funds to the United States Treasury (i.e., the Treasury tax and loan account rate), as prescribed and published by the Secretary of the Treasury in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and the Treasury Financial Manual Bulletins annually or quarterly, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717. The DOT creditor operating element shall charge a penalty of six percent a year, in addition to interest, on any portion of a debt that is more than 90 days past due. It shall assess administrative charges to cover additional costs incurred in processing and handling the debt beyond the payment due date. The imposition of interest, penalties and administrative charges is made in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717 and 4 CFR 102.13.</P>
          <P>(b) Interest on debt shall begin to accrue on the date on which the debtor is first sent or delivered notice of the debt and of the interest requirements or, in the case of advance billings, on the calendar date following the specified due date of the debt provided the advance billing gives notice of the interest requirements for late payment. Interest on the debt shall continue to accrue until payment is received. Interest shall be calculated only on the principal of the debt (simple interest). The rate of interest charged shall be the rate in effect on the date from which interest begins to accrue, and shall remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness.</P>
          <P>(c) A DOT creditor operating element shall waive the monthly interest on debt that is paid within 30 calendar days after the date on which interest began to accrue.</P>
          <P>(d) A DOT creditor operating element may waive interest, penalties and/or administrative charges if it finds that:</P>
          <P>(1) The debtor is unable to pay any significant sum toward the claim within a reasonable period of time;</P>
          <P>(2) Collection of interest, penalties or administrative charges will jeopardize collection of the principal of the debt; or</P>

          <SUBJECT>Requesting recovery when the Department is not the paying agency.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Format of the request for recovery.</E> (1) Where the DOT operating element is the creditor agency and another agency is the paying agency, the chief of the accounting of finance office of the appropriate DOT operating element (see § 92.5(g)) shall complete and certify the “Debt Claim Form” (see Attachment 1), and attach a copy of the demand letter sent to the employee pursuant to § 92.11 with a statement of the employee's response thereto, or, if a hearing was held pursuant to § 92.13, attach a copy of the decision of the administrative law judge or other hearing official. The DOT creditor operating element shall certify that the employee owes the debt, the amount and basis of the debt, the date on which payment is due, the date the Government's right to collect the debt accrued, and that the Departmental regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. 5514 have been approved by the Office of Personnel Management.</P>

          <P>(2) If the collection is to be made in voluntary or involuntary installments (see Attachment 1), the DOT creditor operating element shall also advise the paying agency of the amount of the installments and, if a date for the beginning of payments other than the next <PRTPAGE P="684"/>officially established pay period is required, the date of the first installment.</P>
          <P>(3) Unless the employee has voluntarily agreed to the salary offset in writing or, in the absence of such agreement, has signed a statement acknowledging receipt of the procedures required by 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(2) and the writing or statement is attached to the debt claim form, the DOT creditor operating element shall also indicate the action(s) taken under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and give the date(s) the action(s) were taken.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Submitting the request for recovery</E>—(1) <E T="03">Current employees.</E> The DOT creditor operating element shall submit the “Debt Claim Form” (Attachment 1) to the employee's paying agency.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Employees who are separating or have separated</E>—(i) <E T="03">Employees who are in the process of separating.</E> If the employee is in the process of separating, the DOT creditor operating element shall submit its debt claim (Attachment 1) to the employee's paying agency for collection as provided in § 92.31 of this part. The paying agency is required to certify the total amount of its collection made or to be made prior to separation and notify the DOT creditor operating element and the employee as provided in § 92.41 (b)(2)(iii). If the paying agency is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, or other similar payments, it shall advise the DOT operating element and send a copy of the debt claim and certification to the agency responsible for making such payments as notice that a debt is outstanding.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Employees who have already separated.</E> If the employee has already separated and all payments due from his or her former paying agency have been paid, the DOT operating element may request, unless otherwise prohibited for example by court order, that monies which are due and payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (5 CFR 831.1801 et seq.) or other similar funds, be administratively offset in order to collect the debt (see 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the FCCS).</P>
          <P>(iii) <E T="03">Employees who transfer from one paying agency to another.</E> If, after the DOT creditor operating element has submitted the debt claim to the employee's paying agency, the employee transfers to a position served by a different paying agency before the debt is collected in full, the paying agency from which the employee separates shall certify the total amount of the collection made on the debt. One copy of the certification shall be furnished to the employee and another to the DOT operating element along with notice of the employee's transfer. The original of the debt claim form shall be inserted in the employee's official personnel folder along with a copy of the certification of the amount which has been collected. Upon receiving the official personnel folder, the new paying agency shall, in accordnce with the DOT operating element's properly certified claim, resume the collection from the employee's current pay account and notify the employee and the DOT creditor operating element of the resumption. The DOT operating element is not required to repeat the required collection procedures from the beginning in order to resume the collection. However, it shall be the responsibility of the DOT creditor operating element to review the debt upon receiving the former paying agency's notice of the employee's transfer to make sure the collection is resumed by the new paying agency.</P>

            <P>The duties and obligations of a Government employee (or a special Government employee) do not end when government service terminates by retirement, resignation, or for any other reason. In fact the U.S. Code sets forth specific criminal penalties for certain activities by former Government employees. To summarize broadly, section 207 of title 18, U.S. Code, prohibits a former Government employee from acting as agent or attorney in various types of proceedings and matters on behalf of a non-Government party when the employee was involved in the subject matter while working for the Government. The duration and nature of the prohibitions depend in part on the depth of the employee's involvement in the matter while in Government service. Section 208 of the same title relates to activities performed while a Government employee that benefit an employee's prospective private employer. All Government employees and special Government employees should become familiar with the provisions of the two statutory sections cited, which have been made a part of this regulation as appendix E, so that they will be aware of the restrictions which might affect them upon their termination from the Government service.</P>

(a) Pursuant to the authority of section 208(b) of title 18, United States Code, the following are exempted from the prohibitions of <PRTPAGE P="691"/>section 208(a) of title 18, United States Code, because they are too remote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity of an employee's services in any matter in which he may act in his governmental capacity.</P>

In addition, to the extent that the welfare or benefit plan is a profit sharing or stock bonus plan, this exemption does not apply and the procedures prescribed in § 99.735-15c (c) through (e) will apply to the interest of that employee in the plan.</P>

            <P>(a) Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being an officer or employee of the executive branch of the United States Government, of any independent agency of the United States, or of the District of Columbia, including a special Government employee, participates personally and substantially as a Government officer or employee, through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter in which, to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor child, partner, organization in which he is serving as officer, director, trustee, partner or employee, or any person or organization with whom he is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective employment, has a financial interest:</P>
            <P>Shall be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.</P>

            <P>(b) Subsection (a) hereof shall not apply (1) if the officer or employee first advises the Government official responsible for appointment to his position of the nature and circumstances of the judicial or other proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter and makes full disclosure of the financial interest and receives in advance a written determination made by such official that the interest is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the services which the Government may expect from such officer or employee, or (2) if, by general rule or regulation published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> the financial interest has been exempted from the requirements of clause (1) hereof as being too remote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity of Government officers' or employees' services.

              <E T="03">New 18 U.S.C. 208.</E> This section forbids certain actions by an officer or employee of the Government in his role as a servant or representative of the Government. Its thrust is therefore to be distinguished from that of sections 203 and 205 which forbid certain actions in his capacity as a representative of persons outside the Government.</P>
            <P>Subsection (a) in substance requires an officer or employee of the executive branch, an independent agency or the District of Columbia, including a special Government employee, to refrain from participating as such in any matter in which, to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor child or partner has a financial interest. He must also remove himself from a matter in which a business or nonprofit organization with which he is connected or is seeking employment has a financial interest.</P>

            <P>Subsection (b) permits the agency of an officer or employee to grant him an <E T="03">ad hoc</E> exemption from subsection (a) if the outside financial interest in a matter is deemed not substantial enough to have an effect on the integrity of his services. Financial interests of this kind may also be made nondisqualifying by a general regulation published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
            </P>
            <P>Section 208 is similar in purpose to the former 18 U.S.C. 434 but prohibits a greater variety of conduct than the “transaction of business with * * * [a] business entity” to which the prohibition of section 434 was limited. In addition, the provision in section 208 including the interests of a spouse and others is new, as is the provision authorizing exemptions for insignificant interest.</P>

They prescribe standards of ethical and other conduct, and reporting requirements, for employees of the United States Railway Association (the Association). The standards and requirements are appropriate to the particular functions and activities of the Association.</P>
            <P>(b) The absence of a specific published standard of conduct covering an act tending to discredit an employee of the Association does not mean that the act is condoned, is permissible, or would not call for and result in corrective or disciplinary action.</P>
            <P>(c) Personnel of the Association shall observe standards of conduct that will reflect credit on the Association.</P>
            <P>

              <E T="03">Gifts, entertainment, and favors.</E> (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, an employee may not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, food, lodging, loan, or other thing of monetary value, from a person or employer of a person who:</P>

            <P>(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, an employee may:</P>
            <P>(1) Accept a gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or other thing of value when the circumstances make it clear that an obvious family relationship rather than the business of the persons concerned is the motivating factor;</P>
            <P>(2) Accept food or refreshment of nominal value on infrequent occasions in the ordinary course of a luncheon or dinner meeting or other meeting or on an inspection tour if the employee is properly in attendance;</P>
            <P>(3) Accept unsolicited advertising or promotional material such as pens, pencils, note pads, calendars, or other items of nominal intrinsic value; or</P>

            <P>(c) An employee may not solicit a contribution from another employee for a gift to an official superior, make a donation as a gift to an official superior, or accept a gift from an employee receiving less pay than himself. However, this paragraph does not prohibit a voluntary gift of nominal value or a donation in a nominal amount made on a special occasion such as marriage, illness, retirement, or transfer.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="05">Sec. 11.</E>
              <E T="03">Outside employment and other activities.</E> (a) An employee may not engage in any outside employment or other outside activity which is not compatible with the full and proper discharge of the duties and responsibilities of his employment with the Association. Incompatible activities include:</P>
            <P>(1) Acceptance of a fee, compensation, gift, payment of expenses, or any other thing of monetary value in circumstances in which acceptance may result in, or create the appearance of, a conflict of interest; and</P>

            <P>
              <E T="05">Sec. 13.</E>
              <E T="03">Financial interests.</E> (a) Except where authorized by statute or these regulations, an employee may not have a direct or indirect financial interest that conflicts substantially, or appears to conflict substantially, with his Association duties and responsibilities. In any case in which such a question of financial interest arises the procedures set forth in section 17 apply.</P>
            <P>(b) The fact that an employee is on leave of absence from employment with or has served as an attorney or consultant to, a railroad, or a company engaged in the manufacture, construction, or supply of railroad facilities and equipment, or a creditor of a railroad, shall not, of itself, be deemed to be a financial interest conflicting with his Association duties or responsibilities. This provision does not affect the obligation of such an employee to submit a statement of employment and financial interest as required by section 31(a)(1).</P>
            <P>(c) The fact that an employee owns shares of stock, corporate bonds, or other corporate securities in any single railroad, or a company engaged in the manufacture, construction or supply of railroad facilities and equipment, or a creditor of a railroad, having a current aggregate market value of $10,000 or more, or an option to purchase such securities, shall not, in itself, be deemed to be a financial interest conflicting with his Association duties or responsibilities. Such ownership must, however, be reported in a special statement of financial interest, in a manner specified by the General Counsel, which shall be available for public inspection.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="05">Sec. 15.</E>
              <E T="03">Conflicts of interest.</E> (a) Except where specifically exempted by statute or these regulations, a conflict of interest exists whenever the performance of the duties of an employee has or appears to have a direct and predictable effect upon a financial interest of such employee or of his spouse, minor child, partner, or person or organization with which he is associated or is negotiating for future employment.</P>
            <P>(b) A conflict of interest exists even though there is no reason to suppose that the employee will, in fact, resolve the conflict to his own personal advantage rather than to that of the Association.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="05">Sec. 17.</E>
              <E T="03">Disqualification arising from personal financial interests.</E> (a) Except as stated in paragraph (e) of this section, or except as permitted by statute, an employee may not participate personally and substantially as an employee, through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of advice, investigation or otherwise, in a judicial or other proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim controversy, charge, accusation, or other particular matter in which, to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor child, a blood relative who is a resident of the employee's household, partner, organization in which he is serving as officer, director, trustee, partner or employee, or any person or organization with whom he is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective employment, has a financial interest, unless he shall cause the financial interest involved to be divested, or request a determination of the propriety of his participation in any matter by informing the General Counsel of the nature and circumstances of the matter and financial interest involved.</P>
            <P>(b) After examining the information submitted the General Counsel may:</P>
            <P>(1) Relieve the employee from participation in the matter and, if possible, reassign it to another employee who is not subordinate to the relieved employee;</P>

            <P>(2) Approve the employee's participation upon determining in writing that the interest involved is not so substantial as to be likely to affect the integrity of the services the Association may expect from the employee;<PRTPAGE P="695"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) Recommend the reassignment of the employee; or</P>
            <P>(4) If none of these alternatives is feasible, direct the employee to cause the financial interest to be divested so that it no longer comes within the scope of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) In any case in which the General Counsel has reason to believe that an employee may have an interest that would be disqualifying under this section, he shall discuss the matter with the employee. If he finds that the interest exists, he may take any of the actions stated in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) In any case in which the employee is dissatisfied with the General Counsel's decision, the employee may appeal the matter to the Chairman of the Association for reconsideration and final determination of the appropriate action.</P>
            <P>(e) Information concerning categories of financial interests which are exempted from the prohibitions of §§ 13(a), 15, and paragraph (a) of this section as being too remote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity of an employee's interest in a matter, are set forth in Appendix 1.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="05">Sec. 19.</E>
              <E T="03">Use of Association property or official title.</E> (a) An employee may not, directly or indirectly, use or allow the use of Association property of any kind, including property leased to the Association, for other than an officially approved activity. Each employee has a positive duty to protect and conserve Association property, including equipment, supplies, and other property entrusted or issued to him.</P>
            <P>(b) An employee may not, directly or indirectly, use or allow the use of his title or position in connection with any commercial enterprise or in endorsing any commercial product or service.</P>

              <E T="05">Sec. 21.</E>
              <E T="03">Misuse of information.</E> An employee may not, for the purpose of furthering a private interest, directly or indirectly, use or allow the use of official information obtained through or in connection with his Association employment, if that information has not been made available by the Association to the general public.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="05">Sec. 23.</E>
              <E T="03">Indebtedness.</E> Each employee shall pay his just financial obligations in a proper and timely manner, especially those imposed by law such as Federal, State, or local taxes. For the purposes of this section “just financial obligations” means those that are recognized as such by the employee or reduced to a judgment by a court, and “in a proper and timely manner” means in a manner which the Association determines does not, under the circumstances, reflect adversely on the Association as his employer. The Association will not determine the validity or amount of a disputed debt and will not initiate action to collect such debts.</P>

              <E T="05">Sec. 25.</E>
              <E T="03">Miscellaneous provisions.</E> (a) Each employee shall acquaint himself with these regulations which relate to his ethical and other conduct as an employee of the Association.</P>
            <P>(b) In the appointment of personnel and in assignment of their duties, the President of the Association shall take steps to avoid, to as great an extent as possible, any conflict between the Association duties and the private interests of such personnel.</P>

The General Counsel shall decide, in a doubtful case, whether the relationship to the railroad industry is sufficiently significant as to require submission of a statement of employment and financial interest.</P>
            <P>(2) Each employee who is in a position identified in Appendix 2.</P>
            <P>(b) Any employee who believes that his position has been improperly included as one requiring the submission of a statement of employment and financial interest is entitled to have that inclusion reviewed by the General Counsel.</P>
            <P>(c) Any employee in a position which meets the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section may be excluded from the reporting requirements of this section if the General Counsel determines that the duties of the position are at such a level of responsibility that the submission of a statement is not necessary because of the degree of supervision and review and the remote or inconsequential effect on the integrity of the Association.</P>

            </P>
            <P>(b) Compliance with the reporting requirements of this subpart is not an alternative to observance of the conflict-of-interest provisions of subpart B of these regulations, but is to facilitate uniform compliance with, and the orderly administration of subpart B.</P>

For the purposes of this section, educational and other institutions doing research and development or related work involving grants of money from or contracts with the Association are considered to be “business enterprises” and are required to be included in the employee's statement of employment and financial interest.</P>

The reviewing officials and others who receive statements are responsible for maintaining them in confidence and shall not allow access to, or allow information to be disclosed from, a statement except to carry out the purposes of these regulations. Information may not be disclosed to any person outside the Association, except as the General Counsel may determine for good cause shown. No disclosure permitted by this paragraph may be made unless the affected employee has been notified that disclosure is contemplated, and the employee is given an opportunity to present reasons and arguments to maintain the confidentiality of the statement.</P>
            <P>(b) Each statement of employment and financial interest and each supplementary statement shall be maintained in the records of the Association.</P>

            <P>I. (a) The following are exempted from the prohibitions of sections 13(a), 15, and 17(a), because they are too remote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity of an employee's services in any matter in which he may act in his official capacity.</P>
            <P>(1) Any holding in a widely held mutual fund, or regulated investment company, which does not specialize in the transportation industry.</P>
            <P>(2) Ownership of shares of stock and of corporate bonds or other corporate securities, if the current aggregate market value of the stocks and other securities so owned in any single corporation is less than $10,000 and is less than one percent of the outstanding stock of the organization concerned, and if the employee, his spouse, or minor children are not active in the management of the organization and have no other connection with or interest in it.</P>
            <P>(3) Continued participation in a bona fide pension, retirement, deferred compensation, group life, health, or accident insurance plan or other employee welfare or benefit plan that is maintained by a business or nonprofit organization by which the employee was formerly employed, to the extent that the employee's rights in the plans are vested and require no additional services by him. To the extent the welfare or benefit plan is a profit sharing or stock bonus plan, this exemption does not apply.</P>
            <P>(b) Notwithstanding paragraph 1(a)(2), the interest of an employee, whose position is listed in section II of this appendix, shall not be exempt from the prohibitions of sections 13(a), 15, and 17(a), with respect to any stock or other security holding in an organization to which he is assigned, or for which he has specific responsibility as a part of his regular duties, for conducting inspections or issuing certificates, waivers, exemptions, or approvals.</P>
            <P>II. The following is a list of positions to which the exemption in paragraph 1(a)(2) of this appendix does not apply. This list may be amended at any time by the Association.</P>
