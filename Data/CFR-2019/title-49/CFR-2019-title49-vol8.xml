      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Request and determination.</E> Requests to inspect records other than those now deemed to be of a public nature shall be in writing and addressed to the Freedom of Information Act Officer (FOIA Officer). The FOIA Officer shall determine within 20 days of receipt of a request (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) whether a requested record will be made available. If the FOIA Officer determines that a request cannot be honored, the FOIA Officer must inform the requesting party in writing of this decision and such letter shall contain a detailed explanation of why the requested material cannot be made available and explain the requesting party's right of appeal.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Appeal.</E> If the FOIA Officer rules that such records cannot be made available because they are exempt under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(b), an appeal from such ruling may be addressed to the Chairman. The Chairman's decision shall be administratively final and shall state the specific exemption(s) contained in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) relied upon for any denial. Such an appeal must be filed within 90 days of the date of the FOIA Officer's letter. The Chairman shall act in writing on such appeals within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) of receipt of any appeal. In unusual circumstances, as set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B), the time limit may be extended, by written notice to the person making the particular request, setting forth the reasons for such extension, for no more than 10 working days. If the appeal is denied, the Chairman's order shall notify the requesting party of his or her right to judicial review. Charges shall be made as provided for in 49 CFR 1002.1.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Predisclosure notification procedures for confidential commercial information.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Confidential commercial information provided to the Interstate Commerce Commission or the Board shall not be disclosed pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request except in accordance with this section. For such purposes, the following definitions apply:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Confidential commercial information</E> means records provided to the government by a submitter that arguably contain material exempt from release under Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Submitter</E> means any person or entity who provides confidential commercial information to the government. The term “submitter” includes, but is not limited to, corporations, state governments, and foreign governments.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice to submitters.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, the Board, to the extent permitted by law, shall provide a submitter with prompt written notice, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, of receipt of an FOIA request encompassing its submissions. This notice shall either describe the exact nature of the information requested or provide copies of the records themselves.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">When notice is required.</E> Notice shall be given to a submitter whenever:</P>
              <P>(1) The Board has reason to believe that disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm; or</P>

              <P>(2) The information has been designated, in good faith by the submitter, as confidential commercial information at the time of submission or within a reasonable time thereafter. Whenever possible, the submitter's claim of confidentiality shall be supported by a statement or certification by an officer <PRTPAGE P="11"/>or authorized representative of the company that the information in question is in fact confidential commercial information and has not been disclosed to the public.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Opportunity to object to disclosure.</E> (1) Through the notice described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Board shall afford a submitter a reasonable period of time in which to provide it with a detailed statement of any objection to disclosure. Such statement shall specify all grounds for withholding the requested information.</P>
              <P>(2) When notice is given to a submitter under this section, the Board also shall notify the requester that it has been provided.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Notice of intent to disclose.</E> (1) The Board shall consider carefully a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to its determination whether or not to disclose the requested information. Whenever the Board decides to disclose the information over a submitter's objection, it shall provide the submitter with written notice containing the following:</P>
              <P>(i) A description or copy of the information to be disclosed;</P>
              <P>(ii) The reasons why the submitter's disclosure objections were not sustained; and</P>
              <P>(iii) A specific disclosure date, which shall be a reasonable number of days after the notice of intent to disclose has been mailed to the submitter.</P>
              <P>(2) At the same time that notice of intent to disclose is given to a submitter, the Board shall notify the requester accordingly.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Notice of lawsuit.</E> (1) Whenever an FOIA requester brings legal action seeking to compel disclosure of confidential commercial information, the Board shall promptly notify the submitter.</P>
              <P>(2) Whenever a submitter brings legal action seeking to prevent disclosure of confidential commercial information, the Board shall promptly notify the requester.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Exception to notice requirement.</E> The notice requirements of this section shall not apply if:</P>
              <P>(1) The Board determines that the information requested should not be disclosed; or</P>
              <P>(2) The information already has been published or otherwise officially made available to the public; or</P>
              <P>(3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552); or</P>
              <P>(4) Disclosure is required by a Board rule that:</P>

              <P>(ii) Specifies narrow classes of records submitted to the Board that are to be released; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Provides in exceptional circumstances for notice when the submitter provides written justification, at the time the information is submitted or within a reasonable time thereafter, that disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm; or</P>
              <P>(5) The information requested was not designated by the submitter as exempt from disclosure, when the submitter had an opportunity to do so at the time of submission or within a reasonable time thereafter, unless the Board has reason to believe that disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm; or</P>
              <P>(6) The designation made by the submitter in accordance with these regulations appears obviously frivolous; in such case, the Board must provide the submitter only with written notice of any administrative disclosure determination within a reasonable number of days prior to the specified disclosure date.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Fees for records search, review, copying, certification, and related services.</SUBJECT>

              <P>Certifications and copies of such tariffs, reports and other public records and documents on file with the Surface <PRTPAGE P="12"/>Transportation Board as may be practicable to furnish, as well as searches and copying of records not considered public under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), will be furnished on the following basis:</P>
              <P>(a) Certificate of the Records Officer, $21.00.</P>
              <P>(b) Services involved in examination of tariffs or schedules for preparation of certified copies of tariffs or schedules or extracts therefrom at the rate of $46.00 per hour.</P>
              <P>(c) Services involved in checking records to be certified to determine authenticity, including clerical work, etc. incidental thereto, at the rate of $31.00 per hour.</P>
              <P>(d) Copies or computer printouts of tariffs, reports, and other public documents, at the rate of $.25 per letter or legal size exposure, only after the first 100 pages, with a minimum charge of $7.50. Copies of electronic records, audiovisual materials, or other forms of data are available at the actual cost of duplication or transcription.</P>
              <P>(e) Fees for courier services to transport agency records to provide on-site access to agency records stored off-site will be set at the rates set forth in the Board's agreement with its courier service provider. Rate information can be obtained from the Board's Records Officer, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423-0001.</P>
              <P>(f) The fees for search, review and copying services for records not considered public under the Freedom of Information Act are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) When records are sought for commercial use, requesters will be assessed the full and reasonable direct costs of document search, review and duplication. A “commercial use” request refers to a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made.</P>
              <P>(2) When records are not sought for commercial use and a request is made by an educational or noncommercial scientific institution, requesters will be assessed only for the cost of duplication (excluding charges for the first 100 pages). The term “Educational Institution” refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program of scholarly research. The term “noncommercial scientific institution” refers to an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. They must show that their request is authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and the records are not sought for a commercial use but, instead, are in furtherance of scholarly or scientific research.</P>
              <P>(3) Requesters who are representatives of the news media (persons actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public) will be assessed only for the cost of duplication (excluding charges for the first 100 pages) if they can show that their request is not made for a commercial use. A request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered a request for a commercial use.</P>
              <P>(4) All other requesters will be assessed fees which recover the full, reasonable direct cost of searching for and duplicating records that are responsive to the request (excluding charges for the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time).</P>
              <P>(5) All requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.</P>

              <P>(6) The search and review hourly fees will be based upon employee grade levels in order to recoup the full, allowable direct costs attributable to their performance of these functions. A listing of the hourly fees by employee grade level is available on the Board's website, <E T="03">http://www.stb.gov.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(7) The fee for copies or computer printouts shall be $.25 per letter or legal size exposure, with a minimum charge of $7.50. Copies of electronic records, audiovisual materials, or other forms of data are available at the actual cost of duplication or transcription.<PRTPAGE P="13"/>
              </P>
              <P>(8) If the cost of collecting any fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself, it will not be assessed.</P>
              <P>(9) A fee may be charged for searches which are not productive and for searches for records or those parts of records which subsequently are determined to be exempt from disclosure.</P>
              <P>(10) Interest charges will be assessed on any unpaid bill starting on the date specified in the bill, at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing. The Debt Collection Act, 5 U.S.C. 5514 (1982), including disclosure to the consumer reporting agencies and the use of collection agencies, as prescribed in the Board's Debt Collection Regulations in 49 CFR part 1018, will be utilized to encourage payment where appropriate.</P>
              <P>(11) If search charges are likely to exceed $25, the requester will be notified of the estimated fees unless requester willingness to pay whatever fee is assessed has been provided in advance. The administrative time limits prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) will not begin until after the requester agrees in writing to accept the prospective charges.</P>
              <P>(12) An advance payment (before work is commenced or continued on a request) may be required if the charges are likely to exceed $250. Requesters who have previously failed to pay a fee charged in timely fashion (i.e. within 30 days of the date of billing) may be required first to pay this amount plus any applicable interest (or demonstrate that the fee has been paid) and then make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the new or pending request is processed. The administrative time limits prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) also will not begin until after a requester has complied with this provision.</P>
              <P>(13) Documents shall be furnished without any charge or at a charge reduced below the fees set forth above if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The following six factors will be employed in determining when such fees shall be waived or reduced:</P>
              <P>(i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requester records concerns “the operations or activities of the government”;</P>
              <P>(ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whether the disclosure is “likely to contribute” to an understanding of government operations or activities;</P>
              <P>(iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the general public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to “public understanding”;</P>
              <P>(iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to public understanding of government operations or activities;</P>
              <P>(v) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so</P>
              <P>(vi) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is “primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.” This fee waiver and reduction provision will be implemented in accordance with guidelines issued by the U.S. Department of Justice on April 2, 1987 and entitled “New FOIA Fee Waiver Policy Guidance.” A copy of these guidelines may be inspected or obtained from the Surface Transportation Board's Freedom of Information Office, Washington, DC 20423-0001.</P>
              <P>(14) No fees will be assessed if the FOIA Officer fails to comply with any time limit under the FOIA or these regulations, and has not timely notified the requester, in writing, that an unusual circumstance exists. If an unusual circumstance exists, and timely, written notice is given to the requester, the failure to meet the time limit may be excused an additional 10 working days before fees are automatically waived under this paragraph (f)(14).</P>

              <P>(15) If the FOIA Officer determines that unusual circumstances apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to <PRTPAGE P="14"/>respond to a request, fees may be charged if timely, written notice to the requester is provided and discussed with the requester via mail, Email, or telephone (or if at least three good-faith attempts are made to do so) regarding how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request.</P>
              <P>(16) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, a failure to comply with time limits imposed by these regulations or FOIA shall be excused for the length of time provided by court order.</P>
              <P>(17) Fees may not be avoided by filing multiple requests at the same time. When the FOIA Officer reasonably believes that a requester, alone or with others, is breaking down one request into a series of requests to avoid fees, the requests will be combined, and the requester or requesters will be charged accordingly.</P>
              <P>(g) Fees for services described in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section may be paid by check, money order, or through the Board's electronic payment system in accordance with § 1002.2(a)(2).</P>
              <P>(h) Transcript of testimony and of oral argument, or extracts therefrom, may be purchased by the public from the Board's official reporter. For information regarding the official reporter, contact the Records Officer, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423-0001.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Filing fees.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Manner of payment.</E> (1) Except as specified in this section, all filing fees will be payable at the time and place the application, petition, notice, tariff, contract summary, or other document is tendered for filing.</P>
              <P>(2) Filing fees for all e-filings must be paid via the Board's electronic payment system found on the Board's website. Filing fees for other filings may be paid via the electronic payment system, but will also be accepted payable to the Surface Transportation Board, either by check payable in United States currency drawn upon funds deposited in a United States or foreign bank or other financial institution, or by money order payable in United States currency.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Nonpayment of fees.</E> Any filing that is not accompanied by the appropriate filing fee or a request for waiver of the fee is deficient. If a filer requests a fee waiver but does not submit the appropriate fee, the filing is held for processing until a determination has been made on the fee waiver request. If the filer requests a fee waiver and submits the appropriate fee, the filing is accepted and the Board refunds the fee or a portion thereof if the fee waiver is ultimately granted.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Fees not refundable.</E> Fees will be assessed for every filing in the type of proceeding listed in the schedule of fees contained in paragraph (f) of this section, subject to the exceptions contained in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. After the application, petition, notice, tariff, contract, or other document has been accepted for filing by the Board, the filing fee will not be refunded, regardless of whether the application, petition, notice, tariff, contract, or other document is granted or approved, denied, rejected before docketing, dismissed, or withdrawn. If an individual exemption proceeding becomes a matter of general applicability and is handled through the rulemaking process, the Board will refund the filing fee.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Related or consolidated proceedings.</E> (1)(i) Except as provided for in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, separate fees need not be paid for related applications filed by the same applicant that would be the subject of one proceeding.</P>
              <P>(ii) In proceedings filed under the rail consolidation procedures at 49 CFR part 1180, the applicable filing fee must be paid for each proceeding submitted concurrently with the primary application. The fee for each type of proceeding is set forth in the fee schedule contained in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) A separate fee will be assessed for the filing of an application for temporary authority to operate a motor carrier of passengers as provided for in <PRTPAGE P="15"/>paragraph (f)(5) of this section regardless of whether such application is related to a corresponding transfer proceeding as provided for in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) The Board may reject concurrently filed applications, petitions, notices, contracts, or other documents asserted to be related and refund the filing fee if, in its judgment, they embrace two or more severable matters which should be the subject of separate proceedings.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Waiver or reduction of filing fees.</E> It is the general policy of the Board not to waive or reduce filing fees except as described below:</P>
              <P>(1) Filing fees are waived for an application or other proceeding which is filed by a federal government agency, or a state or local government entity. For purposes of this section the phrases “federal government agency” or “government entity” do not include a quasi-governmental corporation or government subsidized transportation company.</P>
              <P>(2) In extraordinary situations the Board will accept requests for waivers or fee reductions in accordance with the following procedure:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">When to request.</E> At the time that a filing is submitted to the Board the applicant may request a waiver or reduction of the fee prescribed in this part. Such request should be addressed to the Chief, Section of Administration, Office of Proceedings, Surface Transportation Board.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Basis.</E> The applicant must show the waiver or reduction of the fee is in the best interest of the public, or that payment of the fee would impose an undue hardship upon the requestor.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Board action.</E> The Chief, Section of Administration, Office of Proceedings, Surface Transportation Board will notify the applicant of the decision to grant or deny the request for waiver or reduction.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Schedule of filing fees.</E>

Base level direct labor costs are direct labor costs determined by the cost study set forth in <E T="03">Revision of Fees For Services,</E> 1 I.C.C.2d 60 (1984) or subsequent cost studies. The base period for measuring changes shall be April 1984.</P>
              <P>(2) Operations overhead shall be developed each year on the basis of current relationships existing on a weighted basis, for indirect labor applicable to the first supervisory work centers directly associated with user fee activity. Actual updating of operations overhead will be accomplished by applying the current percentage factor to updated direct labor, including current governmental overhead costs.</P>

              <P>(3)(i) Office general and administrative costs shall be developed each year on the basis of current level costs, i.e., dividing actual office general and administrative costs for the current fiscal year by total office costs for the Offices directly associated with user fee <PRTPAGE P="19"/>activity. Actual updating of office general and administrative costs will be accomplished by applying the current percentage factor to updated direct labor, including current governmental overhead and current operations overhead costs.</P>
              <P>(ii) Board general and administrative costs shall be developed each year on the basis of current level costs; i.e., dividing actual Board general and administrative costs for the current fiscal year by total agency expenses for the current fiscal year. Actual updating of Board general and administrative costs will be accomplished by applying the current percentage factor to updated direct labor, including current governmental overhead, operations overhead and office general and administrative costs.</P>

              <P>(4) Publication costs shall be adjusted on the basis of known changes in the costs applicable to publication of material in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(e) All updated fees shall be rounded downward in the following manner:</P>
              <P>(1) Fees between $1-$30 will be rounded to the nearest $1;</P>
              <P>(2) Fees between $30-$100 will be rounded to the nearest $10;</P>
              <P>(3) Fees between $100-$999 will be rounded to the nearest $50; and</P>
              <P>(4) Fees above $1,000 will be rounded to the nearest $100. (This rounding procedure excludes copying, printing and search fees.)</P>

              <SUBJECT>Gifts, donations, and hospitality by carriers.</SUBJECT>
              <P>It is unlawful for any common carrier engaged in interstate or foreign commerce to offer, make, or cause any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any person. Gifts or services or anything of substantial value to particular shippers or their representatives are considered violations of the law. Expenditures for such gifts may not support requests to increase carrier rates. The Board shall take appropriate enforcement action to redress such unlawful expenditures.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Misrouting, adjustment of claims.</SUBJECT>

              <P>Carriers should adjust claims for damages resulting from misrouting. Where a carrier admits responsibility for billing, forwarding, or diverting a shipment over a higher rated route than that directed by the shipper or otherwise available, the misrouting carrier should refund the difference to the shipper (or reimburse the delivering carrier, as the case may be). Where the misrouting carrier alleges justification for using the higher rated route, the Board may, at its discretion and upon appropriate petition, determine or express an advisory opinion on the lawfulness of such routing. This interpretation must not be used to evade or defeat tariff rates or to meet the rate of a competing carrier or route, nor to relieve a shipper from responsibility for routing instruction. Damages caused by misrouting are not overcharges.<PRTPAGE P="20"/>

              <SUBJECT>Filing of claims.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Compliance with regulations.</E> A claim for loss or damage to baggage or for loss, damage, injury, or delay to cargo, shall not be voluntarily paid by a carrier unless filed, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, with the receiving or delivering carrier, or carrier issuing the bill of lading, receipt, ticket, or baggage check, or carrier on whose line the alleged loss, damage, injury, or delay occurred, within the specified time limits applicable thereto and as otherwise may be required by law, the terms of the bill of lading or other contract of carriage, and all tariff provisions applicable thereto.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Minimum filing requirements.</E> A written or electronic communication (when agreed to by the carrier and shipper or receiver involved) from a claimant, filed with a proper carrier within the time limits specified in the bill of lading or contract of carriage or transportation and: (1) Containing facts sufficient to identify the baggage or shipment (or shipments) of property, (2) asserting liability for alleged loss, damage, injury, or delay, and (3) making claim for the payment of a specified or determinable amount of money, shall be considered as sufficient compliance with the provisions for filing claims embraced in the bill of lading or other contract of carriage; <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That where claims are electronically handled, procedures are established to ensure reasonable carrier access to supporting documents.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Documents not constituting claims.</E> Bad order reports, appraisal reports of damage, notations of shortage or damage, or both, on freight bills, delivery receipts, or other documents, or inspection reports issued by carriers or their inspection agencies, whether the extent of loss or damage is indicated in dollars and cents or otherwise, shall, standing alone, not be considered by carriers as sufficient to comply with the minimum claim filing requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Claims filed for uncertain amounts.</E> Whenever a claim is presented against a proper carrier for an uncertain amount, such as “$100 more or less,” the carrier against whom such claim is filed shall determine the condition of the baggage or shipment involved at the time of delivery by it, if it was delivered, and shall ascertain as nearly as possible the extent, if any, of the loss or damage for which it may be responsible. It shall not, however, voluntarily pay a claim under such circumstances unless and until a formal claim in writing for a specified or determinable amount of money shall have been filed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Other claims.</E> If investigation of a claim develops that one or more other carriers has been presented with a similar claim on the same shipment, the carrier investigating such claim shall communicate with each such other carrier and, prior to any agreement entered into between or among them as to the proper disposition of such claim or claims, shall notify all claimants of the receipt of conflicting or overlapping claims and shall require further substantiation, on the part of <PRTPAGE P="21"/>each claimant of his title to the property involved or his right with respect to such claim.</P>

              <P>(a) Each carrier shall, upon receipt in writing or by electronic transmission of a proper claim in the manner and form described in the regulations, acknowledge the receipt of such claim in writing or electronically to the claimant within 30 days after the date of its receipt by the carrier unless the carrier shall have paid or declined such claim in writing or electronically within 30 days of the receipt thereof. The carrier shall indicate in its acknowledgment to the claimant what, if any, additional documentary evidence or other pertinent information may be required by it further to process the claim as its preliminary examination of the claim, as filed, may have revealed.</P>
              <P>(b) The carrier shall at the time each claim is received create a separate file and assign thereto a successive claim file number and note that number on all documents filed in support of the claim and all records and correspondence with respect to the claim, including the acknowledgment of receipt. At the time such claim is received the carrier shall cause the date of receipt to be recorded on the face of the claim document, and the date of receipt shall also appear in the carrier's acknowledgment of receipt to the claimant. The carrier shall also cause the claim file number to be noted on the shipping order, if in its possession, and the delivery receipt, if any, covering such shipment, unless the carrier has established an orderly and consistent internal procedure for assuring: (1) That all information contained in shipping orders, delivery receipts, tally sheets, and all other pertinent records made with respect to the transportation of the shipment on which claim is made, is available for examination upon receipt of a claim; (2) that all such records and documents (or true and complete reproductions thereof) are in fact examined in the course of the investigation of the claim (and an appropriate record is made that such examination has in fact taken place); and (3) that such procedures prevent the duplicate or otherwise unlawful payment of claims.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Supporting documents.</E> When a necessary part of an investigation, each claim shall be supported by the original bill of lading, evidence of the freight charges, if any, and either the original invoice, a photographic copy of the original invoice, or an exact copy thereof or any extract made therefrom, certified by the claimant to be true and correct with respect to the property and value involved in the claim; or certification of prices or values, with trade or other discounts, allowance, or deductions, of any nature whatsoever and the terms thereof, or depreciation reflected thereon; <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That where property involved in a claim has not been invoiced to the consignee shown on the bill of lading or where an invoice does not show price or value, or where the property involved has been sold, or where the property has been transferred at bookkeeping values only, the carrier shall, before voluntarily paying a claim, require the claimant to establish the destination value in the quantity, shipped, transported, or involved; <E T="03">Provided, further,</E> That when supporting documents are determined to be a necessary part of an investigation, the supporting documents are retained by the carriers for possible Board inspection.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Verification of Loss.</E> When an asserted claim for loss of an entire package or an entire shipment cannot be otherwise authenticated upon investigation, the carrier shall obtain from the consignee of the shipment involved a certified statement in writing that the property for which the claim is <PRTPAGE P="22"/>filed has not been received from any other source.</P>

The carrier shall only dispose of the property in a manner that will fairly and equally protect the best interests of all persons having an interest therein. The carrier shall make an itemized record sufficient to identify the property involved so as to be able to correlate it to the shipment or transportation involved, and claim, if any, filed thereon.

              <P>(a) An individual may establish his identity by:</P>
              <P>(1) Submitting with his written request for information or for access to photocopy, two pieces of identification bearing his or her name and signature, one of which shall bear his or her current home or business address; or</P>

              <SUBJECT>The independence of the trustee of a voting trust.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In order to avoid an unlawful control violation, the independent voting trust should be established before a controlling block of voting securities is purchased.</P>
              <P>(b) In voting the trusteed stock, the trustee should maintain complete independence from the creator of the trust (the settlor).</P>
              <P>(c) Neither the trustee, the settlor, nor their respective affiliates should have any officers or board members in common or direct business arrangements, other than the voting trust, that could be construed as creating an indicium of control by the settlor over the trustee.</P>
              <P>(d) The trustee should not use the voting power of the trust in any way which would create any dependence or intercorporate relationship between the settlor and the carrier whose corporate securities constitute the corpus of the trust.</P>
              <P>(e) The trustee should be entitled to receive cash dividends declared and paid upon the trusteed voting stock and turn them over to the settlor. Dividends other than cash should be received and held by the trustee upon the same terms and conditions as the stock which constitutes the corpus of the trust.</P>
              <P>(f) If the trustee becomes disqualified because of a violation of the trust agreement or if the trustee resigns, the settlor should appoint a successor trustee within 15 days.</P>

              <P>(a) The trust and the nomination of the trustee during the term of the trust should be irrevocable.</P>
              <P>(b) The trust should remain in effect until certain events, specified in the trust, occur. For example, the trust might remain in effect until (1) all the deposited stock is sold to a person not affiliated with the settlor or (2) the trustee receives a Board decision authorizing the settlor to acquire control of the carrier or authorizing the release of the securities for any reason.</P>
              <P>(c) The settlor should not be able to control the events terminating the trust except by filing with this Board an application to control the carrier whose stock is held in trust.</P>
              <P>(d) The trust agreement should contain provisions to ensure that no violations of 49 U.S.C. 11323 will result from termination of the trust.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Review and reporting requirements for regulated carriers.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Any carrier choosing to utilize a voting trust may voluntarily submit a copy of the voting trust to the Board for review. The Board's staff will give an informal, nonbinding opinion as to whether the voting trust effectively insulates the settlor from any violation of Board policy against unauthorized acquisition of control of a regulated carrier.</P>
              <P>(b) Any person who establishes an independent trust for the receipt of the voting stock of carrier must file a copy of the trust, along with any auxiliary or modifying documents, with the Board.</P>
              <P>(c) Any carrier required to file a Schedule 13D with the Securities and Exchange Commission (17 CFR 240.13d-1) which reports the purchase of 5 percent or more of the registered securities of another Board regulated carrier (or the listed shares of a company controlling 10 percent or more of the stock of a Board regulated carrier), must simultaneously file a copy of that schedule with the Board, along with any supplements to that schedule.</P>

              <P>(d) Failure to comply with the reporting requirements in paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section will result in denial of the application in which acquisition of control, through the acquisition of the voting stock of another carrier, is sought, unless the applicant <PRTPAGE P="40"/>shows, by clear and convincing evidence, and the Board finds, that the failure to comply was unintentional and that denial of the application will substantially and adversely affect the public interest and the national transportation policy.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
              <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>
              <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1014.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 1014.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because <PRTPAGE P="44"/>of § 1014.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
              <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
              <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written).

              <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
              <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.</P>
              <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
              <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.</P>

              <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In <PRTPAGE P="45"/>those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1014.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Purpose of these rules.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The Equal Access to Justice Act (5 U.S.C. 504) (called the “Act” in this part), provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative proceedings (called “adversary adjudications”) before the Surface Transportation Board. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over the Board or another agency of the United States participating in the Board proceeding, unless the Board's position in the proceeding, or that of the other agency, was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this part describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the Board will use to make them.</P>

                <SUBJECT>When the Act applies.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The Act applies to any adversary adjudication pending before the Board after October 1, 1981. This includes proceedings begun before October 1, 1981, if final Board action has not been taken before that date, regardless of when they were initiated or when final Board action occurs. These rules incorporate the changes made in Pub. L. No. 99-80, 99 Stat. 183, which applies generally to cases instituted after October 1, 1984. If awards are sought for cases pending on October 1, 1981 or filed between that date and September 30, 1984, the prior statutory provisions (to the extent they differ from the existing ones, and our implementing rules) apply.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Proceedings covered.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The Act applies to adversary adjudications conducted by the Board under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of this or any other agency of the United States, or any component of an agency, is presented by an attorney or other representative (hereinafter “agency counsel”) who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding. Proceedings for the purpose of establishing or fixing a rate are not covered by the Act. Proceedings to grant or renew licenses are also excluded, but proceedings to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses are covered if they are otherwise “adversary adjudications.” Generally, the types of Board proceedings covered by the Act include, but are not limited to, investigation proceedings instituted under 49 U.S.C. 11701 and 49 U.S.C. 13905 and disciplinary proceedings conducted pursuant to 49 CFR 1103.5.</P>

                <P>(b) The Board may also designate a proceeding not listed in paragraph (a) of this section as an adversary adjudication for purposes of the Act by so stating in an order initiating the proceeding, designating the matter for <PRTPAGE P="47"/>hearing or at any other time during the proceeding. The Board's failure to designate a proceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing of an application by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the Act; whether the proceeding is covered will then be an issue for resolution in proceedings on the application.</P>
                <P>(c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include only fees and expenses related to covered issues.</P>

That official or decisionmaking body is referred to in this part as the “adjudicative officer.”</P>

                <SUBJECT>Eligibility of applicants.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses under the Act, the applicant must be a party to the adversary adjudication for which it seeks an award, it must have stood in an adversary relationship to the position taken by agency counsel, and it must have prevailed on one or more of the issues raised by agency counsel. The term “party” is defined in 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(B). The applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart and in Subpart B.</P>
                <P>(b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) An individual whose net worth did not exceed $2 million at the time the adversary adjudication was initiated;</P>
                <P>(2) Any owner of an unincorporated business, or any partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or organization whose net worth does not exceed $7 million and which had no more than 500 employees at the time the adversary adjudication was initiated;</P>
                <P>(3) Any organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of such Code, or a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)), may be a party regardless of the net worth of such organization or cooperative association.</P>
                <P>(c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the proceeding was initiated.</P>
                <P>(d) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis. Independent contractors under lease to motor carriers are not employees of the carriers under these rules. Also, agents for motor common carriers of household goods are not employees of their respective principal carriers.</P>
                <P>(e) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of the applicant or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this part, unless the adjudicative officer determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the adjudicative officer may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.</P>
                <P>(f) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.</P>

                <P>(a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding, or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position of the agency over which the applicant has prevailed was substantially justified. Whether or not the position of the agency was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the administrative record made in the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses are sought. The burden of proof that an award should not be made to an eligible prevailing applicant is on the agency counsel, which may avoid an award by showing that its position was reasonable in law and fact.</P>
                <P>(b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly or unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if special circumstances make the award sought unjust.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Allowable fees and expenses.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents and expert witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at a reduced rate to the applicant.</P>
                <P>(b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules may exceed the amount specified by 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(A), unless a higher fee is justified. 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(A). However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.</P>
                <P>(c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent or expert witness, the adjudicative officer shall consider the following:</P>
                <P>(1) If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or her customary fee for similar services, or, if an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;</P>
                <P>(2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily performs services;</P>
                <P>(3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;</P>
                <P>(4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and</P>
                <P>(5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services provided.</P>
                <P>(d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) These regulations set forth guidelines for implementing the Debt Collection Act of 1982 at the Surface Transportation Board (STB). The purpose of the Act is to give agencies the ability to more aggressively pursue debts owed the Federal Government and to increase the efficiency of governmentwide efforts to collect debts owed the United States. The authority for these regulations is found in the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365 and 4 CFR 101.1 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), Collection by Offset From Indebted Government Employees (5 CFR 550.1101 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR 101.1 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), and Administrative Offset (31 U.S.C. 3716).</P>

              <P>(b) These regulations provide procedures for administrative offset of a Federal employee's salary without his/her consent to satisfy certain debts owed to the Federal Government. The regulations covered in this part apply to all current and former Federal employees who owe debts to the Board and to current Board employees who <PRTPAGE P="52"/>owe debts to other Federal agencies. The regulations set forth herein do not apply when the employee consents to recovery from his/her current pay account.</P>
              <P>(c) These regulations do not apply to debts or claims arising under:</P>
              <P>(1) The Social Security Act;</P>
              <P>(2) The Internal Revenue Code of 1954;</P>
              <P>(3) The tariff laws of the United States; or</P>
              <P>(4) Any case where a collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute.</P>

              <P>(d) These regulations also do not preclude the compromise, suspension, or termination of collection action, where appropriate, under the standards implementing the Federal Claims Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 3711 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> 4 CFR 101.1 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). These regulations do not preclude an employee's requesting a waiver of a salary overpayment (i.e., alleged indebtedness) under 5 U.S.C. 5584, 10 U.S.C. 2774, or 32 U.S.C. 716, or in any way questioning the amount or validity of a debt by submitting a claim to the General Accounting Office (GAO), or requesting a waiver under statutory provisions pertaining to the particular debt.</P>
              <P>(e) The Board's regulations governing debt collection for entities and individuals who are not current or former government employees are contained in 49 CFR part 1018.</P>

              <P>(3) If collection must be made in installments, advise the paying agency of the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be collected in each installment;</P>
              <P>(4) Advise the paying agency of any action taken under 5 U.S.C. 5514(a);</P>
              <P>(5) If the employee is in the process of separating, the Board must submit its debt claim to the paying agency as provided in this part. The paying agency must certify any amounts already collected, notify the employee, and send a copy of the certification and notice of the employee's separation to the creditor agency—if the paying agency is aware that the employee is entitled to money from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, it must certify to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that:</P>
              <P>(i) The debtor owes the U.S. a debt, including the amount of that debt;</P>

The Board <PRTPAGE P="56"/>shall not review the merits of the creditor agency's determination of the validity or the amount of the certified claim.</P>
              <P>(2) When the Board receives an incomplete debt from another (creditor) agency, the Board must return the debt claim with a notice that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR 550.1109 must be followed and a properly certified debt claim received before action will be taken to collect from the employee's current pay account.</P>
              <P>(3) If the employee transfers to another agency after the creditor agency has submitted its debt claim to the Board and before the debt is fully collected, the Board must certify the total amount collected to the creditor agency, along with notice of the transfer, and furnish a copy of same to the employee.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The rate of interest assessed shall be the rate of the current value of funds to the U.S. Treasury (i.e., the Treasury tax and loan account rate), as prescribed and published by the Secretary of the Treasury in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and the Treasury Financial Manual Bulletins. A higher rate of interest can be assessed if the Board can reasonably determine that a higher rate is necessary to protect the interests of the United States. The rate of interest, as initially assessed, shall remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, except where a debtor has defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement. The Board may set a new interest rate which reflects the current value of funds to the Treasury at the time the new agreement is executed. The Board shall waive the collection of interest on the debt or any portion of <PRTPAGE P="57"/>the debt which is paid within 30 days after the date on which interest began to accrue.</P>
              <P>(b) The Board shall assess a penalty charge not to exceed 6 percent a year on any portion of a debt that is delinquent as defined in 4 CFR 101.2(b) for more than 90 days. This charge need not be calculated until the 91st day of delinquency, but shall accrue from the date that the debt became delinquent.</P>
              <P>(c) The Board shall assess against a debtor charges to cover administrative costs incurred as a result of a delinquent debt—that is, the additional costs incurred in processing and handling the debt because it became delinquent as defined in 4 CFR 101.2(b).</P>
              <P>(d) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, amounts received by the agency shall be applied first to outstanding penalty and administrative cost charges, second to accrued interest, and third to outstanding principal.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Application.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) This part applies to claims for the payment of debts owed to the United States Government in the form of money or property and unless a different procedure is specified in a statute, regulation, or a contractual agreement with the Board, prescribes procedures by which the Board:<PRTPAGE P="58"/>
                </P>
                <P>(1) Collects, compromises, suspends, and terminates collection actions for claims;</P>
                <P>(2) Determines and collects interest and other charges on these claims; and</P>
                <P>(3) Refers unpaid claims to the General Accounting Office (GAO) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) for litigation.</P>
                <P>(b) The following are examples of the kinds of debts to which special statutory and administrative procedures apply:</P>
                <P>(1) A claim against an employee for erroneous payment of pay and allowances subject to waiver under 5 U.S.C. 5584 and other claims against employees which are handled under 49 CFR part 1017.</P>
                <P>(2) A claim involving the payment of civil penalties or forfeitures which may arise under provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act or legislation supplemental thereto. Those claims are handled under procedures set forth in 49 CFR part 1021.</P>
                <P>(3) A claim involved in a case pending before any Federal Contract Appeals Board or Grant Appeals Board. However, nothing in this part prevents negotiation and settlement of a claim pending before a Board.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Administrative offset</E> means withholding money payable by the United States to, or held by the Government for, a person to satisfy a debt the person owes the Government.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Claim</E> and <E T="03">debt</E> are used synonymously and interchangeably for purposes of this part. These terms refer to an amount of money or property which has been determined by an appropriate agency official to be owed to the United States by any person, organization, or entity except another Federal agency.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Delinquent.</E> A debt is considered delinquent if it has not been paid by the date specified in the initial written demand for payment or applicable contractual agreement with the Board, unless other satisfactory payment arrangements have been made by that date. If the debtor fails to satisfy an obligation under a payment agreement with the Board after other payment arrangements have been made, the debt becomes a delinquent debt.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Payment in full</E> means payment of the total debt due the United States, including any interest, penalty, and administrative costs of collection assessed against the debtor.</P>

                <P>(1) Results from activities of the Board including fees imposed under 49 CFR part 1002; or</P>
                <P>(2) Is referred to the Board for collection.</P>
                <P>(b) These procedures do not apply to:</P>
                <P>(1) A claim based on a civil monetary penalty for violation of a requirement of the Interstate Commerce Act or an order or regulation of the Board unless 49 CFR part 1021 provides otherwise;</P>
                <P>(2) A claim as to which there is an indication of fraud, the presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor, or any other party having an interest in the claim;</P>
                <P>(3) A claim between Federal agencies; and</P>
                <P>(4) A claim once it becomes subject to salary offset which is governed by 5 U.S.C. 5514.</P>

                <P>The Board's authority to compromise a claim or to terminate or suspend collection action on a claim covered by these procedures is limited by 31 U.S.C. 3711(a) to claims that:</P>
                <P>(a) Have not been referred to another Federal agency, including the GAO, for further collection action; and</P>

                <P>(b) A debtor may not use the failure of the Board to comply with any provision of this part or the Federal Claims Collection Standards as a defense to the debt.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Written demand for payment.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The Board shall make appropriate written demand upon the debtor for payment of money in terms which specify:</P>
                <P>(1) The basis for the indebtedness and the right of the debtor to request review within the Board;</P>
                <P>(2) The amount claimed;</P>
                <P>(3) The date by which payment is to be made, which normally should not be more than 30 days from the date that the initial demand letter statement was mailed, unless otherwise specified by contractual agreement, established by Federal statute or regulation, or agreed to under a payment agreement;</P>
                <P>(4) The applicable standards for assessing interest, penalties, and administrative costs (31 CFR 901.9 and 49 CFR 1018.30); and</P>
                <P>(5) The applicable policy for reporting the delinquent debt to consumer reporting agencies.</P>
                <P>(b) The Board normally shall send three progressively stronger written demands at not more than 30-day intervals, unless circumstances indicate that alternative remedies better protect the Government's interest, that the debtor has explicitly refused to pay, or that sending a further demand is futile. Depending upon the circumstances of the particular case, the second and third demands may:</P>
                <P>(1) Offer or seek to confer with the debtor;</P>
                <P>(2) State the amount of the interest and penalties that will be added on a daily basis, as well as the administrative costs that will be added to the debt until the debt is paid; and</P>
                <P>(3) State that the authorized collection procedures include any procedure authorized in this part including:</P>
                <P>(i) Contacts with the debtor's employer when the debtor is employed by the Federal Government or is a member of the military establishment or the Coast Guard;</P>
                <P>(ii) Possible referral of the debt to a private agency for collection;</P>
                <P>(iii) Possible reporting of the delinquent debt to consumer reporting agencies in accordance with the guidelines and standards contained in 31 CFR 901.4 and the Board's procedures set forth in § 1018.23 of this part;</P>
                <P>(iv) The suspension or revocation of a license or other remedy under § 1018.25 of this part;</P>
                <P>(v) Installment payments possibly requiring security; and</P>
                <P>(vi) The right to refer claims to GAO or DOJ for litigation.</P>

                <P>(iii) The specific information to be disclosed to the consumer reporting agency; and</P>
                <P>(iv) That the debtor has the right to a complete explanation of the debt (if that has not already been given), to dispute information on Board records about the debt, and to request reconsideration of the debt by administrative appeal or review of the debt.</P>
                <P>(3) The Board has sent at least one written demand by either registered or certified mail with the notification described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(4) The Board has reconsidered its initial decision on the debt when the debtor has requested a review under § 1018.23(a)(2)(iv).</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Closure of accounts.</E> If a tariff filing fee account is past due more than 90 days, the Board will freeze the account until the account is made current. The Board will notify the account holder that the account has been frozen and that until the account balance including any applicable interest, penalties, and administrative costs are paid, all future filings, must be accompanied by a certified check, cashier's check, or money order. The Board reserves the right to refuse to maintain an account which is repeatedly delinquent.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Suspension or revocation of tariff filing privileges.</E> If the account holder fails to satisfy all claims for tariff filing fees including applicable interest, penalties, and the administrative costs of collection of the debt, the Board may suspend or prohibit a tariff filing fee account holder from submitting tariff filings in its own name or on behalf of others.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Suspension or revocation of certificates, licenses, or permits granted by the Board.</E> The Board may suspend or revoke any certificates, permits, or licenses which the Board has granted to an account holder or other debtor for any inexcusable, prolonged, or repeated failure or refusal to pay a delinquent debt.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedures for suspension or revocation of filing privileges, certificates, licenses, or permits for failure to pay tariff filing fees.</E> Before suspending or revoking an account holder's privilege to submit tariff filings or suspending or revoking any certificate, license, or permit which the Board has granted to any account holder, the Board shall issue to the account holder an order to show cause why the tariff filing privilege or any certificate, license, or permit should not be suspended or revoked. The Board shall allow the debtor no more than 30 days to pay the debt in full including applicable interest, penalties, and administrative costs of collection of the delinquent debt. The Board may suspend or revoke any certificate, license, permit, approval or filing privilege at the end of this period upon a finding of willful noncompliance with the Board's order. If any certificate, license, permit, or filing privilege is revoked under this authority of this part, a new application with appropriate fees must be made to the Board, and all previous delinquent debts of the debtor to the Board must be paid before the Board will consider such application.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Other sanctions.</E> The remedies and sanctions available to the Board in this area are not exclusive. The Board may impose other sanctions, where permitted by law for any inexcusable, prolonged, or repeated failure of a debtor to pay such claim. In such cases, the Board will provide notice and a hearing, as required by law, to the debtor prior to the imposition of any such sanctions.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Collection by administrative offset.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The Board may administratively undertake collection by offset on each claim which is liquidated or certain in amount in accordance with the guidelines and the standards contained in 31 CFR 901.2 and 901.3 and 5 U.S.C. 5514, as applicable. The Board may not initiate administrative offset to collect a debt more than 10 years after the Government's right to the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right to collect the debt were not known and could not reasonably have been known to the Board.</P>
                <P>(b) Collection by administrative offset of amounts payable from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, the Federal Employees Retirement System, or other similar fund is made pursuant to 31 CFR 901.3(e) and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) Salary offset is governed by 5 U.S.C. 5514.</P>
                <P>(d) The following procedures apply when the Board seeks to collect a debt by offset against any payment to be made to a debtor or against the assets of a holder of a certificate, permit, license, or authorization issued by the Board.</P>
                <P>(1) Before the offset is made, the Board shall provide the debtor written notice of the nature and amount of the debt and:</P>
                <P>(i) Notice of the Board's intent to collect the debt by offset;</P>
                <P>(ii) An opportunity to inspect and copy Board records pertaining to the debt;</P>
                <P>(iii) An opportunity to request reconsideration of the debt by the Board, or if provided for by statute, waiver of the debt;</P>
                <P>(iv) An opportunity to enter into a written agreement with the Board to repay or pay the debt, as the case may be;</P>
                <P>(v) An explanation of the debtor's rights under this subpart; and</P>
                <P>(vi) An opportunity for a hearing when required under the provisions of 31 CFR 901.3(e).</P>
                <P>(2) If the Board learns that other agencies of the Government are holding funds payable to the debtor, the Board shall provide the other agencies with written certification that the debt is owed to the Board and that the Board has complied with the provisions of 4 CFR 102.3. The Board shall request that funds which are due the debtor and which are necessary to offset the debt to the Board be transferred to the Board.</P>
                <P>(3) The Board may accept a repayment or payment agreement, as appropriate, in lieu of offset, but will do so only after balancing the Government's interest in collecting the debts against fairness to the debtor. If the debt is delinquent and the debtor has not disputed its existence or amount, the Board may accept a repayment or payment agreement in lieu of offset only if the debtor is able to establish under sworn affidavit or statement certified under penalty of perjury that offset would result in financial hardship or would result in undue financial hardship or would be against equity and good conscience.</P>
                <P>(4) Administrative offset is not authorized with respect to:</P>
                <P>(i) Debts owed by any State or local government;</P>
                <P>(ii) Debts once they become subject to the salary offset provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514; or</P>
                <P>(iii) Any case in which collection of the type of debt involved by administrative offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute.</P>

                <P>(5) The Board reserves the right to take any other action in respect to offset as is permitted under 4 CFR 102.3.<PRTPAGE P="63"/>
                </P>
                <P>(e) The Board shall make appropriate use of the cooperative efforts of other agencies including the Army Holdup List in effecting collections by offset. The Army Holdup List is a list of contractors indebted to the United States.</P>

                <P>(2) If the debtor owes more than one debt and designates how a voluntary installment payment is to be applied among those debts, the Board shall follow that designation.

                <P>(b) Before assessing any charges on delinquent debts, the Board shall mail a written notice to debtor explaining its requirements concerning these charges under 31 CFR 901.2 and 901.9.</P>
                <P>(c) Interest begins to accrue from the date on which the initial invoice is first mailed to the debtor unless a different date is specified on a statute, regulation, or contract.</P>

                <P>(e) Interest is computed only on the principal of the debt, and the interest rate remains fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, unless the debtor defaults on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement.</P>

                <P>(f) The Board shall assess against a debtor charges to cover administrative costs incurred as a result of a delinquent debt. Administrative costs may include costs incurred in obtaining a credit report or in using a private debt collector, to the extent they are attributable to the delinquency.<PRTPAGE P="64"/>
                </P>
                <P>(g) The Board shall assess a penalty charge of six percent a year on any portion of a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days. The charge accrues retroactively to the date that the debt became delinquent.</P>
                <P>(h) Amounts received by the Board as partial or installment payments are applied first to outstanding penalty and administrative cost charges, second to accrued interest, and third to outstanding principal.</P>

                <P>(j) The Board may waive interest during the periods a debt disputed under § 1018.26 is under investigation or review before the Board. This additional waiver is not automatic and must be requested before the expiration of the initial 30-day waiver period. The Board may grant the additional waiver only when it finds merit in the explanation the debtor has submitted under § 1018.26.</P>
                <P>(k) The Board may waive the collection of interest, penalties, and administrative costs if it finds that one or more of the following conditions exists:</P>
                <P>(1) The debtor is unable to pay any significant sum toward the debt within a reasonable time;</P>
                <P>(2) Collection of interest, penalties, and administrative costs will jeopardize collection of the principal of the debt;</P>

                <P>(1) The full amount cannot be collected because:</P>
                <P>(i) The debtor is unable to pay the full amount within a reasonable time; or</P>
                <P>(ii) The debtor refuses to pay the claim in full, and the Government is unable to enforce collection in full within a reasonable time; or</P>
                <P>(2) There is a real doubt concerning the Government's ability to prove its case in Court for the full amount claimed, either because of the legal issues involved or a bona fide dispute as to the facts; or</P>
                <P>(3) The costs of collecting the claim do not justify the enforced collection of the full amount. The Board shall apply this reason for compromise in accordance with the guidelines in 31 CFR 902.2.</P>
                <P>(b) The Board shall determine the debtor's inability to pay, the Government's ability to enforce collection, and the amounts which are acceptable in compromise in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 31 CFR part 902.</P>
                <P>(c) Compromises payable in installments are discouraged, but, if necessary, must be in the form of a legally enforceable agreement for the reinstatement of the prior indebtedness less sums paid thereon. The agreement also must provide that in the event of default:</P>

                <P>(b) When the debtor owns no substantial equity in realty and is unable to make payments on the Government's claim or effect a compromise on it at the time, but the debtor's future prospects justify retention of the claim for periodic review and action:</P>
                <P>(1) The applicable statute of limitations has been tolled or started anew; or</P>

                <P>(b) When the debtor cannot be located, there is no security remaining to be liquidated, the applicable statute of limitations has run, and the prospects of collecting by offset, notwithstanding the bar of the statute of limitations, are too remote to justify retention of the claim; or</P>

                <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
                <P>This subpart establishes procedures for the Board to refer past-due debts to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the offset against the income tax refunds of persons owing debts to the Board. It specifies the Board's procedures and the rights of the debtor applicable to claims for the payment of debts owed to the Board.</P>

              <SECTION>
                <SECTNO>§ 1018.91</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Applicability and scope.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) These regulations implement 31 U.S.C. 3720A which authorizes the IRS to reduce a tax refund by the amount of a past-due legally enforceable debt owed to the Government of the United States.</P>
                <P>(b) For purposes of this section, a past-due legally enforceable debt referable to the IRS is a debt which is owed to the Government of the United States and:</P>
                <P>(1) Except in the case of a judgment debt, has been delinquent for at least 3 months but has not been delinquent for more than 10 years at the time the offset is made;</P>
                <P>(2) Cannot be currently collected pursuant to the salary offset provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1);</P>
                <P>(3) Is ineligible for administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by reason of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2) or cannot be collected by administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by the Board against amounts payable to or on behalf of the debtor by or on behalf of the Board;</P>

                <P>(4) With respect to which the Board has given the taxpayer at least 60 days from the date of notification to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due or legally enforceable, has considered evidence presented by such <PRTPAGE P="68"/>taxpayer, and has determined that an amount of such debt is past-due and legally enforceable;</P>
                <P>(5) Has been disclosed by the Board to a consumer reporting agency as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3711(f), unless a consumer reporting agency would be prohibited from using such information by 15 U.S.C. 1681c, or unless the amount of the debt does not exceed $100.00;</P>
                <P>(6) With respect to which the Board has notified or has made a reasonable attempt to notify the taxpayer that the debt is past-due and, unless repaid within 60 days thereafter, the debt will be referred to the IRS for offset against any overpayment of tax;</P>
                <P>(7) Is at least $25.00; and</P>
                <P>(8) All other requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720A and the Department of the Treasury regulations codified at 26 CFR 301.6402-6 relating to the eligibility of a debt for tax return offset have been satisfied.</P>

                <P>(1) Send a written request for a review of the evidence to the address provided in the notice.</P>
                <P>(2) State in the request the amount disputed and the reasons why the debtor believes that the debt is not past-due or is not legally enforceable.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Submission of evidence.</E> The debtor may submit evidence showing that all or part of the debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable along with the notification required by paragraph (a) of this section. Failure to submit the notification and evidence within 60 days will result in an automatic referral of the debt to the IRS without further action by the Board.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Review of the evidence.</E> The Board will consider all available evidence related to the debt. Within 30 days, if feasible, the Board will notify the debtor whether the Board has sustained, amended, or canceled its determination that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Fixed rate cars.</E> Car hire for fixed rate cars shall be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, for a 10-year period beginning January 1, 1993, the prescribed rates shall continue to apply to fixed rate cars without regard to the aging of such cars subsequent to December 31, 1990. Prescribed car hire rates shall not be increased for any additions and betterments performed on such cars after December 31, 1990. Any OT-37 surcharge to prescribed rates for work performed prior to January 1, 1993 shall expire upon the earlier of:</P>
              <P>(i) The car becoming a market rate car; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The expiration date provided in Association of American Railroads Circular No. OT-37.</P>
              <P>(2) Upon termination of the 10-year period specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, all fixed rate cars shall be deemed to be market rate cars and shall be governed by paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) (i) During each calendar year beginning January 1, 1994, a rail carrier may voluntarily elect to designate up to 10% of the cars in its fleet as of January 1, 1993 to be treated as market rate cars for the purposes of this section. The 10% limitation shall apply each calendar year and shall be noncumulative. Cars designated to be treated as market rate cars shall be governed by paragraph (c) of this section. Such election shall be effective only in accordance with the following provisions:</P>
              <P>(A) An election shall be irrevocable and binding as to the rail carrier making the election and all users and subsequent owners if:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The rail carrier making the election has legal title to the car; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The rail carrier making the election does not have legal title to the car but obtains written consent for such election from the party holding legal title; or</P>

              <P>(B) An election shall be irrevocable and binding only for the term of the transaction pursuant to which the car was furnished to the rail carrier making the election as to that rail carrier and all users and subsequent owners if:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) That rail carrier does not have legal title to the car and does not obtain written consent or such election from the party holding legal title;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The transaction was entered into prior to January 1, 1991; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The transaction does not provide that the compensation to be paid to the party furnishing the car is to be based in whole or in part directly on the car hire earnings of the car; provided, however, that if the rail carrier making the election subsequently obtains legal title to the car, such election shall then be irrevocable and binding as to the rail carrier and all users and subsequent owners.</P>
              <P>(C) The party holding legal title to the car may revoke an election subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section only:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) At the time the transaction pursuant to which the car was furnished to the rail carrier making the election is first extended or renewed after January 1, 1991; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If such transaction is not extended or renewed, at the time such transaction terminates.</P>
              <FP>If such election is so revoked, a rail carrier may make a new election only with the written consent of the party holding legal title to the car, and such election shall be irrevocable and binding as to the rail carrier making the election and all users and subsequent owners.</FP>
              <P>(ii) Nothing in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section shall be construed to limit the rights of parties to any transaction to provide for the consent of any party to an election made pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Market rate cars.</E> (1) Market rate cars shall not be subject to prescribed rates or to the provisions of 49 CFR 1039.14(c)(1) (i) and (ii) and (c)(4).</P>

              <P>(ii) The Code of Car Hire Rules referenced in the Association of American Railroads Car Service and Car Hire Agreement provides that owners and users party to that agreement shall resolve car hire disputes thereunder.

              <P>(iii) Car hire disputes involving an owner or user not a party to that agreement may be resolved by the Board.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Temporary authority.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> Any railroad subject to regulation under 49 U.S.C. 10501 may reasonably divert or reroute traffic to other carriers, if it is unable due to circumstances beyond its control promptly to transport traffic over a portion of its lines. Traffic necessarily diverted under this authority shall be rerouted to preserve as much as possible the participation and revenues of other carriers provided in the original routing. This authority may be exercised for no more than 30 days following the day on which the rerouting begins. If a carrier needs more than 30 days before its disability or the disability of a receiving carrier is cured, it may automatically extend its rerouting for additional 30-day periods. To extend the period, it must submit a written or electronic notice to the Association of American Railroads and the Board's Office of Public Assistance, Governmental Affairs, and Compliance explaining why the rerouting is necessary, when it began, when the disability occurred, why an extension is necessary, the specific lines disabled, the rerouting to be continued, which shippers are affected, and any other important facts.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Concurrence by carriers.</E> A railroad rerouting traffic must receive the concurrence of other railroads to which the traffic will be diverted or rerouted, before the rerouting or diversion begins. A rerouting carrier must also confirm the inability of a disabled receiving carrier to handle the traffic before rerouting that traffic. If the receiving carrier is no longer disabled, it must accept the traffic according to the routing originally designated.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice by rerouting carrier.</E> A rerouting carrier must notify the Board's Office of Public Assistance, Governmental Affairs, and Compliance, the Association of American Railroads, Car Service Division, as agent of all railroads subscribing to car service and car hire agreements, and the American Short Line Railroad Association before the rerouting or diversion begins. The originating carrier must notify each shipper at the time each shipment is rerouted or diverted and furnish to each shipper the rerouting, <E T="03">except when the disability requiring the rerouting occurs after the movement has begun.</E> When a rerouting carrier submits to the Board a notice and explanation for an extension of the rerouting period, it must immediately also submit a copy of that notice and explanation to the AAR, the ASLRA and all shippers that have been affected or that the carrier believes will be affected or that request a copy.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice by AAR.</E> The AAR shall notify all carriers affected by rerouting or by an extension of a rerouting period, in a manner similar to that used for embargoes.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Applicable rates.</E> The rates applicable on shipments rerouted or diverted will be the rates applicable over the route originally designated at the time the shipments are tendered.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Divisions.</E> The carriers involved in the rerouting or diversion shall proceed even though no contracts, agreements, or arrangements exist between them at the time concerning the divisions of the rates applicable to the traffic. Divisions shall be, during the time the rerouting is in effect, those voluntarily agreed upon by the carriers.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Contract Terms and Conditions</HD>
              <P>Sec. 1. (a) The carrier or party in possession of any of the property herein described shall be liable as at common law for any loss thereof or damage thereto, except as hereinafter provided.</P>

              <P>(b) No carrier or party in possession of all or any of the property herein described shall be liable for any loss thereof or damage thereto or delay caused by the act of God, the public enemy, the authority of law, or the act or default of the shipper or owner, or for natural shrinkage. The carrier's liability shall be that of warehouseman, only, for loss, damage, or delay caused by fire occurring after the expiration of the free time allowed by tariffs lawfully on file (such free time to be computed as therein provided) after notice of the arrival of the property at <PRTPAGE P="78"/>destination or at the port of export (if intended for export) has been duly sent or given, and after placement of the property for delivery at destination, or tender of delivery of the property to the party entitled to receive it, has been made. Except in case of negligence of the carrier or party in possession (and the burden to prove freedom from such negligence shall be on the carrier or party in possession), the carrier or party in possession shall not be liable for loss, damage, or delay occurring while the property is stopped and held in transit upon the request of the shipper, owner, or party entitled to make such request, or resulting from a defect or vice in the property, or for country damage to cotton, or from riots or strikes.</P>
              <P>(c) In case of quarantine the property may be discharged at risk and expense of owners into quarantine depot or elsewhere, as required by quarantine regulations or authorities, or for the carrier's dispatch at nearest available point in carrier's judgment, and in any such case carrier's responsibility shall cease when property is so discharged, or property may be returned by carrier at owner's expense to shipping point, earning freight both ways. Quarantine expenses of whatever nature or kind upon or in respect to property shall be borne by the owners of the property or be a lien thereon. The carrier shall not be liable for loss or damage occasioned by fumigation or disinfection or other acts required or done by quarantine regulations or authorities even though the same may have been done by carrier's officers, agents, or employees, nor for detention, loss, or damage of any kind occasioned by quarantine or the enforcement thereof. No carrier shall be liable, except in case of negligence, for any mistake or inaccuracy in any information furnished by the carrier, its agents, or officers, as to quarantine laws or regulations. The shipper shall hold the carriers harmless from any expense they may incur, or damages they may be required to pay, by reason of the introduction of the property covered by this contract into any place against the quarantine laws or regulations in effect at such place.</P>
              <P>Sec. 2. (a) No carrier is bound to transport said property by any particular train or vessel, or in time for any particular market or otherwise than with reasonable dispatch. Every carrier shall have the right in case of physical necessity to forward said property by any carrier or route between the point of shipment and the point of destination. In all cases not prohibited by law, where a lower value than actual value has been represented in writing by the shipper or has been agreed upon in writing as the released value of the property as determined by the classification or tariffs upon which the rate is based, such lower value plus freight charges if paid shall be the maximum amount to be recovered, whether or not such loss or damage occurs from negligence.</P>
              <P>(b) As a condition precedent to recovery, claims must be filed in writing with the receiving or delivering carrier, or carrier issuing this bill of lading, or carrier on whose line the loss, damage, injury or delay occurred, within nine months after delivery of the property (or, in case of export traffic, within nine months after delivery at port of export) or, in case of failure to make delivery, then within nine months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed; and suits shall be instituted against any carrier only within two years and one day from the day when notice in writing is given by the carrier to the claimant that the carrier has disallowed the claim or any part or parts thereof specified in the notice. Where claims are not filed or suits are not instituted thereon in accordance with the foregoing provisions, no carrier hereunder shall be liable, and such claims will not be paid.</P>
              <P>(c) Any carrier or party liable on account of loss of or damage to any of said property shall have the full benefit of any insurance that may have been effected upon or on account of said property, so far as this shall not avoid the policies or contracts of insurance: Provided, That the carrier reimburse the claimant for the premium paid thereon.</P>
              <P>Sec. 3. Except where such service is required as the result of carrier's negligence, all property shall be subject to necessary cooperage and baling at owner's cost. Each carrier over whose route cotton or cotton linters is to be transported hereunder shall have the privilege, at its own cost and risk, of compressing the same for greater convenience in handling or forwarding, and shall not be held responsible for deviation or unavoidable delays in procuring such compression. Grain in bulk consigned to a point where there is a railroad, public or licensed elevator, may (unless otherwise expressly noted herein, and then if it is not promptly unloaded) be there delivered and placed with other grain of the same kind and grade without respect to ownership (and prompt notice thereof shall be given to the consignor), and if so delivered shall be subject to a lien for elevator charges in addition to all other charges hereunder.</P>

              <P>Sec. 4. (a) Property not removed by the party entitled to receive it within the free time allowed by tariffs, lawfully on file (such free time to be computed as therein provided), after notice of the arrival of the property at destination or at the port of export (if intended for export) has been duly sent or given, and after placement of the property for delivery at destination has been made, may be kept in vessel, car, depot, warehouse or place of delivery of the carrier, subject to the tariff charge for storage and to carrier's responsibility as warehouseman, only, or at the option of the carrier, may be removed to <PRTPAGE P="79"/>and stored in a public or licensed warehouse at the place of delivery or other available place, at the cost of the owner, and there held without liability on the part of the carrier, and subject to a lien for all freight and other lawful charges, including a reasonable charge for storage.</P>
              <P>(b) Where nonperishable property which has been transported to destination hereunder is refused by consignee or the party entitled to receive it, or said consignee or party entitled to receive it fails to receive it within 15 days after notice of arrival shall have been duly sent or given, the carrier may sell the same at public auction to the highest bidder, at such place as may be designated by the carrier: Provided, That the carrier shall have first mailed, sent, or given to the consignor notice that the property has been refused or remains unclaimed, as the case may be, and that it will be subject to sale under the terms of the bill of lading if disposition be not arranged for, and shall have published notice containing a description of the property, the name of the party to whom consigned, or, if shipped order notify, the name of the party to be notified, and the time and place of sale, once a week for two successive weeks, in a newspaper of general circulation at the place of sale or nearest place where such newspaper is published: Provided, That 30 days shall have elapsed before publication of notice of sale after said notice that the property was refused or remains unclaimed was mailed, sent, or given.</P>
              <P>(c) Where perishable property which has been transported hereunder to destination is refused by consignee or party entitled to receive it, or said consignee or party entitled to receive it shall fail to receive it promptly, the carrier, may, in its discretion, to prevent deterioration or further deterioration, sell the same to the best advantage at private or public sale: Provided, That if time serves for notification to the consignor or owner of the refusal of the property or the failure to receive it, and request for disposition of the property, such notification shall be given, in such manner as the exercise of due diligence requires, before the property is sold.</P>
              <P>(d) Where the procedure provided for in the two paragraphs last preceding is not possible, it is agreed that nothing contained in said paragraphs shall be construed to abridge the right of the carrier at its option to sell the property under such circumstances and in such manner as may be authorized by law.</P>
              <P>(e) The proceeds of any sale made under this section shall be applied by the carrier to the payment of freight, demurrage, storage, and any other lawful charges and the expense of notice, advertisement, sale, and other necessary expense and of caring for and maintaining the property, if proper care of the same requires special expense, and should there be a balance it shall be paid to the owner of the property sold hereunder.</P>
              <P>(f) Property destined to or taken from a station, wharf, or landing at which there is no regularly appointed freight agent shall be entirely at risk of owner after unloaded from cars or vessels or until loaded into cars or vessels, and except in case of carrier's negligence, when received from or delivered to such stations, wharves, or landings shall be at owner's risk until the cars are attached to and after they are detached from locomotive or train or until loaded into and after unloaded from vessels.</P>
              <P>Sec. 5. No carrier hereunder will carry or be liable in any way for any documents, specie, or for any articles of extraordinary value not specifically rated in the published classifications or tariffs unless a special agreement to do so and a stipulated value of the articles are indorsed hereon.</P>
              <P>Sec. 6. Every party, whether principal or agent, shipping explosives or dangerous goods, without previous full written disclosure to the carrier of their nature, shall be liable for and indemnify the carrier against all loss or damage caused by such goods, and such goods may be warehoused at owner's risk and expense or destroyed without compensation.</P>

              <P>Sec. 7. The owner or consignee shall pay the freight and average, if any, and all other lawful charges accruing on said property; but, except in those instances where it may lawfully be authorized to do so, no carrier by railroad shall deliver or relinquish possession at destination of the property covered by this bill of lading until all tariff rates and charges thereon have been paid. The consignor shall be liable for the freight and all other lawful charges, except that if the consignor stipulates, by signature, in the space provided for that purpose on the face of this bill of lading that the carrier shall not make delivery without requiring payment of such charges and the carrier, contrary to such stipulation, shall make delivery without requiring such payment, the consignor (except as hereinafter provided) shall not be liable for such charges. Provided, that, where the carrier has been instructed by the shipper or consignor to deliver said property to a consignee other than the shipper or consignor, such consignee shall not be legally liable for transportation charges in respect of the transportation of said property (beyond those billed against him at the time of delivery for which he is otherwise liable) which may be found to be due after the property has been delivered to him, if the consignee (a) is an agent only and has no beneficial title in said property, and (b) prior to delivery of said property has notified the delivering carrier in writing of the fact of such agency and absence of beneficial title, and, in the case of a shipment reconsigned or diverted to a point other than that specified in <PRTPAGE P="80"/>the original bill of lading, has also notified the delivering carrier in writing of the name and address of the beneficial owner of said property; and, in such cases the shipper or consignor, or, in the case of a shipment so reconsigned or diverted, the beneficial owner, shall be liable for such additional charges. If the consignee has given to the carrier erroneous information as to who the beneficial owner is, such consignee shall himself be liable for such additional charges. On shipments reconsigned or diverted by an agent who has furnished the carrier in the reconsignment or diversion order with a notice of agency and the proper name and address of the beneficial owner, and where such shipments are refused or abandoned at ultimate destination, the said beneficial owner shall be liable for all legally applicable charges in connection therewith. If the reconsignor or diverter has given to the carrier erroneous information as to who the beneficial owner is, such reconsignor or diverter shall himself be liable for all such charges.</P>
              <P>If a shipper or consignor of a shipment of property (other than a prepaid shipment) is also the consignee named in the bill of lading and, prior to the time of delivery, notifies, in writing, a delivering carrier by railroad (a) to deliver such property at destination to another party, (b) that such party is the beneficial owner of such property, and (c) that delivery is to be made to such party only upon payment of all transportation charges in respect of the transportation of such property, and delivery is made by the carrier to such party without such payment, such shipper or consignor shall not be liable (as shipper, consignor, consignee, or otherwise) for such transportation charges but the party to whom delivery is so made shall in any event be liable for transportation charges billed against the property at the time of such delivery, and also for any additional charges which may be found to be due after delivery of the property, except that if such party prior to such delivery has notified in writing the delivering carrier that he is not the beneficial owner of the property, and has given in writing to such delivering carrier the name and address of such beneficial owner, such party shall not be liable for any additional charges which may be found to be due after delivery of the property; but if the party to whom delivery is made has given to the carrier erroneous information as to the beneficial owner, such party shall nevertheless be liable for such additional charges. If the shipper or consignor has given to the delivering carrier erroneous information as to who the beneficial owner is, such shipper or consignor shall himself be liable for such transportation charges, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph and irrespective of any provisions to the contrary in the bill of lading or in the contract of transportation under which the shipment was made. The term “delivering carrier” means the line-haul carrier making ultimate delivery.</P>
              <P>Nothing herein shall limit the right of the carrier to require at time of shipment the prepayment or guarantee of the charges. If upon inspection it is ascertained that the articles shipped are not those described in this bill of lading, the freight charges must be paid upon the articles actually shipped.</P>
              <P>Where delivery is made by a common carrier by water the foregoing provisions of this section shall apply, except as may be inconsistent with part III of the Interstate Commerce Act.</P>
              <P>Sec. 8. If this bill of lading is issued on the order of the shipper, or his agent, in exchange or in substitution for another bill of lading, the shipper's signature to the prior bill of lading as to the statement of value or otherwise, or election of common law or bill of lading liability, in or in connection with such prior bill of lading, shall be considered a part of this bill of lading as fully as if the same were written or made in or in connection with this bill of lading.</P>
              <P>Sec. 9. (a) If all or any part of said property is carried by water over any part of said route, and loss, damage or injury to said property occurs while the same is in the custody of a carrier by water the liability of such carrier shall be determined by the bill of lading of the carrier by water (this bill of lading being such bill of lading if the property is transported by such water carrier thereunder) and by and under the laws and regulations applicable to transportation by water. Such water carriage shall be performed subject to all the terms and provisions of, and all the exemptions from liability contained in the Act of Congress of the United States, approved on February 13, 1893, and entitled “An act relating to the navigation of vessels, etc.” and of other statutes of the United States according carriers by water the protection of limited liability as well as the following subdivisions of this section: and to the conditions contained in this bill of lading not inconsistent with this section, when this bill of lading becomes the bill of lading of the carrier by water.</P>
              <P>(b) No such carrier by water shall be liable for any loss or damage resulting from any fire happening to or on board the vessel, or from explosion, bursting of boilers or breakage of shafts, unless caused by the design or neglect of such carrier.</P>

              <P>(c) If the owner shall have exercised due diligence in making the vessel in all respects seaworthy and properly manned, equipped and supplied, no such carrier shall be liable for any loss or damage resulting from the perils of the lakes, seas, or other waters, or from latent defects in hull, machinery, or appurtenances whether existing prior to, at the time of, or after sailing, or from collision, stranding, or other accidents of navigation, <PRTPAGE P="81"/>or from prolongation of the voyage. And, when for any reason it is necessary, any vessel carrying any or all of the property herein described shall be at liberty to call at any port or ports, in or out of the customary route, to tow and be towed, to transfer, trans-ship, or lighter, to load and discharge goods at any time, to assist vessels in distress, to deviate for the purpose of saving life or property, and for docking and repairs. Except in case of negligence such carrier shall not be responsible for any loss or damage to property if it be necessary or is usual to carry the same upon deck.</P>
              <P>(d) General Average shall be payable according to the York-Antwerp Rules of 1924, sections 1 to 15, inclusive, and sections 17 to 22, inclusive, and as to matters not covered thereby according to the laws and usages of the Port of New York. If the owners shall have exercised due diligence to make the vessel in all respects seaworthy and properly manned, equipped and supplied, it is hereby agreed that in case of danger, damage or disaster resulting from faults or errors in navigation, or in the management of the vessel, or from any latent or other defects in the vessel, her machinery or appurtenance, or from unseaworthiness, whether existing at the time of shipment or at the beginning of the voyage (provided the latent or other defects or the unseaworthiness was not discoverable by the exercise of due diligence), the shippers, consignees and/or owners of the cargo shall nevertheless pay salvage and any special charges incurred in respect of the cargo, and shall contribute with the shipowner in general average to the payment of any sacrifices, losses or expenses of a general average nature that may be made or incurred for the common benefit or to relieve the adventure from any common peril.</P>
              <P>(e) If the property is being carried under a tariff which provides that any carrier or carriers party thereto shall be liable for loss from perils of the sea, then as to such carrier or carriers the provisions of this section shall be modified in accordance with the tariff provisions, which shall be regarded as incorporated into the conditions of this bill of lading.</P>
              <P>(f) The term “water carriage” in this section shall not be construed as including lighterage in or across rivers, harbors, or lakes, when performed by or on behalf of rail carriers.</P>
              <P>Sec. 10. Any alteration, addition, or erasure in this bill of lading which shall be made without the special notation hereon of the agent of the carrier issuing this bill of lading, shall be without effect, and this bill of lading shall be enforceable according to its original tenor.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1037.1</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Weights and weighing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) How determined—Accuracy of the weights used in determining the quantity of grain and grain products received for transportation by carriers and delivered by them to consignees being of primary and fundamental importance, the use of estimated weights based upon the cubical contents of the load and the test weight per bushel of the grain and grain products, or otherwise, will not be accepted. All shipments shall be carefully weighed by competent weighers upon scales that are known to be accurate within the limits of tolerance stated in scale specifications.</P>
              <P>(b) Inspection of scales—Before weighing grain and grain products to and from cars, the scale and all other facilities to be used must be thoroughly inspected to ascertain whether they are in proper working condition, necessary adjustments or repairs, if any required, must be made, and an accurate and complete record thereof shall be entered at the time of inspection.</P>

              <P>(c) Shipping weights—Where the shipper weighs the grain or grain products for shipment and a claim for loss and damage is subsequently filed on that shipment, the shipper shall furnish the carrier with whom the claim is filed certificates of weight showing car initials and number; the kind of grain or grain products; the total scale weight; the type and house number of the scale used; the number of drafts and weight of each draft; the date and time of weighing; whether the weight is official, board-of-trade, grain-exchange, State, or other supervised weight; and the number of grain doors used. This information should be furnished at the time the claim is filed.<PRTPAGE P="82"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) Destination weights—Where the consignee weighs a shipment of grain or grain products and a claim for loss and damage is subsequently filed on the shipment, the consignee shall furnish the carrier with whom the claim is filed certificates of weight showing the car initials and number; the kind of grain or grain products; the total scale weight; the type and house number of the scale used; the number of drafts and weight of each draft, and the date and time of weighing; and whether the weight is official, board-of-trade, grain-exchange, State, or other supervised weight. This information should be furnished at the time the claim is filed.</P>

              <P>(e) A difference in weights at origin and destination, both of which are based on supervised scales, establishes <E T="03">prima facie</E> that the loss occurred in transit and that the railroad is liable. When a difference in weights is based in part on an unsupervised weight, which nevertheless, was accepted by the railroad as the basis for assessing freight charges, such unsupervised weight in combination with a supervised weight establishes <E T="03">prima facie</E> that the loss occurred in transit and the railroad is liable. When a difference in weights is based in part on an unsupervised weight, with the above exception, a <E T="03">prima facie</E> case of railroad liability for loss in transit has <E T="03">not</E> been established. Such difference in weights is a factor, however, to be considered in connection with other evidence that a clear-record car arrived at destination with seals intact and unbroken or that the shipper made a written complaint that any car placed for loading was defective, in response to which the railroad filed a written report after investigation of the complaint. See paragraph (c) of § 1037.3.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1037.2</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Cars.</SUBJECT>
              <P>A car is not in suitable condition for the transportation of bulk grain and grain products when it is defective. The rules prescribed in this part 1037 apply on shipments transported solely in railroad-owned and railroad-leased cars.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1037.3</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Claims.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In computing the amount of the loss for which the carrier will pay there will be deducted from the gross amount of the ascertained actual loss one-fourth of 1 percent of the established loading weight to cover invisible loss and waste; provided, however, that where grain and grain products heat in transit and investigation shows that the invisible loss resulting therefrom exceeded one-fourth of 1 percent of such other amount as may hereafter be fixed in the manner above stated, and that the carrier is not otherwise liable for said loss, then the ascertained actual amount of the invisible loss due to heating of the grain and grain products will be deducted.</P>
              <P>(b) Where investigation discloses a defect in equipment, seal or seal record, or a transfer in transit by the carrier of a carload of bulk grain or grain products upon which the unloading weight is less than the loading weight and the shipper furnishes duly attested certificates showing the correctness of the claimed weight, and investigation fails to show that the discrepancy is due to defective scales or other shipper facilities, or to inaccurate weighing or other error at point of origin or destination, or to fraud, then the resulting claim will be adjusted subject to the deductions authorized in the immediately preceding paragraph (a) of this § 1037.3; provided, however, that the clear record of either the carrier's or shippers' facilities shall not be interpreted as affecting or changing the burden of proof now lawfully resting upon either party. Therefore, movement in a clear-record car is not conclusive evidence of the fact that the car is not defective. It must be considered along with other evidence to determine liability. See paragraph (e) of § 1037.1</P>

              <P>(c) In case of a disputed claim, the records of both the carrier and the claimant affecting the shipment involved shall be available to both parties. These records shall include a written complaint, if any, filed by the shipper with the railroad at the time the car was placed for loading that the car was defective, and the written report of an investigation of the complaint, filed <PRTPAGE P="83"/>by the railroad with the shipper, if made.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Boxcar transportation exemptions and rules.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Rail transportation of all commodities in boxcars is exempt from the provisions of 49 U.S.C. subtitle IV except as otherwise provided in this section.</P>
              <P>(b) The Board retains jurisdiction in the following areas:</P>
              <P>(1) Car hire and car service;</P>
              <P>(2) Mandatory interchange of equipment;</P>
              <P>(3) Reciprocal switching or joint use of terminal facilities;</P>
              <P>(4) Car supply;</P>
              <P>(5) Freight car pooling agreements; and<PRTPAGE P="86"/>
              </P>
              <P>(6) Freight rates applicable to boxcar traffic originating or terminating at an industry facility served physically by a Class III rail carrier, to the extent provided in paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, carriers are authorized to take the following actions with respect to boxcar equipment use:</P>

              <P>(i) Assess charges for empty movement of cars where movements are made at the request of the car owner, the Association of American Railroads, or the Board. The empty mileage charge is subject to a maximum of 35 cents per mile, as adjusted for inflation or deflation using the rail cost adjustment factors published periodically by the Board in Ex Parte No. 290 (Sub-No. 2), <E T="03">Railroad Cost Recovery Procedures.</E> In applying those factors, the figure of 35 cents will be treated as having been in effect on October 1, 1982.</P>
              <P>(ii) Store empty cars and reclaim car hire payments beginning at the expiration of a 72-hour grace period after the car is made empty.</P>
              <P>(iii) Negotiate bilateral agreements governing car hire rates, empty movements, and storage.</P>
              <P>(2) The authorization in paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section will not apply to excluded carriers, as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, nor will it apply to any boxcar which, on December 30, 1983, was owned or leased by a carrier which then would have qualified as an excluded carrier and which bears the reporting marks of an excluded carrier.</P>
              <P>(i) An “excluded carrier” is a Class III carrier or a Class II carrier not affiliated with one or more Class I carriers. To be affiliated, the Class II carrier must be more than 50 percent owned by one or more Class I carriers.</P>
              <P>(ii) The boxcar exclusion of paragraph (c)(2) of this section will apply:</P>
              <P>(A) To an excluded boxcar whenever it is owned or leased by any Class III carrier and bears a Class III carrier's reporting marks; and</P>
              <P>(B) To an excluded boxcar owned or leased by an excluded Class II carrier beginning on October 16, 1986, and ending on October 31, 1990, so long as such boxcar has not been otherwise owned or leased by another carrier during this period.</P>
              <P>(iii) The exclusion will not apply during any period in which an excluded boxcar is leased or assigned to a Class I or affiliated Class II carrier. If an excluded Class II carrier becomes a Class III carrier within the period under § 1039.14(c)(2)(ii)(B), that carrier will thereafter, for purposes of this rule, be treated as if it had been a Class III carrier on December 10, 1983.</P>
              <P>(iv) Nothing in paragraph (c)(2) of this section will affect the right of any carrier to negotiate bilateral agreements governing car hire rates and rules.</P>
              <P>(3) The hourly and mileage car hire rates in effect on January 1, 1985, as published in AAR Traffic Circular No. OT-10, for any boxcar excluded under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, will remain in effect without regard to the aging of such car subsequent to January 1, 1986, and any modification to the existing car hire formula will not apply to such cars. With respect to an excluded boxcar owned or leased by an excluded Class II carrier, those car hire rates shall remain in effect through October 31, 1990. Any improvements subsequent to January 1, 1985, to the excluded boxcars capitalized under OT-37 criteria or under rebuilt criteria will be subject to the same formula applicable to OT-37 or rebuilt cars under Ex Parte No. 334 or any other railroad car hire proceeding, including any efficiency ratio, if adopted. Any improvements or repairs subsequent to December 31, 1990, to the excluded boxcars performed under OT-37 criteria or under rebuilt criteria or any other criteria shall not result in any increases, additions, or surcharges in the car hire rates for such cars.</P>
              <P>(4) No freight rate made effective after April 1, 1985, that applies to traffic moving by boxcar and originating or terminating at an industry facility served physically by a Class III rail carrier may discriminate while these rules are in effect on the basis of:</P>
              <P>(i) The ownership of the boxcar used or the reporting marks any such boxcar bears;</P>

              <P>(ii) The car hire rate applicable to the boxcar used; or<PRTPAGE P="87"/>

Motor carrier TOFC/COFC pickup and delivery services arranged independently with <PRTPAGE P="89"/>the shipper or receiver (or its representative/agent) and performed immediately before or after a TOFC/COFC movement provided by a rail carrier are similarly exempt. Tariffs heretofore applicable to any transportation service exempted by this section shall no longer apply to such service. The exemption does not apply to a motor carrier service in which a rail carrier participates only as the motor carrier's agent (Plan I TOFC/COFC), nor does the exemption operate to relieve any carrier of any obligation it would otherwise have, absent the exemption, with respect to providing contractual terms for liability and claims.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Ex parte communications that are not prohibited and need not be disclosed.</E> (1) Any communication that the Board formally rules may be made on an ex parte basis;</P>

              <P>(2) Any communication occurring in informal rulemaking proceedings prior to the issuance of a notice of proposed rulemaking;<PRTPAGE P="92"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) Any communication of facts or contention which has general significance for a regulated industry if the communicator cannot reasonably be expected to have known that the facts or contentions are material to a substantive issue in a pending covered proceeding in which it is interested;</P>

                <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The following canons of ethics are adopted as a general guide for those admitted to practice before the Surface Transportation Board. The practitioners before the Board include (a) lawyers, who have been regularly admitted to practice law and (b) others who have fulfilled the requirements set forth in § 1103.3. The former are bound by a broad code of ethics and unwritten rules of professional conduct which apply to every activity of a lawyer. The canons do not release the lawyer from any of the duties or principles of professional conduct by which lawyers are bound. They apply similarly to all practitioners before the Board, but do not negate the applicability of other ethical codes. The canons are organized under three headings, The Practitioner's Duties and Responsibilities to the Board, The Practitioner's Duties and Responsibilities to the Client, The Practitioner's Duties and Responsibilities to Other Litigants, Witnesses and the Public.</P>

                  <P>These canons further the purpose of the Board's Rules of Practice which direct all persons appearing in proceedings before it to conform, as nearly as possible, to the standards of ethical conduct required of practice before the courts of the United States. Such standards are taken as the basis for these specifications and are modified as the nature of the practice before the Board requires.</P>

                  <P>(a) It is the duty of the practitioner to maintain a respectful attitude toward the Board and for the importance of the functions it administers. In many respects the Board functions as a Court, and practitioners should regard themselves as officers of that Court and uphold its honor and dignity.</P>
                  <P>(b) It is the right and duty of the practitioner to submit grievances about a member or employee of the Board to the proper authorities when proper grounds for complaint exists. In such cases, charges should be encouraged and the person making them should be protected.</P>
                  <P>(c) It is the duty of the practitioner to be punctual in attendance, and to be concise and direct in the trial and disposition of causes.</P>

                  <P>(b) Marked attention and unusual hospitality on the part of a practitioner to a Board Member, administrative law judge, or other representative of the Board, which is unwarranted by <PRTPAGE P="98"/>the personal relationship of the parties, is subject to misconstruction of motive and should be avoided.</P>

Practitioners at all times shall scrupulously refrain from going beyond <E T="03">ex parte</E> representations which are clearly proper in view of the administrative work of the Board in their communication with the Board and its staff.</P>

                  <P>The practitioner shall be respectful of the law and its official ministers, and shall not be involved in corruption of public officials or deception of the public. In giving improper service or advice, the practitioner invites and deserves stern condemnation. The practitioner shall observe and advise all clients to observe the statutory law to the best of his knowledge or as interpreted by competent adjudication. The practitioner owes a general duty to practice candor toward his client with respect to all aspects to his service to the client.</P>

                  <P>(a) At the time of the retainer, the practitioner shall disclose to the client all circumstances of his relations to the parties, and any interest in or connection with the case.</P>
                  <P>(b) It is unethical for a practitioner to represent conflicting interests, except by express consent of all concerned given after a full disclosure of the facts. Within the meaning of this section, a practitioner represents conflicting interest, when on behalf of one client, it is his duty to contend for that which duty to another client requires him to oppose.</P>
                  <P>(c) The obligation to represent the client with undivided fidelity and not to divulge secrets or confidences forbids also the subsequent acceptance of retainers or employment from others in matters adversely affecting any interest of the client with respect to which confidence has been reposed.</P>

                  <P>(a) A client's offer of the assistance of an additional practitioner should not be regarded as evidence of lack of confidence, but the matter should be left to the determination of the client. A practitioner shall decline association as colleague if it is objectionable to the practitioner first retained, but if the client should relieve the practitioner first retained, another may come into the case.</P>
                  <P>(b) When practitioners jointly associated in a case cannot agree as to any matter vital to the interest of the client the conflict of opinion should be frankly stated to the client for final determination. The client's decision should be accepted by them unless the nature of the difference makes it impracticable for the practitioner whose judgment has been overruled to cooperate effectively. In that event, it is the practitioner's duty to ask the client to relieve him of his obligation.</P>
                  <P>(c) It is the right of any practitioner to give proper advice to those seeking relief against an unfaithful or neglectful practitioner. The practitioner against whom the complaint is made should be notified of such action.</P>

                  <P>The right of a practitioner to withdraw from employment, once begun, arises only from good cause. The desire or consent of the client is not always sufficient cause for withdrawal. The practitioner shall not abandon the unfinished task to the detriment of the client except for reasons of honor, or the client's persistence over the practitioner's remonstrance in presenting <PRTPAGE P="99"/>frivolous defenses, or the client's deliberate disregard of an obligation as to fees or expenses. In these cases, the practitioner may be warranted in withdrawing after due notice to the client with time allowed for the employment of another practitioner. Other reasons for withdrawal might include instances in which a practitioner discovers that his client has no cause and the client is determined to continue the cause, or the practitioner's own inability to conduct a case effectively. Upon withdrawing from a case, the practitioner shall refund any part of a retainer which clearly has not been earned.</P>

The practitioner shall give a candid opinion of the merits and probable result of bringing the case or of any related pending or contemplated litigation. The practitioner shall beware of bold and confident assurances to clients, especially where employment may depend upon such assurances. Whenever a fair settlement can be reached, the client shall be advised to avoid or to end litigation.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Establishing fees.</E> In establishing fees, a practitioner shall avoid charges which overestimate the value of his advice and services. A client's ability to pay cannot justify a charge in excess of the value of the service although a client's poverty may require a lesser charge or even no charge at all. Publicly quoted fees should be adhered to when actual charges are made. Practitioners are bound to charge no more than the quoted rates for 30 days following the date of their quotations unless a different period of time for the effectiveness of such rates is clearly specified when quoted, or unless permission to charge a higher rate is obtained from the Vice Chairman of the Board.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Compensation, commission, and rebates.</E> A practitioner shall accept no compensation, commission, rebates, or other advantages from the parties in a proceeding other than his client without the knowledge and consent of his client after full disclosure.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Contingent fees.</E> Contingent fees should be only those sanctioned by law. In no case, except a charity case, should fees be entirely contingent upon success.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Division of fees.</E> Fees for services should be divided only with another member of the bar of practitioners and should be based upon a division of service or responsibility. It is unethical for a practitioner to retain laymen to solicit his employment in pending or prospective cases, and to reward them by a share of the fees. Such a practice cannot be too severely condemned.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Suing clients for fees.</E> Controversies with clients concerning compensation are to be entered into only insofar as they are compatible with self-respect and with the right to receive reasonable compensation for services. Lawsuits against clients should be resorted to only to prevent injustice, imposition or fraud.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Acquiring interest in litigation.</E> The practitioner shall not purchase or otherwise acquire any pecuniary interest in the subject matter of litigation which the practitioner is conducting.</P>
                  <P>(g) <E T="03">Expenses.</E> A practitioner may not properly agree with a client that the practitioner shall pay or bear the expenses of litigation. He may in good faith advance expenses as a matter of convenience but must do so subject to reimbursement by the client. A practitioner shall bill and collect from a client, and thereafter retain only such payments and reimbursements for expenses as have actually been incurred on behalf of the client.</P>
                  <P>(h) <E T="03">Witnesses' compensation.</E> Compensation of a witness is not to be made contingent on the success of a case in which the witness is called.</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Dealing with trust property.</E> Money of the client or other trust property coming into the possession of the practitioner should be reported promptly, and, except with the client's knowledge and consent, should not be commingled with the practitioner's private property or be put to the practitioner's private use.</P>

The client is entitled to the benefit of any and every remedy and defense authorized by law. The client may expect his counsel to assert every such remedy or defense.

                  <P>(a) The practitioner's duty to preserve his client's confidence outlasts the practitioner's employment by the client, and this duty extends to the practitioner's employees as well. Neither practitioner nor his employees shall accept employment which involves the disclosure or use of a client's confidences without knowledge and consent of the client even though there are other available sources of information. A practitioner shall not continue employment when he discovers that this obligation presents a conflict in his duty between the former and the new client.</P>
                  <P>(b) If a practitioner is falsely accused by his client, he is not precluded from disclosing the truth in respect to the false accusation. The announced intention of a client to commit a crime is not included in the confidence which a practitioner is bound to respect. The practitioner may properly make such disclosures to prevent the act or protect those against whom that is threatened.</P>

                  <P>(b) It is not candid or fair for a practitioner knowingly to misstate or misquote the contents of a paper, the testimony of a witness, the language or the argument of an opposing practitioner, or the language or effect of a decision or a text book; or, with knowledge of its invalidity to cite as authority a decision which has been overruled or otherwise impaired as a precedent or a statute which has been repealed; or in argument to assert as a fact that which has not been proved, or to mislead his opponent by concealing or withholding positions in his opening argument upon which his side then intends to rely.</P>
                  <P>(c) It is dishonorable to deal other than candidly with the facts in taking the statements of witnesses, in drawing affidavits and other documents, and in the presentation of cases.</P>
                  <P>(d) A practitioner shall not offer evidence which he knows the Board should reject, in order to get the same before the Board by argument for its admissibility, or arguments upon any point not properly calling for determination. He shall not introduce into an argument remarks or statements intended to influence the bystanders.</P>
                  <P>(e) A practitioner shall rely on his judgment concerning matters incidental to the trial which may, in some cases, affect the proceeding. For example, a practitioner should not force a matter to trial when there is affliction or bereavement on the part of the opposing practitioner if no harm will come from postponing the proceeding.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Negotiations with opposing party.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>A practitioner shall not in any way communicate upon the subject of controversy with a party represented by another practitioner except upon express agreement with the practitioner representing such party. He shall not negotiate or make compromises with the other party, but shall deal only with the opposing practitioner. The practitioner shall avoid everything that may tend to mislead a party not represented by a practitioner and should not advise that party as to the law.</P>

                  <SECTNO>§ 1103.29</SECTNO>
                  <SUBJECT>Public communication and solicitation.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) A practitioner shall not make any public communication or solicitation for employment containing a false, fraudulent, misleading, or deceptive statement or claim. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to:</P>
                  <P>(1) The use of statements containing a material misrepresentation of fact or omission of a material fact necessary to keep the statement from being misleading;</P>
                  <P>(2) Statements intended or likely to create an unjustifiable expectation; statements of fee information which are not complete and accurate;</P>
                  <P>(3) Statements containing information on past performance or prediction of future success;</P>
                  <P>(4) Statements of prior Board employment outside the context of biographical information; statements containing a testimonial about or endorsement of a practitioner;</P>
                  <P>(5) Statements containing an opinion as to the quality of a practitioner's services, or statements intended or likely to attract clients by the use of showmanship, puffery, or self-laudation, including the use of slogans, jingles, or sensational language or format.</P>

                  <P>(b) A practitioner shall not solicit a potential client who has given the practitioner adequate notice that he does not want to receive communications from the practitioner, nor shall a <PRTPAGE P="102"/>practitioner make a solicitation which involves the use of undue influence.</P>
                  <P>(c) A practitioner shall not solicit a potential client who is apparently in a physical or mental condition which would make it unlikely that he could exercise reasonable, considered judgment as to the selection of a practitioner.</P>
                  <P>(d) A practitioner shall not pay or otherwise assist any other person who is not also a practitioner and a member or associate of the same firm to solicit employment for the practitioner.</P>
                  <P>(e) If a public communication is to be made through use of radio or television, it must be prerecorded and approved for broadcast by the practitioner. A recording of the actual transmission must be retained by the practitioner for a period of 1 year after the date of the final transmission.</P>
                  <P>(f) A paid advertisement must be identified as such unless it is apparent from the context that it is a paid advertisement.</P>
                  <P>(g) A practitioner shall not compensate or give anything of value to a representative of any communication medium in anticipation of or in return for professional publicity in a news item.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Acceptance of employment.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) The practitioner must decline to conduct a case or to make a defense when convinced that it is intended merely to harass or to injure the opposing party, or to work oppression or wrong. Otherwise, it is the practitioner's right, and having accepted retainer, it becomes the practitioner's duty, to insist upon the judgment of the Board as to the merits of the client's claim. The practitioner's acceptance of a case is equivalent to the assertion that the client's case is proper for determination.</P>
                  <P>(b) No practitioner is obliged to act either as adviser or advocate for every potential client. The practitioner has the right to decline employment. Every practitioner shall decide what employment he will accept, what cases he will bring before the Board for complainants, or contest for defendants or respondents.</P>

                  <P>The practitioner bears the responsibility for advising as to questionable transactions, bringing questionable proceedings, or urging questionable defenses. Client's instructions cannot be used as an excuse for questionable practices.</P>

                  <P>(a) The practitioner, upon detecting fraud or deception practiced against the Board or a party in a case, shall make every effort to rectify the practice by advising his client to forgo any unjustly earned advantage. If such advice is refused, the practitioner should inform the injured party or that party's practitioner so that appropriate steps may be taken.</P>
                  <P>(b) Practitioners shall expose without fear or favor before the proper tribunals any corrupt or dishonest conduct and should accept without hesitation employment against a practitioner who has wronged his client. The practitioner upon the trial of a case in which perjury has been committed owes it to the Board and to the public to bring the matter to the knowledge of the prosecuting authorities.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Responsibility when proposing a person for admission to practice before the Board.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>The practitioner shall aid in guarding the bar of the Board against admission of candidates unfit or unqualified because deficient in either moral character or qualification. A practitioner shall propose no person for admission to practice before the Board unless from personal knowledge or after reasonable inquiry he sincerely believes and is able to vouch that such person possesses the qualifications prescribed in § 1103.3.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Intermediaries.</SUBJECT>

                  <P>(a) The services of a practitioner should not be controlled or exploited by any lay agency, personal or corporate, which intervenes between client and practitioner. The responsibility and qualifications of the practitioner are individual. The practitioner shall avoid all relations which direct <PRTPAGE P="103"/>the performance of his duties in the interest of such intermediaries. The practitioner's relationship and responsibility to the client should be direct.</P>
                  <P>(b) The practitioner may accept employment from any organization (such as an association, club or trade organization) authorized by law to be a party to proceedings before the Board, to render services in such proceedings in any matter in which the organization, as an entity, is interested. This employment should only include the rendering of such services to the members of the organization in respect to the individual affairs as are consistent with the free and faithful performance of his duties to the Board.</P>
                  <P>(c) Nothing in this canon shall be construed as conflicting with § 1103.20(d).</P>

                  <P>In the formation of a partnership or professional corporation among practitioners care should be taken to avoid any misleading name or representation which would create a false impression as to the position or privileges of a member not duly authorized to practice. No person should be held as a practitioner who is not duly qualified under § 1103.2 or § 1103.3 of these rules. No person who is not duly admitted to practice should be held out in a way which will give the impression that he is so admitted. No false or assumed or trade name should be used to disguise the practitioner or his partnership or professional corporation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Address, identification, and electronic filing option.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except as provided in § 1115.7, pleadings should be addressed to the “Chief, Section of Administration, Office of Proceedings, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423-0001,” and should designate the docket number and title of the proceeding, if known.</P>
              <P>(b) The address of the person filing the pleading should be included on the first page of the pleading.</P>
              <P>(c) All envelopes in which a pleading is being submitted should be marked in the lower left hand corner with the docket number, if known, (not the full title) and the pleading type.</P>
              <P>(d) All multi-volume pleadings must be sequentially numbered on the cover of each volume to indicate the volume number of the pleading and the total number of volumes filed (e.g., the first volume in a 4-volume set should be labeled “volume 1 of 4,” the second volume “volume 2 of 4” and so forth).</P>

              <P>(e) Unless otherwise directed by the Board, persons filing pleadings and documents with the Board have the option of electronically filing (e-filing) pleadings and documents instead of filing paper copies. Details regarding file size limitations, permissible formats, procedures to be followed, acceptable signature formats, and other pertinent information are available on the Board's website, <E T="03">www.stb.gov.</E> If the e-filing option is chosen, then the applicable requirements will be those specified on the Board's website, and any requirements of this part that specifically apply to filing of paper copies will not apply to the e-filed pleadings and documents (these requirements include, but are not limited to, stapling or binding <PRTPAGE P="104"/>specifications, signature “in ink,” etc.). Persons are not required to e-file and may continue to use the Board's processes for filing paper copies.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Document specifications.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Documents, except electronic filings, filed with the Board must be on white paper not larger than 8<FR>1/2</FR> by 11 inches, including any tables, charts, or other documents that may be included. Ink must be dark enough to provide substantial contrast for scanning and photographic reproduction. Text must be double-spaced (except for footnotes and long quotations, which may be single-spaced), using type not smaller than 12 point. Printing may appear only on one side of the paper for original documents, but copies of filings may be printed on both sides of the paper.</P>
              <P>(b) In order to facilitate automated processing in document sheet feeders, original documents of more than one page may not be bound in any permanent form (no metal, plastic, or adhesive staples or binders) but must be held together with removable metal clips or similar retainers. Original documents may not include divider tabs, but copies must if workpapers or expert witness testimony are submitted. All pages of original documents, and each side of pages that are printed on both sides, must be paginated continuously, including cover letters and attachments. Where, as a result of assembly processes, such pagination is impractical, documents may be numbered within the logical sequences of volumes or sections that make up the filing and need not be renumbered to maintain a single numbering sequence throughout the entire filing.</P>
              <P>(c) Some filings or portions of filings will not conform to the standard paper specifications set forth in paragraph (a) of this section and may not be scannable. For example, electronic spreadsheets are not susceptible to scanning, but oversized documents, such as oversized maps and blueprints, may or may not be scannable. Filings that are not scannable will be referenced on-line and made available to the public at the Board's offices. If parties file oversized paper documents, they are encouraged to file, in addition to the oversized documents, representations of them that fit on the standard paper, either through reductions in size that do not undermine legibility, or through division of the oversized whole into multiple sequential pages. The standard paper representations must be identified and placed immediately behind the oversized documents they represent.</P>
              <P>(d) Color printing may not be used for textual submissions. Use of color in filings is limited to images such as graphs, maps and photographs. To facilitate automated processing of color pages, color pages may not be inserted among pages containing text, but may be filed only as appendices or attachments to filings. Also, the original of any filing that includes color images must bear an obvious notation, on the cover sheet, that the filing contains color.</P>

              <P>(a) The executed original of a paper pleading or document permitted or required to be filed under this subchapter, including correspondence, must be furnished for the use of the Board. Textual submissions of 20 or more pages must be accompanied by an electronic version. Details regarding electronic submissions, including evidence, workpapers, and other pertinent information are available on the Board's website, <E T="03">www.stb.gov.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(b) The Board may, at its discretion, request paper copies of a pleading, document, or paper filed or e-filed with the Board. Any such copies must be clear and legible. Appropriate notes or other indications shall be used so that matters shown in color on the original, but in black and white on copies, will be accurately identified on all copies.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Signature of attorney or practitioner.</E> If a party is represented by a <PRTPAGE P="105"/>practitioner or an attorney, the original of each paper filed should be signed in ink by the practitioner or attorney, whose address should be stated.

              <P>(1) Has read the pleading, document or paper;</P>
              <P>(2) Is authorized to file it;</P>
              <P>(3) Believes that there is good ground for the document;</P>

              <P>(2) Accompanied by the signer's address; and</P>
              <P>(3) Verified, if it contains allegations of fact, under oath by the person, in whose behalf it is filed, or by a duly authorized officer of the corporation in whose behalf it is filed. If the pleading is a complaint, at least one complainant must sign and verify the pleading.</P>

              <P>(b) Whenever any rule of this Board requires or permits matter to be supported, evidenced, established, or proved by sworn declaration, verification, certificate, statement, oath, or affidavit, in writing of the person making the same (other than a deposition, oath of office, or an oath required to be taken before a special official other than a notary public), such matter may, with like force and effect, be supported, evidenced, established, or proven by the unsworn declaration, certificate, verification, or statement, in writing of such person which is subscribed by him, as true under penalty of perjury and dated, in the following form:

              <P>Documents must be received for filing at the Board's offices in Washington, DC within the time limits set for filing. The date of receipt at the Board, and not the date of deposit in the mail, determines the timeliness of filing. However, if a document is mailed by United States express mail, postmarked at least one day prior to the due date, it will be accepted as timely. Other express mail, received by the private express mail carrier at least one day prior to the due date, also will be accepted as timely filed. The term express mail means that the carrier or delivery service offers next day delivery to Washington, DC. If the e-filing option is chosen (for those pleadings and documents that are appropriate for e-filing, as determined by reference to the information on the Board's Web site), then the e-filed pleading or document is timely filed if the e-filing process is completed before 11:59 p.m. eastern time on the due date.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Computation.</E> In computing any period of time, the day of the act, event, or default upon which the designated period of time begins to run is not included. The last day of the period is included unless it is Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday in the District <PRTPAGE P="106"/>of Columbia, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or holiday. This rule applies to forward and backward measurement of time.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Extensions.</E> Any time period, except those provided by law or specified in these rules respecting informal complaints seeking damage may be extended by the Board in its discretion, upon request and for good cause. Requests for extensions must be served on all parties of record at the same time and by the same means as service is made on the Board, except if service is made on the Board in person and personal service on other parties is not feasible, service on other parties should be made by first class or express mail. A request for an extension must be filed not less than 10 days before the due date. Only the original of the request and certificate of service need be filed with the Board.

              <SUBJECT>Determinative criteria.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In determining whether a “major Federal action” (as that term is defined by the Council on Environmental Quality in 40 CFR 1508.18) has the potential to affect significantly the quality of the human environment, the Board is guided by the definition of “significantly” at 40 CFR 1508.27.</P>
              <P>(b) A finding that a service or transaction is not within the STB's jurisdiction does not require an environmental analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act or historic review under the National Historic Preservation Act.</P>
              <P>(c) The environmental laws are not triggered where the STB's action is nothing more than a ministerial act, as in:</P>
              <P>(1) The processing of abandonments proposed under the Northeast Rail Services Act (45 U.S.C. 744(b)(3));</P>

              <P>(2) Statutorily-authorized interim trail use arrangements under 16 U.S.C. 1247(d) [<E T="03">see,</E> 49 CFR 1152.29]; or</P>

              <P>(3) Financial assistance arrangements under 49 U.S.C. 10904 (<E T="03">see</E> 49 CFR 1152.27).</P>
              <FP>Finally, no environmental analysis is necessary for abandonments that are authorized by a bankruptcy court, or transfers of rail lines under plans of reorganization, where our function is merely advisory under 11 U.S.C. 1166, 1170, and 1172.</FP>

              <P>(ii) Transactions involving corporate changes (such as a change in the ownership or the operator, or the issuance of securities or reorganization) including grants of authority to hold position as an officer or director;</P>
              <P>(iii) Declaratory orders, interpretation or clarification of operating authority, substitution of an applicant, name changes, and waiver of lease and interchange regulations;</P>

              <P>(d) The Board may reclassify or modify these requirements for individual proceedings. For actions that generally require no environmental documentation, the Board may decide that a particular action has the potential for significant environmental impacts and that, therefore, the applicant should provide an environmental report and either an EA or an EIS will be prepared. For actions generally requiring an EA, the Board may prepare a full EIS where the probability of significant impacts from the particular proposal is high enough to warrant an EIS. Alternatively, in a rail construction, an applicant can seek to demonstrate (with supporting information addressing the pertinent aspects of § 1105.7(e)) that an EA, rather than an EIS, will be sufficient because the particular proposal is not likely to have a significant environmental impact. Any request for reclassification must be in writing and, in a rail construction, should be presented with the prefiling notice required by § 1105.10(a)(1) (or a request to waive that prefiling notice period).</P>
              <P>(e) The classifications in this section apply without regard to whether the action is proposed by application, petition, notice of exemption, or any other means that initiates a formal Board proceeding.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice and scope of EIS.</E> When an Environmental Impact Statement is prepared for a proposed action, the Board will publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a notice of its intent to prepare an EIS, with a description of the proposed action and a request for written comments on the scope of the EIS. Where appropriate, the scoping process may include a meeting open to interested parties and the public. After considering the comments, the Board will publish a notice of the final scope of the EIS. If the Environmental Impact Statement is to be prepared in cooperation with other agencies, this notice will also indicate which agencies will be responsible for the various parts of the Statement.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Notice of availability.</E> The Board will serve copies of both the draft Environmental Impact Statement (or an appropriate summary) and the full final Environmental Impact Statement (or an appropriate summary) on all parties to the proceeding and on appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies. A notice that these documents are available to the public will be published (normally by the Environmental Protection Agency) in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> (Interested persons may obtain copies of the documents by contacting OEA.)</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Comments.</E> The notice of availability of the draft Environmental Impact Statement will establish the time for submitting written comments, which will normally be 45 days following service of the document. When the Board decides to hold an oral hearing on the merits of a proposal, the draft Environmental Impact Statement will be made available to the public in advance, normally at least 15 days prior to the portion of the hearing relating to the environmental issues. The draft EIS will discuss relevant environmental and historic preservation issues. The final Environmental Impact Statement will discuss the comments received and any changes made in response to them.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Environmental Assessments.</E> In preparing an Environmental Assessment, OEA will verify and independently analyze the Environmental Report and/or Historic Report and related material submitted by an applicant pursuant to sections 1105.7 and 1105.8. The Environmental Assessment will discuss relevant environmental and historic preservation issues. OEA will serve copies of the Environmental Assessment on <PRTPAGE P="116"/>all parties to the proceeding and appropriate federal, state, and local agencies, and will announce its availability to the public through a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> In the case of abandonment applications processed under 49 U.S.C. 10903, the availability of the Environmental Assessment must be announced in the applicant's Notice of Intent filed under 49 CFR 1152.21. The deadline for submission of comments on the Environmental Assessment will generally be within 30 days of its service (15 days in the case of a notice of abandonment under 49 CFR 1152.50). The comments received will be addressed in the Board's decision. A supplemental Environmental Assessment may be issued where appropriate.</P>

              <P>(2) Requests for waiver of § 1105.10(a)(1) must describe as completely as possible the anticipated environmental effects of the proposed action, and the timing of the proposed action, and show that all or part of the six month lead period is not appropriate.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Third-Party Consultants.</E> Applicants may utilize independent third-party consultants to prepare any necessary environmental documentation, if approved by OEA. The environmental reporting requirements that would otherwise apply will be waived if a railroad hires a consultant, OEA approves the scope of the consultant's work, and the consultant works under OEA's supervision. In such a case, the consultant acts on behalf of the Board, working under OEA's direction to collect the needed environmental information and compile it into a draft EA or draft EIS, which is then submitted to OEA for its review, verification, and approval. We encourage the use of third-party consultants.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Service of Environmental Pleadings.</E> Agencies and interested parties sending material on environmental and historic preservation issues directly to the Board should send copies to the applicant. Copies of Board communications to third-parties involving environmental and historic preservation issues also will be sent to the applicant where appropriate.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Consideration in decisionmaking.</E> The environmental documentation (generally an EA or an EIS) and the comments and responses thereto concerning environmental, historic preservation, Coastal Zone Management Act, and endangered species issues will be part of the record considered by the Board in the proceeding involved. The Board will decide what, if any, environmental or historic preservation conditions to impose upon the authority it issues based on the environmental record and its substantive responsibilities under the Interstate Commerce Act. The Board will withhold a decision, stay the effective date of an exemption, or impose appropriate conditions upon any authority granted, when an environmental or historic preservation issue has not yet been resolved.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Finding of No Significant Impact.</E> In all exemption cases, if no environmental or historic preservation issues are raised by any party or identified by OEA in its independent investigation, the Board will issue a separate decision making a Finding of No Significant Impact (“FONSI”) to show that it has formally considered the environmental record.</P>

              <P>(b) The proposed SIP shall be made part of the environmental record in the Board proceeding and dealt with in the ongoing environmental review process under 49 CFR part 1105. The procedures governing the process shall be as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) In accordance with 49 CFR 244.17, FRA will provide its findings and conclusions on the adequacy of the proposed SIP (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> assess whether the proposed SIP establishes a process that provides a reasonable assurance of safety in executing the proposed transaction) to OEA at a date sufficiently in advance of the Board's issuance of its draft environmental documentation in the case to permit incorporation in the draft environmental document.</P>
              <P>(2) The draft environmental documentation shall incorporate the proposed SIP, any revisions or modifications to it based on further consultations with FRA, and FRA's written comments regarding the SIP. The public may review and comment on the draft environmental documentation within the time limits prescribed by OEA.</P>

              <P>(3) OEA will independently review each proposed SIP. In its final environmental documentation, OEA will address written comments on the proposed SIP received during the time established for submitting comments on the draft environmental documentation. The Board then will consider the full environmental record, including the information concerning the SIP, in arriving at its decision in the case.<PRTPAGE P="120"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) If the Board approves the transaction and adopts the SIP, it will require compliance with the SIP as a condition to its approval. Each applicant involved in the transaction then shall coordinate with FRA in implementing the approved SIP, including any amendments thereto. FRA has provided in its rules at 49 CFR 244.17(g) for submitting information to the Board during implementation of an approved transaction that will assist the Board in exercising its continuing jurisdiction over the transaction. FRA also has agreed to advise the Board when, in its view, the integration of the applicants' operations has been safely completed.</P>
              <P>(c) If a SIP is required in transactions that would not be subject to environmental review under the Board's environmental rules at 49 CFR part 1105, the Board will develop appropriate case-specific SIP procedures based on the facts and circumstances presented.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">The Board's intent.</E> The Board favors the resolution of disputes through the use of mediation and arbitration procedures, in lieu of formal Board proceedings, whenever possible. This section provides for the creation of a binding, voluntary arbitration program in which parties, including shippers and railroads, agree in advance to arbitrate certain types of disputes with a limit on potential liability of $25,000,000 in rate disputes, including any rate prescription, and $2,000,000 in other disputes unless the parties mutually agree to a lower award cap. The Board's arbitration program is open to all parties eligible to bring or defend disputes before the Board.</P>
              <P>(1) Except as discussed in paragraph (b) of this section, parties to arbitration may agree by mutual written consent to arbitrate additional matters and to a lower amount of potential liability than the monetary award cap identified in this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Nothing in these rules shall be construed in a manner to prevent parties from independently seeking or utilizing private arbitration services to resolve any disputes they may have.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Limitations to the Board's arbitration program.</E> These procedures shall not be available:</P>
              <P>(1) To resolve disputes involving labor protective conditions;</P>
              <P>(2) To obtain the grant, denial, stay or revocation of any license, authorization (e.g., construction, abandonment, purchase, trackage rights, merger, pooling), or exemption related to such matters;</P>
              <P>(3) To prescribe for the future any conduct, rules, or results of general, industry-wide applicability;</P>
              <P>(4) To resolve disputes that are solely between two or more rail carriers.</P>
              <P>Parties may only use these arbitration procedures to arbitrate matters within the statutory jurisdiction of the Board.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Opt-in procedures.</E> Any rail carrier, shipper, or other party eligible to bring or defend disputes before the Board may at any time voluntarily choose to opt into the Board's arbitration program. Opting in may be for a particular dispute or for all potential disputes before the Board unless and until the party exercises the opt-out procedures discussed in § 1108.3(b). To opt in parties may:</P>

              <P>(1) File a notice with the Board, under Docket No. EP 699, advising the Board of the party's intent to participate in the arbitration program. Such notice may be filed at any time and shall be effective upon receipt by the Board.<PRTPAGE P="122"/>

              <P>(i) Notices filed with the Board shall state which arbitration-program-eligible issue(s) the party is willing to submit to arbitration.</P>
              <P>(ii) Notices may, at the submitting party's discretion, provide for a lower monetary award cap than the monetary award caps provided in this part.</P>
              <P>(2) Participants to a proceeding, where one or both parties have not opted into the arbitration program, may by joint notice agree to submit an issue in dispute to the Board's arbitration program. The joint notice must clearly state the issue(s) which the parties are willing to submit to arbitration and the corresponding maximum monetary award cap if the parties desire to arbitrate for a lower amount than the monetary award cap that would otherwise be applicable.</P>
              <P>(3) Parties to a dispute may jointly notify the Board that they agree to submit an eligible matter in dispute to the Board's arbitration program, where no formal proceeding has begun before the Board. The joint notice must clearly state the issue(s) which the parties are willing to submit to arbitration and the corresponding maximum monetary award cap if the parties desire to arbitrate for a lower amount than the applicable monetary award cap.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Opt-out procedures.</E> Any party who has elected to participate in the arbitration program may file a notice at any time under Docket No. EP 699, informing the Board of the party's decision to opt out of the program or amend the scope of its participation. The notice shall take effect 90 days after filing and shall not itself excuse the filing party from arbitration proceedings that are ongoing, or permit it to withdraw its consent to participate in any arbitration-program-eligible dispute associated with their opt-in notice for any matter before the Board at any time prior to the end of the 90 day period before the opt-out notice takes effect</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Public notice of arbitration program participation.</E> The Board shall maintain a list of participants who have opted into the arbitration program on its Web site at <E T="03">www.stb.gov.</E> Those parties participating in arbitration only for a particular dispute will not be listed on the Board's Web site.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Use of arbitration.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Arbitration-program-eligible matters.</E> Matters eligible for arbitration under the Board's program are: rates; Demurrage; accessorial charges; misrouting or mishandling of rail cars; and disputes involving a carrier's published rules and practices as applied to particular rail transportation. Parties may agree in writing to arbitrate additional matters on a case-by-case basis as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Monetary award cap.</E> Arbitration claims will be subject to the arbitration program award cap of $25,000,000, including any rate prescription, per rate dispute and $2,000,000 per practice dispute unless:</P>
              <P>(1) The defending party's opt-in notice provides for a lower monetary cap or;</P>
              <P>(2) The parties agree to select a lower award cap that will govern their arbitration proceeding. The parties may change the award cap by incorporating an appropriate provision in their agreement to arbitrate.</P>
              <P>(3) Counterclaims will not offset against the monetary award cap of the initiating claim. A counterclaim is an independent claim and is subject to a monetary award cap of $25,000,000, including any rate prescription, per rate dispute and $2,000,000 per practice dispute, separate from the initiating claim, or to a lower cap agreed upon by the parties in accordance with § 1108.4(b)(2).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Assignment of arbitration-program-eligible matters.</E> The Board shall assign to arbitration all arbitration-program-eligible disputes where all parties to the proceeding are participants in the Board's arbitration program, or where one or more parties to the matter are participants in the Board's arbitration program, and all other parties to the proceeding request or consent to arbitration for a particular dispute.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Matters partially arbitration-program-eligible.</E> Where the issues in a proceeding before the Board relate in part <PRTPAGE P="123"/>to arbitration-program-eligible matters, only those parts of the dispute related to arbitration-program-eligible matters may be arbitrated pursuant to the arbitration program, unless the parties petition the Board in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section to include additional disputes.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Other matters.</E> Parties may petition the Board, on a case-by-case basis, to assign to arbitration disputes, or portions of disputes, not listed as arbitration-program-eligible matters. This may include counterclaims and affirmative defenses. Such disputes are subject to a monetary award cap of $2,000,000 or to a lower cap agreed upon by the parties in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The Board will not consider for arbitration types of disputes that are expressly prohibited in § 1108.2(b).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Arbitration clauses.</E> Nothing in the Board's regulations shall preempt the applicability of, or otherwise supersede, any new or existing arbitration clauses contained in agreements between shippers and carriers.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Rate disputes.</E> Arbitration of rate disputes will only be available to parties if the rail carrier has market dominance as determined by the Board under 49 U.S.C. 10707. In rate disputes, the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators, as applicable, shall consider the Board's methodologies for setting maximum lawful rates, giving due consideration to the need for differential pricing to permit a rail carrier to collect adequate revenues (as determined under 49 U.S.C. 10704(a)(2)).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Arbitration commencement procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Complaint.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, arbitration under these rules shall commence with a written complaint, which shall be filed and served in accordance with Board rules contained at part 1104 of this chapter. Each complaint must contain a statement that the complainant and the respondent are participants in the Board's arbitration program pursuant to § 1108.3(a), or that the complainant is willing to arbitrate voluntarily all or part of the dispute pursuant to the Board's arbitration procedures, and the relief requested.</P>
              <P>(1) If the complainant desires arbitration with a single arbitrator instead of a three-member arbitration panel, the complaint must make such a request in its complaint.</P>
              <P>(2) If the complainant is not a participant in the arbitration program, the complaint may specify the issues that the complainant is willing to arbitrate.</P>
              <P>(3) If the complainant desires to set a lower amount of potential liability than the monetary award cap that would otherwise apply, the complaint should specify what amount of potential liability the complainant is willing to incur.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Answer to the complaint.</E> Any respondent must, within 20 days of the date of the filing of a complaint, answer the complaint. The answer must state whether the respondent is a participant in the Board's arbitration program, or whether the respondent is willing to arbitrate the particular dispute.</P>
              <P>(1) If the complaint requests arbitration by a single arbitrator instead of by an arbitration panel, the answer must contain a statement consenting to arbitration by a single arbitrator or an express rejection of that request.</P>
              <P>(i) The respondent may also initiate a request to use a single arbitrator instead of an arbitration panel.</P>
              <P>(ii) Absent the parties agreeing to arbitration through a single arbitrator, the Board will assign the case to arbitration by a panel of three arbitrators as provided by § 1108.6(a) through (d). The party requesting the single arbitrator shall at that time provide written notice to the Board and the other parties if it continues to object to a three-member arbitration panel. Upon timely receipt of the notice, the Board shall the set the case for formal adjudication by the Board.</P>

              <P>(2) When the complaint limits the arbitrable issues, the answer must state whether the respondent agrees to those limitations or, if the respondent is already a participant in the Board's arbitration program, whether those limitations are consistent with the respondent's opt-in notice filed with the Board <PRTPAGE P="124"/>pursuant to § 1108.3(a)(1)(i). If the answer contains an agreement to arbitrate some but not all of the arbitration-program-eligible issues in the complaint, the complainant will have 10 days from the date of the answer to advise the respondent and the Board in writing whether the complainant is willing to arbitrate on that basis.</P>
              <P>(3) When the complaint proposes a lower amount of potential liability, the answer must state whether the respondent agrees to that amount in lieu of the otherwise applicable monetary award cap.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Counterclaims.</E> In answering a complaint, the respondent may file one or more counterclaims against the complainant if such claims arise out of the same set of circumstances or are substantially related, and are subject to the Board's jurisdiction as provided in § 1108.2(b). Counterclaims are subject to the assignment provisions contained in § 1108.4(c)-(e). Counterclaims are subject to the monetary award cap provisions contained in § 1108.4(b)(2)-(3).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Affirmative defenses.</E> An answer to an arbitration complaint shall contain specific admissions or denials of each factual allegation contained in the complaint, and any affirmative defenses that the respondent wishes to assert against the complainant.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Jointly-filed notice.</E> In lieu of a formal complaint proceeding, arbitration under these rules may commence with a jointly-filed notice by parties agreeing to submit an eligible matter in dispute to the Board's arbitration program under § 1108.3(a)(3). The notice must:</P>
              <P>(1) Contain a statement that all relevant parties are participants in the Board's arbitration program pursuant to § 1108.3(a), or that the relevant parties are willing to arbitrate voluntarily a matter pursuant to the Board's arbitration procedures, and the relief requested;</P>
              <P>(2) Indicate whether parties have agreed to a three-member arbitration panel or a single arbitrator;</P>
              <P>(3) Indicate if the parties have agreed to a lower amount of potential liability in lieu of the otherwise applicable monetary award cap.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Arbitration initiation.</E> When the parties have agreed upon whether to use a single arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators, the issues(s) to be arbitrated, and the monetary limit to any arbitral decision, the Board shall initiate the arbitration under § 1108.7(a) and provide a list of arbitrators as described in § 1108.6.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Arbitration agreement.</E> Shortly after the panel of arbitrators or arbitrator is selected, the parties to arbitration together with the lead or single arbitrator, as applicable, shall create a written arbitration agreement, which at a minimum will state with specificity the issues to be arbitrated and the corresponding monetary award cap to which the parties have agreed. The agreement may also contain other mutually agreed upon provisions.</P>
              <P>(1) Any additional issues selected for arbitration by the parties, that are not outside the scope of these arbitration rules as explained in § 1108.2(b), must be subject to the Board's statutory authority.</P>
              <P>(2) These rules shall be incorporated by reference into any arbitration agreement conducted pursuant to an arbitration complaint filed with the Board.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Panel of arbitrators.</E> Unless otherwise requested in writing pursuant to § 1108.5(a)(1) and agreed to by all parties to the arbitration, all matters arbitrated under these rules shall be resolved by a panel of three arbitrators.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Roster.</E> Arbitration shall be conducted by an arbitrator (or panel of arbitrators) selected, as provided herein, from a roster of persons with rail transportation, economic regulation, professional or business experience, including agriculture, in the private sector. Persons seeking to be included on the roster must have training in dispute resolution and/or experience in arbitration or other forms of dispute resolution. The Board will establish the initial roster of arbitrators by no-objection vote. The Board may modify the roster at any time by no-objection vote to include other eligible arbitrators or remove arbitrators who are no longer available. The Board's roster will provide a brief biographical sketch <PRTPAGE P="125"/>of each arbitrator, including information such as background, area(s) of expertise, arbitration experience, and geographical location, as well as general contact information and fees, based on the information supplied by the arbitrator. The roster shall be published on the Board's Web site. The Board will update the roster every year. The Board will seek public comment on any modifications that should be made to the roster, including requesting the names and qualifications of new arbitrators who wish to be placed on the roster, and updates from arbitrators appearing on the roster to confirm that the biographical information on file with the Board remains accurate. Arbitrators who wish to remain on the roster must notify the Board of their continued availability.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Selecting the lead arbitrator.</E> If the parties cannot mutually agree on a lead arbitrator for a panel of arbitrators, the parties shall use the following process to select a lead arbitrator: First, each party will be given three peremptory strikes to remove names from the Board's roster. Then, from the remaining names on the roster, each party will submit a list of up to 10 potential arbitrators. If only one arbitrator appears on both lists, he or she would be selected as the single or lead arbitrator. If multiple arbitrators appear on both lists, the parties would alternatively strike names of the jointly listed arbitrators until one remains, beginning with complainant. If no name appears on both lists, the parties would alternatively strike from the Board's entire roster, as amended based on the peremptory strikes. A lead arbitrator shall be selected within 14 days of the Board initiating the arbitration process.</P>
              <P>(1) The parties are responsible for conducting their own due diligence in striking names from the arbitrator list. The final selection of a lead arbitrator is not challengeable before the Board.</P>
              <P>(2) The lead arbitrator appointed through the strike methodology shall serve as the head of the arbitration panel and will be responsible for ensuring that the tasks detailed in §§ 1108.7 and 1108.9 are accomplished.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Party-appointed arbitrators.</E> The party or parties on each side of an arbitration dispute shall select one arbitrator from the roster, regardless of whether the other party struck the arbitrator's name in selecting a lead arbitrator. The party or parties on each side will appoint that side's own arbitrator within 14 days of the Board initiating the arbitration process. Parties on one side of an arbitration proceeding may not challenge the arbitrator selected by the opposing side.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Use of a single arbitrator.</E> Parties to arbitration may request the use of a single arbitrator. Requests for use of a single arbitrator must be included in a complaint or an answer as required in § 1108.5(a)(1), or in the joint notice filed under § 1108.5(e). Parties to both sides of an arbitration dispute must agree to the use of a single arbitrator in writing. If the single-arbitrator option is selected, and if parties cannot mutually agree on a single arbitrator, the arbitrator selection procedures outlined in paragraph (c) of this section shall apply.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Arbitrator incapacitation.</E> If at any time during the arbitration process a selected arbitrator becomes incapacitated or is unwilling or unable to fulfill his or her duties, a replacement arbitrator shall be promptly selected by either of the following processes:</P>
              <P>(1) If the incapacitated arbitrator was appointed directly by a party to the arbitration, the appointing party shall, without delay, appoint a replacement arbitrator pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 1108.6(d).</P>
              <P>(2) If the incapacitated arbitrator was the lead or single arbitrator, the parties shall promptly inform the Board of the arbitrator's incapacitation and the selection procedures set forth in paragraph (c) of this section shall apply.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Decision requirements.</E> Whether by a panel of arbitrators or a single arbitrator, all arbitration decisions shall be in writing and shall contain findings of fact and conclusions of law. All arbitration decisions must be consistent with sound principles of rail regulation economics. The arbitrator shall provide an unredacted draft of the arbitration decision to the parties to the dispute, in accordance with any protective order governing the release of confidential and highly confidential information pursuant to § 1108.7(e).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Redacting arbitration decision.</E> The lead or single arbitrator shall also provide the parties with a draft of the decision that redacts or omits all proprietary business information and confidential information pursuant to any such requests of the parties under the arbitration agreement.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Party input.</E> The parties may then suggest what, if any, additional redactions they think are required to protect against the disclosure of proprietary and confidential information in the decision.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Lead or single arbitrator authority.</E> The lead or single arbitrator shall retain the final authority to determine what, if any, additional redactions are appropriate to make.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Service of arbitration decision.</E> The lead or single arbitrator shall serve copies of the unredacted decision upon the parties in accordance with the timetable and requirements set forth in § 1108.7(c). The lead or single arbitrator shall also serve copies of the redacted decision upon the parties and the Board in accordance with the timetable and requirements set forth in § 1108.7(c). The arbitrator may serve the decision via any service method permitted by the Board's regulations.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Service in the case of an appeal.</E> In the event an arbitration decision is appealed to the Board, the lead or single arbitrator shall, without delay and under seal, serve upon the Board an unredacted copy of the arbitration decision.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Publication of decision.</E> Redacted copies of the arbitration decisions shall be published and maintained on the Board's Web site.<PRTPAGE P="127"/>
              </P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Arbitration decisions are binding.</E> By arbitrating pursuant to these procedures, each party agrees that the decision and award of the arbitrator(s) shall be binding and judicially enforceable in any court of appropriate jurisdiction, subject to the rights of appeal provided in § 1108.11.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Precedent.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Decisions rendered by arbitrators pursuant to these rules may be guided by, but need not be bound by, agency precedent. Arbitration decisions shall have no precedential value and may not be relied upon in any manner during subsequent arbitration proceedings conducted under the rules in this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Enforcement and appeals.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Petitions to modify or vacate.</E> A party may petition the Board to modify or vacate an arbitral award. The appeal must be filed within 20 days of service upon the Board of a final arbitration decision, and is subject to the page limitations of § 1115.2(d) of this chapter. Copies of the appeal shall be served upon all parties in accordance with the Board's rules at part 1104 of this chapter. The appealing party shall also serve a copy of its appeal upon the arbitrator(s). Replies to such appeals shall be filed within 20 days of the filing of the appeal with the Board, and shall be subject to the page limitations of § 1115.2(d) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Board's standard of review.</E> On appeal, the Board's standard of review of arbitration decisions will be narrow. The Board will review a decision to determine if the decision is consistent with sound principles of rail regulation economics, a clear abuse of arbitral authority or discretion occurred; the decision directly contravenes statutory authority; or the award limitation was violated. Using this standard, the Board may modify or vacate an arbitration award in whole or in part.</P>
              <P>(1) Board decisions vacating or modifying arbitration decisions under the Board's standard of review are reviewable under the Hobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. 2321 and 2342.</P>
              <P>(2) Nothing in these rules shall prevent parties to arbitration from seeking judicial review of arbitration awards in a court of appropriate jurisdiction pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 9-13, in lieu of seeking Board review.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Staying arbitration decision.</E> The timely filing of a petition for review of the arbitral decision by the Board will not automatically stay the effect of the arbitration decision. A stay may be requested under § 1115.3(f) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Enforcement.</E> Parties seeking to enforce an arbitration decision made pursuant to the Board's arbitration program must petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 9-13.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Costs.</E> The parties shall share the costs incurred by the Board and arbitrators equally, with each party responsible for paying its own legal and other associated arbitration costs.</P>

              <P>The Board favors the resolution of disputes through the use of mediation and arbitration procedures, in lieu of formal Board proceedings, whenever possible. Parties may seek to resolve a dispute brought before the Board using the Board's mediation procedures. These procedures shall not be available in a regulatory proceeding to obtain the grant, denial, stay or revocation of a request for construction, abandonment, purchase, trackage rights, merger, pooling authority or exemption related to such matters. The Board may, by its own order, direct the parties to participate in mediation using the Board's mediation procedures. The Board's mediation program is open to all parties eligible to bring or defend matters before the Board.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Commencement of mediation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Availability of mediation.</E> Mediation may be commenced in a dispute before the Board:</P>
              <P>(1) Pursuant to a Board order issued in response to a written request of one or more parties to a matter;</P>
              <P>(2) Where the Board orders mediation by its own order; or</P>
              <P>(3) In connection with a rate complaint, as provided by § 1109.4 and part 1111 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Requests for mediation.</E> Parties wishing to pursue mediation may file a request for mediation with the Board at any time following the filing of a complaint. Parties that use the Board's mediation procedures shall not be required to pay any fees other than the appropriate filing fee associated with the underlying dispute, as provided at 49 CFR 1002.2. The Board shall grant any mediation request submitted by all parties to a matter, but may deny mediation where one or more parties to the underlying dispute do not consent to mediation, or where the parties seek to mediate disputes not eligible for Board-sponsored mediation, as listed in § 1109.1.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1109.3</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Mediation procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Mediation model.</E> The Chairman will appoint one or more Board employees trained in mediation to mediate any dispute assigned for mediation. Alternatively, the parties to a matter may agree to use a non-Board mediator if they so inform the Board within 10 days of an order assigning the dispute to mediation. If a non-Board mediator is used, the parties shall share equally the fees and/or costs of the mediator. The following restrictions apply to any mediator selected by the Board or the parties:</P>
              <P>(1) No person serving as a mediator may thereafter serve as an advocate for a party in any other proceeding arising from or related to the mediated dispute, including, without limitation, representation of a party to the mediation before any other federal court or agency; and</P>
              <P>(2) If the mediation does not fully resolve all issues in the docket before the Board, the Board employees serving as mediators may not thereafter advise the Board regarding the future disposition of the remaining issues in the docket.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Mediation period.</E> The mediation period shall be 30 days, beginning on the date of the first mediation session. The Board may extend mediation for additional periods of time not to exceed 30 days per period, pursuant to mutual written requests of all parties to the mediation proceeding. The Board will not extend mediation for additional periods of time where one or more parties to mediation do not agree to an extension. The Board will not order mediation more than once in any particular proceeding, but may permit it if all parties to a matter mutually request another round of mediation. The mediator(s) shall notify the Board whether the parties have reached any agreement by the end of the 30-day period.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Party representatives.</E> At least one principal of each party, who has the authority to bind that party, shall participate in the mediation and be <PRTPAGE P="129"/>present at any session at which the mediator(s) request that principal to be present.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Confidentiality.</E> Mediation is a confidential process, governed by the confidentiality rules of the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996 (ADRA) (5 U.S.C. 574). In addition to the confidentiality rules set forth in the ADRA, the Board requires the following additional confidentiality protections:</P>
              <P>(1) All parties to Board sponsored mediation will sign an Agreement to Mediate. The Agreement to Mediate shall incorporate these rules by reference.</P>
              <P>(2) As a condition of participation, the parties and any interested parties joining the mediation must agree to the confidentiality of the mediation process as provided in this section and further detailed in an agreement to mediate. The parties to mediation, including the mediator(s), shall not testify in administrative or judicial proceedings concerning the issues discussed in mediation, nor submit any report or record of the mediation discussions, other than the settlement agreement with the consent of all parties, except as required by law.</P>
              <P>(3) Evidence of conduct or statements made during mediation is not admissible in any Board proceeding. If mediation fails to result in a full resolution of the dispute, evidence that is otherwise discoverable may not be excluded from introduction into the record of the underlying proceeding merely because it was presented during mediation. Such materials may be used if they are disclosed through formal discovery procedures established by the Board or other adjudicatory bodies.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Abeyance.</E> Except as otherwise provided for in § 1109.4(f) and part 1111 of this chapter, any party may request that a proceeding be held in abeyance while mediation procedures are pursued. Any such request should be submitted to the Chief, Section of Administration, Office of Proceedings. The Board shall promptly issue an order in response to such requests. Except as otherwise provided for in § 1109.4(g) and part 1111 of this chapter, the Board may also direct that a proceeding be held in abeyance pending the conclusion of mediation. Where both parties to mediation voluntarily consent to mediation, the period during which any proceeding is held in abeyance shall toll applicable statutory deadlines. Where one or both parties to mediation do not voluntarily consent to mediation, the Board will not hold the underlying proceeding in abeyance and statutory deadlines will not be tolled.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Mediated settlements.</E> Any settlement agreement reached during or as a result of mediation must be in writing, and signed by all parties to the mediation. The parties need not provide a copy of the settlement agreement to the Board, or otherwise make the terms of the agreement public, but the parties, or the mediator(s), shall notify the Board that the parties have reached a mutually agreeable resolution and request that the Board terminate the underlying Board proceeding. Parties to the settlement agreement shall waive all rights of administrative appeal to the issues resolved by the settlement agreement.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Partial resolution of mediated issues.</E> If the parties reach only a partial resolution of their dispute, they or the mediator(s) shall so inform the Board, and the parties shall file any stipulations they have mutually reached, and ask the Board to reactivate the procedural schedule in the underlying proceeding to decide the remaining issues.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Mandatory use of mediation.</E> A shipper seeking rate relief from a railroad or railroads in a case involving the stand-alone cost methodology must engage in non-binding mediation of its dispute with the railroad upon submitting a pre-filing notice under 49 CFR part 1111.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Assignment of mediators.</E> Within 5 business days after the shipper submits its pre-filing notice, the Board will assign one or more mediators to the case. Within 5 business days of the assignment to mediate, the mediator(s) shall contact the parties to discuss ground rules and the time and location of any meeting.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Party representatives.</E> At least one principal of each party, who has the <PRTPAGE P="130"/>authority to bind that party, shall participate in the mediation and be present at any session at which the mediator(s) requests that the principal be present.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Settlement.</E> The mediator(s) will work with the parties to try to reach a settlement of all or some of their dispute or to narrow the issues in dispute, and reach stipulations that may be incorporated into any adjudication before the Board if mediation does not fully resolve the dispute. If the parties reach a settlement, the mediator(s) may assist in preparing a written settlement agreement.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Confidentiality.</E> The entire mediation process shall be private and confidential. No party may use any concessions made or information disclosed to either the mediator(s) or the opposing party before the Board or in any other forum without the consent of the other party. The confidentiality provision of § 1109.3(d) and the mediation agreement shall apply to all mediations conducted under this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Mediation period.</E> The mediation shall be completed within 60 days of the appointment of the mediator(s). The mediation may be terminated prior to the end of the 60-day period only with the certification of the mediator(s) to the Board. Requests to extend mediation, or to re-engage it later, will be entertained on a case-by-case basis, but only if filed by all interested parties.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Procedural schedule.</E> Absent a specific order from the Board granting an extension, the mediation will not affect the procedural schedule in stand-alone cost rate cases set forth at 49 CFR 1111.9(a).</P>

              <P>(b) In addition to the mediation procedures under this part that are available following the filing of a complaint in a proceeding before the Board, the Northeast Corridor Commission established under 49 U.S.C. 24905, Amtrak, or public authorities providing commuter rail passenger transportation on the Northeast Corridor may request that the Board informally assist in securing outside professional mediation services in order to resolve disputes involving implementation of, or compliance with, the policy developed under 49 U.S.C. 24905(c)(1). With respect to a particular dispute, such a request for informal assistance in securing outside professional mediation services may be submitted to the Board:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Content of formal complaints; joinder.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A formal complaint must contain the correct, unabbreviated names and addresses of each complainant and defendant. It should set forth briefly and in plain language the facts upon which it is based. It should include specific reference to pertinent statutory provisions and Board regulations, and should advise the Board and the defendant fully in what respects these provisions or regulations have been violated. The complaint should contain a detailed statement of the relief requested. Relief in the alternative or of several different types may be demanded, but the issues raised in the formal complaint should not be broader than those to which complainant's evidence is to be directed. In a complaint challenging the reasonableness of a rail rate, the complainant should indicate whether, in its view, the reasonableness of the rate should be examined using constrained market pricing or using the simplified standards adopted pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 10701(d)(3). If the complainant seeks to use the simplified standards, it should support this request by submitting, at a minimum, the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) The carrier or region identifier.</P>
              <P>(2) The type of shipment (local, received-terminated, etc.).</P>
              <P>(3) The one-way distance of the shipment.</P>
              <P>(4) The type of car (by URCS code).</P>
              <P>(5) The number of cars.</P>
              <P>(6) The car ownership (private or railroad).</P>
              <P>(7) The commodity type (STCC code).</P>
              <P>(8) The weight of the shipment (in tons per car).</P>
              <P>(9) The type of movement (individual, multi-car, or unit train).</P>
              <P>(10) A narrative addressing whether there is any feasible transportation alternative for the challenged movements.</P>
              <P>(11) For matters for which voluntary, binding arbitration is available pursuant to 49 CFR part 1108, the complaint shall state that arbitration was considered, but rejected, as a means of resolving the dispute.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Disclosure with simplified standards complaint.</E> The complainant must provide to the defendant all documents relied upon in formulating its assessment of a feasible transportation alternative and all documents relied upon to determine the inputs to the URCS Phase III program.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Multiple causes of action.</E> Two or more grounds of complaint concerning <PRTPAGE P="134"/>the same principle, subject, or statement of facts may be included in one complaint, but should be stated and numbered separately.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Joinder.</E> Two or more complainants may join in one complaint against one or more defendants if their respective causes of action concern substantially the same alleged violations and like facts.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Request for access to waybill data.</E> Parties needing access to the Waybill Sample to prepare their case should follow the procedures set forth at 49 CFR 1244.9.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Discovery in stand-alone cost cases.</E> Upon filing its complaint, the complainant shall certify that it has served its initial discovery requests on the defendant.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Amended and supplemental complaints.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Generally.</E> An amended or supplemental complaint may be tendered for filing by a complainant against a defendant or defendants named in the original complaint, stating a cause of action alleged to have accrued within the statutory period immediately preceding the date of such tender, in favor of complainant and against the defendant or defendants. The time limits for responding to an amended or supplemental complaint are computed pursuant to §§ 1111.5 and 1111.6, as if the amended or supplemental complaint was an original complaint.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Stand-alone cost.</E> If a complainant tenders an amended or supplemental complaint in a stand-alone cost case, the complainant shall certify that it has served on the defendant those initial discovery requests affected by the amended or supplemental complaint, if any.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Simplified standards.</E> A complaint filed under the simplified standards may be amended once before the filing of opening evidence to opt for a different rate reasonableness methodology, among Three-Benchmark, Simplified-SAC, or Full-SAC. If so amended, the procedural schedule begins again under the new methodology as set forth at §§ 1111.9 and 1111.10. However, only one mediation period per complaint shall be required.</P>

              <P>A complainant is responsible for serving formal complaints, amended or supplemental complaints, and cross complaints on the defendant(s). Service shall be made by sending a copy of such complaint to the chief legal officer of each defendant by either confirmed facsimile and first-class mail or express overnight courier. The cover page of each such facsimile and the front of each such first-class mail or overnight express courier envelope shall include the following legend: “Service of STB Complaint”. Service of the complaint shall be deemed completed on the date on which the complaint is served by confirmed facsimile or, if service is made by express overnight courier, on the date such complaint is actually received by the defendant. When the complaint involves more than one defendant, service of the complaint shall be deemed completed on the date on which all defendants have been served. The complaint should be filed with the Board together with an acknowledgment of service by the persons served or proof of service in the form of a statement of the date and manner of service, of the names of the persons served, and of the addresses to which the papers were mailed or at which they were delivered, certified by the person who made service.</P>

An answer should be responsive to the complaint and should fully advise the Board and the parties of the nature of the defense. In answering a complaint challenging the reasonableness of a rail rate, the defendant should indicate whether it will contend that the Board is deprived of jurisdiction to hear the complaint because the revenue-variable cost percentage generated by the traffic is less than 180 percent, or the traffic is subject to effective product or geographic competition. In response to a complaint filed under the simplified standards, the answer must include the defendant's preliminary estimate of the <PRTPAGE P="135"/>variable cost of each challenged movement calculated using the unadjusted figures produced by the URCS Phase III program.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Disclosure with simplified standards answer.</E> The defendant must provide to the complainant all documents that it relied upon to determine the inputs used in the URCS Phase III program.</P>

The defendant must serve copies of the answer upon the complainant and any other defendants.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Cross complaints.</E> A cross complaint alleging violations by other parties to the proceeding or seeking relief against them may be filed with the answer. An answer to a cross complaint shall be filed within 20 days after the service date of the cross complaint. The party shall serve copies of an answer to a cross complaint upon the other parties.</P>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Discovery in stand-alone cost cases.</E> Upon filing its answer, the defendant shall certify that it has served its initial discovery requests on the complainant. If the complainant tenders an amended or supplemental complaint to which the defendant must reply, upon filing the answer to the amended or supplemental complaint, the defendant shall certify that it has served on the complainant those initial discovery requests affected by the amended or supplemental complaint, if any.</P>

              <SUBJECT>When modified procedure is used.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The Board may decide that a proceeding be heard under modified procedure when it appears that substantially all material issues of fact can be resolved through submission of written statements, and efficient disposition of the proceeding can be accomplished without oral testimony. Modified procedure may be ordered on the Board's initiative, or upon approval of a request by any party.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Decisions directing modified procedure.</SUBJECT>

              <P>A decision directing that modified procedure be used will set out the schedule for filing verified statements by all parties and will list the names and addresses of all persons who at that time are on the service list in the proceeding. In this part, a statement responding to an opening statement is referred to as a “reply”, and a statement responding to a reply is referred to as a “rebuttal”. Replies to rebuttal material are not permitted. The filing of motions or other pleadings will not automatically stay or delay the established procedural schedule. Parties will <PRTPAGE P="138"/>adhere to this schedule unless the Board issues an order modifying the schedule.</P>

              <P>If a party fails to comply with the schedule for submission of verified statements, or any other requirements established by the modified procedure decision, that party will be deemed to be in default and to have waived any further participation in the proceeding. Thereafter, the proceeding may be disposed of without notice to and without participation by parties in default.</P>

              <P>(2) A request for a subpoena to compel a witness to produce documentary evidence should be made in writing by petition. The petition should specify with particularity the books, papers, or documents desired and facts expected to be proved, and should show the general relevance and reasonable scope of the evidence sought. The officer presiding at a hearing may grant a request for such a subpoena made orally upon the record.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Service.</E> The original subpoena should be exhibited to the person served, should be read to him if he is unable to read, and a copy should be delivered to him by the officer or person making service.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Return.</E> If service of subpoena is made by a United States marshal or his deputy, service should be evidenced by his return of the subpoena. If made by any other person, such person shall make an affidavit stating the date, time and manner of service; and return such affidavit on, or with, the original subpoena in accordance with the form thereon. In case of failure to make service the reasons for the failure <PRTPAGE P="140"/>should be stated on the original subpoena. The written acceptance of service of a subpoena by the person subpoenaed will be sufficient without other evidence of return. The original subpoena bearing or accompanied by the required return, affidavit, statement, or acceptance of service, should be returned forthwith to the Chief, Section of Administration, Office of Proceedings, unless otherwise directed.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Witness fees.</E> A witness who is summoned and responds to the summons is entitled to the same fee as is paid for like service in the courts of the United States. Such fee is to be paid by the party at whose insistence the testimony is taken at the time the subpoena is served, except that when the subpoena is issued on behalf of the United States or an officer or agency thereof, fees and mileage need not be tendered at the time of service.</P>

Thereafter the terms of the written stipulation or statement of the officer, as the case may be, will determine the subsequent course of the proceedings, unless modified to prevent manifest injustice.</P>

If the proceeding is by formal complaint and affirmative relief is sought by petitioner, the petition should conform to the requirements for a formal complaint.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">When filed.</E> A petition for leave to intervene in any proceeding should be filed prior to or at the time the proceeding is called for hearing, but not after, except for good cause shown.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Broadening issues; filing.</E> If the petition seeks a broadening of the issues and shows that they would not thereby be unduly broadened, and in respect thereof seeks affirmative relief, the petition should be filed in time to permit service upon and answer by the parties in advance of the hearing.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Copies; service; replies.</E> When a petition for leave to intervene is tendered at the hearing, sufficient copies of the petition must be provided for distribution to the parties represented at the hearing. When a petition for leave to intervene is not tendered at the hearing, the petition should be submitted to the Board together with a certificate that service has been made by petitioner. Any reply in opposition to a petition for leave to intervene not tendered at the hearing must be filed within 20 days after service of the petition to intervene. At the discretion of the Board, leave to intervene may be granted or denied before the expiration of the time allowed for replies.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Disposition.</E> Leave to intervene will be granted only when the petitioner addresses issues reasonably pertinent to the issues already presented and which do not unduly broaden them.

              <P>Matters of fact that are verified and filed prior to oral hearing and that are not specifically denied constitute evidence and are part of the record. A witness, who would present such evidence, must be made available for cross-examination if a request is reasonably made. This rule does not apply to protests against tariffs or schedules.</P>

                <P>Any evidence which is sufficiently reliable and probative to support a decision under the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, or which would be admissible under the general statutes of the United States, or under the rules of evidence governing proceedings in matters not involving trial by jury in the courts of the United States, will be admissible in hearings before the Board. The rules of evidence will be applied in any proceeding to the end that necessary and proper evidence will be conveniently, inexpensively, and speedily produced, while preserving the substantial rights of the parties.</P>

                <P>An official record or an entry therein, when admissible for any purpose, may be evidenced by an official publication thereof or by a copy attested by the officer having the legal custody of the record, or by a deputy, and accompanied with a certificate that such officer has the custody. If the office in which the record is kept is within the United States or within a territory or insular possession subject to the dominion of the United States, the certificate may be made by a judge of a court of record of the district or political subdivision in which the record is kept, authenticated by the seal of the court, or may be made by any public officer having a seal of office and having official duties in the district or political subdivision in which the record is kept, authenticated by the seal of his office. If the office in which the record is kept is in a foreign state or country, the certificate may be made by a secretary of embassy or legation, consul general, consul, vice consul, or consular agent or by officer in the foreign service of the United States stationed in the foreign state or country in which the record is kept, and authenticated by the seal of his office. A written statement signed by an officer having the custody of an official record <PRTPAGE P="146"/>or by his deputy that after diligent search no record or entry of a specified tenor is found to exist in the records of his office, accompanied by a certificate as above provided, is admissible as evidence that the records of this office contain no such record or entry. This section does not prevent the proof of official records or of entry or lack of entry therein or official notice thereof by a method authorized by any applicable statute or by the rules of evidence.</P>

                <P>Whenever practical the sheets of each exhibit and the lines of each sheet should be numbered. If the exhibit consists of five or more sheets, the first sheet or title-page should be confined to a brief statement of what the exhibit purports to show with reference by sheet and line to illustrative or typical examples contained therein. The exhibit should bear an identifying number, letter, or short title which will readily distinguish it from other exhibits offered by the same party. It is desirable that, whenever practicable, evidence should be condensed into tables. Whenever practicable, especially in proceedings in which it is likely that many documents will be offered, all the documents produced by a single witness should be assembled and bound together, suitably arranged and indexed, so that they may be identified and offered as one exhibit. Exhibits should not be argumentative and should be limited to statements of facts, and be relevant and material to the issue, which can better be shown in that form than by oral testimony.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">When discovery is available.</E> (1) Parties may obtain discovery under this subpart regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in a proceeding other than an informal proceeding. For the purpose of this subchapter, informal proceedings are those not required to be determined on the record after hearing and include informal complaints and all proceedings <PRTPAGE P="147"/>assigned for initial disposition to employee boards under § 1011.5.</P>
                <P>(2) It is not grounds for objection that the information sought will be inadmissible as evidence if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.</P>
                <P>(3) In cases using the simplified standards Three-Benchmark method, the number of discovery requests that either party can submit is limited as set forth in §§ 1114.22, 1114.26, and 1114.30, absent advance authorization from the Board.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">How discovery is obtained.</E> All discovery procedures may be used by parties without filing a petition and obtaining prior Board approval.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Protective conditions.</E> Upon motion by any party, by the person from whom discovery is sought, or by any person with a reasonable interest in the data, information, or material sought to be discovered and for good cause shown, any order which justice requires may be entered to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, or to prevent the raising of issues untimely or inappropriate to the proceeding. Relief through a protective order may include one or more of the following:</P>
                <P>(1) That the discovery not be had;</P>
                <P>(2) That the discovery may be had only on specified terms and conditions, including a designation of the time and place;</P>
                <P>(3) That the discovery may be had only upon such terms and conditions as the Board may impose to insure financial responsibility indemnifying the party or person against whom discovery is sought to cover the reasonable expenses incurred;</P>
                <P>(4) That the discovery may be had only by a method other than that selected by the party seeking discovery;</P>
                <P>(5) That certain matters not be inquired into or that the scope of discovery be limited to certain matters;</P>
                <P>(6) That discovery be conducted with no one present except persons designated in the protective order;</P>
                <P>(7) That a deposition after being sealed be opened only by order of the Board;</P>
                <P>(8) That a trade secret or other confidential research development or commercial information not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a designated way; and</P>
                <P>(9) That the parties simultaneously file specified documents or information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened only upon direction or order of the Board.</P>
                <FP>If the motion for a protective order is denied in whole or in part, the Board may, on such terms and conditions as it deems just, enter an order requiring any party or person to provide or permit discovery. A protective order under this paragraph may only be sought after, or in conjunction with, an effort by any party to obtain relief under § 1114.24(a), § 1114.26(a), or § 1114.31.</FP>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Sequence and timing of discovery.</E> Unless the Board upon motion, and subject to the requirements at 49 CFR 1111.2(f) and 1111.5(f) in stand-alone cost cases, for the convenience of parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice, orders otherwise, methods of discovery may be used in any sequence and the fact that a party is conducting discovery, whether by deposition or otherwise, should not operate to delay any party's discovery.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Stipulations regarding discovery.</E> Unless otherwise ordered, a written stipulation entered into by all the parties and filed with the Board may:</P>
                <P>(1) Provide that depositions be taken before any person, at any time or place, upon sufficient notice, and in any manner and when so taken may be used like other depositions; and</P>
                <P>(2) Modify the procedures provided by these rules for other methods of discovery.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Service of discovery materials.</E> Unless otherwise ordered by the Board, and subject to the requirements at 49 CFR 1111.2(f) and 1111.5(f) in stand-alone cost cases, depositions, interrogatories, requests for documents, requests for admissions, and answers and responses thereto, shall be served on other counsel and parties, but shall not be filed with the Board. Any such materials, or portions thereof, should be appended to the appropriate pleading when used to support or to reply to a <PRTPAGE P="148"/>motion, or when used as an evidentiary submission.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Where deposition should be taken.</E> Unless otherwise ordered or agreed to by stipulation, depositions should be taken in the city or municipality where the deponent is located.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Officer before whom taken.</E> Within the United States or within a territory or insular possession subject to the dominion of the United States, depositions should be taken before an officer authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States or of the place where the examination is held. Within a foreign country, depositions may be taken before an officer or person designated by the Board or agreed upon by the parties by stipulation in writing to be filed with the Board.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Fees.</E> A witness whose deposition is taken pursuant to these rules and the officer taking same, unless he be employed by the Board, shall be entitled to the same fee paid for like service in the courts of the United States, which fee should be paid by the party at whose instance the deposition is taken.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Failure to attend or to serve subpoena; expenses.</E> (1) If the party who filed a petition for discovery fails to attend and proceed with the taking of the deposition and another party attends in person or by representative pursuant to an order of the Board granting discovery the Board may order the party who filed the petition to pay to such other party the reasonable expenses incurred by him and his representative in so attending, including reasonable attorney's fees.</P>
                <P>(2) If the party who filed a petition for discovery fails to serve a subpoena upon the witness and the witness because of such failure does not attend, and if another party attends in person or by representative because he expects the deposition of the witness to be taken, the Board may order the party who filed the petition to pay to such other party the reasonable expenses incurred by him and his representative in so attending, including reasonable attorney's fees.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Disqualification for interest.</E> No deposition should be taken before a person who is a relative or employee or representative or counsel of any of the parties, or is a relative or employee of such representative or counsel or is financially interested in the proceeding.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Depositions; procedures.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Examination.</E> Examination and cross-examination of witnesses should proceed as permitted at a hearing and should be limited to the subject matter specified in the order granting discovery. All objections made at the time of the examination to the qualifications of the officer taking the deposition, or to the manner of taking it, or to the evidence presented, or to the conduct of any party, and any other objection to the proceedings, should be noted by the officer upon the deposition. Evidence objected to should be taken subject to the objections. In lieu of participating in the oral examination, parties may serve written questions in a sealed envelope on the party taking the deposition, and shall transmit them to the officer, who shall open <PRTPAGE P="149"/>the sealed envelope, propound the questions to the witness, and record the answers verbatim.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Use of depositions.</E> At the hearings, any part or all of a deposition, so far as admissible under the rules of evidence, may be used against any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had due notice thereof, in accordance with any one of the following provisions:</P>
                <P>(1) Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the testimony of the deponent as a witness.</P>
                <P>(2) The deposition of a party or of anyone who at the time of taking the deposition was an officer, director, or managing agent, or a person designated to testify on behalf of a public or private corporation, partnership, association or governmental agency (other than this Board, except in those instances where the Board itself is a party to the proceeding) which is a party, may be used by an adverse party for any purpose.</P>
                <P>(3) The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any purpose if the presiding officer or Board finds:</P>
                <P>(i) That the witness is dead; or</P>
                <P>(ii) That the witness is at a greater distance than 100 miles from the place of hearing or is out of the United States, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition; or</P>
                <P>(iii) That the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or</P>
                <P>(iv) That the party offering the deposition has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or</P>
                <P>(v) Upon application and notice, that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witness orally at public hearing, to allow the deposition to be used.</P>
                <P>(4) If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse party may require him to introduce any other part which ought in fairness to be considered with the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other parts. Substitution of parties does not affect the right to use depositions previously taken.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Effect of taking or using depositions.</E> A party should not be deemed to make a person his own witness for any purpose by taking his deposition. The introduction in evidence of the deposition or any part thereof for any purpose other than that of contradicting or impeaching the deponent makes the deponent the witness of the party introducing the deposition, but this should not apply to the use of an adverse party of a deposition under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. At the hearing any party may rebut any relevant evidence contained in a deposition whether introduced by him or by any other party.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Motions to protect.</E> At any time during the taking of the deposition, on motion of any party or of the deponent and upon a showing that the examination is being conducted in bad faith or in such manner as unreasonably to annoy, embarrass, or oppress the deponent or party, the Board may order the officer conducting the examination to cease forthwith from taking the deposition, or may limit the scope and manner of the taking of the deposition as provided in § 1114.21(c). If the order made terminates the examination, it should be resumed thereafter only if so ordered. Upon demand of the objecting party or deponent, the taking of the deposition should be suspended for the time necessary to make a motion for an order.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Recordation.</E> The officer before whom the deposition is to be taken shall observe the provisions of § 1113.6 respecting appearances and typographical specifications, shall put the witness under oath, and shall personally, or by someone acting under his direction and in his presence, record and transcribe the testimony of the witness as required by these rules.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Signing.</E> When the testimony is fully transcribed or otherwise recorded, the deposition should be submitted to the witness for examination and should be read to or by him unless such examination and reading are waived by the witness and the parties. Any changes in form or substance which the witness desires to make should be entered upon the deposition by the officer with a <PRTPAGE P="150"/>statement of the reasons given by the witness for making them. The witness shall then sign the deposition, unless the parties by stipulation waive the signing or the witness is ill or cannot be found or refuses to sign. If the deposition is not signed by the witness within 15 days of its submission to him, the officer shall sign it and state on the record the fact of the waiver or of the illness or absence of the witness or the fact of the refusal to sign together with the reason, if any, given therefor; and the deposition may then be used fully as though signed, unless, on a motion to suppress, it is found that the reasons given for refusal to sign require rejection of the deposition in whole or in part.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Attestation.</E> The officer shall certify on the deposition that the witness was duly sworn by him and that the deposition is a true record of the testimony given by the witness, and that the officer is: (1) not a relative, employee, representative or counsel of any of the parties, (2) not a relative or employee of such representative or counsel, and (3) not financially interested in the proceeding.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Return.</E> The officer shall securely seal the deposition in an envelope endorsed with sufficient information to identify the proceeding and marked “Deposition of (here insert name of witness)” and shall either personally deliver or promptly send the original and one copy of all exhibits by registered mail to the Office of Proceedings. A deposition to be offered in evidence must reach the Board not later than 5 days before the date it is to be so offered.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Notice.</E> The party taking the deposition shall give prompt notice of its filing to all other parties.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Copies.</E> Upon payment of reasonable charges, the officer before whom the deposition is taken shall furnish a copy of it to any interested party or to the deponent.</P>

Each interrogatory should be answered separately <PRTPAGE P="151"/>and fully in writing, unless it is objected to, in which event the reasons for objection should be stated in lieu of an answer. The answers are to be signed by the person making them and subscribed by an appropriate verification generally in the form prescribed in § 1112.9. Objections are to be signed by the representative or counsel making them. The person upon whom the interrogatories have been served shall serve a copy of the answers and objections within the time period designated by the party submitting the interrogatories, but not less than 15 days after the service thereof.</P>

If information sought is contained in computer runs, punchcards, or tapes which also contain privileged or proprietary information or information the disclosure of which is proscribed by the act, it will be sufficient response under these rules that the person upon whom the interrogatory has been served is willing to make available to and permit an independent professional organization not interested in the proceeding and paid by the party serving the interrogatory to extract from such runs, punchcards, or tapes the information sought in the interrogatory that is not privileged or proprietary information or information the disclosure of which is proscribed by the act.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Availability; procedures for use.</E> Subject to the provisions of § 1114.21(a), a party may serve upon any other party a written request for the admission, for purposes of the pending proceeding only, of the truth of any matters within the scope of § 1114.21 set forth in the request, including the genuineness of any documents described in the request for admission. Copies of documents should be served with the request unless they have been or are otherwise furnished or made available for inspection and copying. Each matter of which an admission is requested should be separately set forth. The matter is admitted unless, within a period designated in the request, not less than 15 days after service thereof, the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting the admission a written answer or objection addressed to the matter, signed by the party or his representative or counsel. If objection is made, the reasons therefor should be stated. The answer should specifically deny the matter or set forth in detail the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter. A denial should fairly meet the substance of the requested admission, and when good faith requires that a party qualify his answer or deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is requested, he shall specify so much of it as is true and qualify or deny the remainder. An answering party may not give lack of information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny unless he states that he <PRTPAGE P="152"/>has made reasonable inquiry and that the information known or readily obtainable by him is insufficient to enable him to admit or deny. A party who considers that a matter of which an admission has been requested presents a genuine issue for hearing may not, on that ground alone, object to the request; he may, subject to the provisions of § 1114.31, deny the matter or set forth reasons why he cannot admit or deny it.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Effect of admission.</E> Any matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless upon petition and a showing of good cause the Board enters an order permitting withdrawal or amendment of the admission. Any admission made by a party under this rule is for the purpose of the pending proceeding only and is not an admission by him for any other purpose nor may it be used against him in any other proceeding.</P>

              <P>(a) These appellate procedures apply in cases where a hearing is required by law or Board action. They do not apply to informal matters such as car service, temporary authority, suspension, special permission actions, or to other matters of an interlocutory nature. Abandonments and discontinuance proceedings instituted under 49 U.S.C. 10903 are governed by separate appellate procedures exclusive to those proceedings. (See 49 CFR part 1152)</P>
              <P>(b) Requests for appellate relief may relate either to initial decisions or to Board actions other than initial decisions. For each category, this rule describes the types of appeal permitted, the requirements to be observed in filing an appeal, provisions for stay of the action, and the status of the action in the absence of a stay.</P>
              <P>(c) Appeals from the decisions of employees acting under authority delegated to them by the Chairman of the Board pursuant to § 1011.6 will be acted upon by the entire Board. Appeals must be filed within 10 days of the date of the action taken by the employee, and responses to appeals must be filed within 10 days thereafter. Such appeals are not favored; they will be granted only in exceptional circumstances to correct a clear error of judgment or to prevent manifest injustice.</P>

              <P>(b) Appeals must be based on one or more of the following grounds:</P>
              <P>(1) That a necessary finding of fact is omitted, erroneous, or unsupported by substantial evidence of record;</P>
              <P>(2) That a necessary legal conclusion, or finding is contrary to law, Board precedent, or policy;</P>

A petition to stay may be filed in advance of the petition for reconsideration and shall be filed within 10 days of service of the action. No reply need be filed. However, if a party elects to file a reply, it must reach the Board no later than 16 days after service of the action. In all proceedings, the action, if not stayed, will become effective 30 days after it is served, unless the Board provides for the action to become effective at a different date. On the day the action is served parties may initiate judicial review.</P>

              <P>An appeal of right to the Board is permitted. The appeal must be filed within 20 days upon the Board of a final arbitration decision, unless a later date is authorized by the Board, and is subject to the page limitations of § 1115.2(d). For arbitrations authorized under part 1108 of this chapter, the Board's standard of review of arbitration decisions will be narrow, and relief will only be granted on grounds that the decision is inconsistent with sound principles of rail regulation economics, a clear abuse of arbitral authority or discretion occurred, the decision directly contravenes statutory authority, or the award limitation was violated. For labor arbitration decisions, the Board's standard of review is set forth in <E T="03">Chicago and North Western Transportation Company—Abandonment—near Dubuque &amp; Oelwein, Iowa,</E> 3 I.C.C.2d 729 (1987), <E T="03">aff'd sub nom.

              <SUBJECT>Procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Exemption proceedings are informal, and public comments are generally not sought during consideration of exemption petition proposals, except as provided in § 1121.4(c). However, the Board may consider during its deliberation any public comments filed in response to a petition for exemption.</P>

              <P>(b) If the Board determines that the criteria in 49 U.S.C. 10502 are met for the proposed exemption, it will issue the exemption and publish a notice of exemption in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(c)(1) If the impact of the proposed individual exemption cannot be ascertained from the information contained in the petition or accompanying submissions, or significant adverse impacts might occur if the proposed exemption were granted, the Board may, in its discretion:</P>
              <P>(i) Direct that additional information be filed; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> requesting public comments.</P>

              <P>(2) If a petition for a new class exemption is filed, the Board will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> requesting public comments before granting the class exemption. This requirement does not pertain to individual notices of exemption filed under existing class exemptions. The Board may deny a request for a class exemption without seeking public comments.</P>
              <P>(d) Exemption petitions containing proposals that are directly related to and concurrently filed with a primary application will be considered along with that primary application.</P>
              <P>(e) Unless otherwise specified in the decision, an exemption generally will be effective 30 days from the service date of the decision granting the exemption. Unless otherwise provided in the decision, petitions to stay must be filed within 10 days of the service date, and petitions for reconsideration or petitions to reopen under 49 CFR part 1115 or 49 CFR 1152.25(e) must be filed within 20 days of the service date.</P>
              <P>(f) Petitions to revoke an exemption or the notice of exemption may be filed at any time. The person seeking revocation has the burden of showing that the revocation criteria of 49 U.S.C. 10502(d) have been met.</P>
              <P>(g) In abandonment exemptions, petitions to revoke in part to impose public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28, or to invoke the Trails Act, 16 U.S.C. 1247(d), may be filed at any time prior to the consummation of the abandonment, except that public use conditions may not prohibit disposal of the properties for any more than the statutory limit of 180 days after the effective date of the decision granting the exemption.</P>
              <P>(h) In transactions for the acquisition or operation of rail lines by Class II rail carriers under 49 U.S.C. 10902, the exemption may not become effective until 60 days after applicant certifies to the Board that it has posted at the workplace of the employees on the affected line(s) and served a notice of the transaction on the national offices of the labor unions with employees on the affected line(s), setting forth the types and numbers of jobs expected to be available, the terms of employment and principles of employee selection, and the lines that are to be transferred.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Correspondence handling.</E> When an informal complaint appears susceptible of informal adjustment, the Board will send a copy or statement of the complaint to each subject of the complaint in an attempt to have it satisfied by correspondence, thereby avoiding the filing of a formal complaint.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Actual filing required.</E> Notification to the Board that an informal complaint may or will be filed later seeking damages is not a filing within the meaning of the statute.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Content.</E> An informal complaint seeking damages must be filed within the statutory period, and should identify with reasonable definiteness the involved shipments or transportation services. The complaint should include:</P>
              <P>(1) A statement that complainant seeks to recover damages;</P>
              <P>(2) The names of each individual seeking damages;</P>

              <P>(e) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Notification to the parties; six months' rule.</E> If an informal complaint seeking damages (other than a contested tariff reconciliation petition) cannot be disposed of informally or is denied or withdrawn by complainant, the parties affected will be so notified in writing by the Board. Contested tariff reconciliation petitions either will be granted or denied by the entry of a decision. Unless within six months <PRTPAGE P="165"/>after the date on which a notice is mailed or a decision is served, a party either files a formal complaint or resubmits its informal complaint on an additional-fact basis, the matter in the complaint or petition will not be reconsidered. The claim will be considered abandoned and no complaint seeking damages on the same cause of action will be accepted unless filed within the statutory period. Any filing or resubmission satisfying the six months' requirement will be considered filed as of the date of the original filing and must specifically refer to that date and to the Board's file number. Any petition for reconsideration should be filed with the Board. </P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Tariff reconciliation proceedings for motor common carriers</E>—(1) <E T="03">Petitions to waive collection or permit payment.</E> Subject to Board review and approval, motor common carriers (other than household goods carriers) and shippers may resolve, by mutual consent, overcharge and undercharge claims under the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 14709. Petitions for appropriate authority may be filed by either the carrier, shipper or consignee on the Board's tariff reconciliation docket by submitting a letter of intent to depart from the filed rate. The petitions will be deemed the equivalent of an informal complaint and answer admitting the matters stated in the petition. Petitions shall be sent to the Office of Compliance and Enforcement, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423. The petitions shall contain, at a minimum, the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) The name(s) and address(es) of the payer(s) of the freight charges;</P>
              <P>(ii) The name(s) of the carrier(s) involved in the traffic;</P>
              <P>(iii) An estimate of the amount(s) involved;</P>

              <P>(vi) A general description of the commodity(ies) transported;</P>
              <P>(vii) A statement certifying that the carrier(s) and shipper(s) participating in the shipment(s) or the payer(s) of the freight charges concur(s) with the intent to depart from the filed rate; and</P>
              <P>(viii) A brief explanation of the incorrect tariff provision(s) or billing error(s) causing the request to depart from the filed rate.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Public notice and protest.</E> Tariff reconciliation petitions (letters of intent) shall be served on all parties named in the petition by the party that files the petition and will be made available by the Board for public inspection in the Office of Compliance and Enforcement Public File, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423. Any interested person may protest the granting of a petition by filing a letter of objection with the Office of Compliance and Enforcement within 30 days of Board receipt of the petition. Letters of objection shall identify the tariff reconciliation proceeding, shall clearly state the reasons for the objection, and shall certify that a copy of the letter of objection has been served on all parties named in the petition. The Board may initiate an investigation of the petition on its own motion.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Uncontested petitions.</E> If a petition is not contested, and if the Board does not initiate an investigation of the petition on its own motion, approval is deemed granted without further action by the Board, effective 45 days after Board receipt of the petition.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Contested petitions.</E> If a petition is contested or the Board initiates an investigation of the petition on its own motion, 15 days will be allowed for reply. The 15-day period will commence on the date of service of the objections or, if the Board initiates an investigation on its own motion, on the date of service of the decision initiating the investigation. After the period for reply has expired, the Board will issue a decision approving or disapproving the petition, or requesting further submissions from the parties, and then will issue a decision based on the further submissions.</P>

If the protestant desires action by the Board before the effective date of the collective action, protests and requests for suspension shall reach the Board at least 12 days (except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section) before such effective date. If the protested collective ratemaking action is already in effect, or if the protestant does not desire action before its effective date, protests and requests for suspension can be filed at any time.</P>

              <P>(b) The statement should not include any shipment not covered by the Board's findings, or any shipment on which complaint was not filed with the Board within the statutory period. The filing of a statement will not stop the running of the statute of limitations as to shipments not covered by complaint or supplemental complaint. If the shipments moved over more than one route, a separate statement should be prepared for each route, and separately numbered, except that shipments as to which the collecting carrier is in each instance the same may be listed in a single statement if grouped according to routes. The statement, together with the paid freight bills on the shipments, or true copies thereof, should then be forwarded to the carrier which collected the charges, for verification and certification as to its accuracy. If the statement is not forwarded immediately to the collecting carrier for certification, a letter request from defendants that forwarding be expedited will be considered to the end that steps be taken to have the statement forwarded immediately. All discrepancies, duplications, or other errors in the statements should be adjusted by the <PRTPAGE P="168"/>parties and corrected agreed statements submitted to the Board. The certificate must be signed in ink by a general accounting officer of the carrier and should cover all of the information shown in the statement. If the carrier which collected the charges is not a defendant in the case, its certificate must be concurred in by like signature on behalf of a carrier defendant. Statements so prepared and certified shall be filed with the Board whereupon it will consider entry of a decision awarding damages.</P>

              <P>(b) The Board will serve and publish a notice of the filing in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> within 10 days of the AAR's filing.</P>
              <P>(c) Any interested party may file comments on the AAR's filing within 30 days of the notice described in paragraph (b) of this section. If no comments are received within 30 days, the Board will automatically adopt the AAR's weighted average State tax rates on the 31st day. If comments opposing the AAR's calculations are received, the AAR's response will be due within 20 days of the comments. The Board will review the submission and comments and serve a decision within 60 days from the date of the close of the record that either accepts, rejects, or modifies the AAR's railroad-specific tax information.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedures to calculate interest rates.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For purposes of complying with a Board decision in an investigation or complaint proceeding, interest rates to be computed shall be the most recent U.S. Prime Rate as published by The Wall Street Journal. The rate levels will be determined as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) For investigation proceedings, the interest rate shall be the U.S. Prime <PRTPAGE P="169"/>Rate as published by The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date the statement is filed accounting for all amounts received under the new rates.</P>
              <P>(2) For complaint proceedings, the interest rate shall be the U.S. Prime Rate as published by The Wall Street Journal in effect on the day when the unlawful charge is paid. The interest rate in complaint proceedings shall be updated whenever The Wall Street Journal publishes a change to its reported U.S. Prime Rate. Updating will continue until the required reparation payments are made.</P>
              <P>(b) For investigation proceedings, the reparations period shall begin on the date the investigation is started. For complaint proceedings, the reparations period shall begin on the date the unlawful charge is paid.</P>
              <P>(c) For both investigation and complaint proceedings, the annual percentage rate shall be the same as the annual nominal (or stated) rate. Thus, the nominal rate must be factored exponentially to the power representing the portion of the year covered by the interest rate. A simple multiplication of the nominal rate by the portion of the year covered by the interest rate would not be appropriate because it would result in an effective rate in excess of the nominal rate. Under this “exponential” approach, the total cumulative reparations payment (including interest) is calculated by multiplying the interest factor for each period by the principal amount for that period plus any accumulated interest from previous periods. The “interest factor” for each period is 1.0 plus the interest rate for that period to the power representing the portion of the year covered by the interest rate.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A through route or a through rate shall be prescribed under 49 U.S.C. 10705, or a switching arrangement shall be established under 49 U.S.C. 11102(c), if the Board determines:</P>
              <P>(1) That the prescription or establishment is necessary to remedy or prevent an act that is contrary to the competition policies of 49 U.S.C. 10101 or is otherwise anticompetitive, and otherwise satisfies the criteria of 49 U.S.C. 10705 and 11102(c), as appropriate. In making its determination, the Board shall take into account all relevant factors, including:</P>
              <P>(i) The revenues of the involved railroads on the affected traffic via the rail routes in question.</P>
              <P>(ii) The efficiency of the rail routes in question, including the costs of operating via those routes.</P>
              <P>(iii) The rates or compensation charged or sought to be charged by the railroad or railroads from which prescription or establishment is sought.</P>
              <P>(iv) The revenues, following the prescription, of the involved railroads for the traffic in question via the affected route; the costs of the involved railroads for that traffic via that route; the ratios of those revenues to those costs; and all circumstances relevant to any difference in those ratios; provided that the mere loss of revenue to an affected carrier shall not be a basis for finding that a prescription or establishment is necessary to remedy or prevent an act contrary to the competitive standards of this section; and</P>
              <P>(2) That either:<PRTPAGE P="170"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) The complaining shipper has used or would use the through route, through rate, or reciprocal switching to meet a significant portion of its current or future railroad transportation needs between the origin and destination; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The complaining carrier has used or would use the affected through route, through rate, or reciprocal switching for a significant amount of traffic.</P>
              <P>(b) Other considerations. (1) The Board will not consider product competition.</P>
              <P>(2) If a railroad wishes to rely in any way on geographic competition, it will have the burden of proving the existence of effective geographic competition by clear and convincing evidence.</P>
              <P>(3) When prescription of a through route, a through rate, or reciprocal switching is necessary to remedy or prevent an act contrary to the competitive standards of this section, the overall revenue inadequacy of the defendant railroad(s) will not be a basis for denying the prescription.</P>
              <P>(4) Any proceeding under the terms of this section will be conducted and concluded by the Board on an expedited basis.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">When an application is required.</E> This subpart governs applications under 49 U.S.C. 10901 for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction, acquisition or operation of railroad lines. Noncarriers require Board approval under section 10901 to construct, acquire or operate a rail line in interstate commerce. Existing carriers require approval under section 10901 only to construct a new rail line or operate a line owned by a noncarrier, since acquisition by a carrier of an active rail line owned by a carrier is covered by 49 U.S.C. 11323. We have exempted from these requirements the acquisition by a State entity of a rail line that has been approved for abandonment, as well as operations over these lines. See subpart C of this part. In addition, where appropriate, we have granted individual exemptions from these certification requirements. See 49 U.S.C. 10502.<PRTPAGE P="173"/>
                </P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Content of the application.</E> Applications filed under this subpart shall include the information set forth in §§ 1150.2 through 1150.9. The applicant must also comply with the Energy and Environmental Regulations at 49 CFR parts 1106 and 1105 (including consulting with the Board's Office of Environmental Analysis at least 6 months prior to filing an application, to begin the scoping process to identify environmental issues and outline procedures for analysis of this aspect of the proposal).</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Waivers.</E> Prior to filing an application, prospective applicants may seek an advance waiver, either on a permanent or temporary basis, of required information which is unavailable or not necessary or useful in analysis of the proposal. However, if the information <PRTPAGE P="175"/>is clearly not applicable to the individual proposal, a waiver is not necessary and need not be sought. A petition must specify the sections for which waiver or clarification is sought and the reasons why it should be granted. No replies will be permitted. Parties may, upon an appropriate showing, demonstrate their need to examine data which have previously been waived. In such circumstances, the Board only requires that it be produced under § 1150.8 above.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Filing procedures.</E> An application and all documents shall be filed with the Chief, Section of Administration, Office of Proceedings. A filing fee in the amount set forth in 49 CFR 1002.2(f) is required to file an application. Copies of documents shall be furnished promptly to interested parties upon request. The application may include a stamped self-addressed envelope to be used to notify applicant of the docket number. Additionally, if possible, telephonic communication of the docket number shall be made.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Signatures.</E> The original of the application shall be signed by applicants (if a partnership, all general partners must sign; and if a corporation, association, or other similar form of organization, the signature should be that of the executive officer having knowledge of the matters and designated for that purpose). Applications shall be made under oath and shall contain an appropriate certification (if a corporation, by its secretary) showing that the affiant is duly authorized to verify and file the application. Any persons controlling an applicant shall also sign the application.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Related applications.</E> Applicant shall file concurrently all directly related applications (e.g., to issue securities, control motor carriers, obtain access to terminal operations, acquire trackage rights). All such applications will be considered with the main application.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Service.</E> As soon as the docket number is obtained the applicant shall serve a conformed copy of the application by first-class mail upon the Governor (or Executive Officer), Public Service Board, and Department of Transportation of each State in which any part of the properties involved in the proposed transaction is located. Within 2 weeks of filing, applicant shall submit to the Board a copy of the certificate of service indicating that all persons so designated have been served a copy of the application.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Publication.</E> Within 2 weeks of filing, applicant shall have published the summary of the application (prepared under § 1150.9) in a newspaper of general circulation in each county in which the line is located. The notice should inform interested parties of the date by which they must advise the Board of their interest in the proceeding. This date shall be calculated as the 35th day after the filing of the application which is neither a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday in the District of Columbia. Applicant must file an affidavit of publication immediately after the publication has been completed. The Board will, as soon as practicable, either publish the notice summary in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or reject the application if it is incomplete.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Public participation.</E> Written comments must be filed within 35 days of the filing of the application. Comments must contain the basis for the party's position either in support or opposition. Applicant must be served with a copy of each comment. On the basis of the comments and the assessment by the Office of Environmental Analysis, the Board will decide if a hearing is necessary. A hearing may be either oral or through receipt of written statements (modified procedure). (See 49 CFR part 1112 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) If there is no opposition to the application, additional evidence normally need not be filed, and a decision will be reached using the information in the application.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Replies to written comments.</E> Applicant's replies will be considered by the Board provided they are filed and served within 5 days of the due date of the pleadings they address.</P>

                <P>These special rules apply to operations over abandoned rail lines, which have been acquired (through purchase or lease) by a State. The rail line must have been fully abandoned, or approved for abandonment by the Board or a bankruptcy court. As used in these rules, the term “State” includes <PRTPAGE P="177"/>States, political subdivisions of States, and all instrumentalities through which the State can act. An operator has the option of applying for a modified certificate of public convenience and necessity under this subpart or a common carrier certificate under Subpart A of this part. A copy of the modified certificate shall be served on the Association of American Railroads.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Exemptions and common carrier status.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The acquisition by a State of a fully abandoned line is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board. The acquisition by a State of a line approved for abandonment and not yet fully abandoned is exempted from the Board's jurisdiction. If the State intends to operate the line itself, it will be considered a common carrier. However, when a State acquires a rail line described under § 1150.21 and contracts with an operator to provide service over the line, only the operator incurs a common carrier obligation. The operators of these lines are exempted from 49 U.S.C. 10901 and 10903 which are the statutory requirements governing the start up and termination of operations. Operators exempted from these requirements must comply with the requirements of this part and must apply for a modified certificate of public convenience and necessity. The operator is a common carrier and incurs all benefits and responsibilities under 49 U.S.C. subtitle IV; however, the State through its operational agreement or the operator of the line may determine certain preconditions, such as payment of a subsidy, which must be met by shippers to obtain service over the line. The operator must notify the shippers on the line of any preconditions. The modified certificate will authorize service to shippers who meet these preconditions and the operator will be required to provide complete common carrier service under this certificate only to those shippers. (See 363 ICC 132.)</P>

                <SUBJECT>Scope of exemption.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) Except as indicated below, this exemption applies to all acquisitions and operations under section 10901 (<E T="03">See</E> 1150.1, <E T="03">supra</E>). This exemption also includes:</P>
                <P>(1) Acquisition by a noncarrier of rail property that would be operated by a third party;</P>
                <P>(2) Operation by a new carrier of rail property acquired by a third party;</P>
                <P>(3) A change in operators on the line; and</P>
                <P>(4) Acquisition of incidental trackage rights. Incidental trackage rights include the grant of trackage rights by the seller, or the assignment of trackage rights to operate over the line of a third party that occur at the time of the exempt acquisition or operation. This exemption does not apply when a class I railroad abandons a line and another class I railroad then acquires the line in a proposal that would result in a major market extension as defined at § 1180.3(c).</P>
                <P>(b) Other exemptions that may be relevant to a proposal under this subpart are the exemption for control at § 1180.2(d)(1) and (2), and the exemption from securities regulation at 49 CFR part 1177.</P>

The Board, through the Director of the Office of Proceedings, will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> within 16 days of the filing. A change in operators would follow the provisions at § 1150.34, and notice must be given to shippers.</P>

                <P>(e) If the projected annual revenue of the carrier to be created by a transaction under this exemption exceeds $5 million, applicant must, at least 60 days before the exemption becomes effective, post a notice of intent to undertake the proposed transaction at the workplace of the employees on the affected line(s) and serve a copy of the notice on the national offices of the labor unions with employees on the affected line(s), setting forth the types and numbers of jobs expected to be available, the terms of employment and principles of employee selection, and the lines that are to be transferred, and certify to the Board that it has done so.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Exempt construction of connecting track.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This class exemption applies to proceedings involving the construction and operation of connecting lines of railroad within existing rail rights-of-way, or on land owned by connecting railroads, under 49 U.S.C. 10901 (a), (b), and (c). (See the reference to connecting track in 49 CFR 1105.6(b)(1).) This class exemption is designed to expedite and facilitate connecting track construction while ensuring full and timely environmental review. The Surface Transportation Board (Board) has found that its prior review of connecting track construction and operation is not necessary to carry out the rail transportation policy of 49 U.S.C. 10101; that continued regulation is not necessary to protect shippers from abuse of market power; and that the construction of connecting track would be of limited scope. <E T="03">See</E> 49 U.S.C. 10502. To use this class exemption, a pre-filing notice, environmental report, historic report, and notice of exemption must be filed that complies with the procedures in § 1150.36 (b) and (c), and the Board's environmental rules, codified at 49 CFR part 1105.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Environmental requirements.</E> The environmental regulations at 49 CFR part 1105 must be complied with fully. An environmental report containing the information specified at 49 CFR 1105.7(e), as well as an historic report containing the information specified at 49 CFR 1105.8(d), must be filed either before or at the same time as the notice of exemption is filed. <E T="03">See</E> 49 CFR 1105.7(a). The entity seeking the exemption authority must also serve copies of the environmental report on the agencies listed at 49 CFR 1105.7(b). Because the environmental report must include a certification that appropriate agencies have been consulted in its preparation (<E T="03">see</E> 49 CFR 1105.7(c)), parties should begin environmental and historic consultations well before the notice of exemption is filed. Environmental requirements may be waived or modified where a petitioner demonstrates in writing that such action is appropriate. <E T="03">See</E> 49 CFR 1105.10(c). It is to the advantage of parties to consult with the Board's Office of Environmental Analysis (OEA) at the earliest possible date to begin environmental review.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedures and dates.</E> (1) At least 20 days prior to the filing of a notice of exemption with the Board, the party seeking the exemption authority must notify in writing: the State Public Service Commission, the State Department of Transportation (or equivalent agency), and the State Clearinghouse (if there is no clearinghouse, the State Environmental Protection Agency), of each State involved. The pre-filing notice shall include: the name and address of the railroad (or other entity proposing to construct the line) and the proposed operator; a complete description of the proposed construction and operation, including a map; an indication that the class exemption procedure is being used; and the approximate date that construction is proposed to begin. This pre-filing notice shall include a certification that the petitioner will comply with the Board's environmental regulations, codified at 49 CFR part 1105, and a statement that those regulations generally require the Board to:</P>
                <P>(i) Prepare an environmental assessment (EA) (or environmental impact statement (EIS) if necessary),</P>
                <P>(ii) Make the document (EA or EIS, as appropriate) available to the parties (and to the public, upon request to OEA); and</P>
                <P>(iii) Accept for filing and consideration comments on the environmental document as well as petitions for stay and reconsideration.</P>
                <P>(2) Petitioner must file a verified notice of exemption with the Board at least 90 days before the construction is proposed to begin. In addition to the information contained in § 1150.36(c)(1), the notice shall include a statement certifying compliance with the environmental rules at 49 CFR part 1105 and the pre-filing notice requirements of 49 CFR 1150.36(c)(1).</P>

                <P>(3) The Board, through the Director of the Office of Proceedings, shall publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> within 20 days after the notice of exemption is received that describes the construction project and invites comments. OEA will then prepare an EA (or, if necessary, an EIS). The EA generally will be made available 15 days <PRTPAGE P="182"/>after the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice. It will be served on all parties and appropriate agencies. Others may request a copy from OEA. The deadline for submission of comments on the EA will generally be within 30 days of its availability (<E T="03">see</E> 49 CFR 1105.10(b)). If an EIS is prepared, the time frames and procedures set forth in 49 CFR 1105.10(a) generally will apply.</P>
                <P>(4) The Board's environmental document (together with any comments and OEA's recommendations) shall be used in deciding whether to allow the particular construction project to proceed under the class exemption and whether to impose appropriate mitigating conditions upon its use (including use of an environmentally preferable route). If the Board concludes that a particular project will result in serious adverse environmental consequences that cannot be adequately mitigated, it may deny authority to proceed with the construction under the class exemption (the “no-build” alternative). Persons believing that they can show that the need for a particular line outweighs the adverse environmental consequences can file an application for approval of the proposed construction under 49 U.S.C. 10901.</P>
                <P>(5) No construction may begin until the Board has completed its environmental review and issued a final decision.</P>

                <P>(6) Petitions to stay the effective date of the notice of exemption on other than environmental and/or historic preservation grounds must be filed within 10 days of the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication. Petitions to stay the effective date of the notice on environmental and/or historic preservation grounds may be filed at any time but must be filed sufficiently in advance of the effective date to allow the Board to consider and act on the petition before the notice becomes effective. Petitions for reconsideration must be filed within 20 days of the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication.</P>

                <P>(7) The exemption generally will be effective 70 days after publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> unless stayed. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void <E T="03">ab initio</E> and the Board shall summarily reject the exemption notice.</P>
                <P>(8) Where significant environmental issues have been raised or discovered during the environmental review process, the Board shall issue, on or before the effective date of the exemption, a final decision allowing the exemption to become effective and imposing appropriate mitigating conditions or taking other appropriate action such as selecting the “no build” alternative.</P>

                <P>(9) Where there has been full environmental review and no significant environmental issues have been raised or discovered, the Board, through the Director of the Office of Proceedings, shall issue, on or before the effective date of the exemption, a final decision consisting of a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) to show that the environmental record has been considered (<E T="03">see</E> 49 CFR 1105.10(g)).</P>
                <P>(10) The Board, on its own motion or at the request of a party to the case, will stay the effective date of individual notices of exemption when an informed decision on environmental issues cannot be made prior to the date that the exemption authority would otherwise become effective. Stays will be granted initially for a period of 60 days to permit resolution of environmental issues and issuance of a final decision. The Board expects that this 60-day period will usually be sufficient for these purposes unless preparation of an EIS is required. If, however, environmental issues remain unresolved upon expiration of this 60-day period, the Board, upon its own motion, or at the request of a party to the case, will extend the stay, as necessary to permit completion of environmental review and issuance of a final decision. The Board's order will specify the duration of each extension of the initial stay period. In cases requiring the preparation of an EIS, the Board will extend the stay for a period sufficient to permit compliance with the procedural guidelines established by the Board's environmental regulations.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Third-Party Consultants.</E> An environmental and historic report required under 49 CFR 1105.7 and 1105.8 will not be required where a petitioner engages a third-party consultant who is approved by OEA and acts under OEA's <PRTPAGE P="183"/>direction and supervision in preparing the EA or EIS. In such a case, the third-party consultant must act on behalf of the Board, working under OEA's direction to collect the environmental information that is needed and to compile it into a draft EA or EIS, which is prepared under OEA's direction and then submitted to OEA for its final review and approval. <E T="03">See</E> 49 CFR 1105.10(d).</P>

                <P>(a) Acquisition by a Class III rail carrier of rail property that would be operated by a third party;</P>
                <P>(b) Operation by a Class III carrier of rail property acquired by a third party;</P>
                <P>(c) A change in operators on such a line; and</P>
                <P>(d) Acquisition of incidental trackage rights. Incidental trackage rights include the grant of trackage rights by the seller, or the acquisition of trackage rights to operate over the line of a third party, that occurs at the time of the purchase.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Procedures and relevant dates for small line acquisitions.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) This exemption applies to the acquisition of rail lines with projected annual revenues which, together with the acquiring carrier's projected annual revenue, do not exceed the annual revenue of a Class III railroad. To qualify for this exemption, the Class III rail carrier applicant must file a verified notice providing details about the transaction, and a brief caption summary, conforming to the format in § 1150.44, for publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
                </P>

The Board, through the Director of the Office of Proceedings, will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> within 16 days of the filing. A change in operators must follow the provisions at § 1150.44, and notice must be given to shippers.</P>

                <P>(c) If the notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void <E T="03">ab initio.</E> A petition to revoke under 49 U.S.C. 10502(d) does not automatically stay the exemption. Stay petitions must be filed at least 7 days before the exemption becomes effective.</P>
                <P>(d) Applicant must preserve intact all sites and structures more than 50 years old until compliance with the requirements of section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, 16 U.S.C. 470f, is achieved.</P>
                <P>(e) If the projected annual revenue of the rail lines to be acquired or operated, together with the acquiring carrier's projected annual revenue, exceeds $5 million, the applicant must, at least 60 days before the exemption becomes effective, post a notice of applicant's intent to undertake the proposed transaction at the workplace of the employees on the affected line(s) and serve a copy of the notice on the national offices of the labor unions with employees on the affected line(s), setting forth the types and numbers of jobs expected to be available, the terms of employment and principles of employee selection, and the lines that are to be transferred, and certify to the Board that it has done so.</P>

              <P>(a) Service. When an application is filed, applicant must concurrently serve a copy of the application by first class mail on:</P>
              <P>(1) The owning railroad;</P>
              <P>(2) All rail patrons who originated and/or received traffic on the line during the 12-month period preceding the month in which the application is filed;</P>
              <P>(3) The designated State agency in the State(s) where the property is located;</P>
              <P>(4) County governments where the line is located;</P>
              <P>(5) The National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) (if Amtrak operates on the line);</P>
              <P>(6) And the national offices of rail unions with employees on the line.</P>
              <P>(b) Acceptance or rejection of an application.</P>

              <P>(1) The Board, through the Director of the Office of Proceedings, will accept a complete application no later than 30 days after the application is filed by publishing a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> An application is complete if it has been properly served and contains substantially all information required by § 1151.3, except as modified by advance waiver. The notice will also announce the schedule for filing of competing applications and responses.</P>
              <P>(2) The Board, through the Director of the Office of Proceedings, will reject an incomplete application by serving a decision no later than 30 days after the application is filed. The decision will explain specifically why the application was incomplete. A revised application may be submitted, incorporating portions of the prior application by reference.</P>
              <P>(c) Competing applications.</P>
              <P>(1) Unless otherwise scheduled in the notice, competing applications by other parties seeking to acquire all or any portion of the line sought in the initial application are due within 30 days after the initial application is accepted.</P>
              <P>(2) The Board, through the Director of the Office of Proceedings, will issue a decision accepting or rejecting a competing application no later than 15 days after it is filed. A competing application will be rejected if it does not substantially contain the information required by § 1151.3, except as modified by advance waiver.</P>
              <P>(d) Incomplete applications.</P>
              <P>(1) If an applicant seeking to file an initial or competing application is unable to obtain required information that is primarily or exclusively within the personal knowledge of the owning carrier, the applicant may file an incomplete application if it files at the same time a request for discovery under 49 CFR part 1114 to obtain the needed information from the owning carrier.</P>
              <P>(2) The Board, through the Director of the Office of Proceedings, will by decision conditionally accept incomplete initial or competing applications, if the Director determines that the discovery sought is necessary for the application and primarily or exclusively within the knowledge of the owning carrier.</P>

              <P>(3) When the information sought through discovery has been filed for an initial application, <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice under paragraph (b) of this section will be published.</P>
              <P>(4) When the information sought through discovery has been filed for a competing application, a decision will be issued under paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) Comments. Unless otherwise scheduled in the notice, verified statements and comments addressing both the initial and competing applications must be filed within 60 days after the initial application is accepted.</P>
              <P>(f) Replies. Unless otherwise scheduled in the notice, verified replies by applicants and other interested parties must be filed within 80 days after the initial application is accepted.</P>

              <P>(g) Publication. If the Board finds that the public convenience and necessity require or permit sale of the line, the Board shall concurrently publish this finding in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(h) Acceptance or rejection. If the Board concludes that sale of the line should be required, the applicant(s) must file a notice with the Board and the owning railroad accepting or rejecting the Board's determination. The notice must be filed within 10 days of the service date of the decision.</P>

              <P>(i) Selection. If two or more applicants timely file notices accepting the <PRTPAGE P="187"/>Board's determination, the owning railroad must select the applicant to which it will sell the line and file notice of its selection with the Board and serve a copy on the applicants within 15 days of the service date of the Board decision.</P>
              <P>(j) Waiver. Prior to filing an initial or competing application, an applicant may file a petition to waive or clarify specific portions of part 1151. A decision by the Director of the Office of Proceedings granting or denying a petition for waiver or clarification will be issued within 30 days of the date the petition is filed. Appeals from the Director's decision will be decided by the entire Board.</P>
              <P>(k) Extension. Extensions of filing dates may be granted for good cause.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Board determination.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Board shall determine whether each applicant is a financially responsible person. To be a financially responsible person, the Board must find that:</P>

              <P>(1) The applicant is capable of paying the constitutional minimum value of the line and able to assure that adequate transportation will be provided over the line for at least 3 years;<PRTPAGE P="189"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The applicant is not a class I or class II railroad or an entity affiliated with a class I or class II railroad.</P>
              <P>(b) If the Board finds that one or more applicants are financially responsible parties, it shall determine whether the involved line or line segment is a qualified line. A line is a qualified line if:</P>
              <P>(1) Either</P>
              <P>(i) The public convenience and necessity require or permit the sale of line or line segment; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The line or line segment is classified in category 1 or 2 of the owning carrier's system diagram map; and</P>
              <P>(2) The traffic level on the line or line segment sought to be acquired was less than 3 million gross ton-miles of traffic per mile in the preceding calendar year (Note: This finding will not be required for applications filed after October 1, 1983).</P>
              <P>(c) If the Board finds that one or more financially responsible parties have offered to buy a qualifying line of railroad, the Board shall set the acquisition cost of the line at the higher of NLV or GCV, order the owning carrier to sell the rail line to one of the financially responsible applicants, and resolve any related issues raised in the application. If an applicant and the owning railroad agree on an acquisition price, that price shall be the final price.</P>
              <P>(d) If trackage rights are sought in the application, the Board shall, based on the evidence of record, set the adequate compensation for such rights, if the parties have not agreed.</P>
              <P>(e) If the applicant requests the Board to set joint rates or divisions and the line carried less than 3 million gross ton-miles of traffic per mile during the preceding calendar year, the Board shall, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 10705(a), establish joint rates and divisions based on the evidence of record in the proceeding. Unless specifically requested to do so by the selling carrier, the Board will not set the rate for the selling railroad's share of the joint rate at less than the applicable level (for the year in which the acquisition is made) set by 49 U.S.C. 10707, which limits Board maximum ratemaking jurisdiction to rates above certain cost/price ratios.</P>

                <P>(a) The application shall be filed with the Chief, Section of Administration, Office of Proceedings, Washington, DC 20423-0001. The application shall bear the date and signature and shall be complete in itself. The applicable filing fee must be paid by check, money order, or through the Board's electronic payment system (see 49 CFR part 1002). If the applicant carrier is in bankruptcy, the application shall also be filed on the bankruptcy court.</P>
                <P>(b) The applicant shall tender with its application an affidavit attesting to its compliance with the notice requirement of § 1152.20. The affidavit shall include the dates of service, posting, and publication of the notice.</P>

                <P>(c) When the application is filed with the Board, the applicant shall serve, by first class mail, a copy on the Governor, the Public Service Commission (or equivalent agency), and the designated state agency of each state in which any part of the line of railroad sought to be abandoned or discontinued is situated. A copy of the application <PRTPAGE P="199"/>will be available for public inspection, on or after the date the abandonment application is filed with the Board, at each agency station or terminal on the line proposed to be abandoned or discontinued (if there is no agency station on the line, the application shall be deposited at any agency station through which business for the line is received or forwarded). A certificate of service shall be promptly filed with the Board.</P>
                <P>(d) The applicant shall promptly furnish by first class mail a copy of the application to any interested person proposing to file a written comment or protest upon request. A certificate of service shall promptly be filed with the Board.</P>
                <P>(e)(1) The Board shall reject any abandonment or discontinuance application which does not substantially conform to the regulations in this subpart C regarding notice, form, and content, or which applies to a line which has not properly been published on the carrier's system diagram map (or included in a narrative in the case of a Class III carrier), in conformance with the regulations of subpart B of this part.</P>

                <P>(2) Upon the filing of an abandonment or discontinuance application, the Board will review the application and determine whether it conforms with all applicable regulations. If the application is substantially incomplete or its filing otherwise defective, the Board shall reject the application for stated reasons by order (which order will be administratively final) within 20 days from the date of filing of the application. If the Board does not reject the application, notice of the filing of the application shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> by the Board, through the Director of the Office of Proceedings, within 20 days of the filing of the application.</P>
                <P>(3) If the application is rejected, a revised application may be submitted, and the Board will determine whether the resubmitted application conforms with all prescribed regulations. A properly revised application submitted within 60 days of the order rejecting the incomplete or improper application need not be subjected to new notice and publication under § 1152.20, unless the defect causing the rejection was in the notice and/or publication. A revised application submitted after such 60-day period must be newly published and noticed.</P>
                <P>(4) The resubmission of an abandonment or discontinuance application shall be considered a de novo filing for the purposes of computation of the time period for filing an offer of financial assistance under 49 U.S.C. 10904, and for other time periods prescribed in the regulations contained in this part (49 CFR part 1152), provided, that a resubmitted application is deemed complete and proper.</P>
                <P>(5) An applicant may seek waiver of specific regulations listed in subpart C of this part by filing a petition for waiver with the Board. A decision by the Director of the Office of Proceedings granting or denying a waiver petition will be issued within 30 days of the date the petition is filed.

                <P>(ii) Whether partially to revoke or to reopen abandonment exemptions authorized, respectively, under 49 U.S.C. 10502 and 49 CFR part 1152 subpart F for the purpose of imposing public use conditions under the criteria in 49 CFR 1152.28 and/or conditions limiting salvage of the rail properties for environmental and historic preservation purposes; and</P>
                <P>(iii) The applicability and administration of the Trails Act [16 U.S.C. 1247(d)] in abandonment proceedings under 49 U.S.C. 10903 (and abandonment exemption proceedings), issued pursuant to delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1011.7(a)(2)(iv) and (v), will be acted on by the entire Board as set forth at 49 CFR 1011.2(a)(7). Any appeals, and replies to appeals, under this section must be filed with the Board.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Appeals criteria.</E> Appeals to the Board's decision in abandonment or discontinuance proceedings will not be entertained. Those decisions are administratively final upon the date they are served.</P>

                <P>(i) Parties seeking further administrative action may file a petition to reopen the proceeding under paragraph (e)(4) of this section. If an abandonment or discontinuance is granted and a party wishes the Board to have the opportunity to consider a petition to <PRTPAGE P="202"/>reopen before the abandonment or discontinuance authorization becomes effective, it must file its petition within 15 days after the administratively final decision is served together with a request for a stay of effectiveness under paragraph (e)(7) of this section. If such a petition to reopen and stay request is received within that 15-day period, any replies to the petition to reopen must be filed no later than 25 days after the date the decision is served, and any reply to the stay request must reach the Board no later than 5 days after the stay request is filed.</P>
                <P>(ii) The Board will grant a petition to reopen only upon a showing that the action would be affected materially because of new evidence, changed circumstances, or material error.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Form.</E> A petition to reopen and any reply shall not exceed 30 pages in length, including the index of subject matter, argument, and appendices or other attachments.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Petitions to reopen administratively final actions.</E> A person may file with the Board a petition to reopen any administratively final action of the Board. A petition to reopen shall state in detail the respects in which the proceeding involves material error, new evidence, or substantially changed circumstances.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Judicial review.</E> (i) Parties may seek judicial review of a Board action in an abandonment or discontinuance proceeding on the day the action of the Board becomes final.</P>
                <P>(ii) If a petition seeking reopening is filed under this section, before or after a petition seeking judicial review is filed with the courts, the Board will act upon the petition after advising the court of its pendency unless action might interfere with the court's jurisdiction.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Petitions to vacate.</E> In the event of procedural defects (such as the loss of a properly filed protest, the failure of the applicant to afford the public the requisite notice of its proposed abandonment, etc.), the Board will entertain petitions to vacate the abandonment or discontinuance authorization. Any petitions to vacate must be filed with the Board.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Petitions to stay.</E> (i) The filing of a petition to reopen shall not stay the effect of a prior action. Any petition to stay must be filed with the Board.</P>
                <P>(ii) A petition to reopen an administratively final action may be accompanied by a petition for a stay of the effectiveness of the abandonment or discontinuance. As provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, a petition to reopen must be accompanied by a stay request if the party wishes the Board to have the opportunity to consider the petition to reopen before the abandonment or discontinuance authorization becomes final.</P>
                <P>(iii) A party may petition for a stay of the effectiveness of abandonment or discontinuance authorization pending a request for judicial review. The reasons for the desired relief shall be stated in the petition, and the petition shall be filed not less than 15 days prior to the effective date of the abandonment authorization. No reply need be filed. If a party elects to file a reply, the reply must reach the Board no later than 5 days after the petition is filed.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Financial assistance procedures.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Provision of information.</E> An applicant must provide promptly upon request to a party considering an offer of financial assistance to continue existing rail service that has proven itself preliminarily financially responsible under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, and concurrently to the Board, the following:</P>
                <P>(1)(i) <E T="03">In an application or petition for exemption proceeding,</E> an estimate of the annual subsidy and minimum purchase price required to keep the line or a portion of the line in operation;</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">In a class exemption proceeding,</E> either an estimate of the annual subsidy or the minimum purchase price, depending upon the type of financial assistance indicated in the potential offeror's formal expression of intent submitted under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section;</P>
                <P>(2) Its most recent reports on the physical condition of the involved line; and</P>
                <P>(3) Traffic, revenue, and other data necessary to determine the amount of annual financial assistance that would be required to continue rail transportation over that part of the railroad line. In an exemption proceeding, the data to be provided must at a minimum include the carrier's estimate of the net liquidation value of the line, with supporting data reflecting available real estate appraisals, assessments of the quality and quantity of track materials in a line, and removal cost estimates (including the cost of transporting removed materials to point of sale or point of storage for relay use), and, if an offer of subsidy is contemplated, an estimate of the cost of rehabilitating the line to Federal Railroad Administration class 1 Safety Standards (49 CFR part 213).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Federal Register notice</E>—(1) <E T="03">Abandonment and discontinuance applications.</E> The <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication, which gives notice of the filing of the application 20 days after the application is filed, will serve as notice to persons intending to offer financial assistance to assure continued rail service under 49 U.S.C. 10904 and these regulations as they relate to abandonment and discontinuance applications. Offers of financial assistance will be due 120 days after the application is filed or 10 days after a decision granting the application is served, whichever occurs sooner.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Exemption proceedings.</E> (i) If a petition for individual exemption from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 10903 is filed with the Board for abandonment or discontinuance of a line of railroad, the Board will publish notice of the petition in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> within 20 days of the filing of the petition. The <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication will serve as notice to persons with a potential interest in providing financial assistance to assure continued rail service on the line under 49 U.S.C. 10904 and these regulations as they relate to exempt abandonments and discontinuances. Offers of financial assistance will be due 120 days after the filing of the petition for exemption or 10 days after service of a Board decision granting the exemption, whichever occurs sooner.</P>

                <P>(ii) If a notice of exemption is filed under the class exemption, the Board will publish notice of the exemption in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> within 20 days of filing. The <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication will serve as notice to persons with a potential interest in providing financial assistance to assure continued rail service on the line under 49 U.S.C. 10904 and these regulations as they relate to exempt abandonments and discontinuances. Offers of financial <PRTPAGE P="204"/>assistance will be due no later than 30 days after the date of the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication giving notice of the exemption.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Submission of financial assistance offer</E>—(1) <E T="03">Abandonment and discontinuance applications and petitions for exemption</E>—(i) <E T="03">Expression of intent to file offer.</E> Persons with a potential interest in providing financial assistance must, no later than 45 days after the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or no later than 10 days after the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, submit to the carrier and the Board a formal expression of their intent to file an offer of financial assistance, indicating the type of financial assistance they wish to provide (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> subsidy or purchase) and demonstrating that they are preliminarily financially responsible as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. Such submissions are subject to the filing requirements of § 1152.25(d)(1) through (d)(3).</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Preliminary financial responsibility.</E> Persons submitting an expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance as described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section must demonstrate that they are financially responsible, under the definition set forth in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(B) of this section, for the calculated preliminary financial responsibility amount of the rail line they seek to subsidize or purchase. If they seek to subsidize, the preliminary financial responsibility amount shall be $4,000 (representing a standard annual per-mile maintenance cost) times the number of miles of track. If they seek to purchase, the preliminary financial responsibility amount shall be the sum of the rail steel scrap price per ton (dated within 30 days of the submission of the expression of intent), times 132 short tons per track mile or 117.857 long tons per track mile, times the length of the line in miles, plus $4,000 times the number of miles of track times two. Persons submitting an expression of intent must provide evidentiary support for their calculations. If the Board does not issue a decision regarding the preliminary financial responsibility demonstration within 10 days of receipt of the expression of intent, the party submitting the expression of intent will be presumed to be preliminarily financially responsible and, upon request, the applicant must provide the information required under paragraph (a) of this section. This presumption does not create a presumption that the party will be financially responsible for an offer submitted under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Service and filing.</E> An offeror must serve its offer of assistance on the carrier owning and operating the line and all parties to the abandonment or discontinuance application or exemption proceeding. The offer must be filed concurrently with the Chief, Section of Administration, Office of Proceedings, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423-0001.</P>
                <P>(A) An offer may be filed and served at any time after the filing of the abandonment or discontinuance application or petition for exemption. Once a decision is served granting an application or petition for exemption, however, the Board must be notified that an offer has previously been submitted.</P>
                <P>(B) An offer, or notification of a previously filed offer, must be filed and served no later than 10 days after service of the Board decision granting the application or petition for exemption. This filing and service is subject to the requirements of 49 CFR 1152.25 (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(4).</P>
                <P>(C) If, after a <E T="03">bona fide</E> request, applicant or petitioner has failed to provide a potential offeror promptly with the information required under paragraph (a) of this section and if that information is not contained in the application or petition, the Board will entertain petitions to toll the 10-day period for submitting offers of financial assistance under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Petitions must be filed with the Board within 5 days after service of the decision granting the application or petition for exemption. Petitions should include copies of the prior written request for information or an accurate outline of the specific information that was orally requested. Replies to these petitions must be filed within 10 days after service of the decision granting the application or petition for exemption. These petitions and replies must <PRTPAGE P="205"/>be filed on or before their actual due date under 49 CFR 1152.25(d)(4). The Board will issue a decision on petitions within 15 days after service of the decision granting the application or petition for exemption.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Contents of offer.</E> The offeror shall set forth its offer in detail. The offer must:</P>
                <P>(A) Identify the line, or the portion of the line, in question;</P>
                <P>(B) Demonstrate that the offeror is financially responsible; that is, that it has or within a reasonable time will have the financial resources to fulfill proposed contractual obligations. Examples of documentation the Board will accept as evidence of financial responsibility include income statements, balance sheets, letters of credit, profit and loss statements, account statements, financing commitments, and evidence of adequate insurance or ability to obtain adequate insurance. Examples of documentation the Board will not accept as evidence of financial responsibility include the ability to borrow money on credit cards and evidence of non-liquid assets an offeror intends to use as collateral. Governmental entities will be presumed to be financially responsible;</P>
                <P>(C) Explain the disparity between the offeror's purchase price or subsidy if it is less than the carrier's estimate under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and explain how the offer of subsidy or purchase is calculated.</P>
                <P>(D) Demonstrate that the offeror has placed in escrow with a reputable financial institution funds equaling 10% of the preliminary financial responsibility amount calculated pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. Governmental entities are exempt from this requirement;</P>
                <P>(E) Demonstrate that there is a continued need for rail service on the line, or portion of the line, in question. Examples of evidence to be provided include: Evidence of a demonstrable commercial need for service (as reflected by support from shippers or receivers on the line or other evidence of an immediate and significant commercial need); evidence of community support for continued rail service; evidence that acquisition of freight operating rights would not interfere with current and planned transit services; and evidence that continued service is operationally feasible;</P>
                <P>(F) Identify the offeror and provide a mailing address, either business or personal, and other contact information including phone number and email address as available, for the offeror or a representative;</P>
                <P>(G) If the offeror is a legal entity, include the entity's full name, state of organization or incorporation, and a description of the ownership of the entity; and</P>
                <P>(H) If multiple parties seek to make a single offer of financial assistance, clearly identify which entity or individual will assume the common carrier obligation if the offer is successful, and clearly describe how the parties will allocate responsibility for financing the subsidy or purchase of the line and, if purchased, the operation of the line.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Class exemption proceedings</E>—(i) <E T="03">Expression of intent to file offer.</E> Persons with a potential interest in providing financial assistance must, no later than 10 days after the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, submit to the carrier and the Board a formal expression of their intent to file an offer of financial assistance, indicating the type of financial assistance they wish to provide (i.e., subsidy or purchase) and demonstrating that they are preliminarily financially responsible as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. Such submissions are subject to the filing requirements of § 1152.25(d)(1) through (d)(3). Submission of a formal expression of intent under this subsection will automatically stay the effective date of the notice of exemption under the class exemption for 40 days (normally, this will be 10 days beyond the date stated in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication).</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Service and filing.</E> An offeror must serve its offer of assistance on the carrier that instituted the exempt filing as well as all other parties to the proceeding. The offer must be filed concurrently with the Chief, Section of Administration, Office of Proceedings, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423-0001.<PRTPAGE P="206"/>
                </P>

                <P>(A) An offer may be filed and served at any time after the filing of the notice of exemption. Once a notice of exemption is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> however, the Board must be notified that an offer has previously been submitted.</P>

                <P>(B) An offer, or notification of a previously filed offer, must be filed and served no later than 30 days after the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. This filing and service is subject to the requirements of 49 CFR 1152.25(d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(4).</P>
                <P>(C) If, after a <E T="03">bona fide</E> request, applicant has failed to provide a potential offeror promptly with the information required under paragraph (a) of this section and if that information is not contained in the notice of exemption, the Board will entertain petitions to toll the 30-day period for submitting offers of financial assistance under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Petitions must be filed with the Board within 25 days after publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> (as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section). Petitions should include copies of the prior written request for information or an accurate outline of the specific information that was orally requested. Replies to these petitions must be filed within 30 days after publication. These petitions and replies must be filed on or before their actual due date under 49 CFR 1152.25(d)(4). The Board will issue a decision on petitions to toll the offer period within 35 days after publication.</P>
                <P>(D) Upon receipt of a formal expression of intent to file an offer under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the rail carrier applicant may advise the Board and the potential offeror that additional time is needed to develop the information required under paragraph (a) of this section. Applicant shall expressly indicate the amount of time it considers necessary (not to exceed 60 days) to develop and submit the required information to the potential offeror. For the duration of the time period so indicated by the applicant, the 30-day period for submitting offers of financial assistance under paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall be tolled without formal Board action.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Contents of offer.</E> The offeror shall set forth its offer in detail. The offer must meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Access to documents.</E> Upon receipt by the carrier of a written comment under § 1152.25, or satisfaction of the preliminary financial responsibility requirement under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section or upon receipt by the carrier of an offer of financial assistance, whichever occurs earlier, the carrier must make available to that party or offeror the records, accounts, appraisals, working papers, and other documents used in preparing Exhibit 1 (§ 1152.36) or, if an exemption proceeding, those documents that would have been used in preparing Exhibit 1 had an abandonment or discontinuance application been filed, or other records, reports, and data in the possession of the carrier seeking the exemption that provide comparable data. These documents shall be made available during regular business hours at a time and place mutually agreeable to the parties.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Review of offers</E>—(1) <E T="03">Abandonment and discontinuance applications.</E> The Board will review each offer submitted to determine if a financially responsible person has offered assistance. If that criterion is met, the Board will issue a decision postponing the effective date of the authorization for abandonment or discontinuance. This decision will be issued within 15 days of the service of the decision granting the application (or within 5 days after the offer is filed if the time for filing has been tolled under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(C) of this section, or within 5 days after expiration of the 120 day (4 month) period described in 49 U.S.C. 10904, if that occurs first). Under the delegation of authority at § 1011.7(a), the Director of the Office of Proceedings will make the initial determination whether offers of financial assistance satisfy the standards of 49 U.S.C. 10904(d) for purposes of instituting negotiations. Appeals of initial decisions determining whether offers of financial assistance satisfy the standards of 49 U.S.C. 10904(d) for purposes of instituting negotiations will be acted upon by the entire Board pursuant to 49 CFR 1011.2(a)(7).<PRTPAGE P="207"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Exemption proceedings.</E> The Board will review each offer submitted to determine if a financially responsible person has offered assistance. If that criterion is met, the Board will postpone the effective date either of the decision granting a petition for individual exemption or the notice of exemption under the class exemption and partially revoke the exemption or (in the case of a class exemption) the notice of exemption to the extent it applies to 49 U.S.C. 10904. The decision to postpone and partially revoke will be issued within 15 days of the service date of a decision granting a petition for exemption, or within 35 days of the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section (or within 5 days after the offer is filed if the time for filing has been tolled under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(C) or (c)(2)(ii) (C) or (D) of this section). Under the delegation of authority at section 1011.7(a), the Director of the Office of Proceedings will make the initial determination whether offers of financial assistance satisfy the standards of 49 U.S.C. 10904(d) for purposes of partial revocation and institution of negotiations. Appeals of initial decisions determining whether offers of financial assistance satisfy the standards of 49 U.S.C. 10904(d) for purposes of partial revocation and institution of negotiations will be acted upon by the entire Board pursuant to 49 CFR 1011.2(a)(7).</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Agreement on financial assistance.</E> (1) If the carrier and a person offering financial assistance enter into a subsidy agreement designed to provide for continued rail service, the Board will postpone the effective date of the abandonment or discontinuance. If a decision granting a petition for individual exemption, or a notice of exemption, has been issued, the Board will postpone the effective date of the decision or notice of exemption. The postponement will be for as long as the subsidy agreement is in effect.</P>
                <P>(2) If the carrier and a person offering to purchase a line enter into a purchase agreement which will result in continued rail service, the Board will approve the transaction and dismiss the application for abandonment or discontinuance, or the petition for exemption or notice of exemption. Board approval is not required under 49 U.S.C. 10901, 10902, or 11323 for the parties to consummate the transaction or for the purchaser to institute service and operate as a railroad subject to 49 U.S.C. 10501(a).</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Failure to reach agreement on financial assistance.</E> (1) If the carrier and a financially responsible person fail to agree on the amount or terms of subsidy or purchase, either party may request the Board to establish the conditions and amount of compensation. This request must be filed with the Board within 30 days after the offer is made and served concurrently by overnight mail on all parties to the proceeding. The request must be accompanied by the appropriate fee, codified at 49 CFR 1002.2(f)(26). Replies will be due 5 days later.</P>
                <P>(2) If no agreement is reached within 30 days after the offer of purchase or subsidy is made, and no request is made to the Board to set the conditions and amount of compensation under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the Board will serve a decision vacating the prior decision, which postponed the effective date of the decision granting the application, the decision granting the exemption, or the notice of exemption and, which, if applicable, partially revoked either the decision granting the exemption or (in the case of a class exemption) the notice of exemption. The Board will issue the decision to vacate within 10 days of the due date for requesting the Board to set the conditions and amount of compensation, and the Board will make the decision to vacate effective on its date of service.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Request to establish conditions and compensation for financial assistance.</E> (1) If the Board is requested to establish conditions and compensation for financial assistance under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the Board will issue a decision within 30 days after the request is due.</P>

                <P>(2) If the applicant receives multiple offers of financial assistance, requests to establish conditions and compensation will not be permitted before the applicant selects the offeror with whom it wishes to transact business. (See paragraph (l)(1) of this section.)<PRTPAGE P="208"/>
                </P>
                <P>(3) A party requesting the Board to establish conditions and compensation for financial assistance must, within the time period set forth in paragraph (h)(4) of this section, provide its case in chief, including reasons why its estimates are correct and the other negotiating party's estimates are incorrect, points of agreement and points of disagreement between the negotiating parties, and evidence substantiating these allegations. The offeror has the burden of proof as to all issues in dispute.</P>
                <P>(4) The offeror must submit all evidence and information supporting the terms it seeks within 30 days after the offer is made. The carrier's reply to this evidence and support for the terms it seeks are due within 35 days after the offer is made. No rebuttal evidence will be permitted and evidence and information submitted after these dates will be rejected.</P>
                <P>(5) If requested, the Board will determine the amount and terms of subsidy based on the avoidable cost of providing continued rail transportation, plus a reasonable return on the value of the line. Under 49 U.S.C. 10904(f)(4)(B), no subsidy arrangement approved under section 10904 shall remain in effect for more than one year unless mutually agreed by the parties.</P>
                <P>(6) If requested, the Board will determine the price and other terms of sale. The Board will not set a price below the fair market value of the line (including, unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties, all facilities on the line or portion necessary to provide effective transportation services). Fair market value equals constitutional minimum value which is the greater of the net liquidation value of the line or the going concern value of the line. The constitutional minimum value is computed without regard to labor protection costs.</P>
                <P>(7) Within 10 days of the service date of the Board's decision, the offeror must accept or reject the Board's terms and conditions with a written notification to the Board and all parties to the proceeding. If the offeror accepts the terms and conditions set by the Board, the Board's decision is binding on both parties. If the offeror withdraws its offer or does not accept the terms and conditions set by the Board with a timely written notification, the Board will serve, within 20 days after the service date of the Board decision setting the terms and conditions, a decision vacating the prior decision, which postponed the effective date of either the decision granting the application or exemption or the notice of exemption, and which, if applicable, partially revoked the exemption or (in the case of a class exemption) the notice of exemption (unless other offers are being considered under paragraph (l) of this section). The decision to vacate will be effective on its date of service.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Substitution of purchasers and disposition after sale.</E> (1) Prior to the consummation of a purchase under this section, an offeror may substitute its corporate affiliate as the purchaser under an agreement, provided the Board has determined either:</P>
                <P>(i) The original offeror has guaranteed the financial responsibility of its affiliate; or</P>
                <P>(ii) The affiliate has demonstrated financial responsibility in its own right.</P>
                <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(3) of this section, a purchaser under this section may not:</P>
                <P>(i) Transfer the line or discontinue service over the line prior to the end of the second year after consummation of the original sale under these provisions; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Transfer the line, except to the carrier from whom the line was purchased, prior to the end of the fifth year after consummation.</P>
                <P>(3) Paragraph (i)(2) of this section does not preclude a purchaser under this section from transferring the line to a corporate affiliate following the consummation of the original sale. Prior Board approval of the affiliate's acquisition and operation, however, is required under 49 U.S.C. 10901, 10902, or 11323. A corporate affiliate acquiring a line under this section is prohibited from discontinuing service over the line or transferring the line to a party that is not a corporate affiliate during the time periods prescribed in paragraph (i)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Discontinuance of subsidy.</E> A subsidizer may discontinue a subsidy <PRTPAGE P="209"/>under this section by giving 60 days notice of the discontinuance to the applicant and all other parties to the proceeding. Unless another financially responsible party enters into a subsidy agreement as beneficial to the carrier as the discontinued subsidy agreement in a situation where the 1-year time limit of 49 U.S.C. 10904(f)(4)(B) has not yet run, the carrier may by filing a request with the Board and serving the request on all parties to the abandonment or exemption proceeding obtain a decision vacating the decision postponing the effective date of either the decision granting the application, or petition for individual exemption, or the notice of exemption. The Board will issue a decision to vacate within 10 days after the filing and service of the request. This decision to vacate will be effective on its service date.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Default on agreement.</E> If any party defaults on its obligations under a financial assistance agreement, any other party to the agreement may promptly inform the Board of that default. Upon notification, the Board will take appropriate action.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Multiple offers of financial assistance.</E> (1) If an applicant receives more than one offer to purchase or subsidize the line from offerors found to be financially responsible, the applicant must select the offeror from those with whom it wishes to transact business. In abandonment and discontinuance application and petition for exemption proceedings within 25 days after service of the decision granting the application or petition for exemption, and in class exemption proceedings within 45 days after the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the railroad must:</P>
                <P>(i) File a written notification of its selection with the Board; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Serve a copy of the notification on all parties to the proceeding.</P>
                <P>(2)(i) <E T="03">Abandonment and discontinuance applications and petitions for exemption.</E> If the applicant has received multiple offers of financial assistance from persons found to be financially responsible and has selected the offeror with whom it wishes to transact business, the negotiating parties shall complete the sale or subsidy agreement or request the Board to establish the conditions and amount of compensation within 40 days after the service date of the decision granting the application or petition for exemption. A request to the Board to set terms and conditions must be served concurrently on all parties to the proceeding. If no agreement on subsidy or sale is reached within the 40-day period and the Board has not been requested to establish the conditions and amount of compensation, any other financially responsible offeror may request the Board to establish the conditions and amount of compensation. This request must be filed at the Board within 50 days of the service date of the decision granting the application or petition for exemption and served concurrently on all parties to the proceeding. If no other request is filed, the Board will issue a decision authorizing abandonment or discontinuance within 60 days of the service date of the decision granting the application or petition for exemption. This decision will be effective on the date of service.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Class exemption proceedings.</E> If the carrier seeking the exemption has received multiple offers of financial assistance from persons found to be financially responsible and has selected the offeror with whom it wishes to transact business, the negotiating parties shall complete the sale or subsidy agreement or request the Board to establish the conditions and amount of compensation within 60 days after the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. A request to the Board to set terms and conditions must be served concurrently on all parties to the proceeding. If no agreement on subsidy or sale is reached within the 60-day period and the Board has not been requested to establish the conditions and amount of compensation, any other financially responsible offeror may request the Board to establish the conditions and amount of compensation. This request must be filed at the Board within 70 days of the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section and served concurrently on all parties to the proceeding. If no other request is filed, the Board will issue a decision vacating the decision <PRTPAGE P="210"/>postponing the effective date of the notice of exemption within 80 days of the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. The decision to vacate will be effective on the date of service.</P>
                <P>(3) If the Board has established the conditions and amount of compensation, and the original offer is withdrawn under paragraph (h)(7) of this section, any other offeror found to be financially responsible may accept the Board's decision within 20 days after the service date of the Board's decision setting terms and conditions. If the decision is accepted by another such offeror, the Board will require the applicant to accept the terms incorporated in the Board's decision.</P>
                <P>(m) <E T="03">Additional time for filing.</E> Notwithstanding the deadlines previously set forth in part 1152 for filing an offer of financial assistance, parties that can show that they would be materially prejudiced by having less than the full 4 months for filing an offer of financial assistance provided in 49 U.S.C. 10904(c) for application proceedings may seek relief under 49 CFR part 1117.</P>
                <P>(n) <E T="03">Special provisions for summary discontinuance and abandonment of lines not part of the Final System Plan.</E> (1) Board authorization is not needed for the cessation of service on a line of railroad formerly in reorganization that was not included in the Final System Plan (Plan) under the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, 45 U.S.C. 701 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> as amended by the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, if the line has been continuously subsidized since the inception of the Plan. To provide an opportunity for rail service continuation through offers of financial assistance, however, the owner of the line must give not less than 60 days' notice of a discontinuance, and beginning 120 days after discontinuance, not less than 30 days' notice of abandonment. Designated operators need only comply with the notice requirements of § 1150.11 of this title. In instances of discontinuance by a designated operator, the line owner is not obligated to operate the line. Notice is to be sent by the line owner to the Board, the governor and transportation agencies and the government of each political subdivision of each state in which such rail properties are located and to each shipper who has used the rail service during the previous 12 months. The Board will generally apply the OFA procedures in this section (49 CFR 1152.27) for class exemptions to summary abandonment and discontinuance notices (except that the Board will not postpone the effective date of a summary discontinuance). For example, notice of summary abandonment or discontinuance will be published by the Board in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> within 20 days of filing. Paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. Expressions of intent to file an offer must be filed no later than 10 days after the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication. Paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. An offer must be filed within 30 days of the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication. Paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. The Board will review offers to determine if a financially responsible person has offered assistance. If this criterion is met, the Board will postpone the effective date of the summary abandonment (but not the discontinuance) within 35 days of the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication. Paragraph (e)(2) of this section. If the carrier and financially responsible person fail to agree on the amount or terms of subsidy or purchase, either party may request the Board to establish the conditions and amount of the compensation. This request must be filed within 30 days after the offer of purchase or subsidy is made, and the Board will issue a decision within 30 days after the request is due. Paragraphs (g)(1) and (h)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) Where a designated operator is being used, it shall be paid a reasonable management fee. If the parties cannot agree on this fee, it shall be four and one-half percent of the total annual revenues attributable to the branch.</P>

                <P>(a)(1) If the Board finds that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or permit abandonment or discontinuance, the Board will determine if the involved rail <PRTPAGE P="211"/>properties are appropriate for use for other public purposes.</P>
                <P>(2) A request for a public use condition under 49 U.S.C. 10905 must be in writing and set forth:</P>
                <P>(i) The condition sought;</P>
                <P>(ii) The public importance of the condition;</P>
                <P>(iii) The period of time for which the condition would be effective (up to the statutory maximum of 180 days); and</P>
                <P>(iv) Justification for the imposition of the time period. A copy of the request shall be mailed to the applicant.</P>

                <P>(3) For applications filed under part 1152, subpart C, a request for a public use condition must be filed not more than 45 days after the application is filed. A decision on the public use request will be issued by the Board or the Director of the Office of Proceedings prior to the effective date of the abandonment. For abandonment exemptions under part 1152, subpart F or exemptions granted on the basis of an individual petition for exemption filed under 49 U.S.C. 10502, a request for a public use condition must be filed not more than 20 days from the date of publication of the notice of exemption in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> in the case of class exemptions under subpart F of this part, or not more than 20 days from the date of publication of notice of the filing of the petition for individual exemption in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

                <P>(b) If the Board finds that the rail properties are appropriate for use for other public purposes, the railroad may dispose of the rail properties only under the conditions described in the Board's decision. The conditions imposed by the Board may include a prohibition against the disposal of the rail assets for a period of not more than 180 days from the effective date of the decision authorizing the abandonment or discontinuance, unless the properties have first been offered, on reasonable terms, for sale for public purposes. This period will run concurrently with any other postponements. Jurisdiction to impose such conditions expires after 180 days from the effective date of the decision authorizing the abandonment or discontinuance.</P>

                <P>(a) If any state, political subdivision, or qualified private organization is interested in acquiring or using a right-of-way of a rail line proposed to be abandoned for interim trail use and rail banking pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1247(d), it must file a comment or otherwise include a request in its filing (in a regulated abandonment proceeding) or a petition (in an exemption proceeding) indicating that it would like to do so. The comment/request or petition must include:</P>

                <P>(3) An acknowledgment that interim trail use is subject to the sponsor's continuing to meet its responsibilities described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and subject to possible future reconstruction and reactivation of the right-of-way for rail service.

                  <P>In order to establish interim trail use and rail banking under 16 U.S.C. 1247(d) and 49 CFR 1152.29 with respect to the right-of-way owned by ________ (Railroad) and operated by ________ (Railroad), ________ (Interim Trail Sponsor) is willing to assume full responsibility for: (1) Managing the right-of-way, (2) any legal liability arising out of the transfer or use of the right-of-way (unless the sponsor is immune from liability, in which case it need only indemnify the railroad against any potential liability), and (3) the payment of any and all taxes that may be levied or assessed against the right of way. The property, known as ________ (Name of Branch Line), extends from railroad milepost <PRTPAGE P="212"/>________ near ________ (Station Name), to railroad milepost ______, near ________ (Station name), a distance of ______ miles in [County(ies), (State(s)]. The right-of-way is part of a line of railroad proposed for abandonment in Docket No. STB AB ________ (Sub-No. ________). A map of the property depicting the right-of-way is attached.</P>
                  <P>________ (Interim Trail Sponsor) acknowledges that use of the right-of-way is subject to the sponsor's continuing to meet its responsibilities described above and subject to possible future reconstruction and reactivation of the right-of-way for rail service. A copy of this statement is being served on the railroad(s) on the same date it is being served on the Board.</P>
                </EXTRACT>
                
                <P>(b)(1) In abandonment application proceedings under 49 U.S.C. 10903, interim trail use statements are due within the 45-day protest and comment period following the date the abandonment application is filed. See § 1152.25(c). The applicant carrier's response notifying the Board whether and with whom it intends to negotiate a trail use agreement is due within 15 days after the close of the protest and comment period (i.e., 60 days after the abandonment application is filed).</P>
                <P>(i) In every proceeding where a Trails Act request is made, the Board will determine whether the Trails Act is applicable.</P>
                <P>(ii) If the Trails Act is not applicable because of failure to comply with § 1152.29(a), or is applicable but the carrier either does not intend to negotiate an agreement, or does not timely notify the Board of its intention to negotiate, a decision on the merits will be issued and no Certificate of Interim Trail Use or Abandonment (CITU) will be issued. If the carrier is willing to negotiate an agreement, and the public convenience and necessity permit abandonment, the Board will issue a CITU.</P>

                <P>(2) In exemption proceedings, a petition containing an interim trail use statement is due within 10 days after the date the notice of exemption is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> in the case of a class exemption and within 20 days after publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of the notice of filing of a petition for exemption in the case of a petition for exemption. When an interim trail use comment(s) or petition(s) is filed in an exemption proceeding, the railroad's reply to the Board (indicating whether and with whom it intends to negotiate an agreement) is due within 10 days after the date a petition requesting interim trail use is filed.</P>
                <P>(3) Late-filed trail use statements must be supported by a statement showing good cause for late filing.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Regular abandonment proceedings.</E> (1) If continued rail service does not occur pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 10904 and Sec. 1152.27, and a railroad agrees to negotiate an interim trail use/rail banking agreement, then the Board will issue a CITU to the railroad and to the interim trail sponsor for that portion of the right-of-way as to which both parties are willing to negotiate. The CITU will: Permit the railroad to discontinue service, cancel any applicable tariffs, and salvage track and material consistent with interim trail use and rail banking, as long as it is consistent with any other Board order, 30 days after the date the CITU is issued; and permit the railroad to fully abandon the line if no trail use agreement is reached 180 days after the CITU is issued, subject to appropriate conditions, including labor protection and environmental matters.</P>

                <P>(2) The CITU will indicate that any interim trail use is subject to future restoration of rail service and to the sponsor's continuing to meet its responsibilities described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The CITU will also provide that, if an interim trail use agreement is reached (and thus interim trail use established), the parties shall file the notice described in paragraph (h) of this section. Additionally, the CITU will provide that if the sponsor intends to terminate interim trail use on all or any portion of the right-of-way covered by the interim trail use agreement, it must send the Board a copy of the CITU and request that it be vacated on a specified date. If a party requests that the CITU be vacated for only a portion of the right-of-way, the Board will issue an appropriate replacement CITU covering the remaining portion of the right-of-way subject to the interim trail use agreement. The Board will reopen the abandonment proceeding, vacate the CITU, and issue <PRTPAGE P="213"/>a decision permitting immediate abandonment for the involved portion of the right-of-way. Copies of the decision will be sent to:</P>
                <P>(i) The abandonment applicant;</P>
                <P>(ii) The owner of the right-of-way; and</P>
                <P>(iii) The current trail sponsor.</P>
                <P>(3) If an application to construct and operate a rail line over the right-of-way is authorized under 49 U.S.C. 10901 and 49 CFR part 1150, or exempted under 49 U.S.C. 10502, then the CITU will be vacated accordingly.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Exempt abandonment proceedings.</E> (1) If continued rail service does not occur under 49 U.S.C. 10904 and 1152.27 and a railroad agrees to negotiate an interim trail use/rail banking agreement, then the Board will issue a Notice of Interim Trail Use or Abandonment (NITU) to the railroad and to the interim trail sponsor for the portion of the right-of-way as to which both parties are willing to negotiate. The NITU will: Permit the railroad to discontinue service, cancel any applicable tariffs, and salvage track and materials, consistent with interim trail use and rail banking, as long as it is consistent with any other Board order, 30 days after the date the NITU is issued; and permit the railroad to fully abandon the line if no agreement is reached 180 days after the NITU is issued, subject to appropriate conditions, including labor protection and environmental matters.</P>
                <P>(2) The NITU will indicate that interim trail use is subject to future restoration of rail service and to the sponsor's continuing to meet its responsibilities described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The NITU will also provide that, if an interim trail use agreement is reached (and thus interim trail use established), the parties shall file the notice described in paragraph (h) of this section. Additionally, the NITU will provide that if the sponsor intends to terminate interim trail use on all or any portion of the right-of-way covered by the interim trail use agreement, it must send the Board a copy of the NITU and request that it be vacated on a specific date. If a party requests that the NITU be vacated for only a portion of the right-of-way, the Board will issue an appropriate replacement NITU covering the remaining portion of the right-of-way subject to the interim trail use agreement. The Board will reopen the exemption proceeding, vacate the NITU, and issue a decision reinstating the exemption for that portion of the right-of-way. Copies of the decision will be sent to:</P>
                <P>(i) The abandonment exemption applicant;</P>
                <P>(ii) The owner of the right-of-way; and</P>
                <P>(iii) The current trail sponsor.</P>
                <P>(3) If an application to construct and operate a rail line over the right-of-way is authorized under 49 U.S.C. 10901 and 49 CFR part 1150, or exempted under 49 U.S.C. 10502, then the NITU will be vacated accordingly.</P>
                <P>(e)(1) Where late-filed trail use statements are accepted, the Director (or designee) will telephone the railroad to determine whether abandonment has been consummated and, if not, whether the railroad is willing to negotiate an interim trail use agreement. The railroad shall confirm, in writing, its response, within 5 days. If abandonment has been consummated, the trail use request will be dismissed. If abandonment has not been consummated but the railroad refuses to negotiate, then trail use will be denied. If abandonment has not been consummated and the railroad is willing to negotiate, the abandonment proceeding will be reopened, the abandonment decision granting an application, petition for exemption or notice of exemption will be vacated, and an appropriate CITU or NITU will be issued. The effective date of the CITU or NITU will be the same date as the vacated decision or notice.</P>

                <P>(2) A railroad that receives authority from the Board to abandon a line (in a regulated abandonment proceeding under 49 U.S.C. 10903, or by individual or class exemption issued under 49 U.S.C. 10502) shall file a notice of consummation with the Board to signify that it has exercised the authority granted and fully abandoned the line (e.g., discontinued operations, salvaged the track, canceled tariffs, and intends that the property be removed from the interstate rail network). The notice shall provide the name of the STB proceeding and its docket number, a brief description of the line, and a statement <PRTPAGE P="214"/>that the railroad has consummated, or fully exercised, the abandonment authority on a certain date. The notice shall be filed within 1 year of the service date of the decision permitting the abandonment (assuming that the railroad intends to consummate the abandonment). Notices will be deemed conclusive on the point of consummation if there are no legal or regulatory barriers to consummation (such as outstanding conditions, including Trails Act conditions). If, after 1 year from the date of service of a decision permitting abandonment, consummation has not been effected by the railroad's filing of a notice of consummation, and there are no legal or regulatory barriers to consummation, the authority to abandon will automatically expire. In that event, a new proceeding would have to be instituted if the railroad wants to abandon the line. Copies of the railroad's notice of consummation shall be filed with the Chief, Section of Administration, Office of Proceedings. In addition, the notice of consummation shall be sent to the State Public Service Commission (or equivalent agency) of every state through which the line passes. If, however, any legal or regulatory barrier to consummation exists at the end of the 1-year time period, the notice of consummation must be filed not later than 60 days after satisfaction, expiration or removal of the legal or regulatory barrier. For good cause shown, a railroad may file a request for an extension of time to file a notice so long as it does so sufficiently in advance of the expiration of the deadline for notifying the Board of consummation to allow for timely processing.</P>
                <P>(f)(1) When a trail user intends to terminate trail use and another person intends to become a trail user by assuming financial responsibility for the right-of-way, then the existing and future trail users shall file, jointly:</P>
                <P>(i) A copy of the extant CITU or NITU; and</P>
                <P>(ii) A Statement of Willingness to Assume Financial Responsibility by the new trail user.</P>
                <P>(iii) An acknowledgement that interim trail use is subject to possible future reconstruction and reactivation of the right-of-way for rail service.</P>
                <P>(2) The parties shall indicate the date on which responsibility for the right-of-way is to transfer to the new trail user. The Board will reopen the abandonment or exemption proceeding, vacate the existing NITU or CITU; and issue an appropriate replacement NITU or CITU to the new trail user.</P>
                <P>(g) In proceedings where a timely trail use statement is filed, but due to either the railroad's indication of its unwillingness to negotiate interim trail use agreement, or its failure to timely notify the Board of its willingness to negotiate, a decision authorizing abandonment or an exemption notice or decision is issued instead of a CITU or NITU, and subsequently the railroad and trail use proponent nevertheless determine to negotiate an interim trail use agreement under the Trails Act, then the railroad and trail use proponent must file a joint pleading requesting that an appropriate CITU or NITU be issued. If the abandonment has not been consummated, the Board will reopen the proceeding, vacate the outstanding decision or notice (or portion thereof), and issue an appropriate CITU or NITU that will permit the parties to negotiate for a period agreed to by the parties in their joint filing, but not to exceed 180 days, at the end of which, the CITU or NITU will convert into a decision or notice permitting abandonment.</P>

                <P>(h) When the parties negotiating for rail banking/interim trail use reach an agreement, the trail sponsor and railroad shall jointly notify the Board within 10 days that the agreement has been reached. The notice shall include a map depicting, and an accurate description of, the involved right-of-way or portion thereof (including mileposts) that is subject to the parties' interim trail use agreement and a certification that the interim trail use agreement includes provisions requiring the sponsor to fulfill the responsibilities described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Additionally, if the interim trail use agreement establishes interim trail use over less of the right-of-way than is covered by the CITU or NITU, the notice shall also include a request that the Board vacate the CITU or NITU and issue a replacement CITU/NITU for only the portion of the right-<PRTPAGE P="215"/>of-way covered by the interim trail use agreement. The Board will reopen the abandonment proceeding, vacate the CITU or NITU, issue an appropriate replacement CITU or NITU for only the portion of the right-of-way covered by the interim trail use agreement, and issue a decision permitting immediate abandonment of the portion of the right-of-way not subject to the interim trail use agreement. Copies of the decision will be sent to:</P>
                <P>(1) The rail carrier that sought abandonment authorization;</P>
                <P>(2) The owner of the right-of-way; and</P>
                <P>(3) The current trail sponsor.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Contents of subpart.</E> (1) 49 U.S.C. 10904 directs the Board to determine the extent to which the avoidable costs of providing rail service plus a reasonable return on the value of the line exceed the revenues attributable to the line. This subpart contains the methodology for such determinations and the standards necessary for application of those terms in the context of a particular proceeding. Such data will be used in reaching the Board's findings on the merits of an abandonment or discontinuance proceeding and in making the necessary financial assistance determinations.</P>
                <P>(2) This subpart also sets forth a method by which the carrier may establish its Forecast Year estimates and Estimated Subsidy Payment to be included in its application (§ 1152.22(d) of this part). Furthermore, an offeror of financial assistance may use this method to formulate a subsidy offer and/or Proposed Subsidy Payment under 49 U.S.C. 10904 and § 1152.27 of subpart C of this part.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Data collection.</E> The owning or operating carrier shall establish a system to collect at branch level the data necessary to compute the base year data and the final subsidy payment. The collection and compilation of such data shall be in accordance with the Branch Line Accounting System (49 CFR part 1201, subpart B).</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Final payment of financial assistance.</E> (1) When a financial assistance agreement to subsidize is concluded, the final payment will be adjusted to reflect the actual revenues derived, avoidable costs incurred, and value of the properties used in the subsidy year.</P>
                <P>(2) Where an adjustment results in an increase in the Estimated Subsidy Payment upon which the financial assistance agreement is based, the amount of such increase is limited to 15 percent of the estimated payment. However, if the railroad notifies the subsidizer that the estimate will be exceeded by more than 15 percent in one of the Financial Status Reports (§ 1152.37) issued during the first 10 months of the subsidy year or the increase results from an expense preapproved by the subsidizer, the adjusted amount shall be included in the final payment.</P>

                <P>The revenue attributable to the rail properties is the total of the revenues assigned to the branch in accordance with this section, plus any subsidy payments that would cease upon discontinuance of service on the branch, for the subsidy year.

                <P>(2) Originates or terminates on the branch and is handled off the branch on the system but not on another carrier; and</P>

                <P>(3) Originates or terminates on the branch and is handled on another carrier. All traffic that is received or forwarded through interchange at a point on the branch, including ferry operations, shall be considered as originating or terminating on the branch. <PRTPAGE P="216"/>The revenues of all other bridge or overhead traffic that will not be retained by the carrier shall be attributed to the branch on the ratio of miles moved on the branch to miles moved on the system, provided, however, that the parties may agree on a mutually acceptable usage charge for bridge traffic in lieu of the mileage apportionment.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Calculation of avoidable costs.</SUBJECT>
                <P>This section defines: Which cost elements are eligible for inclusion in the calculation of avoidable costs; the conditions under which certain cost elements become eligible for inclusion; and the basis of apportioning those cost elements which are not assigned to the branch on an actual expense basis. The avoidable costs of providing freight service on a branch shall be the total of the costs assigned to the branch in accordance with this section. The avoidable costs of providing freight service on a branch shall be just and reasonable, and shall not exceed those necessary for an honest and efficient operation. Those expenses apportioned under this section shall be derived from the latest Form R-1 Annual Report for Class I railroads filed with the Board prior to the conclusion of the subsidy year, and company records for all non-Class I railroads, and assigned to the branch according to the procedures set forth in § 1152.33 of these regulations. When the term “Actual” is specified as the basis for assigning an expense, it shall mean that the only costs which can be assigned to the account are those costs which are incurred solely as a result of the continuation of rail freight service on the branch. The accounts in the following charts, which list only the “freight-only” account numbers, shall include the portion of common expenses that have been apportioned to freight service.</P>

                <P>The system total of the repair and maintenance accounts, all accounts designated XX-XX-42, and depreciation shall be divided into time-related costs and mileage-related costs on the basis of 50 percent time and 50 percent mileage for repairs, and 60 percent time and 40 percent mileage for depreciation. <PRTPAGE P="228"/>Freight car costs shall not include depreciation as determined in Account No. 62-22-00. Freight car depreciation shall be calculated in the manner set forth in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section. The system total receipts and payments for the hire of time-mileage cars, and the basic data used in the development of the car-day and car-mile factors, shall be taken from the carrier's latest Form R-1 and company records. The specific steps to complete the calculation are as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) The total system car days by car type shall be calculated by:</P>
                <P>(i) Averaging the carrier's freight car ownership at the beginning and end of the year (Form R-1, schedule 710, columns (b) and (k);</P>
                <P>(ii) Multiplying the average by the standard active number of car days (346) as developed in ICC Docket No. 31358;</P>
                <P>(iii) Subtracting car days on foreign lines (source: Company records); and</P>

                <P>(iv) Adding the foreign car days on home line (source: Company records). This procedure shall be followed for each car type specified in Ex Parte No. 334, <E T="03">supra.</E>
                </P>

                <P>(2) The total railroad car miles shall be calculated by adding the loaded car miles for the railroad owned and leased cars (R-1, Schedule 755) to empty car miles for the railroad owned or leased cars (R-1, Schedule 755). The total car miles, loaded and empty, shall be calculated for each car type specified in Ex Parte No. 334, <E T="03">supra.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(3) The cost per car day shall be calculated for each type of time-mileage car by adding 50 percent of total freight car repair costs for each type (Form R-1, schedule 415, column (b)), and 60 percent of the depreciation shall be developed as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) The current value for each type of car shall be calculated by first arriving at the current cost per car using the most recent purchase of this type by the railroad indexed to the midpoint of the year or a price quote from the manufacturer. This unit price shall be applied to the average number of this type of car owned by the carrier during the year. The current value developed for each car type is then multiplied by the composite depreciation rate for that type of car as shown in the latest annual report filed with the Board or company records.</P>
                <P>(ii) Add 100 percent of the return on investment. Return on investment shall be determined by multiplying the current value of each type of car, developed in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, by 1 minus the ratio of accumulated depreciation to the total original cost investment. This will determine the net current value for each type of car. The net current value for each type of car shall then be multiplied by the nominal rate of return calculated in § 1152.34(d) to obtain nominal return on investment for each type of car. The total return on investment shall then be calculated by deducting the projected holding gain (loss) for the forecast and/or subsidy year from the nominal return on investment for each type of car. In any instance where the holding gain is not specifically determined for freight cars, the Gross Domestic Product deflator calculated by the U.S. Department of Commerce shall be used. The total return on investment for each type of car shall then be divided by total car-days for each car-type developed in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(iii) To the amounts for repairs and depreciation, add the time portion of the railroad's payment for hire of time-mileage freight cars (Form R-1, schedule 414, column (g)), and subtract the time portion of the railroad's receipts for hire of time mileage freight cars (Form R-1, schedule 414, column (d)). The total of these costs is divided by the total car days for each type developed in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(4) The cost per mile shall be calculated for each type of time-mileage car as follows. First, add:</P>
                <P>(i) 50 percent of the total freight train car repair cost for each car type (Form R-1, schedule 415, column (b));</P>
                <P>(ii) 40 percent of the total depreciation costs for each car type developed in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section; and</P>

                <P>(iii) The mileage portion of the carrier's payments for the hire of time-mileage freight cars (Form R-1, schedule 414, column (f)).
                </P>

                <FP>Second, subtract the mileage portion of the carrier's receipts for hire of time-<PRTPAGE P="229"/>mileage freight cars (Form R-1, schedule 414, column (c)). Finally, divide the result by the total car-miles for each car-type developed in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.</FP>
                <P>(5) The costs per car day and per car mile developed in paragraphs (g) (3) and (4) of this section shall be applied to the total car days and total car miles for each car type accumulated on the line segment for all traffic originated and/or terminated on the segment plus those freight cars that bridge the line segment which are attributed to time-mileage freight train cars. The on-segment costs for freight cars rented on a straight mileage basis shall be the railroad's total payments for mileage cars (Form R-1, schedule 414, column (e)) for each car type divided by the total miles on which the charges were based.</P>
                <P>(6) For Class II and III railroads, the on-segment costs for time-mileage and straight mileage freight cars shall be calculated in the same manner prescribed for Class I railroads, using the latest data available.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Return on investment—locomotive</E> (<E T="03">line</E>). The return on investment shall be calculated for each type of classification of locomotive that is actually used to provide service to the line segment. The return for the locomotive(s) used shall be calculated in accordance with the following procedure:</P>
                <P>(1) The current replacement cost for each type of locomotive used to serve the line segment shall be based on the most recent purchase of that particular type and size locomotive by the carrier, indexed to the midpoint of the forecast and/or subsidy year, or on an amount quoted by the manufacturer. The amount must be substantiated. This unit cost shall be multiplied by 1 minus the ratio of total accumulated depreciation to original total cost of that type of equipment owned by applicant-carrier, as shown by company records.</P>
                <P>(2) The current nominal cost of capital shall be used in the calculation of return on investment for locomotives and shall be calculated as provided in § 1152.34(d).</P>
                <P>(3) The return on investment for each category or type of locomotive shall be the nominal return less the holding gain (loss). The nominal return is calculated by multiplying the replacement cost determined in paragraph (h)(1) of this section by the nominal rate of return determined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. The holding gain (loss) shall be the gain (loss) projected to occur during the forecast and/or subsidy year. In any instance where the holding gain is not specifically determined for locomotives, the Gross Domestic Product deflator calculated by the U.S. Department of Commerce shall be used.</P>
                <P>(4) The return on investment for each type of locomotive shall be assigned to the line segment on a ratio of the locomotive unit hours on the segment to average locomotive unit hours per unit for each type of locomotive in the system. This ratio will be developed as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) The carrier shall keep and maintain records of the number of hours that each type of locomotive incurred in serving the segment during the subsidy period.</P>
                <P>(ii) The railroad shall develop the system average locomotive unit hours per unit for each of the following types of locomotives; yard diesel; yard-other; road diesel; and road-other.</P>
                <P>(iii) The ratio applied to the return on investment is calculated by dividing the hours that each type or class of locomotive is used to serve the segment, as developed in paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, by the system average locomotive unit hours per unit for the applicable type developed in paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section.</P>
                <P>(5) The cost assigned to the segment for each type of locomotive shall be calculated by multiplying the annual return on investment developed in paragraph (h)(3) of this section by the ratio(s) developed in paragraph (h)(4) of this section.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Revenue taxes.</E> The amount of revenue taxes shall be computed based on the amounts directly paid in those states that subject the railroad to a revenue tax.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Property taxes</E> (<E T="03">Line</E>). (1) The assigned costs under this subsection shall be the net systemwide property tax savings resulting from the abandonment, calculated as set out below, if <PRTPAGE P="230"/>the applicant-carrier intends subsequently to sell or otherwise dispose of the abandoned properties. If the applicant-carrier expresses an intent to dispose of the properties, it will be presumed that the properties will ultimately be sold or otherwise disposed of after abandonment. Protestants may rebut this presumption by showing that it would be financially beneficial to retain ownership of the property for investment purposes.</P>
                <P>(2) In states where a true <E T="03">ad valorem</E> tax is levied on real property (such as track, land, buildings, and other facilities), applicant must affirm that the ad valorem method applies and must substantiate the amount of property taxes levied against the property on the line segment.</P>
                <P>(3) In states where the <E T="03">ad valorem</E> method is not employed, applicant must describe the applicable property tax methodology if it is claiming the local property tax as an avoidable cost of operations. Additionally, it must substantiate with evidence and computations the actual statewide tax savings attributable to the abandonment.</P>
                <P>(4) Any property tax properly substantiated under paragraphs (j)(2) or (3) of this section shall be presumed to represent systemwide savings to the carrier. Protestants may rebut this presumption by presenting evidence:</P>
                <P>(i) That property taxes in those states where the carrier operates that are not involved in the abandonment will increase significantly because of reassessments attributable to the abandonment; or</P>
                <P>(ii) That a significantly higher property tax will be levied against a retained portion of the abandoned property. If applicant does not refute protestant's evidence, it may claim avoidable property taxes only if, and to the extent, it proves systemwide property tax savings.</P>
                <P>(5) In states where real property taxes are assessed and levied against the owner of the property but the tax on rolling stock is assessed to the railroad operating the service on the basis of a formula of a statewide valuation of property, the tax on rolling stock attributable to each line segment shall be determined as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) Using ratio of the cost of equipment (as used in the formula) to the total of all property costs (as used in formula);</P>
                <P>(ii) Apply that ratio to the total state assessment to determine the portion of the assessment attributable to rolling stock;</P>
                <P>(iii) Allocate the rolling stock assessment thus determined to each line segment on the basis of car and locomotive unit miles on the segment to total car and locomotive unit miles in the state; and</P>
                <P>(iv) Apply the appropriate tax rate or rates to the allocated assessment thus determined.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Administrative costs.</E> The costs assigned under this account shall be the actual costs directly attributable to the administration of the subsidy program or at the option of the carrier, one percent of the total annual revenues attributed to the branch shall be allowable to cover all costs of administering the subsidy program. Either method may be used, but not both.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Casualty reserve account.</E> The costs assigned under this account shall be any payments mutually agreed to by the person offering the subsidy and the railroad for the purpose of holding the subsidizer harmless from any liability under those accounts that are used to record any costs incurred by the railroad as a result of an accident.</P>
                <P>(m) <E T="03">Rehabilitation.</E> (1) For abandonment purposes the applicant carrier shall project the amounts necessary to permit efficient operations over the line segment. The carrier shall indicate the level of FRA class safety standard to be attained with the amount of expenditure. See 49 CFR part 213. Applicant, in making its projection of rehabilitation costs, shall give consideration to:</P>
                <P>(i) The cost to attain the lowest operationally feasible track level;</P>
                <P>(ii) The cost to attain the rehabilitation level resulting in the lowest operating and rehabilitation expenditures; or</P>
                <P>(iii) The cost to attain the rehabilitation level resulting in the lowest loss, or highest profit, from operations.</P>

                <P>(2) For subsidy purposes rehabilitation costs shall not be included unless:<PRTPAGE P="231"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) The track fails to meet minimum Federal Railroad Administrative class 1 safety standards (49 CFR part 213), in which case the railroad will furnish, with the abandonment application, a detailed estimate of the costs to rehabilitate the track to the minimum level; or</P>
                <P>(ii) The potential subsidizer requests a level of service which requires expenditures for rehabilitation.</P>
                <P>(n) <E T="03">Off-branch costs.</E> The off-branch costs developed in this section shall be separated between “off-branch costs other than return on freight cars” and “return on value-freight cars”. The off-branch costs shall be developed in the following manner:</P>
                <P>(1) Terminal costs, line-haul costs, interchange costs, and modified terminal costs shall be considered as the off-branch avoidable costs of providing service over the remainder of the railroad's system. These costs shall be computed by applying the variable unit costs to the service units attributed to the branch line's traffic for the time periods specified in § 1152.22(d) of this part.</P>
                <P>(2) The procedure for determining the off-branch costs shall be based upon the URCS cost formula. This formula shall be applied to the latest Annual Report Form R-1 filed by the railroad, with two exceptions. First, the amount used in the formula for freight car depreciation shall be calculated using the procedure discussed in paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section applied to the average total car fleet of the railroad. Second, the return on investment in freight cars shall be computed using the procedure set forth in paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section. In addition, the application of URCS shall include the use of the nominal cost of capital for all return on investment determinations.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">The Class I Procedure:</E> A Class I railroad shall calculate its off-branch costs using the Class I procedure as set forth below in this paragraph.</P>
                <P>(i) The unit costs developed by applying URCS in the manner specified in paragraph (n)(2) of this section shall be applied to the service characteristics of each movement of traffic that is attributed to the branch line. This application shall result in the total off-branch cost associated with this traffic for normal terminal handlings, line-haul mileage, and interchange events.</P>
                <P>(ii) The modified terminal cost per carload shall be calculated separately for each type of freight car and applied to each car that is attributed to the branch line. The modified terminal cost shall consist of clerical costs, two days of freight car cost, and an inter-intra train switching cost (locomotive engine minute cost only). The clerical cost and inter-intra train switching cost shall be calculated from unit costs developed within the individual URCS application.</P>
                <P>(A) The unit costs for the clerical cost per carload calculation are located in URCS Worktable E1, Part 1: Line 106, columns 1, 2, and 3; line 107, column 1; line 108, column 1; line 109, column 1; and line 110, column 1.</P>
                <P>(B) The inter-intra train switching cost shall be calculated by multiplying the total switch engine minute cost from URCS Worktable E1, Part 1, line 111, columns 1, 2, and 3 by the total minutes specified in the next sentence.

                <P>(ii) All accounts designated xx-31-67 shall be assigned to the branch in accordance with the following procedure. The dollar amounts used in the determination of locomotive fuel costs shall be based on data contained in the most recent publication issued by the General Managers Association (GMA) relating to the rental of locomotives. The total number of locomotive unit hours incurred by the locomotive(s) shall then be categorized according to the applicable GMA horsepower classification group. The fuel cost is derived from the Repairs and Supplies Expenses element of the locomotive rental rates published by the GMA. The fuel cost per locomotive unit hour shall be determined for each GMA horsepower classification group by multiplying the latest GMA fuel cost percentage by the Repairs and Supplies Expense per hour included in each group. The fuel cost update ratio is determined by using the indices for fuel from the Association of American Railroad's (AAR's) Railroad Cost Recovery Index (RCR). The indices shall be taken from the district to which the railroad is assigned by the Board. The index for the current period is divided by the index of the period representative of the GMA publication to develop the fuel update ratio. The fuel cost per locomotive unit hour developed for each GMA horsepower group shall be multiplied by the fuel update ratio to determine the fuel cost per locomotive hour for each horsepower group. The updated fuel cost per locomotive unit hour for each applicable GMA group shall be multiplied by the number of locomotive unit hours incurred in serving the branch by locomotives of that GMA horsepower classification group. The total cost developed under this procedure for each horsepower classification shall be the locomotive fuel cost assignable to the branch line.</P>

                <P>Return on investment for road property shall be computed according to the procedures set forth in this section.</P>
                <P>(a)-(b) [Reserved]</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Return on investment—road properties.</E> Return on investment—road properties shall be computed according to the following procedures:</P>
                <P>(1) The investment base to which the nominal return element shall apply shall be the sum of:</P>
                <P>(i) The allowable working capital computed at 15 days on-branch cash avoidable costs (on branch avoidable costs less depreciation).</P>
                <P>(ii) The amount of current income tax benefits resulting from abandonment of the line which would have been applicable to the period of the subsidy agreement. (Conversely, if the railroad would incur an income tax liability from abandonment, the liability should be deducted from the investment base.) This information is to be furnished by the railroad and subject to audit by the person offering the subsidy.</P>
                <P>(iii) The net liquidation value for the highest and best use for non-rail purposes of the rail properties on the line to be subsidized which are used and required for performance of the services requested by the persons offering the subsidy. This value shall be determined by computing the current appraised market value of such properties for other than rail transportation purposes, less all costs of dismantling and disposition of improvements necessary to make the remaining properties available for their highest and best use and complying with applicable zoning, land use, and environmental regulations. If rehabilitation has been performed along the line during a subsidy year and rehabilitation expenses have been paid by the subsidizer under 49 CFR 1152.32(m)(2), the investment base shall exclude the increment to the net liquidation value of the line caused by the rehabilitation project. For these purposes:</P>

                <P>(A) In calculating the net liquidation values for the Forecast Year, no asset on the line shall be excluded from the determination of net liquidation value because it contributes negatively to that value, i.e., the removal costs exceed the market value after removal. All such assets shall be included in the net liquidation value determination if the carrier is required by law to remove them or if the carrier intends to remove them, even if it is not required <PRTPAGE P="239"/>to do so. The parties shall fully support and explain the exclusion for net liquidation purposes of all assets having a negative salvage value.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) In calculating the net liquidation value of railroad properties for the purpose of determining the operating subsidy under an offer of financial assistance, any asset with a negative salvage value shall be included at a value of zero (0).</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Determination of the net liquidation value of rail properties for the purpose of purchasing the rail properties under an offer of financial assistance shall include any asset with a negative salvage value at a value of zero (0).</P>
                <P>(B) All adjustments to the appraised fair market value of right-of-way land, including a downward adjustment to reflect an imputed real estate Board or selling expense, shall be fully supported and explained.</P>
                <P>(C) Parties shall fully support and explain their use of unadjusted across-the-fence (ATF) values as a surrogate for the value of railroad right-of-way land, given that the physical and economic characteristics (grading and elevation) usually are different from those of surrounding parcels. All adjustments to ATF values to arrive at the right-of-way values shall also be supported and explained.</P>
                <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Reasonable return.</E> A rail carrier shall furnish to the Board, and to any financially responsible person considering making an offer of a rail service continuation payment, a substantiated statement showing its current nominal cost of capital. The railroad's nominal cost of capital shall be the current before tax cost of capital, weighted to the capital structure, and adjusted for the effects of the combined statutory Federal and state income tax rates. This rate of return expressed as a percent, shall be calculated as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) The railroad shall determine its permanent capital structure ratio for debt and equity capital such that the two numbers total 100 percent. This capital structure will be the actual capital structure of the railroad. If this calculation is not possible or also not representative because the railroad is part of a conglomerate, the debt-equity ratio from the Board's latest Determination of Adequate Railroad Revenues will be used. However, if the debt-equity ratio for the railroad industry is used then the industry average equity and debt rate from the Board's latest revenue adequacy finding must also be used in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) The current nominal cost of debt shall be determined by taking the average of all debt instruments (including bonds, equipment trust certificates, financial lease arrangements, et cetera) issued by the carrier in the most recent 12-month period. The debt cost calculated by this procedure is a before-tax rate and is not adjusted for inflation or income taxes.</P>
                <P>(3) The current nominal after tax cost of equity shall be an amount equal to that which a prudent investor would expect to earn through investment in the market place. The current after tax nominal cost of equity is divided by 1 minus the combined statutory Federal and state income tax rates. This will develop the nominal cost of equity on a before tax basis.</P>
                <P>(4) The current nominal before-tax cost of debt is multiplied by the current percentage of debt to total capital to obtain a weighted before-tax nominal cost of current debt.</P>
                <P>(5) The current nominal before-tax cost of equity is multiplied by the current percentage of equity to total capital to obtain a weighted nominal before-tax cost of current equity.</P>
                <P>(6) The results of paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section are added together to determine the current nominal cost of capital.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Holding gain</E> (<E T="03">loss</E>)-<E T="03">road properties.</E> The railroad shall determine the holding gain (loss) that is projected to occur during the forecast and/or subsidy year. In any instance where the holding gain is not specifically determined for road properties, the Gross Domestic Product deflator calculated by the U.S. Department of Commerce shall be used.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Exempt abandonments and discontinuances of service and trackage rights.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a)(1) A proposed abandonment or discontinuance of service or trackage rights over a railroad line is exempt from the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 10903 if the criteria in this section are satisfied.</P>
                <P>(2) Whenever the Board determines a proposed abandonment to be exempt from the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 10903, whether under this section or on the basis of the merits of an individual petition, the provisions of §§ 1152.27, 1152.28, and 1152.29 as they relate to exemption proceedings shall be applicable.</P>
                <P>(b) An abandonment or discontinuance of service or trackage rights is exempt if the carrier certifies that no local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years and any overhead traffic on the line can be rerouted over other lines and that no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or a state or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Board or any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period. The complaint must allege (if pending), or prove (if decided) that the carrier has imposed an illegal embargo or other unlawful impediment to service.</P>
                <P>(c) The Board has found:</P>
                <P>(1) That its prior review and approval of these abandonments and discontinuances is not necessary to carry out the rail transportation policy of 49 U.S.C. 10101; and</P>

                <P>(2) That these transactions are of limited scope and continued regulation is unnecessary to protect shippers from abuse of market power. 49 U.S.C. 10502. A notice must be filed to use this class exemption. The procedures are set out in § 1152.50(d). This class exemption does not relieve a carrier of its statutory obligation to protect the interests <PRTPAGE P="242"/>of employees. 49 U.S.C. 10502(g) and 10903(b)(2). This also does not preclude a carrier from seeking an exemption of a specific abandonment or discontinuance that does not fall within this class.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice of exemption.</E> (1) At least 10 days prior to filing a notice of exemption with the Board, the railroad seeking the exemption must notify in writing:</P>
                <P>(i) The Public Service Commission (or equivalent agency) in the state(s) where the line will be abandoned or the service or trackage rights discontinued;</P>
                <P>(ii) Department of Defense (Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, Transportation Engineering Agency, Railroads for National Defense Program);</P>
                <P>(iii) The National Park Service, Recreation Resources Assistance Division; and</P>
                <P>(iv) The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Chief of the Forest Service.</P>
                <P>The notice shall name the railroad, describe the line involved, including United States Postal Service ZIP Codes, indicate that the exemption procedure is being used, and include the approximate date that the notice of exemption will be filed with the Board. The notice shall include the following statement “Based on information in our possession, the line (does) (does not) contain federally granted rights-of-way. Any documentation in the railroad's possession will be made available promptly to those requesting it.”</P>
                <P>(2) The railroad must file a verified notice using its appropriate abandonment docket number and subnumber (followed by the letter “X”) with the Board at least 50 days before the abandonment or discontinuance is to be consummated. The notice shall include the proposed consummation date, the certification required in § 1152.50(b), the information required in §§ 1152.22(a) (1) through (4), (7) and (8), and (e)(4), the level of labor protection, and a certificate that the notice requirements of §§ 1152.50(d)(1) and 1105.11 have been complied with.</P>

                <P>(3) The Board, through the Director of the Office of Proceedings, shall publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> within 20 days after the filing of the notice of exemption. The notice shall include a statement to alert the public that following any abandonment of rail service and salvage of the line, the line may be suitable for other public use, including interim trail use. Petitions to stay the effective date of the notice on other than environmental or historic preservation grounds must be filed within 10 days of the publication. Petitions to stay the effective date of the notice on environmental or historic preservation grounds may be filed at any time but must be filed sufficiently in advance of the effective date in order to allow the Board to consider and act on the petition before the notice becomes effective. Petitions for reconsideration, comments regarding environmental, energy and historic preservation matters, and requests for public use conditions under 49 U.S.C. 10905 and 49 CFR 1152.28(a)(2) must be filed within 20 days after publication. Requests for a trail use condition under 16 U.S.C. 1247(d) and 49 CFR 1152.29 must be filed within 10 days after publication. The exemption will be effective 30 days after publication, unless stayed. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the use of the exemption is void <E T="03">ab initio</E> and the Board shall summarily reject the exemption notice.</P>
                <P>(4) In out-of-service rail line exemption proceedings under 49 CFR 1152.50, the Board, on its own motion, will stay the effective date of individual notices of exemption when an informed decision on pending environmental and historic preservation issues cannot be made prior to the date that the exemption authority would otherwise become effective.</P>
                <P>(5) A notice or decision to all parties will be issued if use of the exemption is made subject to environmental, energy, historic preservation, public use and/or interim trail use and rail banking conditions.</P>

                <P>(6) To address whether the standard labor protective conditions set forth in <E T="03">Oregon Short Line R. Co.—Abandonment—Goshen,</E> 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979), adequately protect affected employees, a petition for partial revocation of the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10502(d) must be filed.<PRTPAGE P="243"/>

                <P>A petition to require a solid waste rail transfer facility in existence on October 16, 2008, to apply for a land-use-exemption permit, submitted by the Governor of the state or that Governor's designee, shall contain the following information:</P>
                <P>(a) The Governor's name.</P>
                <P>(b) The state's name and the name of any agency filing on behalf of the Governor.</P>
                <P>(c) The full address of the solid waste rail transfer facility, or, if not available, the city, state, and United States Postal Service ZIP code.</P>
                <P>(d) The name of the rail carrier that owns or operates the facility or the rail carrier on whose behalf the facility is operated.</P>

                <P>(e) A good-faith certification that the facility qualified as a solid waste rail transfer facility as defined in 49 U.S.C. <PRTPAGE P="246"/>10908(e)(1)(H) and 49 CFR 1155.2, on October 16, 2008.</P>
                <P>(f) Relief sought (that the rail carrier that owns or operates the facility be required to apply for a land-use-exemption permit).</P>

                <P>(a) When the petition is filed with the Board, the petitioner shall serve concurrently, by first class mail, a copy of the petition on the rail carrier that owns or operates the solid waste rail transfer facility and on the facility if the address is different than the rail carrier's address. A copy of the certificate of service shall be filed with the Board at the same time.</P>
                <P>(b) Upon the filing of a petition, the Board will review the petition and determine whether it conforms to all applicable regulations. If the petition is substantially incomplete or is otherwise defective, the Board will reject the petition without prejudice for stated reasons by order within 15 days from the date of filing of the petition.</P>
                <P>(c) If the petition is rejected, a revised petition may be resubmitted, and the Board will determine whether the resubmitted application conforms with all prescribed regulations.</P>

The petitioner will have an opportunity to file a rebuttal.</P>
                <P>(b) A facility can acknowledge that it was a solid waste rail transfer facility on October 16, 2008, but no longer operates as such and therefore is not required to seek a land-use-exemption permit. To do so, a facility must file with the Board a certification stating that it:</P>
                <P>(1) No longer operates as a solid waste transfer facility;</P>
                <P>(2) Understands that by certifying that it no longer operates as a solid waste transfer facility, it no longer qualifies as a facility in existence on October 16, 2008 for purposes of the Clean Railroad Act and these regulations; and</P>
                <P>(3) Understands that if it seeks a land-use-exemption permit in the future, it would be required to do so as a proposed facility.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Filing and service of replies.</E> (1) Any reply shall be filed with the Board (the Chief, Section of Administration, Office of Proceedings, Surface Transportation Board, 395 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20423) within 20 days of the filing with the Board of the petition.</P>
                <P>(2) A copy of the reply shall be served on petitioner or its representative at the time of filing with the Board. Each filing shall contain a certificate of service.</P>
                <P>(3) Any rebuttal to a reply shall be filed and served by petitioner no later than 30 days after the filing of the petition.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Board determination with respect to a Governor's petition.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The Board shall accept the Governor's complete petition on a finding that the facility qualified as a solid waste rail transfer facility, as defined in 49 U.S.C. 10908(e)(1)(H) and 49 CFR 1155.2, on October 16, 2008. If the Board finds that the facility currently does not qualify for or require a land-use-exemption permit, any future use of the facility as a solid waste rail transfer facility would require an application for a land-use-exemption permit as a proposed facility and/or the proper state permits. In a decision granting the Governor's petition, the Board shall require that the rail carrier that owns or operates the facility, or the operator of the facility, file a land-use-exemption-permit application within 120 days of the service date of the decision.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The regulations in this subpart set out the information to be filed and the procedures to be followed in control, merger, acquisition, lease, trackage rights, and any other consolidation transaction involving more than one railroad that is initiated under 49 U.S.C. 11323. Section 1180.2 separates these transactions into four types: <E T="03">Major, significant, minor,</E> and <E T="03">exempt.</E> The informational requirements for these types of transactions differ. Before an application is filed, the designation of type of transaction may be clarified or certain of the information required may be waived upon petition to the Board. This procedure is explained in § 1180.4. The required contents of an application are set out in §§ 1180.6 (general information supporting the transaction), 1180.7 (competitive and market information), 1180.8 (operational information), 1180.9 (financial data), 1180.10 (service assurance plans), and 1180.11 (transnational and other informational requirements). A <E T="03">major</E> application must contain the information required in §§ 1180.6(a), 1180.6(b), 1180.7(a), 1180.7(b), 1180.8(a), 1180.8(b), 1180.9, 1180.10, and 1180.11. A <E T="03">significant</E> application must contain the information required in §§ 1180.6(a), 1180.6(c), 1180.7(a), 1180.7(c), and 1180.8(b). A <E T="03">minor</E> application must contain the information required in §§ 1180.6(a) and 1180.8(c). Procedures (including time limits, filing requirements, participation requirements, and other matters) are contained in § 1180.4. All applications must comply with the Board's Rules of General Applicability, 49 CFR parts 1100 through 1129, unless otherwise specified. These regulations may be cited as the Railroad Consolidation Procedures.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Waiver.</E> We will waive application of the regulations contained in this subpart for a consolidation involving The Kansas City Southern Railway Company and another Class I railroad and instead will apply the regulations <PRTPAGE P="260"/>in this subpart A in effect before July 11, 2001 and contained in the 49 CFR, Parts 1000 to 1199, edition revised as of October 1, 2000, unless we are shown why such a waiver should not be allowed. Interested parties must file any objections to this waiver within 10 days after the applicants' prefiling notification (see 49 CFR § 1180.4(b)(1)).</P>

                <SUBJECT>General policy statement for merger or control of at least two Class I railroads.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> To meet the needs of the public and the national defense, the Surface Transportation Board (Board) seeks to ensure balanced and sustainable competition in the railroad industry. The Board recognizes that the railroad industry (including Class II and III carriers) is a network of competing and complementary components, which in turn is part of a broader transportation infrastructure that also embraces the nation's highways, waterways, ports, and airports. The Board welcomes private-sector initiatives that enhance the capabilities and the competitiveness of this transportation infrastructure. Although mergers of Class I railroads may advance our nation's economic growth and competitiveness through the provision of more efficient and responsive transportation, the Board does not favor consolidations that reduce the transportation alternatives available to shippers unless there are substantial and demonstrable public benefits to the transaction that cannot otherwise be achieved. Such public benefits include improved service, enhanced competition, and greater economic efficiency. The Board also will look with disfavor on consolidations under which the controlling entity does not assume full responsibility for carrying out the controlled carrier's common carrier obligation to provide adequate service upon reasonable demand.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Consolidation criteria.</E> The Board's consideration of the merger or control of at least two Class I railroads is governed by the public interest criteria prescribed in 49 U.S.C. 11324 and the rail transportation policy set forth in 49 U.S.C. 10101. In determining the public interest, the Board must consider the various goals of effective competition, carrier safety and efficiency, adequate service for shippers, environmental safeguards, and fair working conditions for employees. The Board must ensure that any approved transaction would promote a competitive, efficient, and reliable national rail system.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Public interest considerations.</E> The Board believes that mergers serve the public interest only when substantial and demonstrable gains in important public benefits—such as improved service and safety, enhanced competition, and greater economic efficiency—outweigh any anticompetitive effects, potential service disruptions, or other merger-related harms. Although further consolidation of the few remaining Class I carriers could result in efficiency gains and improved service, the Board believes additional consolidation in the industry is also likely to result in a number of anticompetitive effects, such as loss of geographic competition, that are increasingly difficult to remedy directly or proportionately. Additional consolidations could also result in service disruptions during the system integration period. Accordingly, to assure a balance in favor of the public interest, merger applications should include provisions for enhanced competition, and, where both carriers are financially sound, the Board is prepared to use its conditioning authority as necessary under 49 U.S.C. 11324(c) to preserve and/or enhance competition. In addition, when evaluating the public interest, the Board will consider whether the benefits claimed by applicants could be realized by means other than the proposed consolidation. The Board believes that other private-sector initiatives, such as joint marketing agreements and interline partnerships, can produce many of the efficiencies of a merger while risking less potential harm to the public.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Potential benefits.</E> By eliminating transaction cost barriers between firms, increasing the productivity of investment, and enabling carriers to lower costs through economies of scale, scope, and density, mergers can generate important public benefits such as improved service, more competition, and greater economic efficiency. A <PRTPAGE P="261"/>merger can strengthen a carrier's finances and operations. To the extent that a merged carrier continues to operate in a competitive environment, its new efficiencies would be shared with shippers and consumers. Both the public and the consolidated carrier can benefit if the carrier is able to increase its marketing opportunities and provide better service. A merger transaction can also improve existing competition or provide new competitive opportunities, and such enhanced competition will be given substantial weight in our analysis. Applicants shall make a good faith effort to calculate the net public benefits their proposed merger would generate, and the Board will carefully evaluate such evidence. To ensure that applicants have no incentive to exaggerate these projected benefits to the public, the Board expects applicants to propose additional measures that the Board might take if the anticipated public benefits fail to materialize in a timely manner. In this regard, the Board recognizes, however, that applicants require the flexibility to adapt to changing marketplace or other circumstances and that it is inevitable that an approved merger may not necessarily be implemented in precisely the manner anticipated in the application. Applicants will be held accountable, however, if they do not act reasonably in light of changing circumstances to achieve promised merger benefits.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Potential harm.</E> The Board recognizes that consolidation can impose costs as well as benefits. It can reduce competition both directly and indirectly in particular markets, including product markets and geographic markets. Consolidation can also threaten essential services and the reliability of the rail network. In analyzing these impacts we must consider, but are not limited by, the policies embodied in the antitrust laws.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Reduction of competition.</E> Although in specific markets railroads operate in a highly competitive environment with vigorous intermodal competition from motor and water carriers, mergers can deprive shippers of effective options. Intramodal competition can be reduced when two carriers serving the same origins or destinations merge. Competition arising from shippers' build-out, transloading, plant siting, and production shifting choices can be eliminated or reduced when two railroads serving overlapping areas merge. Competition in product and geographic markets can also be eliminated or reduced by mergers, including end-to-end mergers. Any railroad combination entails a risk that the merged carrier would acquire and exploit increased market power. Applicants shall propose remedies to mitigate and offset competitive harms. Applicants shall also explain how they would at a minimum preserve competitive and market options such as those involving the use of major existing gateways, build-outs or build-ins, and the opportunity to enter into contracts for one segment of a movement as a means of gaining the right separately to pursue rate relief for the remainder of the movement.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Harm to essential services.</E> The Board must ensure that essential freight, passenger, and commuter rail services are preserved wherever feasible. An existing service is essential if there is sufficient public need for the service and adequate alternative transportation is not available. The Board's focus is on the ability of the nation's transportation infrastructure to continue to provide and support essential services. Mergers should strengthen, not undermine, the ability of the rail network to advance the nation's economic growth and competitiveness, both domestically and internationally. The Board will consider whether projected shifts in traffic patterns could undermine the ability of the various network links (including Class II and Class III rail carriers and ports) to sustain essential services.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Transitional service problems.</E> Experience shows that significant service problems can arise during the transitional period when merging firms integrate their operations, even after applicants take extraordinary steps to avoid those disruptions. Because service disruptions harm the public, the Board, in its determination of the public interest, will weigh the likelihood of transitional service problems. In addition, under paragraph (h) of this section, the Board will require applicants to provide a detailed service assurance plan. <PRTPAGE P="262"/>Applicants also should explain how they would cooperate with other carriers in overcoming serious service disruptions on their lines during the transitional period and afterwards.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Enhanced competition.</E> To offset harms that would not otherwise be mitigated, applicants should explain how the transaction and conditions they propose would enhance competition.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Conditions.</E> The Board has broad authority under 49 U.S.C. 11324(c) to impose conditions on consolidations, including requiring divestiture of parallel tracks or the granting of trackage rights and access to other facilities. The Board will condition the approval of Class I combinations to mitigate or offset harm to the public interest, and will carefully consider conditions proposed by applicants in this regard. The Board may impose conditions that are operationally feasible and produce net public benefits, but will not impose conditions that undermine or defeat beneficial transactions by creating unreasonable operating, financial, or other problems for the combined carrier. Conditions are generally not appropriate to compensate parties who may be disadvantaged by increased competition. The Board anticipates that mergers of Class I carriers would likely create some anticompetitive effects that would be difficult to mitigate through appropriate conditions, and that transitional service disruptions might temporarily negate any shipper benefits. To offset such potential harms and improve the prospect that their proposal would be found to be in the public interest, applicants should propose conditions that would not simply preserve but also enhance competition. The Board seeks to enhance competition in ways that strengthen and sustain the rail network as a whole (including that portion of the network operated by Class II and III carriers).</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Employee protection.</E> The Board is required to provide a fair arrangement for the protection of the rail employees of applicants who are affected by a consolidation. The Board supports early notice and consultation between management and the various unions, leading to negotiated implementing agreements, which the Board strongly favors. Otherwise, the Board respects the sanctity of collective bargaining agreements and will look with extreme disfavor on overrides of collective bargaining agreements except to the very limited extent necessary to carry out an approved transaction. The Board will review negotiated agreements to ensure fair and equitable treatment of all affected employees. Absent a negotiated agreement, the Board will provide for protection at the level mandated by law (49 U.S.C. 11326(a)), and if unusual circumstances are shown, more stringent protection will be provided to ensure that employees have a fair and equitable arrangement.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Environment and safety.</E> (1) The National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4321 <E T="03">et seq.</E> (NEPA), requires the Board to take environmental considerations into account in railroad consolidation cases. To meet its responsibilities under NEPA and related environmental laws, the Board must consider significant potential beneficial and adverse environmental impacts in deciding whether to approve a transaction as proposed, deny the proposal, or approve it with conditions, including appropriate environmental mitigation conditions addressing concerns raised by the parties, including federal, state, and local government entities. The Board's Office of Environmental Analysis (OEA) ensures that the agency meets its responsibilities under NEPA and the implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 1105 by providing the Board with an independent environmental review of merger proposals. In preparing the necessary environmental documentation, OEA focuses on the potential environmental impacts resulting from merger-related changes in activity levels on existing rail lines and rail facilities. The Board generally will mitigate only those impacts that would result directly from an approved transaction, and will not require mitigation for existing conditions and existing railroad operations.</P>

                <P>(2) During the environmental review process, railroad applicants have negotiated agreements with affected communities, including groups of communities and other entities such as state <PRTPAGE P="263"/>and local agencies. The Board encourages voluntary agreements of this nature because they can be extremely helpful and effective in addressing specific local and regional environmental and safety concerns, including the sharing of costs associated with mitigating merger-related environmental impacts. Generally, these privately negotiated solutions between an applicant railroad and some or all of the communities along particular rail corridors or other appropriate entities are more effective, and in some cases more far-reaching, than any environmental mitigation options the Board could impose unilaterally. Therefore, when such agreements are submitted to it, the Board generally will impose these negotiated agreements as conditions to approved mergers, and these agreements generally will substitute for specific local and site-specific environmental mitigation for a community that otherwise would be imposed. Moreover, to encourage and give effect to negotiated solutions whenever possible, the opportunity to negotiate agreements will remain available throughout the oversight process to replace local and site-specific environmental mitigation imposed by the agency. The Board will require compliance with the terms of all negotiated agreements submitted to it during oversight by imposing appropriate environmental conditions to replace the local and site-specific mitigation previously imposed.</P>
                <P>(3) Applicants will be required to work with the Federal Railroad Administration, on a case-by-case basis, to formulate Safety Integration Plans (SIPs) to ensure that safe operations are maintained throughout the merger implementation process. As part of the environmental review process, applicants will be required to submit:</P>
                <P>(i) A SIP and</P>
                <P>(ii) Evidence about potentially blocked grade crossings as a result of merger-related traffic increases or operational changes.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Oversight.</E> As a condition to its approval of any major transaction, the Board will establish a formal oversight process. For at least the first 5 years following approval, applicants will be required to present evidence to the Board, on no less than an annual basis, to show that the merger conditions imposed by the Board are working as intended, that the applicants are adhering to the various representations they made on the record during the course of their merger proceeding, that no unforeseen harms have arisen that would require the Board to alter existing merger conditions or impose new ones, and that the merger benefit projections accepted by the Board are being realized in a timely fashion. Parties will be given the opportunity to comment on applicants' submissions, and applicants will be given the opportunity to reply to the parties' comments. During the oversight period, the Board will retain jurisdiction to impose any additional conditions it determines are necessary to remedy or offset adverse consequences of the underlying transaction.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Service assurance and operational monitoring.</E> (1) The quality of service is of vital importance. Accordingly, applicants must file, with their initial application and operating plan, a Service Assurance Plan identifying the precise steps they would take to ensure adequate service and to provide for improved service. This plan must include the specific information set forth at § 1180.10 on how shippers, connecting railroads (including Class II and III carriers), and ports across the new system would be affected and benefitted by the proposed consolidation. As part of this plan, applicants will be required to provide service benchmarks, describe the extent to which they have entered into any arrangements with shippers and shipper groups to compensate for service failures, and establish contingency plans that would be available to mitigate any unanticipated service disruption.</P>
                <P>(2) The Board will conduct significant post-approval operational monitoring to help ensure that service levels after a merger are reasonable and adequate.</P>

                <P>(3) The Board also will require applicants to establish problem resolution teams and specific procedures for problem resolution to ensure that any unanticipated post-merger problems related to service or any other transportation matters, including claims, are promptly addressed. These teams <PRTPAGE P="264"/>should include representatives of all appropriate employee categories. Also, the Board envisions the establishment of a Service Council made up of shippers, railroads, passenger service representatives, ports, rail labor, and other interested parties to provide an ongoing forum for the discussion of implementation issues.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Loss and damage claims handling.</E> Shippers or shortlines who have freight claims under 49 CFR part 1005 during merger implementation shall file such claims, in writing or electronically, with the merged carrier. The claimant shall provide supporting documentation regarding the effect on the claimant, and the specific damages (in a determinable amount) incurred. Pursuant to 49 CFR part 1005, the merged carrier shall acknowledge each claim within 30 days and successively number each claim. Within 120 days of carrier receipt of the claim, the merged carrier shall respond to each claim by paying, declining, or offering a compromise settlement. The Board will take notice of these claims and their disposition as a matter of oversight. During each annual oversight period, the merged carrier shall report on claims received, their type, and their disposition for each quarterly period covered by oversight. While shippers and shortlines may also contract with the applicants for specific remedies with respect to claims, final adjudication of contract issues as well as unresolved claims will remain a matter for the courts.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Service failure claims.</E> Applicants must suggest a protocol for handling claims related to failure to provide reasonable service due to merger implementation problems. Commitments to submit all such claims to arbitration will be favored.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Alternative rail service.</E> Where shippers and connecting railroads require relief from extended periods of inadequate service, the procedures at 49 CFR parts 1146 and 1147 are available for the Board to review the documented service levels and to consider shipper proposals for alternative service relief when other avenues of relief have already been explored with the merged carrier in an effort to restore adequate service.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Cumulative impacts and crossover effects.</E> Because there are so few remaining Class I carriers and the railroad industry constitutes a network of competing and complementary components, the Board cannot evaluate the merits of a major transaction in isolation. The Board must also consider the cumulative impacts and crossover effects likely to occur as rival carriers react to the proposed combination. The Board expects applicants to explain how additional Class I mergers would affect the eventual structure of the industry and the public interest. Applicants should generally discuss the likely impact of such future mergers on the anticipated public benefits of their own merger proposal. Applicants will be expected to discuss whether and how the type or extent of any conditions imposed on their proposed merger would have to be altered, or any new conditions imposed, should we approve any future consolidation(s).</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Inclusion of other carriers.</E> The Board will consider requiring inclusion of another carrier as a condition to approval only where there is no other reasonable alternative for providing essential services, the facilities fit operationally into the new system, and inclusion can be accomplished without endangering the operational or financial success of the new company.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Transnational and other informational issues.</E> (1) All applicants must submit “full system” competitive analyses and operating plans—incorporating any operations in Canada or Mexico—from which we can determine the competitive, service, employee, safety, and environmental impacts of the prospective operations within the United States, and explain how cooperation with the Federal Railroad Administration would be maintained to address potential impacts on operations within the United States of operations or events elsewhere on their systems. All applicants must further provide information concerning any restrictions or preferences under foreign or domestic law and policies that could affect their commercial decisions. Applicants must also address how any ownership restrictions might affect our public interest assessment.<PRTPAGE P="265"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) The Board will consult with relevant officials, as appropriate, to ensure that any conditions it imposes on an approved transaction are consistent with the North American Free Trade Agreement and other pertinent international agreements to which the United States is a party. In addition, the Board will cooperate with those Canadian and Mexican agencies charged with approval and oversight of a proposed transnational railroad combination.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Types of transactions.</SUBJECT>

                <P>Transactions proposed under 49 U.S.C. 11323 involving more than one common carrier by railroad are of four types: <E T="03">Major, significant, minor,</E> and <E T="03">exempt.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(a) A <E T="03">major</E> transaction is a control or merger involving two or more class I railroads.</P>
                <P>(b) A <E T="03">significant</E> transaction is a transaction not involving the control or merger of two or more class I railroads that is of regional or national transportation significance as that phrase is used in 49 U.S.C. 11325(a)(2) and (c). A transaction not involving the control or merger of two or more class I railroads is not significant if a determination can be made either:</P>
                <P>(1) That the transaction clearly will not have any anticompetitive effects, or</P>
                <P>(2) That any anticompetitive effects of the transaction will clearly be outweighed by the transaction's anticipated contribution to the public interest in meeting significant transportation needs.</P>
                <P>A transaction not involving the control or merger of two or more class I railroads is significant if neither such determination can clearly be made.</P>
                <P>(c) A <E T="03">minor</E> transaction is one which involves more than one railroad and which is not a <E T="03">major, significant,</E> or <E T="03">exempt</E> transaction.</P>
                <P>(d) A transaction is exempt if it is within one of the eight categories described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (8). The Board has found that its prior review and approval of these transactions is not necessary to carry out the rail transportation policy of 49 U.S.C. 10101; and is of limited scope or unnecessary to protect shippers from market abuse. See 49 U.S.C. 10502. A notice must be filed to use one of these class exemptions. The procedures are set out in § 1180.4(g). These class exemptions do not relieve a carrier of its statutory obligation to protect the interests of employees. See 49 U.S.C. 10502(g) and 11326. The enumeration of the following categories of transactions as exempt does not preclude a carrier from seeking an exemption of specific transactions not falling into these categories.</P>
                <P>(1) Acquisition of a line of railroad which would not constitute a major market extension where the Board has found that the public convenience and necessity permit abandonment.</P>
                <P>(2) Acquisition or continuance in control of a nonconnecting carrier or one of its lines where (i) the railroads would not connect with each other or any railroads in their corporate family, (ii) the acquisition or continuance in control is not part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect the railroads with each other or any railroad in their corporate family, and (iii) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier.</P>
                <P>(3) Transactions within a corporate family that do not result in adverse changes in service levels, significant operational changes, or a change in the competitive balance with carriers outside the corporate family.</P>

                <P>(4) Renewal of leases and any other matters where the Board has previously authorized the transaction, and only an extension in time is involved.<PRTPAGE P="266"/>
                </P>
                <P>(5) Joint projects involving the relocation of a line of railroad which does not disrupt service to shippers.</P>
                <P>(6) Reincorporation in a different State.</P>
                <P>(7) Acquisition of trackage rights and renewal of trackage rights by a rail carrier over lines owned or operated by any other rail carrier or carriers that are: (i) based on written agreements, and (ii) not filed or sought in responsive applications in rail consolidation proceedings.</P>
                <P>(8) Acquisition of temporary trackage rights by a rail carrier over lines owned or operated by any other rail carrier or carriers that are: (i) based on written agreements, (ii) not filed or sought in responsive applications in rail consolidation proceedings, (iii) for overhead operations only, and (iv) scheduled to expire on a specific date not to exceed 1 year from the effective date of the exemption. If the operations contemplated by the exemption will not be concluded within the 1-year period, the parties may, prior to expiration of the period, file a request for a renewal of the temporary rights for an additional period of up to 1 year, including the reason(s) therefor. Rail carriers acquiring temporary trackage rights need not seek authority from the Board to discontinue the trackage rights as of the expiration date specified under 49 CFR 1180.4(g)(2)(iii). All transactions under these rules will be subject to applicable statutory labor protective conditions.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicant.</E> The term <E T="03">applicant</E> means the parties initiating a transaction, but does not include a wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiary of an applicant if that subsidiary is not a rail carrier. Parties who are considered applicants, but for whom the information normally required of an applicant need <E T="03">not</E> be submitted, are:</P>
                <P>(1) In <E T="03">minor</E> trackage rights applications, the transferor and</P>
                <P>(2) In responsive applications, a primary applicant.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicant carriers.</E> The term <E T="03">applicant carriers</E> means: any applicant that is a rail carrier; any rail carrier operating in the United States, Canada, and/or Mexico in which an applicant holds a controlling interest; and all other rail carriers involved in the transaction. Because the service provided by these commonly controlled carriers can be an important competitive aspect of the transactions that we approve, applicant carriers are subject to the full range of our conditioning power. Carriers that are involved in an application only by virtue of an existing trackage rights agreement with applicants are not applicant carriers.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Major market extension.</E> A major market extension is a transaction which may significantly increase competition by extending service into a new market, expanding service in a currently served market when another carrier concurrently contracts its service to that market as part of the same transaction, or providing significantly more efficient and effective competitive service to a market presently being served. Criteria which can be used to determine if a railroad is proposing to provide a more competitive service to a currently served area include: (1) Creating a shorter route; (2) providing enhanced service capabilities (speed is not the only factor); (3) entering an interchange or market generating more than 5,000 cars per year or 5 percent of applicant's traffic; (4) filing the application as a condition of relief to a pending proceeding; and (5) permitting a carrier to become more competitive (extending its length of haul) See. <E T="03">Burlington Northern, Inc.—Control &amp; Merger—St. L.,</E> 354 I.C.C. 616, 617 (1978).</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Petition for clarification.</E> A request that the Board clarify the applicability of any part of these regulations to a particular situation or explain the type of material needed to comply with these regulations.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Petition for waiver.</E> A request that the Board either dispense with material required by the regulations, or accept material in place of that required by these regulations.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Primary application.</E> A proposal for approval filed under 49 U.S.C. 11323 which begins a new proceeding and is <PRTPAGE P="267"/>not proposed either as a condition to or as an alternative to Board approval of another pending application.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Railroad.</E> Any common carrier by railroad as defined in 49 U.S.C. 10102(5)-(6).</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Responsive applications.</E> Applications filed in response to a primary application are those seeking affirmative relief either as a condition to or in lieu of the approval of the primary application. Responsive applications include inconsistent applications, inclusion applications, and any other affirmative relief that requires an application, petition, notice, or any other filing to be submitted to the Board (such as trackage rights, purchases, constructions, operation, pooling, terminal operations, abandonments, and other types of proceedings not otherwise covered). For fees covering inconsistent applications or responsive applications not otherwise covered in the Board's fee schedule, see 49 CFR 1002.2(f) (38)-(41) and 1180.4(d)(2). The fees for all other responsive applications are set forth in 49 CFR 1002.2(f).</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Transferee.</E> The transferee is:</P>
                <P>(1) The acquiring corporation in a control proceeding,</P>
                <P>(2) The surviving corporation in a merger,</P>
                <P>(3) The resulting corporation in a consolidation,</P>
                <P>(4) The leasee in a lease,</P>
                <P>(5) The purchaser in an acquisition, and</P>
                <P>(6) The grantee of trackage rights in a trackage rights proceeding.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Transferor.</E> The transferor is:</P>
                <P>(1) The corporation acquired in a control proceeding,</P>
                <P>(2) The merging corporation in a merger,</P>
                <P>(3) All corporations to be consolidated in a consolidation,</P>
                <P>(4) The lessor in a lease,</P>
                <P>(5) The seller in an acquisition, and</P>

                <P>(6) <E T="03">Application format.</E> (i) The application shall be in the same sequence as the information is requested in these procedures, and shall be numbered to correspond to the numbering in the procedures.</P>
                <P>(ii) If any material required in the application would lend itself to being placed in an appendix, this should be done. The appendix and application shall be tabulated and cross-referenced in an index for ease in locating and referring to the information. The appendixes shall be in the same sequence as the information required by these procedures. If certain information required in the application is not applicable, provide an explanation.

The pages in each volume shall begin with 1, and be sequentially numbered.</P>
                <P>(iii) The Board's Office of Proceedings will provide informal opinions and interpretations, which are not binding on the Board, regarding the format of or information to be included in the application.</P>

The publication shall indicate the applicable time limits for processing the application. (These are the time limits of 49 U.S.C. 11325(b) for a <E T="03">major</E> transaction, 49 U.S.C. 11325(c) for a <E T="03">significant</E> transaction, and 49 U.S.C. 11325(d) for a <E T="03">minor</E> transaction.)</P>

                <P>(ii) The Board shall reject an incomplete application by serving a decision no later than 30 days after the application is filed with the Board. The decision shall explain specifically why the application was incomplete. A revised <PRTPAGE P="270"/>application may be submitted, incorporating portions of the prior application by reference.

                <P>(8) The application must present a <E T="03">prima facie</E> case. Applicants can fail to meet their burden of proof and thus not present a <E T="03">prima facie</E> case either by (i) disclosing facts that, even if construed in their most favorable light, are insufficient to support a finding that the proposal is consistent with the public interest, or by (ii) disclosing facts that affirmatively demonstrate that the proposal is not in the public interest. See <E T="03">Railroad Consolidation Procedures,</E> 363 I.C.C. 767 (1980).</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Responsive applications.</E> (1) No responsive applications shall be permitted to minor transactions.</P>
                <P>(2) An inconsistent application will be classified as a major, significant, or minor transaction as provided in § 1180.2(a) through (c). The fee for an inconsistent application will be the fee for the type of transaction involved. See 49 CFR 1002.2(f)(38) through (41). The fee for any other type of responsive application is the fee for the particular type of proceeding set forth in 49 CFR 1002.2(f).</P>
                <P>(3) Each responsive application filed and accepted for consideration will automatically be consolidated with the primary application for consideration.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Evidentiary proceeding.</E> (1) The Board may order an oral public hearing, a hearing by written submissions, or another kind of evidentiary proceeding. The determination will generally be made on the basis of the needs indicated by the written comments.</P>
                <P>(2) The evidentiary proceeding will be completed:</P>

                <P>(i) Within 1 year after the primary application is accepted for a <E T="03">major</E> transaction;</P>
                <P>(ii) Within 180 days for a <E T="03">significant</E> transaction; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Within 105 days for a <E T="03">minor</E> transaction.</P>
                <P>(3) A final decision on the primary application and on all consolidated cases will be issued:</P>

In making this estimate, applicants should identify the benefits that would arise from service improvements, enhanced competition, cost savings, and other merger-related public interest benefits, and should discuss whether the particular benefits they are relying upon could be achieved short of merger. Applicants must also identify, discuss, and, where possible, quantify the likely negative effects approval would entail, such as losses of competition, potential for service disruption, and other merger-related harms. In addition, applicants must suggest additional measures that the Board might take if it approves the application and the anticipated public benefits identified by applicants fail to materialize in a timely manner.</P>

                <P>(a) For <E T="03">major</E> and <E T="03">significant</E> transactions, applicants shall submit impact analyses (exhibit 12) describing the impacts of the proposed transaction—both adverse and beneficial—on inter-and intramodal competition with respect to freight surface transportation in the regions affected and on the provision of essential services by applicants and other carriers. An impact analysis should include underlying data, a study of the implications of those data, and a description of the resulting likely effects of the proposed transaction on the transportation alternatives that would be available to the shipping public. Each aspect of the analysis should specifically address significant impacts as they relate to the applicable statutory criteria (49 U.S.C. 11324(b) or (d)), essential services, and competition. Applicants must identify and address relevant markets and issues, and provide additional information as requested by the Board on markets and issues that warrant further study. Applicants (and any other party submitting analyses) must demonstrate both the relevance of the markets and issues analyzed and the validity of their methodology. All underlying assumptions must be clearly stated. Analyses should reflect the consolidated company's marketing plan and existing and potential competitive alternatives (inter- as well as intramodal). They can address: city pairs, interregional movements, movements through a point, or other factors; a particular commodity, group of commodities, or other commodity factor that would be significantly affected by the transaction; or other effects of the transaction (such as on a particular type of service offered).</P>
                <P>(b) For <E T="03">major</E> transactions, applicants shall submit “full system” impact analyses (incorporating any operations in Canada or Mexico) from which they must demonstrate the impacts of the transaction—both adverse and beneficial—on competition within regions of the United States and this nation as a whole (including inter- and intramodal competition, product competition, and geographic competition) and the provision of essential services (including freight, passenger, and commuter) by applicants and other network links (including Class II and Class III rail carriers and ports). Applicants' impact analyses must at least provide the following types of information:</P>
                <P>(1) The anticipated effects of the transaction on traffic patterns, market concentrations, and/or transportation alternatives available to the shipping public. Consistent with § 1180.6(b)(10), these would incorporate a detailed examination of any competition-enhancing aspects of the transaction and of the specific measures proposed by applicants to preserve existing levels of competition and essential services;</P>

                <P>(2) Actual and projected market shares of originated and terminated traffic by railroad for each major point on the combined system. Applicants may define points as individual stations or as larger areas (such as Bureau of Economic Analysis statistical areas or U.S. Department of Agriculture Crop Reporting Districts) as relevant and indicate the extent of switching access and availability of terminal belt railroads. Applicants should list points where the number of serving railroads would drop from two to one and from three to two, respectively, as a result <PRTPAGE P="277"/>of the proposed transaction (both before and after applying proposed remedies for competitive harm);</P>
                <P>(3) Actual and projected market shares of revenues and traffic volumes for major interregional or corridor flows by major commodity group. Origin/destination areas should be defined at relevant levels of aggregation for the commodity group in question. The data should be broken down by mode and (for the railroad portion) by single-line and interline routings (showing gateways used);</P>
                <P>(4) For each major commodity group, an analysis of traffic flows indicating patterns of geographic competition or product competition across different railroad systems, showing actual and projected revenues and traffic volumes;</P>
                <P>(5) Maps and other graphic displays where helpful in illustrating the analyses in this section;</P>
                <P>(6) An explicit delineation of the projected impacts of the transaction on the ability of various network links (including Class II and Class III rail carriers and ports) to participate in the competitive process and to sustain essential services; and</P>
                <P>(7) Supporting data for the analyses in this section, such as the basis for projections of changes in traffic patterns, including shipper surveys and econometric or other statistical analyses. If not made part of the application, applicants shall make these data available in a repository for inspection by other parties or otherwise supply these data on request, for example, electronically. Access to confidential information will be subject to protective order. For information drawn from publicly available published sources, detailed citations will suffice.</P>
                <P>(8) If necessary, an explanation as to how the lack of reliable and consistent data has limited applicants' ability to satisfy any of the requirements in this paragraph (b).</P>
                <P>(c) For <E T="03">significant</E> transactions, specific regulations on impact analyses are not provided so that the parties will have the greatest leeway to develop the best evidence on the impacts of each individual transaction. As a general guideline, applicants shall provide supporting data that may (but need not) include: current and projected traffic flows; data underlying sales forecasts or marketing goals; interchange data; market share analysis; and/or shipper surveys. <E T="03">It is important to note that these types of studies are neither limiting nor all-inclusive.</E> The parties must provide supporting data, but are free to choose the type(s) and format. If not made part of the application, applicants shall make these data available in a repository for inspection by other parties or otherwise supply these data on request, for example, electronically.

                <P>For <E T="03">major</E> transactions: Applicants must submit a Service Assurance Plan, which, in concert with the operating plan requirements, identifies the precise steps to be taken by applicants to ensure that projected service levels would be attainable and that key elements of the operating plan would improve service. The plan shall describe with reasonable precision how operating plan efficiencies would translate into present and future benefits for the shipping public. The plan must also describe any potential area of service degradation that might result due to operational changes and how instances of degraded service might be mitigated. Like the Operating Plan on which it is based, the Service Assurance Plan must be a full-system plan encompassing:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Integration of operations.</E> Based on the operating plan, and using appropriate benchmarks, applicants must develop a Service Assurance Plan describing how the proposed transaction would result in improved service levels and how and where service might be degraded. This description should be a precise route level review, but not a shipper-by-shipper review. Nonetheless, the plan should be sufficient for individual shippers to evaluate the projected improvements and changes, and respond to the potential areas of service degradation for their customary traffic routings. The plan should inform Class II and III railroads and other connecting railroads of the operational changes or changes in service terms that might affect their operations, including operations involving major gateways.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Coordination of freight and passenger operations.</E> If Amtrak or commuter services are operated over the lines of applicant carriers, applicants must describe definitively how they would continue to facilitate these operations so as to fulfill existing performance agreements for those services. Whether or not the passenger services are operated over lines of applicants or applicants' operations are on the lines of passenger agencies, applicants must establish operating protocols ensuring effective communications with Amtrak and/or regional rail passenger operators to minimize any potential transaction-related negative impacts.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Yard and terminal operations.</E> The operational fluidity of yards and terminals is key to the successful implementation of a transaction and effective service to shippers. Applicants must describe how the operations of principal classification yards and major terminals would be changed or revised and how these revisions would affect service to customers. As part of this analysis, applicants must furnish dwell time benchmarks for each facility described in this paragraph, and estimate what the expected dwell time would be after the revised operations are implemented. Also required will be a discussion of on-time performance for the principal yards and terminals in the same terms as required for dwell time.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Infrastructure improvements.</E> Applicants must identify potential infrastructure impediments (using volume/capacity line and terminal forecasts), formulate solutions to those impediments, and develop time frames for resolution. Applicants must also develop a capital improvement plan (to support the operating plan) for timely funding and completion of the improvements critical to transition of operations. <PRTPAGE P="281"/>They should also describe improvements related to future growth, and indicate the relationship of the improvements to service delivery.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Information technology systems.</E> Because the accurate and timely integration of applicants' information systems is vitally important to service, applicants must identify the process to be used for systems integration and training of involved personnel. This must include identification of the principal operations-related systems, operating areas affected, implementation schedules, the realtime operations data used to test the systems, and pre-implementation training requirements needed to achieve completion dates. If such systems will not be integrated and on line prior to implementation of the transaction, applicants must describe the interim systems to be used and the adequacy of those systems to ensure service delivery.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Customer service.</E> To achieve and maintain customer confidence in the transaction and to ensure the successful integration and consolidation of existing customer service functions, applicants must identify their plans for the staffing and training of personnel within or supporting the customer service centers. This discussion must include specific information on the planned steps to familiarize customers with any new processes and procedures that they may encounter in using the consolidated systems and/or changes in contact locations, telephone numbers, or communication mode.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Labor.</E> Applicants must furnish a plan for reaching necessary labor implementing agreements. Applicants must also provide evidence that sufficient qualified employees would be available at the proper locations to effect implementation.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Training.</E> Applicants must establish a plan for providing necessary training to employees involved with operations, train and engine service, operating rules, dispatching, payroll and timekeeping, field data entry, safety and hazardous material compliance, and contractor support functions (e.g., crew van service), as well as training for other employees in functions that would be affected by the acquisition.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Contingency plans for merger-related service disruptions.</E> To address potential disruptions of service that could occur, applicants must establish contingency plans. Those plans, based upon available resources and traffic flows and density, must identify potential areas of disruption and the risk of occurrence. Applicants must provide evidence that contingency plans would be in place to promptly restore adequate service levels. Applicants must also provide for the establishment of problem resolution teams and describe the specific procedures to be utilized for problem resolution.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Timetable.</E> Applicants must identify all major functional or system changes/consolidations that would occur and the time line for successful completion.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Benchmarking.</E> Specific benchmarking requirements may vary with the transaction. The minimum for benchmarking will be the 12 monthly periods immediately preceding the filing date of the notice of intent to file the application. Benchmarking is intended to provide an historic monthly baseline against which actual post-transaction levels of performance can be measured. Benchmarking data should be sufficiently detailed and encompassing to give a meaningful picture of operational performance for the newly merged system. Applicants will report in a matrix structure giving the historic monthly (benchmark) data and provide for the reporting of actual monthly data during the monitoring period. It is important that data reflect uniformly constructed measures of historic and post-transaction operations. Minimum benchmark data include:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Corridor performance benchmarking.</E> Benchmarks will consist of route level performance information including flow data for traffic moving on the applicants' systems. These data will encompass flows to and from major points. A major point could be a Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) statistical area, or it can be a railroad-created point based on an operational grouping of stations or interchanges, or it could be another similar construction. It will be necessary for applicants <PRTPAGE P="282"/>to define traffic points used to establish benchmarks for purposes of monitoring. A sufficient number of corridor flows must be reported so as to fully represent system flows, including interchanges with short lines and other Class I's, and internal traffic of the respective applicants before the transaction. In addition to identifying traffic flows by areas, they also must be identified by commodity sector (for example, merchandise, intermodal, automotive, unit coal, unit grain etc.). Data for each flow must include: traffic volume in carloads (units), miles (area to area), and elapsed time in hours. Only loaded traffic need be included.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Yard and terminal benchmarking</E>—(i) <E T="03">Terminal dwell.</E> Terminal dwell for major yards will be calculated in hours for cars handled, not including run-through and bypass trains or maintenance of way and bad order cars.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">On time originations by major yard.</E> On time originations are based on the departure of scheduled trains originating at a particular yard.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">System benchmarking.</E> (i) Cars on line.</P>
                <P>(ii) Average train velocity, by train type.</P>
                <P>(iii) Locomotive fleet size and applicable bad order ratios.</P>
                <P>(iv) Passenger train performance for commuter and intercity passenger services.</P>

Failure to file a timely comment waives further participation in the proceeding. If no comments are filed opposing the application, the published tentative grant of authority will automatically become effective at the close of the comment period.

              <P>(b) Applicants may file a reply to opposing comments, within 60 days after the date the application was published.</P>

              <P>(1) The reply may include a request for an expedited decision on the issues raised by the comments. Otherwise, the <PRTPAGE P="285"/>reply may not contain any new evidence, but shall only rebut or further explain matters previously raised.</P>
              <P>(2) The reply shall be verified, as provided in 49 CFR 1182.8(e), unless it consists strictly of legal argument.</P>
              <P>(3) Applicants' reply must be served on each commenter in such manner that it is received no later than the date it is due to be filed with the Board.</P>

              <P>(1) Dispense with further proceedings and make a final determination based on the record as developed; or</P>
              <P>(2) Issue a procedural schedule specifying the dates by which: applicants may submit additional evidence in support of the application, in response to the comment(s) in opposition; and the opposing commenter(s) may reply.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Interim approval.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) A party may request interim approval of the operation of the properties sought to be acquired through the proposed transaction, for a period of not more than 180 days pending determination of the application. This request may be included in the application or may be submitted separately after the application is filed (e.g., once a comment opposing the application has been filed). An additional filing fee is required, whether the request for interim approval is included in the application or is submitted separately at a later time. <E T="03">See</E> 49 CFR 1002.2(f)(5) for the additional filing fee.</P>
              <P>(b) A request for interim approval of the operation of the properties sought to be acquired in the application must show that failure to grant interim approval may result in destruction of or injury to those properties or substantially interfere with their future usefulness in providing adequate and continuous service to the public.</P>
              <P>(c) If a request for interim approval is submitted after the application is filed, it must be served on each person who files or has filed a comment in response to the published notice of the application. Service must be simultaneous upon those commenters who are known when the request for interim approval is submitted; otherwise, service must be within 5 days after the comment is received by applicants or their representative.</P>
              <P>(d) Because the basis for requesting interim approval is to prevent destruction of or injury to motor passenger carrier properties sought to be acquired under 49 U.S.C. 14303, the processing of such requests is intended to promote expeditious decisions regarding interim approval. The Board has no obligation to give public notice of requests for interim approval, and such requests are decided without hearing or other formal proceeding.</P>
              <P>(1) If a request for interim approval is included in the application, the Board's decision with regard to interim approval will be served in conjunction with the notice accepting the application.</P>
              <P>(2) If an application is rejected, the request for interim approval will be denied.</P>
              <P>(3) If an application is denied, after comments in opposition are submitted, any interim approval will terminate 30 days after service of the decision denying the application.</P>
              <P>(e) A petition to reconsider a grant of interim approval may be filed only by a person who has filed a comment in opposition to the application.</P>
              <P>(1) A petition to reconsider a grant of interim approval must be in writing and shall state the specific grounds upon which the commenter relies in opposing interim approval. The petition shall certify that a copy has been served on applicants' representative.</P>

              <P>(2) The petition to reconsider a grant of interim approval shall be filed with the Board, and one copy of the petition shall be served on applicants' representative(s).<PRTPAGE P="286"/>
              </P>
              <P>(f) The Board may act on a petition to reconsider a grant of interim approval either separately or in connection with the final decision on the application.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Notices of exemption.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A transaction within a motor passenger corporate family is exempt from 49 U.S.C. 14303 if it does not result in adverse changes in service levels, significant operational changes, or a change in the competitive balance with motor passenger carriers outside the corporate family. The Board has found that its prior review and approval of these transactions is not necessary to carry out the transportation policy of 49 U.S.C. 13101; regulation is not necessary to protect shippers from abuse of market power; and an exemption is in the public interest. See 49 U.S.C. 13541(a).</P>
              <P>(b) To qualify for a class exemption, a party must file a verified notice of the exempt transaction with the Board. The notice shall contain a brief summary of the proposed transaction, the name of the applicants, their business address and telephone number, and the name of counsel to whom questions would be addressed. The notice shall describe the purpose of the transaction and give the proposed consummation date for the transaction, which must be at least 7 days after the filing of the notice. The notice shall describe any contracts or agreements that have been entered into, or will be entered into, concerning the transaction, and shall indicate the impact, if any, that the transaction would have on employees.</P>

              <P>(c) The Board shall publish notice of the exemption in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> within 30 days from the filing of the verified notice of exemption. If the notice contains false or misleading information, the Board shall summarily revoke the exemption and require divestiture. Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 13541(d) may be filed at any time and will be granted upon a finding that the application of 49 U.S.C. 14303 to the person, class, or transportation is necessary to carry out the transportation policy of 49 U.S.C. 13101.</P>

              <P>A pooling application filed under 49 U.S.C. 14302 should include the following information:</P>
              <P>(a) An identification of all the carriers who are parties to the pooling agreement;</P>

              <P>(f) The competitive routing and service alternatives that would remain if the agreement is approved, to the best of applicant's knowledge;</P>
              <P>(g) If there is a lessening of such alternatives, an estimate of the public benefits that will accrue from approval, or new competition that will arise, which would offset such lessening;</P>
              <P>(h) A narrative assessment of how the pooling arrangement will affect present and future competition in the area, including a description of the projected volume of traffic, the revenues, and the commodities which will be subject to the pooling agreement;</P>
              <P>(i) Certification that rates set for traffic moving under the agreement do not violate the restrictions on collective ratemaking contained in 49 U.S.C. Subtitle IV and Board regulations;</P>
              <P>(j) A narrative statement as to the relative transportation importance of the pooling agreement as it would affect the public and the national transportation system;</P>
              <P>(k) If any known non-pooling carriers authorized to transport the subject traffic are not included in the pooling arrangement explain why, and explain whether inclusion would enhance or restrain competition;</P>

              <P>(m) Certification by applicant, or its representatives, that the representations made in the application are, to the best of applicant's knowledge and belief, true and complete.</P>

              <FP>As appendices, applicants must submit: (1) A copy of the pooling agreement; (2) a copy of the specific operating authority of each carrier which is the subject of the pooling agreement; and (3) a caption summary (for <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication) of the pooling transaction sought to be approved.</FP>

              <P>After the pooling application is received (not less than 50 days before the effective date specified in the pooling agreement), the Board will either reject it or determine initially whether the pooling agreement is of major transportation importance and whether there is a substantial likelihood that the pooling agreement will unduly restrain competition.

Where either factor is found to exist, the application will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> using the caption summary filed with the application, and a hearing will be scheduled (normally to receive written verified <PRTPAGE P="288"/>statements) to consider the issues further. In this second phase of the proceeding, the Board will consider whether the pooling agreement would be in the interest of better service to the public or of economy of operation and whether it will unduly restrain competition.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Definitions and scope of regulations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This part addresses the requirement of 49 U.S.C. 11328 authorization of the Surface Transportation Board (STB) needed for a person to hold the position of officer or director of more than one rail carrier, except where only Class III carriers are involved. STB authorization is not needed for individuals seeking to hold the positions of officers or directors only of Class III railroads. 49 U.S.C. 11328(b).</P>
              <P>(b) When a person is an officer of a Class I railroad and seeks to become an officer of another Class I railroad, an application under 49 U.S.C. 11328(a) (or petition for individual exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10502) must be filed. All other “interlocking directorates” have been exempted as a class from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11328(a), pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 10502 and former 49 U.S.C. 10505. For such interlocking directorates exempted as a class, no filing with the STB is necessary to invoke the exemption.</P>
              <P>(c) An <E T="03">interlocking directorate</E> exists whenever an individual holds the position of officer or director of one rail carrier and assumes the position of officer or director of another rail carrier. This provision applies to any person who performs duties, or any of the duties, ordinarily performed by a director, president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, general counsel, general solicitor, general attorney, comptroller, general auditor, general manager, freight traffic manager, passenger traffic manager, chief engineer, general superintendent, general land and tax agent or chief purchasing agent.</P>
              <P>(d) For purposes of this part, a <E T="03">rail carrier</E> means a person providing common carrier railroad transportation for compensation (except a street, suburban, or interurban electric railway not operating as part of the general system of rail transportation), and a corporation organized to provide such transportation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Contents of application.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each application shall state the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The full name, occupation, business address, place of residence, and post office address of the applicant.</P>
              <P>(2) A specification of every carrier of which the applicant holds stock, bonds, or notes, individually, as trustee, or otherwise; and the amount of, and accurate description of, such securities of each carrier for which the applicant seeks authority to act. (Whenever it is contemplated that the applicant will represent on the board of directors of any carrier securities other than those owned by the applicant, the application shall describe such securities, state the character of representation, the name of the beneficial owner or owners, and the general nature of the business conducted by such owner or owners.)</P>
              <P>(3) Each and every position with any carrier:</P>
              <P>(i) Which is held by the applicant at the time of the application; and</P>

              <P>(ii) Which the applicant seeks authority to hold, together with the date and manner of his or her election or appointment thereto and, if the applicant has entered upon the performance of his duties in any such position, the nature of the duties so performed and the date when he first entered upon their performance. (A decision authorizing a person to hold the position of director of a carrier will be construed as sufficient to authorize that person to serve also as chairman of its board of directors or as a member or chairman of any committee or committees of such board; and, therefore, when authority <PRTPAGE P="289"/>is sought to hold the position of director, the applicant need not request authority to serve in any of such other capacities.)</P>
              <P>(4) As to each carrier covered by the requested authorization, whether it is an operating carrier, a lessor company, or any other corporation organized for the purpose of engaging in rail transportation. (If any such carrier neither operates nor owns any railroad providing transportation that is subject to 49 U.S.C. 10501, the application shall include a copy of such carrier's charter or certificate or articles of incorporation, with amendments to date or, if already filed with the former Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) or with the STB, a reference thereto, with any intervening amendments.)</P>
              <P>(5) A full statement of pertinent facts relative to any carrier involved which does not make annual reports to the STB.</P>
              <P>(6) Full information as to the relationship—operating, financial, competitive, or otherwise—existing between the carriers covered by the requested authorization.</P>
              <P>(7) Every corporation—industrial, financial, or miscellaneous—of which the applicant is an officer or director, and the general character of the business conducted by such corporation.</P>
              <P>(8) The reasons, fully, why the granting of the authority sought will not affect adversely either public or private interests.</P>
              <P>(9) Whether or not any other application for authority has been made in behalf of the applicant and, if so, the date and docket number thereof, by whom made, and the action thereon, if any.</P>
              <P>(b) When application has been made on behalf of any person, a subsequent application by that person need not repeat any statement contained in the previous application but may incorporate the same by appropriate reference.</P>

A carrier may apply for general authority on behalf of an individual who has already received authority to act as an interlocking officer. However, a carrier may not apply for general authority for an individual who holds a position with another railroad which is not an affiliate or subsidiary of the carrier or whose properties are not used or operated by the carrier, either separately or jointly with other carriers.</P>

              <P>(a) Pursuant to approval and authority of the ICC granted under former 49 U.S.C. 11343-44 or by the STB granted under 49 U.S.C. 11323-24; or</P>
              <P>(b) Pursuant to an exemption authorized by the ICC under former 49 U.S.C. 10505 or by the STB under 49 U.S.C. 10502; or</P>
              <P>(c) Pursuant to a controlling, controlled, or common control relationship which has existed between such carriers since before June 16, 1933.</P>
