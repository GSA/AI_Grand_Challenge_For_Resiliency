      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.

        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
        There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

              Financial statements released by carriers.
              Carriers desiring to do so may prepare and publish financial statements in reports to stockholders and others, except in reports to this Board, based on generally accepted accounting principles for which there is authoritative support, provided that any variance from this Board's prescribed accounting rules contained in such statements is clearly disclosed in footnotes to the statements.

              Adoption of generally accepted accounting principles issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
              (a) Accounting Series Circulars. Following the release of a Statement of Financial Accounting Standards by the FASB, and provided that the Office of Economics, and Administration of the Board considers such standards appropriate for the Board's accounting regulations, the Office of Economics shall issue an Accounting Series Circular (ASC) requiring carriers under the Board's jurisdiction to follow the new standards in their accounts and reports filed with the Board. The Office shall also specify in the ASC the proper accounting procedures that the carriers shall follow.
              (b) Carriers' and Interested Parties' Comments on the ASC. The ASC issued by the Office of Economics, and Administration will remain effective until revoked by the Office of Economics, and Administration. After an ASC is issued, the Office of Economics, and Administration shall allow carriers and interested parties 45 days following the service date of the ASC during which the respondents may submit to the Office their comments and reasons either supporting or opposing the ASC.
              (c) Formal Adoption of the New Accounting Standards. After considering the comments submitted in response to the ASC, and based on the proposal of the Office of Economics, and Administration, the Board will decide whether or not to adopt the new accounting standards specified in the ASC by revising the Uniform Systems of Accounts, (49 CFR 1201 through 1210).
              (d) Accounting Standards Not Appropriate for Board's Use. The Office of Economics, and Administration may determine that a new FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards is not appropriate for use by carriers under the Board's jurisdiction. In such instances, the Office shall issue an ASC to advise the carriers that the new standards shall not be used in their reports filed with the Board. The carriers and interested parties shall be allowed 45 days following the ASC's service date to submit comments to the Board. The Board will then determine whether or not to revise the Uniform Systems of Accounts to conform to the new accounting standards.

                List of Instructions and Accounts
                
                  REGULATIONS PRESCRIBED
                  (i) Regulations prescribed. Carriers by railroad subject to provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act and not independently operated as electric lines, and each lessor of such a carrier, shall comply with regulations in this part as presented hereinafter.
                  (ii) Definitions.
                  
                  1. Abandonment means the withdrawal from transportation service of a branch line or other track segment or facility, representing a permanent reduction in plant.
                  2. Accounts means the accounts prescribed in this system of accounts.
                  3. Actually issued as applied to funded debt securities or capital stock issued or assumed by the company, means those which have been sold to bona fide purchasers or holders for a valuable consideration (including those issued in exchange for other securities or other property) and such purchasers or holders secured them free from control by the carriers. Also securities issued as dividends on stock.
                  4. Actually outstanding as applied to funded debt securities or capital stock issued or assumed by the carrier means those which have been actually issued and are neither retired and canceled nor reacquired and held by or for the accounting company.
                  5. (a) Affiliated companies means companies or persons that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries control, or are controlled by, or are under common control with, the accounting carrier.
                  (b) Control (including the terms controlling, controlled by, and under common control with) means the possession directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company, whether such power is exercised through one or more intermediary companies, or alone, or in conjunction with, or pursuant to an agreement, and whether such power is established through a majority of minority ownership or voting of securities, common directors, officers or stockholders, voting trusts, holding trusts, associated companies, contract or any other direct or indirect means.
                  6. Amortization means the gradual extinguishment of an amount in an account by distributing such amount over a fixed period dependent on the requirements of regulatory bodies, over the life of the asset or liability to which it applies, or over the period during which it is anticipated the benefit will be realized.
                  7. Carrier as used herein and when not otherwise indicated in the context means any carrier to which this system of accounts is applicable.
                  8. Consolidation means the formation of a new company. See instruction 2-15.
                  9. Board means the Surface Transportation Board.
                  10. Compensating balance means the portion of any demand deposit (or any time deposit or certificate of deposit) maintained by a carrier (or by any person on behalf of the carrier) which constitutes support for existing borrowing arrangements of the carrier with a lending institution. Such arrangements include both outstanding borrowings and the assurance of future credit availability. (The compensating balance requirement should be adjusted by the amount of float unless such adjustment would cause the compensating balance to be greater than the cash balance per carrier's books.) The float adjustment is made by subtracting the float from the compensating balance requirement if the collected bank ledger balance exceeds the cash balance per carrier's books or by adding the float to the compensating balance requirement if the collected bank ledger balance is less than the cash balance per carrier's books.
                  
                  (a) Float means deposits and withdrawals in transit which constitute a difference between the collected bank ledger balance and the cash balance per carrier's books.
                  11. Cost center refers to an organizational subdivision for which cost data are desired and for which provision is made to accumulate costs such as a terminal, yard, or track segment. A cost center may correspond to a given area of responsibility for which costs are presently accumulated for planning and control. A cost center is the smallest segment of activity or area of responsibility for which costs are accumulated and directly traceable.
                  12. Cost of renewal means the cost of additional material applied (other than the value assigned second-hand parts remaining in the rebuilt unit) plus the cost of labor used in the rebuilding process, exclusive of the portion applicable to dismantling and repair of old parts reused.
                  13. Cost of removal means cost of demolishing, dismantling, tearing down or otherwise removing property.
                  14. Debt issue cost means all costs in connection with the issuance and sale of evidences of debt, such as fees for drafting mortgages and trust deeds; fees for issuing or recording evidences of debt; cost of engraving and printing bonds and certificates of indebtedness; fees paid trustees, specific costs of obtaining governmental authority; fees for legal services; fees and commissions paid underwriters, brokers and salespeople for marketing such evidences for debt; fees and costs of listing on exchanges; and other like costs.
                  15. Discount as applied to funded debt securities or capital stock issued or assumed by the carrier, means the excess of the par or face value of the securities plus interest or dividends accrued at the date of the sale over the cash value of the consideration received from their sale.
                  16. Equity security encompasses any instrument representing ownership shares (e.g., common, preferred and other capital stock), or the right to acquire (e.g., warrants, rights, and call options) or dispose of (e.g., put options) ownership shares in an enterprise at fixed or determinable prices. The term does not encompass preferred stock that by its terms either must be redeemed by the issuing enterprise or is redeemable at the option of the investor, nor does it include treasury stock or convertible bonds.
                  (a) Marketable, as applied to an equity security, means an equity security as to which sales prices or bid and ask prices are currently available on a national securities exchange (i.e., those registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission) or in the over-the-counter market. In the over-the-counter market, an equity security shall be considered marketable when a quotation is publicly reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotations System or by the National Quotations Bureau, Inc. (provided, in the latter case, that quotations are available from at least three dealers). Equity securities traded in foreign markets shall be considered marketable when such markets are of a breadth and scope comparable to those referred to above. This definition is not met by restricted stock (securities for which sale is restricted by a governmental or contractual requirement except where such requirement terminates within one year or where the holder has the power to cause the requirement to be met within one year). Any portion of the stock which can reasonably be expected to qualify for sale within one year, such as may be the case under Rule 144 or similar rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is not considered restricted.
                  (b) Market value refers to the aggregate of the market price of a single share or unit times the number of shares or units of each marketable equity security in the portfolio. When an equity has taken positions involving short sales, sales of calls, and purchases of puts for marketable equity securities and the same securities are included in the portfolio, those contracts shall be taken into consideration in the determination of market value of the marketable equity securities.
                  (c) Cost, as applied to a marketable equity security, refers to the original cost as adjusted for unrealized holding gains and losses.
                  17. (a) Income taxes means taxes based on income determined under provisions of the United States Internal Revenue Code and foreign, state and other taxes (including franchise taxes) based on income.
                  (b) Income tax expense means the amount of income taxes (whether or not currently payable or refundable) allocable to a period in the determination of net income.
                  (c) Pretax accounting income means income or loss for a period, exclusive of related income tax expense.
                  (d) Taxable income means the excess of revenues over deductions or the excess of deductions over revenue to be reported for income tax purposes for a period.
                  (e) Timing differences means differences between the periods in which transactions affect taxable income and the periods in which they enter into the determination of pretax accounting income. Timing differences originate in one period and reverse or turn around in one or more subsequent periods. Some timing differences reduce income taxes that would otherwise be payable currently; others increase income taxes that would otherwise be payable currently.
                  (f) Permanent differences means differences between taxable income and pretax accounting income arising from transactions that, under applicable tax laws and regulations, will not be offset by corresponding differences or turn around in other periods.
                  (g) Tax effects means differentials in income taxes of a period attributable to (1) revenue or expense transactions which enter into the determination of pretax accounting income in one period and into the determination of taxable income in another period, (2) deductions or credits that may be carried backward or forward for income tax purposes and (3) adjustments of prior periods and direct entries to other stockholders' equity accounts which enter into the determination of taxable income in a period but which do not enter into the determination of pretax accounting income of that period. A permanent difference does not result in a tax effect as that term is used in this definition.
                  (h) Deferred taxes means tax effects which are deferred for allocation to income tax expense of future periods.
                  (i) Interperiod tax allocation means the process of apportioning income taxes among periods.
                  (j) Tax allocation within a period means the process of apportioning income tax expenses applicable to a given period between income before extraordinary items and extraordinary items, and of associating the income tax effects of adjustments of prior periods and direct entries to other stockholders' equity accounts with these items.
                  18. (a) Investor means a business entity that holds an investment in voting stock of another company.
                  (b) Investee means a corporation that issued voting stock held by an investor.
                  (c) Corporate joint venture is a company owned and operated as a separate and specific business or project for the mutual benefit of the members of the group. Joint facilities for purposes of this system of accounts are not considered corporate joint ventures.
                  (d) Dividends when applied to distributions received from investees unless otherwise specified, means dividends received or receivable in cash, other assets, or another class of stock and does not include stock dividends or stock splits.
                  (e) Earnings or losses of an investee and financial position of an investee refer to net income (or net loss) and financial position of an investee determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
                  (f) Undistributed earnings of an investee means net income less dividends declared whether received or not.
                  (g) Date of acquisition is the date on which the investor assumes the rights of ownership. Ordinarily, this is the date assets are received and other assets are given or securities issued.
                  19. Joint facility means any owned or leased carrier operating property occupied or operated jointly by the carrier and one or more other carriers, under an arrangement whereby the cost and income are apportioned to the parties to the joint agreement. Portions of a structure or other property used exclusively by each of two or more carriers are not joint facilities.
                  20. Ledger value of an account means the undepreciated or unamortized cost of acquisition of the item to the carrier, recorded in the general ledger. In case the cost of any item of property is not shown separately in the ledger, the ledger value of that item shall be its proportionate share of the value of the entire group in which the particular property is included.
                  21. Merger means the acquisition of one company by another. See instruction 2-15.
                  22. Minor items of property means the associated parts or items of which units of property are composed.
                  23. Net railway operating income: Operating revenue remaining after deducting operating expenses, income taxes on ordinary income, and the provision for deferred income taxes. Also, in arriving at NROI, deduct the Income from Lease of Road and Equipment and add the Rent for Leased Road and Equipment, formerly accounts 509 and 542, respectively.
                  24. Net salvage value means salvage value of property retired less the cost of removal.
                  25. Nominally issued as applied to funded debt securities or capital stock issued or assumed by the carrier, means those which have been signed, certified by trustees, or otherwise executed, and placed with the proper officer for sale and delivery, or pledged, or otherwise placed in some special fund of the accounting company, but which have not been sold or issued directly to the trustees of such fund in accordance with contractual requirements.
                  26. Nominally outstanding as applied to funded debt securities or capital stock issued or assumed by the carrier, means those which, after being actually issued, have been reacquired by or for the accounting company under such circumstances which require them to be considered as held alive and not retired and canceled.
                  27. Premium as applied to funded debt securities or capital stock issued or assumed by the carrier, means the excess of the cash value of the consideration received from their sale over the sum of their par (stated value of no par stock) or face value and interest or dividends accrued at the date of sale.
                  28. Programmed track replacements are costs incurred as part of a track replacement program or planned expenditures. Programmed track replacements are generally performed by relatively large work gangs which, on the basis of programmed and authorized work orders, use heavy mechanized equipment to replace rail, ties and other track material. For guidance on what not to capitalize, see the notes to the text of Accounts 8, 9 and 11.
                  29. Property retired means units of property which have been removed, sold, abandoned, destroyed, or which for any cause have been permanently withdrawn from service; also minor items of property not replaced.
                  30. Rail Transportation Property. Rail transportation property is all property and other assets, irrespective of ownership, that comprise the entire operating unit devoted to rail transportation service. This definition comprises the following accounts:
                  
                  
                    701 Cash
                    703 Special deposits
                    704 Loans and notes receivable
                    705 Accounts receivable—interline and other balances
                    706 Accounts receivable—customers
                    707 Accounts receivable—other
                    708.5 Receivable with affiliated companies
                    709 Accrued accounts receivable
                    710 Working funds
                    711 Prepayments
                    712 Material and supplies
                    713 Other current assets

                    731 Road and equipment property
                    732 Improvements on leased property
                  
                  
                  31. Salvage value means the amount received from the sale of operating property retired less any expenses in connection with the sale or in preparing the property for sale. If the property is retained for reuse, the salvage value shall be recorded in account 712, Materials and Supplies, or other appropriate account at an amount not to exceed its recorded cost (actual or average), or current market value, whichever is lower.
                  32. Segment of a business refers to a component of an entity whose activities represent a separate major line of business or class of customer. A segment may be in the form of a subsidiary, a division, or a department, and in some cases a joint venture or other non-subsidiary investee, provided that its assets, results of operations, and activities can be clearly distinguished, physically and operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the other assets, results of operations, and activities of the entity. The fact that the results of operations of the segment being sold or abandoned cannot be separately identified strongly suggests that the transaction should not be classified as a disposal of a segment of business.
                  (a) Measurement date means the date on which the management having authority to approve the action commits itself to a formal plan to dispose of a segment of the business, whether by abandonment or sale. The measurement date for disposals requiring Commission approval shall be the service date of the Order authorizing the disposal.
                  (b) Disposal date refers to the date of closing the sale, if the disposal is by sale or the date that operations cease if the disposal is by abandonment.
                  33. Service life means the period between the date when operating property is placed in service and the date of its retirement.
                  34. Service value means the ledger value of operating property less its salvage value (see definition 17).
                  35. Track maintenance is material and labor costs of routine track repairs such as sporadic tie replacement, repair of broken rails, tightening track bolts and track spikes. A more complete list of maintenance items are included in notes to the text of Accounts 8, 9 and 11.
                  36. Work equipment means equipment which can be coupled in a train for movement over the carrier's tracks, and which is used in the carrier's work service. See equipment listing for account 57, Work equipment.
                  
                  [42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 44 FR 3493, Jan. 19, 1979; 45 FR 31110, May 12, 1980; 48 FR 7183, Feb. 18, 1983; 48 FR 33718, July 25, 1983; 49 FR 2254, Jan. 19, 1984; 52 FR 4321, Feb. 11, 1987; 81 FR 19907, Apr. 6, 2016]
                
                
                  GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
                  1-1 Classification of carriers. (a) For purposes of accounting and reporting, carriers are grouped into the following three classes:
                  Class I: Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues of $250 million or more after applying the railroad revenue deflator formula shown in Note A.
                  Class II: Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues of less than $250 million but in excess of $20 million after applying the railroad revenue deflator formula shown in Note A.
                  Class III: Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues of $20 million or less after applying the railroad revenue deflator formula shown in Note A.
                  (b)(1) The class to which any carrier belongs shall be determined by annual carrier operating revenues after the railroad revenue deflator adjustment. Families of railroads operating within the United States as a single, integrated rail system will be treated as a single carrier for classification purposes. Upward and downward reclassification will be effected as of January 1 in the year immediately following the third consecutive year of revenue qualification.
                  (2) If a Class II or Class III carrier's classification is changed based on three years' adjusted revenues the carrier shall complete and file the Classification Index Survey Form with the Board by March 31 of the year following the end of the period to which it relates.
                  (3) Newly organized carriers shall be classified on the basis of their annual carrier operating revenues after railroad revenue deflator adjustment for the latest period of operation. If actual data are not available, new carriers shall be classified on the basis of their carrier operating revenues known and estimated for a year (after railroad revenue deflator adjustment).
                  (4) When a business combination occurs, such as a merger, reorganization, or consolidation, the surviving carrier shall be reclassified effective January 1 of the next calendar year on the basis of the combined revenue for the year when the combination occurred (after railroad revenue deflator adjustment).

                  (5) In unusual circumstances, such as partial liquidation and curtailment or elimination of contracted services, where regulations will unduly burden the carrier, the carrier may request the Board for an exception to the regulations. This request shall be in writing specifying the conditions justifying an exception.
                  (c) Class I carriers shall keep all of the accounts of this system which are applicable to their operations. Class II and III carriers are not required to maintain the accounts of this system.
                  (d) All switching and terminal companies, regardless of their operating revenues will be designated Class III carriers.

                  (e) Unless provided for otherwise, all electric railway carriers, regardless of operating revenues, will be designated Class III carriers.
                  
                  
                    Note A:

                    The railroad revenue deflator formula is based on the Railroad Freight Price Index developed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The formula is as follows:
                    
                    Current Year's Revenues × (1991 Average Index/Current Year's Average Index)
                  
                  
                    Note B:
                    See related regulations 49 CFR 1241.15 Railroad classification survey form.
                  

                  [57 FR 27185, June 18, 1992; 57 FR 31754, July 17, 1992; 66 FR 56245, Nov. 7, 2001; 67 FR 57533, Sept. 11, 2002]
                  
                  1-2 Classification of accounts. (a) Accounts are prescribed to cover cost of property used in transportation operations and operations incidental thereto and for revenues, expenses, taxes, rents, and other items of income for such operations. Separate accounts are prescribed for investment in property not used in transportation operations and for other investments and income therefrom; for unusual and infrequent items; for operations and disposal of discontinued segments; for extraordinary items and accounting changes; and for assets, liabilities and capital includable in the balance sheet statement. Retained earnings accounts form the connecting link between the income account and the equity section of the balance sheet. They are provided to record the transfer of net income or loss for the year; certain capital transactions; and, when authorized by the Board, other items.
                  (b) The cost of property, and the revenues, expenses, taxes and rents for miscellaneous operations involving the use of such facilities as hotels, restaurants, grain elevators, storage warehouses, power plants, cold storage plants, etc., shall not be included in the accounts prescribed for transportation operations unless the operation of the facilities is conducted by the railway companies in connection with furnishing transportation services. Likewise, the cost of property, the revenues, expenses, taxes, and rents arising from the operation of stockyards shall not be included in accounts prescribed for transportation operations unless operation of the facilities is conducted in connection with transportation of livestock. It is not intended that cost of property and income arising from incidental public stockyards service rendered by stockyards primarily devoted to transportation services shall be excluded from transportation operation accounts.
                  (c) Joint facility accounts are provided for the joint users of tracks, bridges, yards, wharves, stations, and other facilities in which to record items in settlement for use of such facilities. When the compensation for the use of facilities is a fixed amount or is based upon a charge per passenger, ton, car or other unit, the amount shall be fairly apportioned by the operating company among the joint facility operating expense and income accounts. The creditor shall show the distribution of these charges upon its bills, and such distribution shall be adhered to by the debtor. Train service in connection with the line haul of traffic, including that operated under a joint arrangement for the benefit of two or more carriers, is not considered a joint facility operation.
                  (d)(1) Extraordinary Items. All items of profit and loss recognized during the year are includable in ordinary income unless evidence clearly supports their classification as extraordinary items.
                  Extraordinary items are characterized by both their unusual nature and infrequent occurrence taking into account the environment in which the firm operates; they must also meet the materiality standard.
                  Unusual means the event or transaction must possess a high degree of abnormality and be of a type clearly unrelated to, or only incidentally related to the ordinary and typical activities of the entity.

                  Infrequent occurrence means the event or transaction shall be of a type not reasonably expected to recur in the foreseeable future.
                  
                  (2) Unusual or Infrequent Items. Material events unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence but not both, thus not meeting both criteria for classification as extraordinary, shall be includable in the accounts provided as separate components of income/expense from continuing operations.
                  (3) Discontinued Operations. The results of continuing operations shall be reported separately from discontinued operations and any gain or loss resulting from disposal of a segment of a business (see definition 23(a)) shall be reported in conjunction with the related results of discontinued operations and not as an extraordinary item. The disposal of a segment of a business shall be distinguished from other disposals of assets incident to the evolution of the entity's business, such as the disposal of part of a line of business, the shifting of production or marketing activities for a particular line of business from one location to another, the phasing out of a product line or class of service, and other changes occasioned by technological improvements. If a loss is expected from the proposed sale or abandonment of a segment, the estimated loss shall be provided for at the measurement date (see definition 23(b)). If a gain is expected, it shall be recognized when realized, which ordinarily is the disposal date (see definition 23(c)).
                  (4) Prior period adjustments. Only the following two items of profit and loss shall be accounted for and reported as prior period adjustments and excluded from the determination of net income for the current period:
                  (1) Correction of an error in the financial statements of a prior period, and
                  (2) Adjustments that result from realization of income tax benefits of preacquisition operating loss carryforwards of purchased subsidiaries.
                  With the exception of the two items just mentioned, all items of profit and loss recognized during a period shall be included in the determination of net income for that period.
                  
                    Note:
                    The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting principles where an interpretation of the rules is needed or obtain an interpretation from its public accountant or the Board.
                  
                  (5) Accounting Changes. Errors in financial statements result from mathematical mistakes, mistakes in the application of accounting principles, or oversight or misuse of facts that existed at the time the financial statements were prepared. In contrast, a change in an accounting estimate results from new information or subsequent developments and from better insight or judgment. Correction of an error should be accomplished through a prior period adjustment [See Instruction 1-2(d)(4)]. Changes in an accounting estimate should be accounted for in the period of change (and future period if the change affects both)(See Instruction 1-7). A change in an accounting principle or accounting entity should be referred to this Board for approval. The cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle should ordinarily be reflected in the account provided for in determining net income.
                  (6) Materiality. As a general standard an item shall be considered material when it exceeds 10 percent of annual income (loss) before extraordinary items. An item may also be considered in relation to the trend of annual earnings before extraordinary items or other appropriate criteria. Items shall be considered individually and not in the aggregate in determining materiality. However, the effects of a series of related transactions arising from a single specific and identifiable event or plan of action shall be aggregated to determine materiality.
                  (7) Board Approval and Accountant's Letter. Items shall be included in the accounts provided for extraordinary items, unusual or infrequent items, discontinued operations, prior period adjustments and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles only upon approval of the Board. If the carrier retains the service of an independent accountant, a request for using these accounts shall be accompanied by a letter from the independent accountant approving or otherwise commenting on the request.
                  
                    Note:
                    The carrier may refer to generally accepted accounting principles for further guidance in applying paragraph (d) above.

                  1-3 Records. (a) Each carrier shall keep its books of account, and all other books, records, and memoranda which support the entries in such books of account so as to be able to furnish readily full information as to any item included in any account. Each entry shall be supported by such detailed information as will permit ready identification, analysis, and verification of all facts relevant thereto.
                  (b) All expenditures including the expense accounts of officers and employees shall be supported by vouchers, payrolls, receipted bills, canceled checks, receipts for petty cash payments, or other evidences of the expenditures incurred.
                  (c) The books referred to herein include not only books of accounts in a limited technical sense but all other records such as minute books, stock books, reports, correspondence, memoranda, etc., which will be useful in developing the history of or facts regarding any transaction.
                  (d) No carrier shall destroy any books, records, memoranda, etc., which support entries to its accounts unless destruction is permitted by the regulations governing preservation of records, Part 1220 of this chapter.
                  (e) In addition to prescribed accounts, clearing accounts, temporary accounts, and subdivisions of any accounts may be kept, provided the integrity of the prescribed accounts is not impaired.
                  (f) Cost detail shall be maintained by cost centers for purposes of cost assignments effective 1-1-79. This provides for cost control and cost planning at any designated area of responsibility. These cost centers shall be similarly defined as the railroads' existing responsibility centers. Cost center information shall therefore be kept at the same level of detail presently collected, categorized, and maintained in railroad internal managerial accounting systems. This detailed information shall not be reported to the Board on an ongoing basis. However, the carrier shall keep the detailed information to provide a ready analysis and verification of the costs collected by cost center.

                  [42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 4324, Feb. 11, 1987; 61 FR 9113, Mar. 7, 1996]
                  
                  1-4 Accounting period. (a) Each carrier shall keep its books on a monthly basis so that known transactions, as nearly as may be ascertained, shall be entered in the accounts not later than 60 days after the last day of the period for which the accounts are stated, except that the time within which the final entries for the year ending December 31 shall be made may be extended to such date in the following March as shall not interfere with the preparation and filing of annual report.
                  (b) A trial balance of the general ledger accounts shall be prepared at the close of each month setting out the account number, title, and amount of each ledger account. (Mechanical, electronic or automatic data processing printout documentation producing the equivalent of manually prepared trial balances shall identify balances by account numbers.) At the end of the calendar year, the revenue, expense, and other income accounts shall be closed into retained earnings account, and the balance sheet account balances shall be brought forward to the general ledger for the succeeding year.
                  (c) No changes shall be made in the accounts for periods covered by quarterly and annual reports that have been filed with the Board unless the changes have first been authorized by the Board.
                  1-5 Accrual method of accounting. The accounting for operating revenues, operating expenses, income and other items each month and year shall be, as nearly as practicable, upon the basis of accruals consistently applied. Any change in practice of accounting for accruals or any unusual accruals involving material amounts shall be reported promptly to the Board.
                  
                  1-6 Charges to be just and reasonable. All charges to the accounts prescribed in this system of accounts for carrier property, operating revenues, operating and maintenance expenses, and other carrier expenses, shall be just, reasonable and not exceed amounts necessary to the honest and efficient operation and management of carrier business. Payments shall not exceed the fair market value of goods and services acquired in an arm's length transaction. Any payments in excess of such just and reasonable charges shall be included in account 551, Miscellaneous income charges.
                  
                  1-7 Changes in accounting estimates. Changes in accounting estimate arising during the current year which are applicable to prior years shall be included in the same account which would have been charged or credited if the item had been taken up or the adjustment made in the year to which it pertained. [See Instruction 1-2(d)(5) for Accounting Changes].

                  1-8 Accounting for computer systems and word processing costs. (a) Capitalized costs for computer systems and word processing equipment shall be charged to property account 59, when such costs are not dedicated to a particular function (See Account 59). Related depreciation expenses for capitalized costs shall be charged to account 62-23-00, Depreciation, Other Equipment.
                  (b) Repair and maintenance costs related to computer systems and word processing equipment shall be charged to function 46 of the Other equipment subactivity by appropriate natural expense (labor, material, purchased services, other). Repairs performed by an outside company shall be charged to operating expense account 39-23-46.
                  (c) Operating costs related to computer systems and word processing equipment shall be charged to function 87, Management services and data and word processing, when the equipment benefits more than one activity. When the equipment benefits one activity only, such operating costs shall be charged to the activity/function benefited.

                  1-9 Transactions with affiliated companies. (a) The records and supporting data of all transactions with affiliated companies shall be maintained in a separate file. The types of transactions referred to in this paragraph are for management services or any other type of services rendered, sale or use of facilities or any other type of assets or property. The file shall be maintained so as to enable the carrier, upon a Board request, to furnish accurate information with supporting documentation about particular transactions within 15 days of the request. We do not intend the file to include data relating to ordinary carrier operations (e.g. lawful tariff charges or interchange of equipment).
                  (b) Each bill rendered by an affiliated company shall state specifically the basis used for determining charges, unless the file contains the information to support the specific basis for charges.
                  (c) Punched cards, magnetic tapes, discs, or other machine-sensible devices used for recording, consolidating, and summarizing accounting transactions and records with a carrier's electronic or automatic data processing system may constitute a file within the meaning of this instruction.
                  (d) The carrier shall record, as the cost of assets or services received from an affiliated supplier, the invoice price (plus any incidental costs related to those transactions) in those cases where the invoice price can be determined from a prevailing price list of the affiliated supplier available to the general public in the normal course of business. If no such price list exists, the charges shall be recorded at the lower of their cost to the originating affiliated supplier (less all applicable valuation reserves in case of asset sales, or their estimated fair market value determined on the basis of a representative study of similar competitive and arm's-length or bargained transaction. Any difference between actual transaction price and the above, as well as charges that are not transportation related, shall be considered of a financing nature and shall be recorded, accordingly, as nonoperating charges or credits. (See instruction 1-6.)
                  (e) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as restraining the carrier from subdividing accounts (see instruction I-3(e)) for the purpose of recording separately transactions with affiliated companies.

                  (f) Carriers reporting information on a consolidated or combined basis in railroad Annual Report Form R-1 shall maintain a file with appropriate records and supporting data. This shall include work sheets showing revenues, expenses, earnings, investment in assets and accumulated depreciation for all affiliated railroads and rail-related affiliated companies. The work sheets shall also disclose any eliminations. Carriers shall also disclose the methodology used to support segregation of rail-related or other items as appropriate. Further, a file shall be maintained to support and reconcile entity sales, transfers and reclassifications as well as taxes deducted from gains or losses.

                  [42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 53 FR 46620, Nov. 18, 1988]
                  
                  1-10 Accounting for income taxes. (a) The interperiod tax allocation method of accounting shall be applied where material timing differences (see definition 17(e)) occur between pretax accounting income and taxable income. Carriers may elect, as provided by the Revenue Act of 1971, to account for the investment tax credit by either the flow through method or the deferred method of accounting. See paragraphs (d) and (e) below. All income taxes (Federal, state and other) currently accruable for income tax return purposes shall be charged to account 556, Income taxes on ordinary income, and account 590, Income Taxes on Extraordinary Items, as applicable.
                  (b) Under the interperiod tax allocation method of accounting the tax effect of timing differences (see definition 17) originating in the current accounting period are allocated to income tax expense of future periods when the timing differences reverse. Similar timing differences originating and reversing in the current accounting period should be combined into groups and the current tax rates applied to determine the tax effect of each group. A carrier shall not apply other than current tax rates in determining the tax effect of reversing differences except upon approval of the Board. When determining the amount of deferred taxes, rather than computing state and other taxes individually by jurisdiction, the Federal income tax rate may be increased by a percent equivalent to the effect of taxes imposed by the jurisdictions. In classifying a deferred charge or credit as current or noncurrent a carrier shall follow the classification criteria used for the related asset or liability which caused the timing difference. A deferred charge or credit that is not related to an asset or liability because (a) there is no associated asset or liability or (b) reduction of an associated asset or liability will not cause the timing difference to reverse shall be classified based on the expected reversal date of the specific timing difference. Such classification disregards any additional timing differences that may arise and is based on the criteria used for classifying other assets and liabilities.
                  (c) The future tax benefits of loss carryforwards shall normally be recognized in the year in which such loss is applied to reduce taxes. Only in those unusual instances when realization is assured beyond any reasonable doubt should the future tax benefits of loss carryforwards be recognized in the year of loss. The tax effects of any realizable loss carrybacks shall be recognized in the determination of net income (loss) of the loss periods; appropriate adjustments of existing net deferred tax credits may also be necessary in the loss period.

                  (d) Carriers electing to account for the investment tax credit by the flow through method shall credit account 556 Income taxes on ordinary income, or account 590, Income taxes on extraordinary items, as applicable, and charge account 760, Federal income taxes accrued, with the amount of investment tax credit utilized in the current accounting period. When the flow through method is followed for the investment tax credit, account 557, Provision for Deferred Taxes, shall reflect the difference between the tax payable (after recognition of allowable investment tax credit) based on taxable income and tax expense (with full recognition of investment tax credit that would be allowable based on accounting income) based on accounting income.

                  (e) Carriers electing to account for the investment tax credit by the deferred method shall concurrently with making the entries prescribed in (d) above charge account 557, Provision for deferred taxes, or account 591, Provision for deferred taxes—extraordinary item, as applicable, and shall credit account 786, Accumulated deferred income tax credits, with the investment tax credit utilized as a reduction of the current year's tax liability but deferred for accounting purposes. The investment tax credit so deferred shall be amortized by credits to account 557, Provision for deferred taxes.
                    
                  
                  
                    Note A:
                    Any change in practice of accounting for the investment tax credit shall be reported promptly to the Board. Carriers desiring to clear deferred investment tax credits because of a change from the deferral method to the flow though method shall submit the proposed journal entry to the Board for consideration and advice.
                  
                  
                    Note B:
                    The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting principles where an interpretation of the accounting rules for income taxes is needed or obtain an interpretation from its public accountant or the Board.
                  

                  [42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 47 FR 12350, Mar. 23, 1982; 52 FR 4321, Feb. 11, 1987; 67 FR 57533, Sept. 11, 2002]
                  
                  1-11 Items in texts of accounts. The items appearing in the texts of the accounts or elsewhere herein are for the purpose of more clearly indicating the application of the prescribed accounting. The items are intended to be representative, but not exhaustive. The appearance of an item in the text of a primary account warrants the inclusion of the item in the account mentioned only when the whole text also indicates inclusion inasmuch as the same item frequently appears in more than one primary account. The proper entry in each instance must be determined by the entire text of each primary account.
                  1-12 Distribution of pay and expenses of employees. (a) The pay and expenses of officers or employees regularly assigned to specific duties who perform incidental services of a different nature involving small expense may be included in the appropriate expense accounts for the duties to which such officers or employees are regularly assigned.

                  (b) When it is necessary to apportion the pay of officers and employees among various accounts, the carrier shall apportion the pay on the basis of the directly assignable pay to the various accounts.
                  
                  1-13 Payroll related expenses. (a) Fringe benefits (account series 12-00-00) distributed to the activities using one of the following techniques (in order of preference):
                  (1) Apply appropriate factors to the total of the fringe expense account, in such a way as to distribute an equitable proportion of cost to each activity. These factors shall be developed to take into account variables such as the following:
                  (i) The effect of seniority on the expense. For example, profit sharing or pensions may be available to only certain categories of employees, which may be more predominant in one activity than another.
                  (ii) The effect of the type of work performed. For example, workmen's compensation expense may vary for each category of employees because of the rate charged or the claims experience of the category.
                  (iii) Any other variable which may have an appreciable effect on the equity of the apportionment.
                  (2) Distribute the amount in the same proportion as the pay charged to each activity in account series 11-00-00 (salaries and wages).
                  (3) Distribute the amounts using any other equitable basis which the carrier can substantiate.
                  (b) All carriers shall be prepared to describe the basis of apportionment used to distribute expenses included in this instruction.

                  (c) Any carrier which finds it impracticable to distribute expenses as required by this instruction should furnish the Board with full particulars of the conditions which prevent the proper distribution. Upon receipt of such information carrier will be advised of the procedure to be followed.
                  
                  1-14 Submission of questions. To maintain uniformity of accounting, carriers shall submit questions of doubtful interpretation to the Board for consideration and decision.
                  1-15 Transfers from government authorities. When a Federal, State, or municipal government transfers cash or other assets to a railroad, the transaction shall be accounted for in accordance with the provisions set forth hereunder.
                  

                  (a) The following forms of government transfers shall be included in account 502, Railway Operating Revenues—Transfers from Government Authorities for Current Operations when received:
                  (1) Payments as reimbursement for operating losses sustained on a specific line, or in a certain region. Examples include support of commuter operations of a railroad, and local rail service assistance subsidies granted to a railroad under authority of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976;
                  (2) Subsidies designated by the donor to offset operating expenses of the railroad, and
                  (3) Subsidies which may be applied at the discretion of the recipient to operating expenses and/or operating property.

                  (b) Government transfers relating to the acquisition, addition to, or improvement of depreciable operating property shall be included in account 783, Deferred Revenues—Transfers from Government Authorities when received. Account 783 shall be periodically charged, and account 503, Railway Operating Revenues—Amortization of Deferred Transfers from Government Authorities shall be credited with amounts equal to the depreciation costs of the assets to which they apply.

                  (c) Government transfers in the form of, or designated for the purchase of nondepreciable operating property shall be included in account 796, Other Capital Surplus in the manner described in the text of that account.
                  (d)(1) Transfers from the Federal Government to Amtrak and ConRail relating to the acquisitions, addition to, or improvement of depreciable or nondepreciable operating property shall be included in account 796 in the manner described in the text of that account.
                  (2) Transfers from the Federal Government to Amtrak and ConRail other than those described in paragraph (d)(1) shall be accounted for in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
                  (e) The provisions of this section do not apply to the following forms of government transfers:
                  (1) Government contributions in connection with construction projects in which government agencies and railroads participate. Transfers of this type shall be accounted for in accordance with the provisions of instruction 2-17. Paragraph (b) of that instruction lists applicable construction projects.

                  (2) Government payment for specific services rendered by the carrier in transporting property or persons by rail line other than services described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Such payments shall be included in account 501, Railway Operating Revenues (Exclusive of Transfers from Government Authorities).
                  
                  (3) Government transfers relating to other than carrier operations.
                  (4) Government transfers in exchange for debt and/or equity securities of recipients.
                  (f) Government transfers shall generally be recorded when made available to the railroad. However, transfers relating to specific operations shall be recorded as earned.
                  (g) Government transfers in the form of assets other than cash shall be recorded at fair value when received.

                  [43 FR 30558, July 17, 1978, as amended at 52 FR 4321, Feb. 11, 1987]
                  
                  1-16 Business entertainment expenses. (a) Business entertainment expenses are to be accounted for as operating expenses when incurred in conjunction with sales or marketing related activities. Sales or marketing related activities are those that emphasize a carrier's ability to provide efficient, timely and competitive service. These activities include outlays designed to promote new business as well as outlays incurred in maintaining existing business. The entertainment expenditures must be reasonable in relation to the business conducted and the business purpose for the entertainment must be adequately supported. Examples of this type of activity include the following:
                  (1) Salespersons' salaries and travel expenses, advertising, promotional and educational material;
                  (2) The conduct of shipper symposiums, conferences, meetings and traffic related functions;

                  (3) The use of direct mail solicitations and the publication and distribution of routing guides and service directories;
                  
                  (4) Incidental promotional materials such as road atlases, calendars, pens, scratchpads, and other materials of nominal value;
                  (5) The conduct of business oriented lunches and dinners, public affairs programming, conferences and customer service calls;
                  (6) Sponsoring sales promotion functions, involving a number of customers or potential customers.
                  It must be noted that an activity listed above is not to be automatically accounted for as an operating expense. A carrier must be able to justify that an activity was primarily sales or marketing related.
                  (b) Business entertainment expenses are to be accounted for as non-operating expenses when they cannot be shown to be related to the sales or marketing activity. These are expenses that are primarily related to recreation or to the convenience and comfort of the individuals rather than to the transaction of business. Examples of this type of activity include the following:
                  (1) Recreational or resort entertainment, including but not limited to, fishing, hunting, tennis, golfing, skiing or other sporting or recreational trips or outings;
                  (2) Expense paid transportation in any carrier owned, leased or furnished vehicles, planes, helicopters, boats, yachts, or other methods;
                  (3) Expense paid lodging in any carrier owned, leased or furnished motels, hotels, apartments, condominiums, lodges, rooms and other places of overnight accommodation;
                  (4) Paid admission to any sporting, cultural, educational, recreational, or entertaining occurrence or event;
                  (5) Gifts such as athletic equipment, food or liquor, beverages of all types, smoking materials, clothing and personal accessories;
                  (6) The furnishing of lunches, dinners, appetizers or beverages where there is no true business purpose;
                  (7) Social occasions such as holiday parties.
                  It must be noted that an activity listed above is not to be automatically accounted for as a non-operating expense. If a carrier can justify that the activity was primarily sales or marketing related, it may be accounted for as an operating expense.
                  
                  
                    Note:
                    The examples listed above are not inclusive, but are intended as a guide to give carriers an indication of what will or will not be permitted to be recovered through the rate structure. In all instances the burden of proof will fall on the carrier involved.

                  1-18 Distribution of expenses for material, tools, fuel, lubricants, purchased services and general. (a) These expenses shall be assigned directly to activities based on usage whenever possible.
                  (b) When it is necessary to apportion these expenses to two or more activities they shall be equitably apportioned only to the activities in which they are actually used or to the activities they support.

                  1-19 Accounting for Other Comprehensive Income. (a) Railroads will record items of Other Comprehensive Income in account 799.1, Other comprehensive income. Amounts included in this account will be maintained by each category of Other Comprehensive Income. Examples of categories of Other Comprehensive Income include foreign currency items, minimum pension liability adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale type securities and cash-flow hedge amounts.
                  (b) Supporting records will be maintained for account 799 so that the company can readily identify the cumulative amount of Other Comprehensive Income for each item included in this account.

                  (c) When an item of Other Comprehensive Income enters into the determination of earnings in the current or subsequent periods, a reclassification adjustment will be recorded in account 799 to avoid double counting of when an item included in net income was also included in Other Comprehensive Income in the same or prior period.
                  [81 FR 19907, Apr. 6, 2016]
                  1-20 Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. (a) A carrier will recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the financial statements and measure those instruments at fair value. A derivative instrument is a financial instrument or other contract with all three of the following characteristics:
                  (1) The derivative instrument has one or more underlyings and a notional amount or payment provision. Those terms determine the amount of the settlement or settlements, and, in some cases, whether or not a settlement is required.
                  (2) The derivative instrument requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have similar responses to changes in market factors.
                  (3) The derivative instrument's terms require or permit net settlement; the derivative instrument can readily be settled net by a means outside the contract; or the derivative instrument's terms provide for delivery of an asset that puts the recipient in a position not substantially different from net settlement.

                  (b) The accounting for the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends upon their intended use and designation. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges will be recorded in account 713.5, Derivative instrument assets, or account 763.5, Derivative instrument liabilities, as appropriate, with the gains or losses charged to earnings in account 551, Miscellaneous income charges.
                  (c) A derivative instrument may be specifically designated as a fair-value or cash-flow hedge. A hedge may be used to manage risk to price, interest rates, or foreign currency transactions. An entity will maintain documentation of the hedge relationship at the inception of the hedge that details the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how hedge effectiveness will be determined.

                  (d) If the carrier designates the derivative instrument as a fair-value hedge against exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment, it will record the change in fair value of the derivative instrument designated as a fair-value hedge to account 713.6, Derivative instruments assets—hedges, or account 763.6, Derivative instrument liabilities—hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding adjustment to the sub-account of the item being hedged. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction will be reflected in the same income or expense account that would have been used if the hedged item had been disposed of or settled. In the case of a fair-value hedge of a firm commitment, a new asset or liability is created. As a result of the hedge relationship, the new asset or liability will become part of the carrying amount of the item being hedged.

                  (e) If the carrier designates the derivative instrument as a cash-flow hedge against exposure to variable cash flows of a probable forecasted transaction, it will record changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument in account 713.6, Derivative instrument assets—hedges, or account 763.6, Derivative instrument liabilities—hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding amount in account 799.1, Other comprehensive income, for the effective portion of the hedge. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction will be reflected in the same income or expense account that would have been used if the hedged item had been disposed of or settled. Amounts recorded in Other Comprehensive Income will be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged forecasted item affects earnings.

                  INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPERTY ACCOUNTS
                  2-1 Items to be charged. (a) To the road and equipment property accounts shall be charged the cost of purchasing land, the cost of purchasing and constructing buildings, facilities and equipment, and the cost of additions and betterments to property, Cost means the amount of cash disbursed, or the fair value of other assets distributed, or the present value of amounts to be paid. Where the fair market value of resources given up (assets, services or items of stockholder's equity) is not clearly determinable, the cost may be determined by the fair market value of the resources acquired. The carrier shall be prepared to furnish the Board with the particulars of its method of determining cash value when the consideration is other than monetary. The amount of liabilities incurred with suppliers in the normal course of business, which are due in customary trade terms not exceeding approximately one year, shall be recorded at the maturity value. Acquisition date is the date title passes to the carrier.
                  (b) The cost of road and equipment purchased under a plan involving other deferred payments (debt or capital lease) shall be recorded at the discounted present value of the payment, net of executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes. The interest rate used to discount the payments should be the prevailing market rate for similar debt instruments of issues with similar credit ratings. In any event, the rate used for valuation purposes will normally be at least equal to the rate at which the carrier can obtain financing of a similar nature from other sources at the date of the transaction (the carrier's incremental borrowing rate). In the case of a capital lease, when it is practical to ascertain the implicit rate computed by the lessor, and that rate is less than the carrier's incremental borrowing rate, the carrier should use the implicit rate. Acquisition date for a capital lease is the date the lease agreement is signed. If the property covered by the lease has yet to be constructed or has not been acquired by the lessor at the date the lease agreement or commitment is signed, the acquisition date shall be the date the property under construction is completed or the date the property not yet acquired is acquired by the lessor. (See Instruction 2-20.)

                  (c) Where actually incurred, interest cost is to be added to the cost of road and equipment deemed qualifying assets during the period of time required to get them ready for their intended use (acquisition period). Qualifying assets are those that are (1) either constructed or otherwise produced for a carrier's own use (including assets constructed or produced for the carrier by others for which deposits or progress payments have been made) or (2) assets intended for sale or lease that are constructed or otherwise produced as discrete projects. The amount of interest to be capitalized for qualifying assets shall be based upon the average amount of accumulated expenditures for the asset during the acquisition period at the rate used on specific new borrowings associated with the qualifying asset. If average accumulated expenditures for the asset exceed the amount of specific new borrowings associated with the asset, the rate to be applied to such excess shall be a weighted average of the rates applicable to other borrowings of the enterprise. The total amount of interest cost capitalized in an accounting period shall not exceed the total amount of interest cost incurred by the enterprise during that period.
                  (d) Suitable records shall be maintained showing expenditures during the year for original road and equipment and road extensions; for merger and purchase of existing lines and reorganizations; for additions and betterments; and credits for property retirement.

                  (e) When the carrier exchanges road and equipment for other road and equipment with no other consideration involved, the road and equipment received shall be recorded at the ledger value of the road and equipment relinquished. Where the carrier receives a monetary consideration in the exchange, the carrier shall recognize gain on the exchange to the extent that the consideration received exceeds a proportionate share of the recorded cost of the road and equipment surrendered. The portion of the cost applicable to the realized amount shall be based on the ratio of the monetary consideration to the total consideration received (monetary consideration plus the estimate fair value of the road and equipment received) or, if more clearly evident, the fair value of the road and equipment transferred. Where the carrier pays a monetary consideration in the exchange, it shall not recognize any gain on the transaction but shall record the road and equipment received at the amount of the monetary consideration paid plus the recorded costs of the road and equipment surrendered. If a loss is indicated by the terms of an exchange transaction, the carrier shall recognize the entire loss on the exchange. Immaterial gains and losses on these exchanges shall be included in account 519, Miscellaneous Income, or 551, Miscellaneous Income Charges, as appropriate. Material amounts shall be recorded in accordance with Instruction 1-2(d).

                  2-2 Minimum rule applicable to additions to property. An exception to the rule in Instruction 2-1 is that when the cost of acquisition of units of road property and of additions to existing units of road property (other than land and tracks) is less than $5,000, such costs may be charged to operating expenses. This amount (rounded to the nearest $100) will be adjusted by the June Producer Price Index for all commodities when an aggregate adjustment is $500 or more. The revision will be published in the Federal Register and be effective as of January 1 of the following year. The carrier shall not parcel expenditures under a general plan bringing the accounting for such expenditures within this minimum rule. An amount of less than the current minimum capitalization level, for the railroad as a whole or for individual property accounts may be adopted for purposes of this rule provided the carrier first notifies the Board of the amount it proposes to adopt and thereafter makes no change in the amount unless authorized by the Board. An amount adopted shall be adhered to in reporting property changes for valuation purposes.

                  2-3 Land. (a) Accounts are provided for the cost of land used in transportation operations and also for land used in other than transportation operations. When land is retired from transportation operations but is retained by the carrier the original cost (estimated, if not known) shall be transferred to the account prescribed for property used in other than transportation operations. It is not contemplated that irregular parcels of land acquired in connection with acquisition of right-of-way which have no value as commercial property shall be thus transferred, either for the purpose of making right-of-way boundaries run more or less regular or for the purpose of eliminating from transportation property account the cost of unoccupied lands between tracks in yards and terminals. When any land, the cost of which is included in the accounts, is sold or otherwise retired, the ledger value shall be credited to the appropriate property investment account. The profit or loss from sale or loss from retirement or land shall be included in the accounts prescribed for such amounts.
                  (b) [Reserved]

                  2-4 Structures. Accounts are provided for the cost of several classes of buildings and facilities, including fixtures permanently attached to and made a part thereof. When a building or other structure is used or held primarily for transportation operations and is an integral part of the carrier's transportation plant, but a part thereof is used or held for commercial purposes such as for rental to others or for use in other than transportation operations by the carrier, the entire cost of the building or other structure is includable in the accounts for transportation property. When a building or other structure is used or held primarily for commercial purposes or for use in other than transportation operations by the carrier, the entire cost of the building or structure is includable in account 737, Property used in other than carrier operations. Reclassification of property from its primary classification as transportation or other than transportation property, as the case may be, to the other classification is not required where changes in use are of a temporary nature or for a short period of time. The accounting for costs of maintenance, taxes, other operating costs, and for revenues and rentals shall be consistent with the classification of the building or other structure.
                  2-5 Equipment. Accounts are provided for several classes of equipment, such as locomotives, passenger-train cars, freight-train cars, highway revenue equipment, work equipment, floating equipment, and the necessary appurtenance, furniture, and fixtures first to equip for service, including the cost of inspection, setting up, and trying out, and transportation over foreign lines; also the cost of additions and betterments, such as improved appliances, parts, or appurtenances. When retired equipment is held without being torn down, the estimated value of the salvage therefrom shall be included in account 741, Other assets, until the salvage is recovered, except that the estimated scrap value of retired equipment held for sale in the ordinary course of business, and on which sale and realization of the proceeds within one year is assured, is includable in account 713, Other current assets.
                  
                  2-6 Components of construction cost. The cost of constructing property includable in the property accounts shall include the direct and other costs as described hereunder.
                  (a) Cost of labor. This includes the amount paid for labor expended by the carrier's own employees, including the cost of labor expended for preliminary work, such as sinking test holes or making soundings for tunnels, grading, buildings, and other structures; and cost of labor expended in laying and taking up tracks for temporary use in construction, except the cost of labor expended on tracks provided for the protection of traffic during the progress of addition and betterment work. The cost of labor shall also include the accounting company's expenditures for associated fringe benefits, such as vacation and holiday pay, health and welfare group insurance, pensions and retirement plans, payroll taxes and unemployment insurance. Office expenses and traveling and other personal expenses of employees, when borne by the carrier, shall be considered a part of the cost of the labor, as shall also the cost of fidelity bonds and employer's liability insurance premiums. When officers or employees are especially assigned to construction work their pay and their traveling and incidental expenses while thus engaged shall be included in the cost of the work. No charge shall be made against road and equipment accounts for the pay of officers and employees who merely render services incidentally in connection with extensions, additions, or betterments, although traveling and incidental expenses incurred by such officers and employees solely on account of such work shall be included in the account to which the cost of the work is chargeable.
                  (b) Cost of materials and supplies. This includes the purchase price of materials and supplies, including small tools, at the point of free delivery plus the cost of inspection and loading assumed by the carrier; a suitable proportion of store expenses; also sales and excise taxes on materials and supplies except as otherwise provided in the text of account 712, Material and supplies. In calculating the cost of materials used, proper allowance shall be made for the value of unused portions and of cuttings, turnings, borings, etc.; for the value of the material recovered from temporary tracks, scaffolding, cofferdams, and other temporary structures used in construction; and for the value of small tools recovered and used for other purposes.
                  (c) Cost of work-train service. This includes amounts paid to others for rent and maintenance of equipment used; cost of labor of enginemen, trainmen, and enginehousemen, including wages of engine crews and train crews held in readiness for such service; and cost of fuel and other supplies consumed in connection with the operation of work trains. It shall also include the cost of maintaining the carrier's own equipment used in construction service. Amounts representing constructive rent or return upon the investment in owned equipment shall not be included as a part of the cost of work-train service.
                  (d) Cost of special machine service. This includes the cost of labor expended and of materials and supplies consumed in maintaining and operating power shovels, scrapers, rail unloaders, ballast unloaders, pile drivers, dredges, ditchers, weed burners, and other labor-saving machines; also rents paid for use of such machines.
                  (e) Cost of transportation. This includes the amounts paid to other companies or individuals for the transportation of men, materials and supplies, special machine outfits, appliances, and tools in connection with construction. Freight charges paid foreign lines for the transportation of construction material to the carrier's line shall be included, so far as practicable, as a part of the cost of the material.
                  (f) Cost of contract work. This includes amounts paid for work performed under contract by other companies, firms, or individuals, and costs incident to the award of the contract.
                  (g) Cost of protection from casualties.

                  (h) Cost of injuries and damages. This includes expenditures on account of injuries to persons or damage to property when incurred directly as a result of construction projects, and shall be included in the cost of the work in connection with which the injury or damage occurs. It also includes that portion of premiums paid for insuring property applicable to the period prior to the completion or coming into service of the property insured. Insurance recovered on account of compensation paid for injuries to persons incident to construction shall be credited to the accounts to which such compensation is charged, and insurance recovered on account of damages to property incident to construction shall be credited to the accounts chargeable with the expenditures necessary for restoring the damaged property. The cost of injuries and damages incident to the removal of old structures, or parts thereof, shall be charged to operating expenses, except that such costs in connection with the removal of old structures which are incumberances on newly acquired lands shall be included in accounts 2, Land for transportation purposes, or 3, Grading, as appropriate.
                  (i) Cost of privileges. This includes compensation for temporary privileges, such as the use of public property or streets, in connection with the construction of the property of the carrier.
                  (j) Material excavated. The cost of disposing of material excavated in connection with construction shall be considered as a part of the cost of work, except that when such material is used for filling, the cost of removal and dumping shall be equitably apportioned between the work in connection with which the removal occurs and the work in connection with which the material is used.
                  (k) Interest cost. [See Instruction 2-1(c)].

                  2-7 Additions to and retirements of property—General. (a) In accounting for additions to and retirements and replacements of road and equipment property (excluding land) used in transportation operations, such property changes shall be considered as consisting of: (1) Units of property, and (2) other than units of property as prescribed in Instruction 2-19. Track property changes will be distinguished by units of property as approved by the Commission.

                  (b) The cost of removal of retired property, both depreciable and other than depreciable, when borne by the carrier, shall be charged, as appropriate, to account 11-13-39, Personnel—Salaries and Wages—Way and Structures—Other—Dismantling retired property, or 11-23-39. Personnel—Salaries and Wages—Equipment—Other Equipment—Dismantling retired property, and other appropriate accounts (including subactivities 11 and 12). 1

                  (c) An equitable proportion of a balance in property accounts 76, Interest During Construction, and 80, Other elements of investment, applicable to retired property shall be cleared from these accounts concurrently with the retirement accounting. Unless provided for otherwise, interest costs shall be capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

                  (d) When retired property is held and not removed, the estimated value of the salvage therefrom shall be included in account 741, Other assets, until the salvage is recovered, except that the estimated scrap value of retired property held for sale in the ordinary course of business, and on which sale and realization of the proceeds within one year is assured, is includible in account 713, Other current assets.
                  
                  (e) The accounting for track additions and retirements (with and without replacement) shall be guided by Instruction 2-10.

                  2-8 Additions to and retirements of units of property. (a) When a unit of road or equipment property is added to the plant, the cost thereof shall be included in the appropriate primary account. When a unit of property is retired, with or without replacement, the cost thereof shall be written out of the property account at time of retirement.

                  (b) When a unit of road or equipment property (or a minor item not replaced) classified as depreciable and included in the accounts prescribed for depreciable property is retired the service value shall be charged to account 735, Accumulated depreciation; Road and equipment property.
                  

                  (c) When road property (other than a minor item constituting repairs) classified as other than depreciable property is retired, the cost thereof shall be cleared from the property account and the service value shall be charged to account 61-13-99, General—Other Expenses—Way and Structures—Other—Other. When the retirement requires Board approval, the carrier shall clear the cost from the property account upon the effective date of the abandonment. Subactivities 11 and 12 also apply.
                  (d) When property included in the depreciable accounts but excluded from the depreciation base is retired, the service value (including engineering expenditures assignable to retired property but not included in the depreciation base) shall be charged to operating expense.
                  2-9 Additions and retirements of other than units of property. (a) When an item of road or equipment property, other than a complete unit, is added to the plant and the addition is not a replacement, the cost thereof shall be accounted for in the same manner as an addition of a complete unit of property, subject to the minimum rule applicable to road property (see Instruction 2-2). When an item of property other than a complete unit (minor item) is replaced, independent of the complete unit of which it is a part, the cost of replacement shall be treated as maintenance and charged to operating expenses. If the replacement constitutes an improvement then the cost of replacement should be accounted for as a rebuilding expenditure under Instruction 2-12.
                  (b) When second-hand property acquired is in such physical condition that it is necessary to rehabilitate the property to bring it up to the standard required by the carrier, the cost of such rehabilitation shall be included in the appropriate account for the property.

                  (a) When track or its components are added to the plant, the cost shall be included in the track primary account. When track components are replaced as part of a track replacement program, the replacement cost shall be accounted for as an addition to the track property account. The cost of track components which are retired with or without replacement shall be written out of the track property account at the time of retirement.

                  (b) When track is retired the service value (ledger value less net salvage) shall be charged to account 735, Accumulated depreciation; Road and equipment property.

                  2-12 Units of property rebuilt or converted—(a) Rebuilding expenditures. Carriers shall be governed by the following provisions when determining and accounting for depreciable road and equipment property rebuilding expenditures:
                  (1) Rebuilding expenditures are those cost actually incurred which substantially extend the service life or substantially increase the utility of depreciable road and equipment property. The rebuilding expenditures shall be material in nature relative to the current replacement cost of a similar new unit of road or equipment property. Expenses resulting from delayed maintenance and repairs shall not be considered in determining materiality.
                  (2) The phrase extend the service life means to extend the life of a property unit past its estimated service life.
                  (3) The term increased utility means that the road or equipment property has become more useful, more efficient, more durable, or has greater capacity.
                  (4) Rebuilt or converted road or equipment property shall be accounted for as an addition to the appropriate property accounts, with the old units accounted for as retired from service. The charge to the appropriate property accounts shall be composed of (i) the cost (estimated if necessary) less a fair allowance for depreciation, or salvage value, whichever is lower, of the parts reused, (ii) the cost of labor expended in rebuilding or in the conversion process, (iii) the cost of additional materials applied, and (iv) any other expenses incurred directly with the rebuilding or conversion. In no case shall the total amount charged to the property accounts for these units exceed the current replacement costs of similar new units that would be used for the same purpose. When a unit of road property or equipment is transferred from one class of service to another, with or without physical conversion, the unit shall be accounted for as retired from its original account and be recorded in a primary investment account appropriate to its new class of service.
                  (5) If it is necessary to repair the secondhand or reused parts remaining in a rebuilt unit, the repair cost may be added to the value assigned parts in determining the related cost to be capitalized. Associated dismantling costs shall be included in operating expenses.
                  (b) Repair expenses. Expenses pertaining to road and equipment property, which represent normal or delayed repairs and maintenance, shall be expensed in the year incurred.
                  (c) File and Storage. Carriers shall keep records of each rebuilding program readily available. These records shall be provided to representatives of the Board when requested. The retention period shall be as required by 49 CFR part 1220, Preservation of Records.

                  2-13 Changes in line of road and relocation of yard tracks.
                  

                  (a) When changes are made in a line of road for the purpose of reducing curves or grades, or to eliminate bridges, tunnels, tracks in the installation of a centralized traffic control system, or other physical features, the part of the line so changed shall be considered property retired and its ledger value credited to the property accounts. The new line of road, including land, grading, ballast, track elements, and other transportation facilities serving the road shall be considered an addition and the cost charged to the property accounts. The cost of track changes which do not involve change in the existing roadbed shall be charged to operating expenses, even though the tracks may be dismantled in the process, but the resulting track extensions or reductions shall be accounted for as additions or retirements as appropriate.
                  (b) The cost of shifting or rearranging tracks within a yard shall be charged to operating expenses, even though the tracks may be dismantled in the process, but resulting increases or decreases in grading, ballast, or track length shall be accounted for as additions or retirements, as appropriate. Where tracks in whole or in part within a yard are determined to be no longer permanently used, the ledger value of such tracks shall be eliminated from the property account. If yard tracks and facilities are constructed in another location to take the place of tracks retired, such tracks and facilities shall be accounted for as additions and the cost thereof shall be included in the property account.

                  2-14 Track connections. (a) When the accounting carrier bears the construction cost of a connecting track situated on the property of another carrier, but acquires the salvage rights to the track, the cost of the track construction shall be charged to account 731, Road and equipment property.
                  

                  (b) When carriers (1) share the cost of constructing a connecting track of which a portion is situated on each carrier's right-of-way, and (2) own and obtain the salvage rights to the track segment located on their respective properties, the construction cost borne by each carrier shall be charged to account 731, Road and equipment property.
                  

                  (c) The cost of constructing a track connection on the right-of-way of another carrier which acquires the ownership of and salvage rights to the track, shall be charged by the carrier bearing such cost to accounts 37-11-00, Purchased service—Joint facility—Debit—Way and Structures—Running, or 37-12-00, Purchased services—Joint facility—Debit—Way and Structures—Switching. The owner carrier shall charge the amount of the construction cost to account 731, Road and equipment—property, with contra credit to accounts 38-11-00, Purchases services—Joint facility—Credit—Way and Structures—Running, or 38-12-00, Purchases services—Joint facility—Credit—Way and Structures—Switching. Material amounts for such costs shall be referred to the Board for consideration and decision.

                  (d) The cost of constructing a side track under a deposit refund agreement shall be charged to account 731, Road and equipment property. The deposit shall be credited to account 782, Other liabilities. Deposit amounts refunded during the agreement period shall be charged to account 782, Other liabilities. Upon termination of the agreement, the amount of any unrefunded deposit shall be credited to the applicable primary property accounts on an equitable basis.

                  (a) When a railway or portion thereof constituting an operating unit or system is acquired in a business combination, that business combination shall be recorded in the accounts in the manner stated hereunder.
                  (b) Purchase:

                  (1) The amount includable in account 731, Road and equipment property, shall be the cost at the date of acquisition to the purchaser of the transportation property acquired. The cost assigned the property, as well as other assets acquired, shall be the amount of the cost consideration given. Where property and other assets are acquired for other than cash, including liabilities assumed and shares of stock issued, cost shall be determined by either the fair value of the consideration given or the fair value of the assets acquired, whichever is more clearly evident. In addition to any liabilities assumed, provision shall be made for such estimated liabilities as may be necessary.
                  (2) When the costs of individual units or classes of transportation property are not specified in the agreement, the cost assigned such property shall be apportioned among the appropriate primary accounts using the percentage relationship between the fair values for each class of property acquired and the total of such values.
                  (c) Merger of subsidiaries:
                  The acquisition and merger of property of subsidiaries controlled through ownership of the majority shares of voting stock is to be accounted for using the acquisition accounting methodology.

(a) When a railway reorganization or receivership has been consummated, the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and the capital stock or other securities issued or assumed, and other consideration, shall be recorded in the accounts in the manner stated hereunder. An adjustment of capitalization resulting in modification and reformation of classes of securities pursuant to voluntary action of the holders of securities but not resulting in a formal reorganization following a bankruptcy or other receivership proceedings (sometimes called a quasi-reorganization) is not covered by this instruction 2-16. Reduction of capital stock and other contributions to capital by stockholders shall be recorded in accordance with the instructions in the text of account 795, Other capital.
                  
                  (b) The amounts includable in primary road and equipment property accounts shall be recorded at cost as shown in the predecessor companies' accounts except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this instruction 2-16. The remaining assets and the liabilities of the predecessor companies, adjusted as necessary to conform with the accounting rules of the Board, together with the balances in the accumulated amortization and depreciation accounts, shall be recorded in the appropriate balance sheet accounts.
                  (c) When the amount recorded for assets acquired is more than the par or stated value of no par capital stock issued and other consideration paid, including liabilities assumed, the difference shall be applied to such extent as necessary and is available to provide first for any deficiency in past accrued depreciation on property classified as depreciable; and, second, for any estimated loss from retirement of a branch line, segment of track or other important facility indicated by supporting records to be imminent. The remaining amount of the difference, if any, shall be applied proportionately to reduce the amounts includable in the property accounts in accordance with paragraph (b) of this instruction 2-16, based on the percentage relationship between such difference and the aggregate cost of the property shown in the predecessor companies' accounts.
                  (d) When the amount applicable to the assets acquired is less than the par or stated value of no par capital stock issued and other consideration paid, including liabilities assumed, the accounting shall be referred to the Board for consideration and decision.
                  2-17 Construction projects in which governmental agencies, individuals, or others, and the carrier participate. (a) The amount includible in the property account for construction projects in which the carrier and governmental agencies, individuals, or others participate shall be (1) the payment made by the carrier for its share of the cost of construction plus (2) the recorded cost (estimated if unknown) of property relinquished as a direct result of the arrangement and retired from service less the value of salvage recovered therefrom by the carrier and less depreciation accrued on depreciable property, which is part of the carrier's cost of the project. The amount so includable in the property account shall be distributed equitably among the primary accounts applicable to railway property constructed. This amount shall first be applied to railway facilities includable in accounts other than 4, Other right-of-way expenditures, or 39, Public improvements—Construction, then any remaining balance shall be included in account 4 or 39, as appropriate. In no case shall the amount included in the primary accounts for the railway facilities acquired exceed the actual cost of constructing such facilities. The property account shall not include any cost or value for facilities or land contributed or paid for by governmental agencies, individuals or others. Property acquired as a specific contribution to capital by stockholders does not come under this rule. (See text of account 795, Other capital.)
                  (b) Construction projects as used in this section means widening of highways, construction of spillways, drainage canals, farm and other private passes, pipelines, drains or other facilities across the right-of-way; construction of overhead highway bridges, and railroad bridges over public highways and across streams, which provide a railroad use in the operation of trains and a public use in the uninterrupted passage of highway and river traffic; installation of warning signals to protect highway traffic; and industrial side tracks. Also, reconstruction and relocation of tracks and appurtenant facilities such as occur in connection with carrying out flood control, reclamation, and other public improvement projects where it becomes necessary to abandon part of the line of railroad and relocate the tracks.
                  2-18 Leased property improvements and retirements. The cost to lessee of structures, facilities, additions and betterments on leased property and for retirement of property the cost of which is included in account 732 Improvements on leased property, shall be accounted for in conformity with the principles in the instructions for property owned. When lessor's property is retired and replaced and lessee is not obligated to reimburse the lessor for the retired property other than through the replacement, the lessee shall (1) charge the cost of the replacement to account 732, Improvements on leased property, (2) discontinue accruing depreciation for lessor's retired property, and (3) when recording final settlement with the lessor, consider jointly the amount accrued in account 772, Accrued liability; Leased property, for lessor's retired property and the respective amounts for the replacement included in accounts 732, Improvements on leased property, and 733, Accumulated depreciation; Improvements on leased property. When lessee is obligated to reimburse the lessor currently or at the termination of the lease for property retired other than through replacement, the lessee shall include the amount of the obligation in the appropriate liability account. The lessee shall furnish the lessor such information as is required to enable the lessor to perform necessary accounting. The accounting by the lessee and the lessor shall be consistent with contractual arrangements.

See instruction 2-2 pertaining to the minimum rule.
                  (b) This list of units will be revised from time to time as may be necessary to meet conditions. A carrier desiring to include in any account an appropriate unit not now specified therein may, upon approval of the Board, make such authorized addition to this list of units.
                  (c) Rules applicable to units of property rebuilt or converted and to changes in line of road or tracks which involve accounting for units or property retired are set forth in instructions 2-12 and 2-13.

                  [42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 4325, Feb. 11, 1987]
                  
                  2-20 Accounting for leases. (a) Leases shall be accounted for as capital leases whenever the lease meets one or more of the following four criteria:
                  (1) The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the end of the lease term,
                  (2) The lease contains a bargain purchase option,
                  (3) The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated economic life of the property, and,
                  (4) The present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments equals or exceeds 90 percent of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at the inception of the lease less any related investment tax credit retained by the lessor.
                  (b) If the lease does not meet any of the four criteria, the lease shall be classified and accounted for as an operating lease.
                  (c) When accounting for capital leases the lessee shall record the asset and the related obligation. The amount recorded as the asset and the obligation shall be the present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments during the lease term, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor. However, if that amount exceeds the fair value of the leased property, the amount recorded as the asset and the obligation shall be the fair value. The lessee shall compute the present value of the minimum lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate unless (1) it is practicable to learn the implicit rate computed by the lessor and (2) the implicit rate computed by the lessor is less than the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. If both of those conditions are met, the lessee shall use the implicit rate.

                  (d) Leased assets that meet the criteria for classification as a capital lease shall be subject to depreciation over their useful lives in the same manner as assets owned. If the capital lease meets the criteria of either Instruction 2-20(a)(1) or 2-20(a)(2), the asset shall be amortized in a manner consistent with the lessee's normal depreciation policy for owned assets. If the lease does not meet either of these two criteria, the asset shall be amortized in a manner consistent with the lessee's normal depreciation policy except that the period of amortization shall be the lease term.
                  (e) The accounting accorded the lease shall be subject to the same considerations as other obligations in classifying them with current and noncurrent liabilities in the classified balance sheet. Leases that meet the criteria requiring capitalization shall be recorded in those accounts that provide for carrier operating property or property used in other than carrier operations, as appropriate. The accounts shall segregate the amounts pertaining to capital leases.
                  (f) If the lease qualifies as an operating lease it should be accounted for by charging the rent to expense over the lease term. The rental expense should be recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term unless another method is more representative of the use and the benefits derived.
                  (g) The criteria specified in paragraph (a) should be applied to all leases regardless of the relationship between the lessor and the lessee unless it is clear that the terms of the lease transaction have been significantly affected by their relationship. In this situation, the accounting should be modified to recognize economic substance rather than legal form.
                  (h) In the case of subsidiary companies or companies under common control whose principal business activity is leasing property or facilities to the carrier, the carrier is encouraged to request special authority to file consolidated or combined financial statements. If the carrier does not wish to file consolidated or combined financial statements, capitalization of the lease will be required if the lease meets the criteria that would require capitalization.
                  
                    Note:
                    The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting principles where an interpretation of the rules for lease accounting is needed or obtain an interpretation from its public accountant or the Board.

                  2-21 Freight train car repair costing. Class I railroads shall report the costs of repairing freight train cars by car types.
                  (a) The accounting for freight train car repair costs shall agree with the applicable instructions and texts of accounts in 49 CFR Part 1201 relating to the equipment repair process (see Note A).
                  (b) Railroads may assign either actual costs, standard costs, or a combination of both to the accounting process. Standard costs, if used, shall recognize the differences in performing repairs on various types of equipment, and the differences related to specific repair facilites. Standard costs shall be based on adequate operational data which are reviewed at least annually. The resulting variances (price, efficiency, capacity, etc.) shall be reasonably allocated back to the car types to derive the amounts reported in Form R-1.
                  (c) Railroads shall report repair costs by the freight train car types shown in Schedule 415 of Form R-1. In assigning repair costs, railroads may use either one of the following methodologies:
                  
                    Level I: Job Order Cost System
                    Railroads may use a job order cost system for assigning repair costs to the car types for freight train cars. Under this methodology, railroads shall directly match direct labor and materials with the specific unit of equipment that was repaired. Actual costs, standard costs, or a combination of both may be used as stated above.
                    Level II: Alternative Repair Costs Methodology
                    Railroads not using the job order cost system shall report freight train car repair costs by using the methodology described below:
                  
                  
                  (1) The repair costs relating to heavy, program, or project repairs of freight train cars shall be directly assigned to the car types repaired by using actual or standard costs. A heavy repair is defined as a repair that is relatively so material in cost, repair time, or physical damage that management's involvement in the determination of the repair to be made is necessary and relatively greater than usual. Program or project repairs are those repairs which are performed under a predetermined plan where estimates costs, time periods, and car types to be repaired are identified.

                  (2) The repair costs relating to light and running repairs of system cars shall be allocated to the car types by using the Association of American Railroads' Car Repair Billing System (CRBS) as the process for distributing light and running repairs. The CRBS will be the tracking system for recording the number of repairs, the car types and types of repairs. Then by applying the CRBS standard costs to the particular repairs, standard costs relationships by car type can be developed and used to distribute actual light and running repair cost pools to the car types.
                  (3) Railroads shall match repair costs billed by and paid to foreign roads with the car types that were repaired. Foreign billings for light and running repairs are usually conducted through CRBS, and therefore, the car types can be identified. For heavy off-line repairs, car type identification is possible because system management is generally involved with the authorization of such heavy repairs and car identification numbers are generally included in the billing process.
                  (4) Repair costs relating to foreign freight train cars shall also be reported by car types. However, a separate breakdown between foreign and system repair costs is not required for Board reporting purpose. Car type identification for light and running repairs to foreign cars can be obtained from CRBS tapes. The cost of heavy repairs to foreign cars should be accumulated by car types. The resulting expense credits from foreign railroads should be assigned to the car types to which they relate.
                  (5) Railroads shall match any resulting expense credits with the car types to which they relate. This can occur, for example, when a railroad is charged with the repair costs of system cars, but the responsibility of the repair ultimately rests with and is paid by a foreign road.
                  (d) Railroads shall submit to the Board any repair cost by car type methodology which does not agree with item (c) above. The Board shall review the methodology and determine if it is acceptable for reporting purposes.
                  (e) Railroads may submit justification and supporting documents requesting waiver from provisions required by this instruction. This provision is intended to provide relief for those smaller Class I railroads that might be unduly burdened by the cost of developing and maintaining the required system. Waivers shall be directed to the Board's Accounting and Valuation Board.

                  (f) Equipment repair cost records, including the allocation methods used, shall be maintained and made available to the Board upon request.

                  INSTRUCTIONS FOR MAINTENANCE EXPENSES
                  3-1 Items to be charged. (a) The accounts provided for maintenance of road property and of equipment are designed to show the cost of repairs and also the loss through depreciation of the property used in transportation operations, including expenses resulting from ordinary wear and tear of service, exposure to the elements, inadequacy, obsolesence, or other depreciation, or from accident, fire, flood, or other casualty.

                  (b) These accounts shall include the cost of labor, materials and supplies, work-train service, floating equipment work service, special machine service, contract work, privileges, protection from casualties, and other analogous items of expense in connection with the maintenance of the plant used in railway service. The cost of materials and supplies, which shall include small tools, shall include the cost at the point of free delivery plus freight charges of foreign lines, and the costs of inspection and loading assumed by the carrier; also a proportion of store expenses. Such costs shall not include expenses of transportation over the carrier's line. Royalties for patent rights on mechanical appliances used in repairs of equipment shall be included in the cost of the repairs. The cost of boarding, traveling, and other incidental expenses of employees shall be included in the accounts to which the pay of the employees is chargeable, except where otherwise specified in the text of the accounts. In calculating the cost of materials used proper allowance shall be made for the value of unused portions and of cuttings, turnings, borings, etc., and for the value of the material recovered from property repaired and from temporary tracks, scaffolding, cofferdams, and other temporary structures used in repair work.
                  (c) The cost of repairs shall include the cost of inspecting to determine the repairs necessary, and of adjusting or repairing parts, both of road property and of equipment, such as the repairing of locomotives, cars, frogs, switches, rails, etc.; the cost of inspecting and testing after repairs have been made such as the testing of locomotives after repairs to determine whether the repairs have been properly made, and the running of repaired locomotives light in order to break them in for regular service; incidental costs of repairs, such as the construction or removal of false work in connection with maintenance, cost of demolishing retired road property and disposing of the wreckage therefrom when the property is dismantled by or for the carrier; cost of maintaining or protecting traffic during the progress of construction work, including the cost of constructing, maintaining and removing temporary tracks required for maintaining traffic during the progress of the work; cost of mowing and beautifying grounds around buildings; repairing fences, sidewalks, driveways, and streets within or adjacent to such grounds; cost of removing snow from roofs of buildings (when not removed by those employed in the buildings); cost of periodical restorations of seasonal features, such as gardens, shrubbery, and lawns; cost of operating hothouses in connection with the work of beautifying grounds; and cost of clearing and removing casual incumbrances, such as ice, snow, and fallen timber.
                  (d) An employee's job classification shall not govern the accounting for work performed. Charges to a particular expense function shall be based on the nature of the work performed.

                  INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEPRECIATION ACCOUNTS
                  4-1 Method. (a) There shall be charged monthly to operating expenses or other appropriate accounts and credited to account 735, Accumulated depreciation; Road and equipment property, during the service life of depreciable road and equipment property, includable in accounts classed as depreciable, amounts which will approximate the loss in service value not restored by current repairs or covered by insurance. The charges for accruing depreciation currently shall be computed in conformity with the group plan by applying to the cost of property such percentage rates as will distribute the service value by the straight-line method in equal annual charges to operating expenses or other accounts during the estimated life of the property. In the case of track accounts 8, 9 and 11, service value shall reflect net salvage value. For road property, the cost shall be original cost or estimated original cost, as used in the valuation records, adjusted to current date. If a carrier submits proof that the actual cost of depreciable property is substantially different from cost figures in the valuation records, the carrier may, with the approval of the Board, use such cost figures as the depreciation base.
                  (b) The term group plan means the plan under which depreciation charges are accrued upon the basis of the cost of depreciable property includable in accounts classed as depreciable using the service lives of the individual depreciable units in the accounts and properly weighing to determine the composite annual rate of depreciation.

                  (c) For the purpose of the group plan of depreciation accounting, the following primary accounts are classed as depreciable accounts:

The composite rates shall be based on the results of a depreciation study performed by each railroad. A depreciation study shall, in general, contain the following components:
                  (i) Actuarial or semiactuarial methods for determining service lives for road and equipment properties;
                  (ii) Salvage value calculations for road and equipment properties;
                  (iii) Accumulated depreciation for each account or subaccount as appropriate;
                  (iv) Other factors and related calculations involving the depreciation process; and
                  (v) A commentary on any adjustments and judgmental factors used in the study.
                  (b) Railroads shall submit to the Board for review and approval a report on depreciation studies and proposed depreciation rates every three years for equipment property, and every six years for road property. Railroads can, however, submit depreciation studies prior to its scheduled year, in which case a new cycle will begin.
                  (c) In computing monthly depreciation charges, the annual percentage rates shall be applied to the depreciation base as of the first of each month and the results shall be divided by twelve.
                  (d) Class II railroads are exempt from the three-year and six-year cyclical reviews, but shall submit depreciation studies when requested by the Board. Class III railroads are not required to submit depreciation studies.
                  (e) A separate track depreciation rate shall apply to each primary property account in each track density category as provided in Instruction 4-3(d). Track depreciation rates shall be developed by estimating the average life based on an acceptable depreciation methodology, consistently applied, including as an option the units of production method based on gross ton-miles per mile of track.

                  4-3 Depreciation records to be kept. (a) The carrier shall maintain for each class of property in convenient and accessible form engineering and other data bearing on prospective service lives.

                  (b) The carrier also shall keep such records of depreciable property and property retirements as will reflect the service life of each class of property which has been retired, or will permit the determination of service life indications by past experience of useful life tenure of comparable property, turnover, or other appropriate methods; also such records as will reflect the percentage of value of the salvage for property retired from each class of depreciable property.
                  (c) For purposes of analysis the carrier shall maintain subsidiary records in which the accumulated depreciation account is broken down into component parts corresponding to each primary account to show the current credits and debits and the balance for each account. Such detailed information shall be reported annually to this Board. For balance sheet purposes, the accumulated depreciation account shall be treated as a single composite account for depreciable property.
                  (d) Carriers shall be prepared to justify all track depreciation rates by keeping appropriate data on the service lives and salvage values of track components which went into the life and net salvage computation of each primary account in each density category.
                  (e) The investment and related accumulated depreciation for accounts 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 39 must be maintained by distinct traffic density categories. Each line segment shall be identified on January 1 of each year as belonging to one of the following traffic density classes, based on the average traffic density in the preceding three years:
                  Density

                      Lines carrying at least 20 million gross ton-miles per mile on an annual basis and not designated as belonging to Density Class III.
                    
                    
                      II 
                      Lines carrying less than 20 million gross ton-miles per mile on an annual basis and not designated as belonging to Density Class III.
                    
                    
                      III 
                      Lines identified as potentially subject to abandonment pursuant to Section 10904 of the Interstate Commerce Act.
                    
                    
                      IV 
                      Yard and way switching tracks.

                    Note A:
                    For purposes of designating line segments as belonging to one of the density classes, the carrier shall consider all traffic carried over the segment whether in the carrier's trains or in the trains of other carriers (estimated if not known).
                  
                  
                    Note B:
                    When a carrier operates systems of parallel tracks on a single roadbed, the density associated with the related segment of a rail route shall be the aggregate gross ton-miles on all individual tracks.
                  

                  [42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 46 FR 20210, Apr. 3, 1981; 48 FR 7183, Feb. 18, 1983; 52 FR 4321, Feb. 11, 1987]
                  
                  4-4 Leased property—depreciation. (a) The carrier shall include in operating expenses charges for depreciation on road property and equipment used but not owned, the rent for which is includable in the lease rental accounts, and shall maintain the same records of service lives, salvage values, etc., as provided for owned road property and equipment. The excess of the total compensation paid over the amount chargeable for depreciation shall be included in the rent account. If settlement between the carrier and the lessor is not currently made, the amount of the depreciation accrued during the period of the lease shall be credited by the carrier to account 772. Accrued liability; Leased property. The necessary adjustments of the difference between the balance thus accrued in that account and the actual amount of settlement shall be made appropriately through accounts 519, Miscellaneous income, or 551, Miscellaneous income charges, at the time settlement for depreciation on the property is made with the lessor.
                  (b) The carrier shall not include in the depreciation account in operating expenses any charges for depreciation of equipment used but not owned when the rents therefor are not included in the lease rental accounts but shall include such charges in the appropriate other rent expense accounts.
                  4-5 Jointly used property—depreciation. The owning carrier shall include in the depreciation accounts in operating expenses the charges for depreciation on units of depreciable property jointly used with one or more other carriers. The owning carrier shall credit and each using carrier shall charge the appropriate joint facility accounts in operating expenses with the amounts billed by the owning carrier against each using carrier for its proportion of the service loss on property retired from service whether billed currently as depreciation or when retirements occur as the loss in service value. The using carriers shall be required to account for depreciation or retirement of units of road property jointly used but not owned to the extent of their contract liability. The same principle shall apply to terminal companies and their nonowner tenants in accounting for depreciation accruals or retirement charges recorded in the accounts of the terminal companies.
                  INSTRUCTIONS FOR INCOME AND BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTS
                  5-1 Current assets. (a) In the group of accounts designated as current assets shall be included cash, those assets which are readily convertible into cash or are held for current use in operations, current claims against others and amounts accruing to the carrier which are subject to settlement in the ordinary course of business within one year. There shall not be included in this group of accounts any amount the collection of which is not reasonably assured within one year because of the known financial conditions of the debtor or otherwise. Such items shall be included in account 741, Other assets, at an amount not in excess of a reasonable estimate of realizable value. Items of current character but of doubtful value shall be written down or written off by charge to account 63-61-00, General—Uncollectible accounts—General and administrative, or account 553, Uncollectible accounts, as appropriate. Adjustment of these items of doubtful value shall be made by direct reduction of the asset account in which such items are carried or by provision in account 709.5, Allowance for uncollectible accounts, for the estimated uncollectible amount.

                  (b) The carrier shall transfer the estimated realizable value of obsolete material to account 741, Other assets, equitably distribute the loss due to obsolescence among the accounts ordinarily chargeable for such classes of material, and concurrently credit account 712, Material and Supplies.
                  
                  5-2 Recorded value of securities owned. (a)(1) The investment in securities other than those issued or assumed by the accounting company shall be recorded in these accounts at cost, but excluding amounts paid for accrued interest and accrued dividends.
                  (2) Account 702, Temporary cash investments, account 721, Investments and advances; affiliated companies, and account 722, Other investments and advances, shall be maintained in such a manner as to reflect the marketable equity portion (see definition 26) and other securities or investments.
                  (3) For the purpose of determining net ledger value, the marketable equity securities in account 702 shall be considered the current portfolio and the marketable equity securities in accounts 721 and 722 (combined) shall be considered the noncurrent portfolio.

                  (4) Carriers will categorize their security investments as held-to-maturity, trading, or available-for-sale. Unrealized holding gains and losses on trading type investment securities will be recorded in account 551, Miscellaneous income charges. Unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale type investment securities will be recorded in account 799.1, Other comprehensive income.
                  
                  (5) If there is a change in the classification of a marketable equity security between current and noncurrent, the security shall be transferred at the lower of its cost or market value at date of transfer. If market value is less than cost, the market value shall become the new cost basis, and the difference shall be accounted for as if it were a realized loss and included in the determination of net income.

                  (6) The accounting company shall write down the ledger value of any securities to the extent of impairment in their value or write off entirely if there is no reasonable prospect of realizing any value therefrom. For long term investments in marketable equity securities, when the decline in market value below cost is judged to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the individual security shall be writen down to a new cost basis. The amount of the write-down shall be accounted for as realized loss by a charge to account 551, Other Income Charges, and a credit to account 723, Reserve for Adjustment of Investment in Securities. The new cost basis shall not be changed for subsequent recoveries in value.

                  (b)(1) For financial statement purposes the carrier shall follow the principles of equity accounting for (1) all investments in corporate joint ventures (see definition 21(c)), and (2) all investments in voting stock of affiliated companies giving the carrier the ability to significantly influence the operating and financial policies of an investee (see definition 21(b)). For purposes of this instruction an investment of 20 percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of an investee will indicate the ability to exercise significant influence over an investee in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
                  (2) Since the equity method is not to be effected by entries in the books of accounts but is to apply only in financial reports to the Board, the carrier shall establish worksheet or memorandum accounts. Three basic worksheet or memorandum accounts are needed:
                  (i) An investment account to include (1) equity in the undistributed earnings or losses of the investee since the date of acquisition (see definition 21(g)); (2) accumulated amortization of the difference between cost and net assets at date of acquisition (see (b)(3) below); and other adjustments for disposition or writedown of investments.
                  (ii) An income account to include (1) the investor's share of the investee's undistributed profits or losses for each reporting period subsequent to acquisition of the investment except that in the year of acquisition such amount shall be determined from the date of acquisition; (2) amortization for the reporting period of the difference between cost and net assets at date of acquisition. This account shall be closed at year-end to the retained earnings memorandum account discussed in paragraph (iii) below.
                  (iii) A retained earnings account to include (1) equity in the undistributed earnings or losses of the investee since the date of acquisition; (2) accumulated amortization of the difference between cost and net assets acquired at date of acquisition (see (b)(3) below).
                  (iv) Other memorandum accounts will be needed for such adjustments as gains and losses on disposition of investments, recognition of impairments in value, the investor's share of extraordinary and prior period adjustments reported in the investee's financial statements (see instruction 1-2(d)), and provision for deferred taxes where it is reasonable to assume that undistributed earnings of an investee will be transferred to the investor in a taxable distribution. These memorandum accounts shall be closed at year-end to the retained earnings memorandum account discussed in paragraph (iii) above.
                  (3) The carrier shall retain the following information for each investee in support of the worksheet or memorandum accounts:
                  (i) Original cost of investment.
                  (ii) Equity in net assets of investee at date of acquisition.
                  (iii) Allocation of difference between cost and equity in net assets, namely, to specific assets of investee or to goodwill.
                  (iv) Accumulated amortization of difference between cost and equity in net assets.
                  (v) Unamortized balance of difference between cost and equity in net assets.
                  (vi) Equity in undistributed earnings/losses for each year since date of acquisition.
                  (vii) Dividends received since date of acquisition if determinable.
                  (viii) Proceeds from sale of investments.
                  (4) Any difference between the investor's cost and its share of the net assets of the investee at date of acquisition shall be allocated to specific assets of the investee to the extent the difference is attributable to them. When the difference is allocated to depreciable or amortizable assets, depreciation and amortization (through the investment and income memorandum accounts) should absorb the difference over the remaining life of the related assets. If the difference is not related to specific accounts, it should be considered goodwill and amortized over a reasonable period not to exceed 40 years. For investments made prior to November 1, 1970, amortization of goodwill is not required in the absence of evidence that the goodwill has a limited term of existence.
                  (5) The financial statements of the investee that are used for equity accounting should be timely. If the accounting year of the investee differs from that of the investor then the most recent available financial statements may be used. The lag in reporting should be consistent from period to period.

                  (6) Material profits or losses on transactions between the investor and investee shall be eliminated until realized by either company as if the two were consolidated.
                  (7) A transaction of the investee of a capital nature that affects the investor's share of the investee's stockholder's equity should be reported in the financial statements as if the two were consolidated.
                  (8) The investor shall deduct any dividends applicable to outstanding cumulative preferred stock whether or not declared, and any other dividends declared when computing its share of undistributed earnings or losses.
                  (9) The investor shall suspend application of the equity method when the investment (including the investment memorandum account) together with any net advances made to the investee is reduced to zero. Additional losses shall not be provided for unless the investor has guaranteed obligations of the investee or is otherwise committed to provide further financial support for the investee. If the investee subsequently reports net income the investor shall resume applying the equity method at such time as its share of that net income equals the share of net losses not recognized during the period of suspension.
                  (10) When the investor's voting stock interest falls below the level of ownership described in paragraph (b)(1) of this instruction, the investment no longer qualifies for the equity method. Should dividends received on the investment in subsequent periods exceed the investor's share of earnings for such periods, the investment memorandum and income memorandum accounts shall be reduced by the excess amount.
                  (11) When the level of ownership of an investment increases to that described in paragraph (b)(1) of this instruction, the equity method shall be applied. The memorandum accounts for the investment, income (for current year's equity in undistributed earnings less amoritzation), and retained earnings (for prior years' equity in undistributed earnings less amortization) shall be adjusted retroactively on a step-by-step basis determining the equity in net assets at date of acquisition, amortization adjustment, and equity in undistributed earnings or losses at each level of ownership. Where small purchases are made over a period of time and then a purhase is made which qualifies the investment for the equity method, the date of latest purchase may be used as date of acquisition.
                  (12) Information having significance with respect to the investor's ownership in investees shall be disclosed in notes to financial statements of annual reports filed with the Board in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
                  (c) When securities with a fixed maturity date are purchased at a discount (i.e., when total cost including brokerage fees, taxes, commissions, etc., is less than par), such discounts may be amortized over the remaining life of the securities through periodic debits to the account in which the securities are carried (preferably coincident with entries recording interest accruals) and credits to the same account in which interest income is credited. No debits shall be made in respect to discounts upon securities held as investments or in special funds if there is reason to believe that such securities will be disposed of by redemption or otherwise at less than par or will not be paid at date of maturity. When securities with a fixed maturity date are purchased at a premium (i.e., when the total cost including brokerage fees, taxes, commissions, etc., is in excess of par), such premium may be amortized over the remaining life of the securities through periodic credits to the account in which the securities are carried (preferably coincident with entries recording interest accruals) and debits to the same accounts in which the interest income is recorded.
                  
                    Note:
                    The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting principles where an interpretation of the rules for equity accounting is needed or obtain an interpretation from its public accountant or the Board.
                  
                  [81 FR 19908, Apr. 6, 2016]
                  5-3 Discounts, expenses, and premiums on debt. (a) Ledger accounts shall be provided to cover the discounts, expenses, and premiums on the sale or resale of each subclass of funded debt and of receivers' and trustees' securities issued for the benefit of or assumed by the company. (For explanation of subclass see account 765, Funded debt unmatured.) The net debit balances remaining in the ledger accounts for discount and premium shall be included in account 770.1, Unamortized debt discount, and the net credit balances in account 770.2, Unamortized premium on debt. Debt expense shall be included in account 743, Other deferred debits.
                  

                  (b) Each fiscal period there shall be charged to account 548, Amortization of discount on funded debt, a proportion on a consistent basis of each of the debit balances in the discount and premium accounts and correspondingly there shall be credited to income account 517, Release of premiums on funding debt, a similar proportion of each of the credit balances in these accounts. Related debt expense shall also be charged to account 548 on a proportional and consistent basis. The amounts for the respective debit balances for discount and expenses applicable to a particular issue of obligations may be charged directly to account 548 at time of issue when the aggregate of such amounts does not appreciably affect the accounts. The method of apportioning debt discount, issue costs, and premium to accounts 517 and 548 shall be the interest method, where the effective interest rate on the date of issuance is applied to the carrying value (debt, less related discount, and issue cost, plus related premium of each specific issue to the beginning of any given period.) However, other methods of amortization may be used if the results obtained are not materially different from those which would result from the interest method.

                  (c) When any funded debt which has been actually issued to bona fide holders for value is reacquired by the accounting company, that proportion of the balance remaining in accounts containing discount, expense and premium on funded debt for the subclass of the security reacquired applicable to the portion reacquired shall be credited or charged thereto, as appropriate, and concurrently charged or credited to account 519, Miscellaneous income, account 551, Miscellaneous income charges; or to account 570, Extraordinary items, as appropriate, in accordance with the text of these accounts. Such proportion shall be based upon the ratio of the par value of the security reacquired to the par value of all the securities of the subclass actually outstanding immediately before such reacquirement. Gains and losses from extinguishment of debt (excluding debt maturing serially) which is acquired to satisfy sinking fund requirements, shall not be recorded as extraordinary items regardless of amount, but shall be included in accounts 519 and 551, as appropriate. Such gains and losses shall be separately disclosed in reports to this Board.

                  [42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 4325, Feb. 11, 1987; 81 FR 19908, Apr. 6, 2016]
                  
                  5-4 Discount, premium, and assessment on capital stock. (a) Separate ledger accounts shall be provided for each subclass of capital stock issued or assumed by the accounting company to cover discount suffered and premium realized at the time of sale of capital stock. General levies or assessments against stockholders shall be credited to the appropriate ledger accounts for the subclass of capital stock against which the levy or assessment is made.

                  (b) The total of net debit balance in these ledger accounts shall be included in account 793, Discount on capital stock, and the total of net credit balances in account 794, Premiums and assessments on capital stock.
                  

                  (c) Discount on each subclass of capital stock may be offset or reduced by charges to account 794, Premiums and assessments on capital stock, to the extent that net gains from premiums or assessments have been included therein or to account 795, Other capital, to the extent that net gains from reacquisition and resale or retirement of capital stock applicable to such subclass have been included therein. Any remaining discount may be amortized by charge to account 616. Other debits to retained earnings, or may be retained and carried in account 793, Discount on capital stock, until the stock to which the discount applies is retired.

                  (d) In case the accounting company is permitted and elects with the approval of the Board, to distribute all or any part of the net balance of other paid-in capital to its stockholders, the amount thus distributed shall be charged to account 795, Other capital.
                    
                  

                  (e) When capital stock is reacquired, either by purchase or donation, and is retired or cancelled, account 791, Capital stock, shall be charged with the par value, stated value of no par stock, or if no par stock without stated value, the proportionate amount at which the particular class of stock is included in account 791. Any excess of reacquisition cost over the recorded value of the stock shall be charged to account 795, Other capital, to the extent of the accumulated net gains included in this account applicable to reacquisition and resale or retirement of such subclass. Any remaining excess reacquisition cost shall be charged to account 616, Other debits to retained earnings. Any excess of recorded value over reaquisition cost shall be credited to account 795, Other capital.
                  

                  (f) When capital stock is reacquired, either by purchase or donation, and is not retired or cancelled, nor properly includable in sinking or other funds, the reacquisition cost shall be charged to account 798.5, Treasury stock.
                  

                  (g) When treasury stock is resold, account 798.5, Treasury stock, shall be credited with the cost paid for it. Gains shall be credited to account 795, ‘Other capital.’ Losses shall be charged to account 795, Other capital, to the extent that previous net gains from sales or retirements of the same class of stock are included therein; otherwise, to account 616, Other debits to retained earnings.
                  
                  5-5 Joint liabilities. The accounting company shall state as a liability in its balance sheet the difference between the total par value of securities jointly or severally issued by it and others and the portion of such liability which, under the joint arrangement, it is expected will be liquidated by the other party or parties to the joint arrangement. The amount of the jointly or severally issued securities expected to be liquidated by the other party or parties shall be shown as a contingent liability in accordance with instruction 5-6 pertaining to contingent assets and liabilities.
                  5-6 Contingencies. (a) The proper accounting treatment for contingencies depends upon whether the contingency is: Probable: the event or events are likely to occur; Reasonably possible: the chance of occurrence of the future event or events is more than remote, but less than likely; or Remote: the chance of occurrence of the future event or events is slight.
                  (b) Loss contingencies must be accrued when they are probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Where they are only reasonably possible, only footnote disclosure is required. Where they are remote, footnote disclosure is not required, but is permitted.
                  (c) Gain contingencies usually are not reflected in the accounts since to do so might be to recognize revenue prior to its realization. Adequate disclosure shall be made of contingencies that might result in gain, but care shall be exercised to avoid misleading implications as to the likelihood of realization.

                  [42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 4326, Feb. 11, 1987]
                  
                  5-7 Long-term obligations. Commitments under unconditional purchase obligations associated with suppliers' financing arrangements and future payments on long-term borrowings and redeemable stock shall be disclosed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Such disclosures shall not preclude accounting recognition if the substance of a financing arrangement is the acquisition of an asset or incurrence of a liability.
                  [47 FR 4266, Jan. 29, 1982, as amended at 52 FR 4321, Feb. 11, 1987]
                  INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLEARING ACCOUNTS
                  6-1 Items to be charged. In recognition of the fact that certain expenditures incident to the construction and the operation of property are not chargeable directly to any particular property investment or expense account, clearing accounts have been provided for the purpose of securing an equitable distribution of such items to the proper primary accounts.
                  6-2 Material and stationery store expenses. (a) To clearing accounts called Material store expenses and Stationery store expenses shall be charged expenses in connection with purchasing, handling and storing material and stationery in and distributing it from the company's storehouses. Including the pay of officers and employees in the purchasing and store departments and their traveling, office, and other expenses; also expenses, including wages, fuel, and supplies, of operating switching locomotives when exclusively assigned to the service of switching at material storehouses. (Expenses of incidental switching at material yards by locomotives in regular switching service shall be charged to the appropriate transportation accounts.) The pay and expenses of men employed in purchasing or inspecting a single class of material, such as ties, shall be added as store expenses to the cost of that particular material.
                  (b) The total amount of storehouse expenses charged to these accounts shall be distributed among the accounts to which material and stationery has been charged, in proportion to the amounts charged to each account for the items issued, except that the amount representing the purchasing department expenses shall be apportioned on the value of the items issued which were purchased by that department. To avoid monthly fluctuations in the ratio of store expenses to the value of material and stationery purchased or issued, carriers may make a monthly apportionment on the basis of fair percentage rates, provided the store expense accounts are adjusted and closed out at the end of each year.
                  6-3 Shop expenses. (a) To a clearing account entitled Shop expenses shall be charged items of expense at shops, enginehouses, repair tracks, and other places where mechanical work is performed, not assignable directly to specific accounts. Such expenses shall be apportioned among the various accounts affected. The basis of distribution shall be the relative proportion which the total amount of charges to Shop expenses bears to the total of the directly distributed labor. To avoid monthly fluctuations in the ratio of shop expenses to the total of distributed labor, carriers are permitted to make the monthly apportionment on the basis of a percentage of the distributed labor, provided the shop expense account is adjusted and closed out at the end of the year.
                  (b) The expenses assignable to this account shall include the pay of foremen (who exercise supervision over all departments), their clerks, and other employees engaged in general work in and about shops, cost of heat, light and power; cost of small tools and supplies and water and power purchased; also cost of removal of snow and ice from transfer tables and shop yards, and other incidental shop expenses. To this account shall be charged expenses, including wages, fuel and supplies, of operating switching locomotives when exclusively assigned to switching service at shops (the expenses of incidental switching at shops by locomotives in transportation switching service shall be charged to appropriate transportation accounts).
                  6-4 Gravel and sand pits and quarries. (a) When a gravel or sand pit or quarry is opened for operations likely to extend over a long period, an account shall be set up designated, Operations of gravel pit at _______, or Operations of quarry at ____, as the case may be. To this account shall be charged cost of the land in excess of its estimated value after the gravel, sand, or stone has been removed (credit to the property account in which the cost of the land is included); payments for right to enter upon and remove ballast from land not owned by the carrier; cost of sinking test holes; and costs preparatory to opening the pit or quarry. To this account shall be charged also the cost, in excess of the estimated salvage value, of rails and fastenings, ties, other material and labor used in constructing tracks to and in the gravel pit or quarry (the estimated salvage being carried in an appropriate suspense account); cost of labor and train service employed in producing, quarrying, and loading ballast, including the cost of operation, repairs, and depreciation of power shovels and other machines and machinery; pay and expenses of watchmen; cost of explosives and hand tools, and miscellaneous expenses; and cost of installing, operating and maintaining signals and interlockers at gravel pits.

                  (b) Credit to the clearing account shall be made each month to cover the cost of ballast material produced during the month. The cost of production shall include the expenses directly assignable to the monthly output plus a proportion of the expenses not directly assignable, such as cost of land, tracks, machinery, and interlockers. This latter amount shall be computed upon the basis of the ratio which the monthly output bears to the total estimated yardage to be taken from the pit. When any portion of the product of such pits or quarries is sold, the cost thereof shall be credited to this clearing account and any related profit shall be credited to account 110, Incidental.
                  
                  6-5 Power plant operations. (a) The accounting for the expenses of maintaining and operating an electric, steam, or other power plant (both building and machinery) shall be determined by the purpose for which the power produced is used. When a power plant is intended and used for producing power solely for the carrier's own operations and the cost of operating the plant is chargeable to clearing account Shop expenses, or to any one specific account for operating expenses, the expenses of maintenance shall be charged to the appropriate maintenance accounts, and the cost of operation to the account appropriate according to the use of the power.

                  (b) When the power from such a plant is properly chargeable to more than one account, the expenses of maintaining and operating the plant shall be included in clearing account designated Power plant operations. The expense of maintenance shall be cleared from that account to the appropriate maintenance accounts. The expenses of operation shall be apportioned to the appropriate accounts upon the basis of quantity of power used for the various purposes.

                  (c) When a part of the power produced by a power plant is sold and the remainder is used in the carrier's own operations, the cost of maintaining and operating the plant shall be charged to a clearing account. The expense of maintenance shall be cleared from that account to the appropriate maintenance accounts. The proportion of the expenses of operation assignable to the power sold, on the basis of ratio of quantity of power sold to total quantity of power produced, shall be credited to this clearing account and any related profit shall be credited to account 110, Incidental. The remainder of the cost of operation shall be distributed to the appropriate expense accounts for the carrier's own operations.

                  (d) When power plants are intended and used solely for furnishing power to others, their investment cost shall be included in account 737, Property used in other than carrier operations, and the revenues and operating expenses shall be included in the accounts provided for operations of such property.
                  (e) The accounting for the maintenance of transmission systems and distribution systems shall be in accordance with instructions pertaining to power plant operations.

                  General Expenditures
                  70 General expenditures.

                  The primary accounts of this general account are designed to include expenditures made in connection with the acquisition and construction of original road and equipment, and with extension, additions, and betterments to road and equipment property, when such expenditures cannot properly be included in any of the foregoing accounts as a part of the cost of any specific work. When assignable, such expenditures shall be included in the cost of the property for which the expenditures occurred.
                  76 Interest during construction.
                  (a) When any bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness are sold, or any interest-bearing debt is incurred for acquisition and construction of original road and equipment, extensions, additions, and betterments, the interest accruing on the part of the debt representing the cost of property chargeable to road and equipment accounts (less interest, if any, allowed by depositaries on unexpended balances) after such funds become available for use and before the receipt or the completion or coming into service of the property so acquired shall be charged to this account.
                  (b) When such securities are sold at a premium, the proportion of such premium assignable to the time between the date of the actual issuance of the securities and the time when the property acquired or the improvement made becomes available for service shall be credited to this account.

                  (c) This account shall also include such proportion of the discount and expense on funded debt issued for the acquisition of original road, original equipment, road extensions, additions, and betterments, as is equitably assignable to the period between the date of the actual issuance of securities and the time when the property acquired or the improvement made become available for the service for which it is intended. The proportion of discount and expense thus chargeable shall be determined by the ratio between the period prior to the completion or coming into service of the facilities or improvements acquired and the period of the entire life of the securities issued.
                  
                  
                    Note A:
                    Interest on bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness accruing before the proceeds from the sale of the securities become available for use shall not be included in this account, nor shall there be included any interest accruing after the property with respect to which the proceeds are expended is received or becomes available for use in connection with commercial service.
                  
                  
                    Note B:
                    If securities issued or assumed by the carrier are subsequently sold or exchanged by or for the carrier, the excess of the par value and accrued interest of the securities over the actual money value of the consideration received shall be deemed a discount. In no case (except as provided in the third paragraph of this account) shall discount be included as part of the cost of items included in the accounts prescribed in this classification.
                  
                  
                    Note C:
                    Whenever interest, premium, or discount assignable to the construction period is incurred in connection with an expenditure covered by some specific road and equipment account or accounts, such interest, premium, or discount shall be charged directly to the specific accounts to which it is related. Unless provided for otherwise, interest costs shall be capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
                  
                  
                    Note D:
                    This account shall not include interest during the construction period on the carrier's own funds expended in connection with the acquisition or construction of original road and equipment, extensions, additions, and betterments.

                  Other Property Accounts
                  80 Other elements of investment.
                  (a) This account shall include amounts resulting from adjustment of the primary property accounts to conform with cost of property in valuation records. The amount in this account shall be cleared on a consistent basis as property is retired from service or otherwise in accordance with the rules in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this account. Any material amount in this account assignable to property previously retired from service shall be cleared immediately.

                  (b) When property is retired from service, an equitable portion of the balance in this account assignable to such property shall be cleared when the retirement entry is made. The amount so cleared, when a debit, shall be charged to account 551, Miscellaneous income charges, or, when a credit, shall be recorded in account 519, Miscellaneous income. The exception to this general rule with respect to a credit balance assignable to property retired is that when property classified as depreciable is retired from service and the balance in the accumulated depreciation account for the property is materially deficient, because of sudden retirement or other unusual cause, the portion of a credit balance cleared for the retirement, equal to the deficiency, shall be applied to reduce the amount of loss otherwise chargeable to the accumulated depreciation account.

                  (c) A carrier may apply to the Board for authority to clear the entire balance from this account immediately or amortize the balance over a short period of time by appropriate inclusion in account 616, Other debits to retained earnings, or account 606 Other credits to retained earnings. Any amount so authorized or directed by the Board to be cleared and written off to retained income shall be in lieu of amounts includible in accounts indicated in paragraph (b).

                      1 Each operating expense account has a six-digit code divided into three two-digit groups. The first two-digit group denotes the natural expense [see control column], the second group denotes the activity/subactivity for freight, passenger or common service [see Table F]; and the third group signifies applicable function assignment [see Tables B, C, D & E].
                    
                      2 The account numbers shown on this matrix are for freight only. The account numbers for passenger and common are derived by applying the natural expense code (first two digits) to the activity codes shown in Table F. Natural expenses are used only in the same activities as shown for freight.
                    
                      3 Expenses shall be reported by applicable functions [see account text].

Taxes on gasoline, other motor fuel, and motor oil are also includible in this account.

                  (b) Materials recovered for reuse in connection with construction, maintenance, or the retirement of property shall be charged to this account at cost, or average cost, estimated if not known, less accumulated depreciation, if any, plus the cost to restore the materials to a serviceable condition, or current market value, whichever is lower.

                  (c) Scrap and other nonusable materials, including obsolete parts, shall be included in account 713, “Other current assets,” at the estimated salvage value when the sale of the materials is imminent and there is a relatively firm market price. Obsolete parts not subject to imminent sale shall be included in account 741, “Other assets,” at their net realizable value.
                  (d) Material and supplies shall be credited to this account and charged to the appropriate operating expense or other account on the basis of recorded cost, average cost, or other recognized pricing system, provided that such system is consistently applied and is based on the cost of such material and supplies.
                  (e) An inventory of material and supplies shall be taken during each calendar year and the necessary adjustments to bring this account into harmony with the actual inventory balances shall be made in the accounts of the year in which the inventories are taken. In effecting this adjustment, determined differences in accounting for important classes of material shall be equitably assigned among the accounts to which the classes of material are ordinarily chargeable. Other differences shall be equitably apportioned among the primary accounts to which material has been charged since the last inventory. (Also see instruction 5-1(b).)

The ineffective portion of the cash-flow hedge will be charged to the same income or expense account that would have been used if the hedged item had been disposed of or otherwise settled.

                  (c) When a carrier designates a derivative instrument as a fair-value hedge, it will record the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument in this account with a concurrent charge to a sub-account of the asset or liability that carries the item being hedged. The ineffective portion of the fair-value hedge will be charged to the same income or expense account that would have been used if the hedged item had been disposed of or otherwise settled.

                  This account shall be credited with the amount accrued for Federal income taxes which has been concurrently charged to the appropriate income or other authorized accounts. Credits to this account that are based upon estimates shall be adjusted during the year so that this account may show, as nearly as practicable the approximate amount of the carrier's unpaid liability for such taxes.

                  (a) This account shall be credited with the accruals of all taxes, other than income taxes, which have been concurrently charged to the appropriate income or other accounts for taxes. Such accruals may be based upon estimates, provided such estimates shall be adjusted during the year so that this account may show, as nearly as practicable, the approximate amount of the carrier's unpaid liability for such taxes. Payments of taxes for which accruals have been made shall be debited to this account.
                  (b) The records supporting the entries in this account shall be kept to show separately by classes of taxes the amount of the tax accruals for the current year and adjustments of accruals for prior years.

The ineffective portion of the cash-flow hedge will be charged to the same income or expense account that would have been used if the hedged item had been disposed of or otherwise settled.
                  (c) A carrier will record the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument liability related to a fair-value hedge in this account, with a concurrent charge to a sub-account of the asset or liability that carries the item being hedged. The ineffective portion of the fair-value hedge will be charged to the same income or expense account that would have been used if the hedged item had been disposed of or otherwise settled.

                  (a) This account shall include the total par value of unmatured debt (other than equipment obligations), maturing more than one year from the close of the accounting period, including obligations due within one year which are expected to be refinanced on a long-term basis (see note B to account 751, “Loans and notes payable”), whether the securities were issued by the accounting company or the payment was assumed by the accounting company after being issued as the debt of other companies. (See account 764, “Equipment obligations and other long-term debt due within one year.”)
                  (b) The amounts included in this account shall be divided to show the par value of (1) certificates or other evidences of funded debt (pledged and unpledged) held in the company's treasury, by its agents or trustees, or otherwise subject to its control, including both those reacquired after actual issue and those nominally but never actually issued; and (2) certificates or other evidences of funded debt issued and actually outstanding, being those not held by the company, its agents or trustees, or subject to its control.
                  (c) The amounts included herein shall be further divided so as to show the amount of each class of funded debt, as follows:

                  (4) Miscellaneous obligations. All funded obligations not provided for by the other subdivisions of this account, also notes, unsecured certificates of indebtedness, debenture bond, plain bonds, real estate mortgages executed or assumed and other similar obligations maturing more than one year from date of issue, but excluding liabilities for assessments for public improvements and those evidenced by conditional or deferred equipment purchase contracts for which provision is made in accounts 782, “Other liabilities,” and 766, “Equipment obligations,” respectively.
                  (5) Receipts outstanding for funded debt. Receipts for payments on account of funded debt. When certificates are issued for such payments, the par value shall be included in the account covering the class of funded debt for which the certificates are issued.
                  (d) Each of the above classes shall also be divided into subclasses according to differences in mortgage or other lien or security therefor, rate of interest, interest dates, or date of maturity. Parts of any issue agreeing in other characteristics but maturing serially may be treated as of the same subclass.

                  (e) Records shall be maintained in such manner as to show (1) securities the issuance or assumption of which has been authorized by the Board under provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, and similar securities issued or assumed prior to the effective date of such provisions of the Act, and (2) other obligations of a kind which may legally be issued or assumed without such authorization.

Mature funded debt shall be included in account 763, “Other current liabilities,” if provision has been made for current settlement. If no provision has been made for current settlement, matured funded debt shall be included in account 768, “Debt in default,” except that when the collection of matured funded debt of affiliated companies is not enforced by controlling companies, the principal amount (to the extent held by a controlling company) shall be included in account 769, “Accounts payable; Affiliated companies.”

                  766.5 Capitalized lease obligations.
                  (a) Long-term leases which are clearly in substance installment purchases shall be capitalized. The liability under such leases which have been capitalized in fixed asset accounts shall be recorded in this account. (See instruction 2-20.)

                  (b) This account shall be kept so as to show the liability under each lease obligation.
                  
                  
                    Note A:

                    Note B:

                  769 Accounts payable; affiliated companies.
                  This account shall include the par value of nonnegotiable notes issued to affiliated companies; also matured funded debt of affiliated companies held by controlling companies where there is no agreement for an extension as to time of payment and collection of the principal is not enforced; credit balances in open accounts with such companies other than credit balances classable as current liablilities, and interest accrued on notes, matured funded debt of affiliated companies and open accounts included in this account, when such interest is not subject to current settlements.

                    Accounts with affiliated companies which are subject to current settlement shall be classed as current assets or current liabilities, as appropriate.
                  
                  
                    Note B:
                    No item shall be included in this account which is not known to be the property of an affiliated company.
                  
                  
                    Note C:
                    The term affiliated companies includes:
                    1. Controlled companies, including companies solely controlled by the accounting company, and also companies jointly controlled by the accounting company and others under a joint arrangement. (See definition 4.)
                    2. Controlling companies, including both companies solely controlling the accounting company, and companies which jointly control the accounting company under a joint arrangement.

                    By control (See definition 8) is meant the ability to determine the action of a corporation. For the purposes of this account, the following are to be considered forms of control:
                    (a) Right through title to securities issued or assumed to exercise the major part of the voting power in the controlled corporation.
                    (b) Right through agreement of some character or through some source other than title to securities, to name the majority of the board of directors, managers, or trustees of the controlled corporation.
                    (c) Right to foreclose a first lien upon all or a major part in value of the tangible property of the controlled corporation.
                    (d) Right to secure control in consequence of advances made for construction of the operating property of the controlled corporation.
                    (e) Right to control only in a specific respect the action of the controlled corporation.
                    A leasehold interest in the property of a corporation is not to be classed as a form of control over the lessor corporation.
                    
                      Sole control is that which rests in one corporation.
                    
                      Joint control is that which rests in two or more corporations and which is held under a joint arrangement.

                    Note A:
                    Issue costs related to long-term debt (debt expense) shall be included in account 743, “Other deferred debits.” (See instruction 5-3.)

                    When long-term obligations are refinanced the balance of debt discount and expense pertaining to the old obligations shall be transferred to account 551, “Miscellaneous income charges.”
                  
                  770.2 Unamortized premium on debt.
                  This account shall include the total of all credit balances representing the excess of the premium over the discount and expenses in connection with the issuance of each class of the carrier's outstanding long-term or equipment obligations. Separate subdivisions shall be maintained for each issue of obligations. (See instruction 5-3.)
                  Other Long-Term Liabilities
                  771 Accrued liability; pension and welfare.
                  (a) This account shall include the credit balances accrued representing the estimated liability of the carrier for amounts provided by charges to operating expenses, including amounts contributed by employees, irrespective of whether carried in special funds or in general funds of the carrier, for pensions, accident and death benefits, savings, relief, hospital, or other provident purposes.
                  (b) The carrier may use the “full accrual basis” to account for pension costs upon prior approval of the Board. Full accrual basis as used herein means recording in the accounts now and hereafter costs of employees pensions accrued, including credits for past services, upon the basis of actuarial computations, even though the sum has not been funded by payment to the trustees. Applications for such accounting shall show the method of computation, together with the carrier's proposal for recording in the accounts the related income tax credits to be realized in subsequent years.
                  (c) This account shall be charged when payments are made to retired employees, or disbursements are made for the purposes for which liability was provided.
                  (d) Separate subaccounts shall be maintained to show the amount provided for each liability and the nature of and amounts of debits and credits to the subaccounts.
                  772 Accrued liability; leased property.
                  (a) This account shall be credited with amounts concurrently charged to operating expenses or other accounts to cover the accrued liability on leased road and equipment when settlement between the accounting carrier and the lessor is not made currently. The amounts recorded shall include unsettled rent, based on depreciation or other factors, and liability for property retired.
                  (b) This account shall be divided to show the liability to (1) affiliated companies (See definition 4), and (2) others.
                  774 Accrued liability; casualty and other claims.
                  (a) This account shall be credited with the amounts charged to operating expense to provide for estimated liabilities for claims for deaths of or injuries to employees and others, and for damages to property not owned or held under lease by the carrier; for claims for loss, destruction, damage, or delays to property entrusted to the carrier for transportation or storage; for revenue over charges, such as those covered by reparation claims; and for similar items. No credits shall be made to this account for amounts recoverable from insurance companies or others.
                  (b) Separate subaccounts shall be maintained to show the amount provided for each liability and the nature of and amounts of debits and credits to the subaccounts.

                  (c) If settlements for claims when audited are charged to this account, the balances for each year shall be kept separately until all items have been adjusted and cleared. If the settlements when audited are charged to the appropriate expense accounts, the balance in this account shall be adjusted through the expense accounts so as to reflect the probable liability at the close of each accounting period for claims which have been or may be filed for actuarial occurrences.
                  (d) Estimates of amounts payable within one year covering liability for claims shall be transferred from this account to account 759, “Accrued accounts payable.”
                  775 Other accrued liabilities.
                  (a) This account shall be credited with the amounts accrued for estimated liabilities or losses provided by charges to operating expense or income accounts which are not provided for in any of the preceding accrued liability accounts.
                  (b) Separate subaccounts shall be maintained to show the amount provided for each liability and the nature of and amounts of debits and credits to the subaccounts.
                  (c) Upon accomplishment of the purpose for which each accrued liability was provided in this account, any remaining balance in the applicable subaccount shall be cleared to the appropriate operating expense or other account. Prior Board approval shall be required for clearance of balances in accrued liability subaccounts which were originally established by authority of the Board.
                  (d) Estimates of amounts payable within one year covering any liability included in this account shall be transferred to account 759, “Accrued accounts payable.”
                  781 Interest in default.
                  This account shall include the amount of matured and unpaid interest (for which no provision has been made for current settlement) on all indebtedness issued or assumed by the accounting company except interest which is added to the principal of the debt on which incurred. Where interest is in default, subsequent accruals shall be credited to this account.
                  
                    Note:
                    Interest matured and unpaid on debt to affiliated companies, if not subject to current settlement, shall be included in account 769, “Accounts payable; Affiliated companies.”
                  
                  782 Other liabilities.
                  This account shall include assessments for public improvements; retained amounts due governmental agencies for construction work; percentages due contractors to be paid upon completion of contracts; deposits for construction of side tracks to be refunded on basis of an agreed portion of the earnings from the traffic handled over the tracks and similar liabilities not payable within one year: This account shall also include other deferred and noncurrent liabilities not otherwise provided for in general balance sheet accounts.

                  (d) When capital stock is retired or canceled, this account shall be charged with the amount at which such stock is carried in this account. In the case of no par stock without stated value, the amount to be charged shall be the proportion, applicable to the reacquired shares immediately prior to reacquisition, of the total book liability included herein of actually outstanding shares of the particular class and series of stock of which the reacquired shares are a part.

                  (2) Preferred stock. Stocks having preference over other issues of stock in distribution of dividends or of assets.
                  (3) Debenture stock. Stock issued under a contract to pay a specified return at specified intervals.
                  (4) Receipts outstanding for installments paid. Receipts for payments on account of subscriptions to capital stock.
                  (g) When the subscriber has paid his subscription in full and is entitled to receive certificates representing the shares for which he has subscribed, the par value of stocks having par value, the stated value of no par stock, or the agreed purchase price or the price authorized by the Board for no par stock without stated value, as appropriate, shall be included in the division for the class for which the certificates are issued.

                  (h) Each of the above classes shall also be divided into subclasses according to differences in dividend or interest rights, voting rights, or conditions under which the securities may be retired.

                900 Definitions.
                Unless otherwise required by context, the following definitions apply in this subpart:
                
                  Account means an account in the STB's Uniform System of Accounts (USOA), for Railroad companies (49 CFR Part 1201, Subpart A).
                
                  IC Act means the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), as amended.
                
                  Branch Line or Branch means a rail line or segment of line which (a) has been designated on a transportation system diagram in categories (1), (2), (3), or (4) (49 CFR 1152.10(b) (1), (2), (3), (4)); or (b) is the subject of a directed service order under section 304(d)(3) of the 3R Act; or (c) is the subject of a rail continuation service agreement entered into prior to the designation of the line on a system diagram.
                
                  STB or Board means the Surface Transportation Board.
                
                  Designated State agency means the instrumentality created by a State or designated by appropriate authority to administer or coordinate its State rail plan as required by section 5(j)(2) of the Department of Transportation Act (90 Stat. 131) or section 402(c)(1)(A) of the 3R Act (87 Stat. 985) or regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.
                
                
                  Railroad means a common carrier by railroad, as defined in section 1(3) of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C. 1(3)).
                
                  3R Act means the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, Pub. L. 93-236, 87 Stat. 985, as amended.

Example: 11-21-XX refers to all salary and wage accounts for locomotives because 11 designates salaries and wages and 21 designates locomotives. Thus, 11-21-XX includes all of the following accounts: 11-21-01; 11-21-40; 11-21-48; 11-21-39; and 11-21-99. Similarly, XX-31-67 means all accounts containing 31 (train operations) and 67 (locomotive fuel).

                910 Purpose and scope.
                Section 205(e)(1)(A) of the 3R Act directs the office to issue regulations which will permit the collection and publication by the Consolidated Rail Corp. (ConRail), or by profitable railroads of information necessary to determine accurately the revenues attributable, avoidable costs, and service units of light-density lines scheduled for abandonment. This accurate information is intended to facilitate the determination of the revenues and avoidable costs in abandonment proceedings and in potential offers of subsidy. This information is intended to be compatible with the Regional Subsidy Standards, for those lines which were not conveyed to ConRail under the final system plan and with the National Subsidy Standards (49 CFR Part 1152, Subpart D), for all other lines. The purpose of the Branch Line Accounting System regulations is to specify an accounting system for the collection and publication of this information.
                [43 FR 1733, Jan. 11, 1978, as amended at 47 FR 49596, Nov. 1, 1982; 67 FR 57533, Sept. 11, 2002]
                920 Collection of data.
                (a) Lines for which data collection is required. The railroad shall collect data on all branch lines which meet the criteria listed in paragraphs 1 through 4 below. The data to be collected are specified in section 920(b).
                (1) Branch lines in categories (1), (2), and (3) on the System Diagram Map include, respectively, lines for which a carrier intends to file an abandonment application within three years, lines which the carrier has under study and are potentially subject to abandonment, and lines for which an abandonment application is pending before the Board. The collection of data on such lines shall commence on the first day of the month after the line has been designated in one of the categories and will continue so long as the branch line is retained in one of these categories. The assignment and apportionment methodology set forth in Part 1152, Subchapter B (National Subsidy Standards), shall be applied.
                (2) For branch lines operated under an order directing service, under section 304(d)(3) of the 3R Act, data shall be collected from the effective date of the order until the order is withdrawn.
                (3) For branch lines operated under a rail service continuation agreement under section 1a(6)(a) of the IC Act, data shall be collected from the effective date of the agreement until the termination of the agreement. The assignment and apportionment methodology set forth in Part 1152, Subchapter B (National Subsidy Standards), shall be applied.
                (4) For branch lines operated under a rail service continuation agreement under section 304 of the 3R Act, data collection shall commence on the effective date of the agreement and shall continue until the termination date of the agreement.
                (b) Data to be collected. The data collected shall include the items of revenue, expense, and service units which are specified in 49 CFR 1152, as described in the account texts listed in section 950. The format for presentation of these data is specified in section 940.

                930 Publication of data.
                (a) General. The railroad shall file on or before June 30 of each calendar year the certification included in these regulations as Appendix I. The railroad shall include a description of each branch line using the format set forth in Appendix I of these regulations. The description of each branch line requires the same data as that submitted under 49 CFR 1152.11. This section prescribes the branch line information required in conjunction with the system diagram maps specifying the line's designation, states and counties traversed, delineation of mileposts, and location of agency and terminal stations.
                (b) [Reserved]
                (c) Access to records. The records, accounts, working papers, and other documents reflecting the revenues, cost, and service unit data of each branch line for which the railroad must maintain data shall be made available for inspection and examination by the Board and, for lines situated within its State, by the designated State agency at a time and place mutually agreeable to the parties. The railroad shall also reproduce such records for the designated State agency, provided the agency pays the reasonable cost thereof.
                (d) Waivers and modifications. The STB's Office of Economics may, with respect to individual requests, upon good cause shown, waive or modify any requirement of this section not required by law.

                    Note D:

                    Note E:
                    This account shall be maintained so as to show separately payments and allowances for (a) terminal collection and delivery services when performed in connection with line-haul transportation of freight on the basis of freight tariff rates, further separated between (1) TOFC/COFC service, and (2) all other freight service; also (b) payments for switching services when performed in connection with line-haul transportation of freight on the basis of switching tariffs and allowances out of freight rates, including the switching of empty cars in connection with a revenue movement, and (c) payments on basis of tariff rates for loading and unloading livestock.

                  Note:
                  No revenue shall be included in this account for water transfers of passengers or shipments upon the basis of arbitraries out of rates for transportation involving rail line haul.

                  110 Incidental. This account is designed to show the amounts which the carrier becomes entitled to receive from services rendered incidentally with rail-line and water-line transportation; for the use of facilities of which the expenses for operation and maintenance are not separable from railway expenses and from incidental sources not provided for elsewhere. Among the items included in this account are revenues derived from (1) hotels and restaurants, (2) operations conducted at stations and on trains by individual or companies other than railway companies, (3) storage, (4) the sale of electric power, (5) renting property operated and maintained in connection with the property used in the carrier's transportation operations and from railway operations not provided for elsewhere.
                
                  121 Joint facility, credit. This account shall include the carrier's proportion of revenue collected by others in connection with the operation of joint tracks, yards, terminals, and other facilities, including revenue from hotels, restaurants, grain elevators, sale of power, and other miscellaneous operations.
                
                
                  Note A:
                  The purpose of this account is to show the amounts of revenue from the operation of joint tracks, yards, terminals and other facilities operated by other companies, which under existing contracts or agreements are credited by the operating company to the tenant companies which participate therein. The bill rendered by any creditor company against a debtor company for the latter's proportion of the expense of maintenance and operation of joint facilities, which includes also a credit covering a proportion of the revenue to be paid over, shall show the distribution of the credit for such proportion of the revenue separately from the distribution of the expense of operation.
                
                
                  Note B:
                  No credits shall be made to this account representing amounts creditable by the operating company to primary accounts 101-103, 105, and 110.
                
                
                  122 Joint facility, debit. This account shall include that proportion of revenue from the operation of joint tracks, yards, terminals, and other facilities, which is creditable to other companies, including revenue from hotels, restaurants, grain elevators, sale of power, and other miscellaneous operations.
                
                
                  Note A:
                  The purpose of this account is to show the amount of revenue from operation of a terminal company or other carrier which, under the terms of existing contracts or agreements covering the joint use of tracks, yards, and other facilities, is credited to other carriers that participate in the benefits from such joint use. The bill rendered by a creditor company against a debtor company for the latter's proportion of expense of maintaining and operating joint facilities, which includes a credit covering the debtor company's proportion of the revenues from operation of such joint facilities, shall indicate separately the proper distribution of both the revenues and the expenses included in the bill, and such distribution shall be adhered to the debtor.
                
                
                  Note B:
                  No debits shall be made to this account representing amounts creditable by the operating company to primary accounts 101-103, 105, and 110.

                (2) This account shall be charged with the cost of maintenance of the property rented, also specific incidental expenses in connection with such property, such as the cost of negotiating contracts, advertising for tenants, fees paid conveyancers, collectors' commissions, and analogous items.
                
                
                  Note A:
                  If property the rent of which is chargeable to account 543—“Miscellaneous rents,” is sublet by the accounting company, the rent receivable therefore shall be credited to this account.
                
                
                  Note B:
                  Taxes on property the rent of which is creditable to this account shall be charged to account 553—“Taxes on property used in other than carrier operations.”
                
                
                  Note C:

                  The rent from property carried in balance-sheet account 737—“Property used in other than carrier operations,” shall not be included in this account, but in account 506—“Revenues from property used in other than carrier operations.”
                
                
                  Note D:
                  Rent and other income from real estate acquired for new lines or for additions and betterments shall be credited to the appropriate road and equipment accounts until the completion or coming into service of the property.
                
                
                
                  519 Miscellaneous income. (1) This account shall include all items, not provided for elsewhere, properly creditable to income accounts during the current year. Among the items which shall be included in this account are:

                (ii) Profit from sale of land used for transportation purposes, of noncarrier property and of securities acquired for investment purposes.
                (2) Gains for extinguishment of debt shall be aggregated and, if material, credited to account 570 “Extraordinary Items,” upon approval by the Commission; however, gains from extinguishment of debt (excluding debt maturing serially), which is made to satisfy sinking fund requirements, shall be recorded in this account regardless of amount.
                
                  599 Subsidy payments from preexisting contracts. This account shall include all payments made to the operating carrier of a subsidized line that (1) existed prior to the commencement of operations under a subsidy operating agreement and (2) would cease if freight service on the line were discontinued.

              § 1220.1
              Records required to be retained.
              Companies subject to this part shall retain records for the minimum retention periods required by § 1220.6, Schedule of records and periods of retention. After the required retention periods, the records may be destroyed at the discretion of each company's management. It shall be the obligation of the subject company to maintain records that adequately support financial and operational data required by the Board. The company may request a ruling from the Board on the retention of any record. The provisions of this part shall not be construed as excusing compliance with the lawful requirements of any other governmental body prescribing longer retention periods for any category of records.
            
            
              
              § 1220.2
              Protection and storage of records.
              (a) The company shall protect records subject to this part from fires, floods, and other hazards, and safeguard the records from unnecessary exposure to deterioration from excessive humidity, dryness, or lack of ventilation.
              (b) The company shall notify the Board if prescribed records are substantially destroyed or damaged before the term of the prescribed retention periods.
            
            
              § 1220.3
              Preservation of records.
              (a) All records may be preserved by any technology that is immune to alteration, modification, or erasure of the underlying data and will enable production of an accurate and unaltered paper copy.
              (b) Records not originally preserved on hard copy shall be accompanied by a statement executed by a person having personal knowledge of the facts indicating the type of data included within the records. One comprehensive statement may be executed in lieu of individual statements for multiple records if the type of data included in the multiple records is common to all such records. The records shall be indexed and retained in such a manner as will render them readily accessible. The company shall have facilities available to locate, identify and produce legible paper copies of the records.
              (c) Any significant characteristic, feature or other attribute that a particular medium will not preserve shall be clearly indicated at the beginning of the applicable records as appropriate.
              (d) The printed side of forms, such as instructions, need not be preserved for each record as long as the printed matter is common to all such forms and an identified specimen of the form is maintained on the medium for reference.

              § 1220.4
              Companies going out of business.
              The records referred to in these regulations may be destroyed after business is discontinued and the company is completely liquidated. The records may not be destroyed until dissolution is final and all pending transactions and claims are completed. When a company is merged with another company under jurisdiction of the Board, the successor company shall preserve records of the merged company in accordance with these regulations.
            
            
              § 1220.5
              Waiver of requirements of these regulations.
              A waiver from any provision of these regulations may be made by the Board upon its own initiative or upon submission of a written request by the company. Each request for waiver shall demonstrate that unusual circumstances warrant a departure from prescribed retention periods, procedures, or techniques, or that compliance with such prescribed requirements would impose an unreasonable burden on the company.

                § 1242.00
                Separation of common operating expenses.
                (a) Commencing with annual reports for the year 1978 or for any portion thereof until further order, all class I railroad companies including class I switching and terminal companies subject to section 20 of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended shall separate operating expenses common to both freight service and passenger service in accordance with the regulation in this part.
                (b) The carrier shall maintain records supporting its common operating expense apportionments to freight and passenger services. The carrier shall report common expense apportionments to the Board as required.
                [43 FR 7637, Feb. 24, 1978, as amended at 67 FR 57534, Sept. 11, 2002]
              
            
            
              General
              
                § 1242.01
                Expenses solely related to freight service and passenger service.
                The Uniform System of Accounts for Railroad Companies (49 CFR part 1201) requires that carriers assign directly to freight service or to passenger service, including allied services, the expenses, taxes, and purchased services incurred solely for the benefit of either freight or passenger service.
              
              
                § 1242.02
                Common expenses.
                The Uniform System of Accounts also requires that carriers assign to common expense accounts the remaining expenses, taxes and purchased services which are not solely related to either freight or passenger service. The following instructions govern the separation of common expense accounts between freight and passenger services.
              
              
                § 1242.03
                Made by accounting divisions.
                The separation shall be made by accounting divisions, where such divisions are maintained, and the aggregate of the accounting divisions reported for the quarter and for the year.
              
              
                § 1242.04
                Special tests.
                When the separation of common expense accounts between freight and passenger services is based upon special tests or service unit factors, such tests shall be made at sufficiently frequent intervals to represent actual operating conditions. The service unit factors used are those of the reporting period.
              
              
                § 1242.05
                Operating expense account number notation.

                (a) The operating expense account numbers consist of a six-digit coding structure divided into three two-digit groups. The first two-digit group denotes natural expenses; the second group denotes activities/subactivities for freight, passenger or common service; and the third group signifies applicable function assignment.
                
                  ec03mr91.050
                
                (b) For reporting purposes, four natural expense categories are utilized. The categories are: salaries and wages (account 11-XX-XX); material, tools, supplies, fuels and lubricants (account 21-XX-XX); purchased services (accounts 31-XX-XX to 41-XX-XX, inclusive); and general (accounts 61-XX-XX to 65-XX-XX, inclusive, 51-XX-XX, 52-XX-XX, 53-XX-XX and 12-XX-XX).

                (c) The symbol “XX” in the first two-digit group is used throughout the separation instructions to denote more than one natural expense associated with the same activity/subactivity-function account structure. For reporting purposes, the natural expense account numbers represented by “XX” include:
                
                
                  11—Salaries and wages;
                  21—Materials, tools, supplies, fuels, and lubricants;
                  30 or 41—Purchased services:
                  30—Summation of certain purchased service accounts;
                  41—Other purchased services;
                  61—General.
                
                
                (d) The “30” natural expense designation indicates a summation of specific purchased service accounts that are reported in total rather than individually. The specific accounts under the way and structures activity except for administration functions include 39-1X-XX, repairs billed by others, Dr.; 40-1X-XX, repairs billed to others, cr.; and 41-1X-XX, other purchased services. For the equipment activity excluding administration functions, the “30” designation denotes the summation of 39-2X-XX and 41-2X-XX.
                (e) The “41” natural expense designation (other purchased services) is the purchased service category of the “XX” code for the following:
                (1) Way and structures activity administration—function accounts,
                (2) Equipment activity administration—function accounts,
                (3) Transportation activity expense accounts, and
                (4) General and administration activity expense accounts.
                (f) The “61” general natural expense designation is applicable to all accounts with the “XX” symbol except transportation, train and yards accounts (XX-(33/43/53)-XX).
                (g) The natural expense account number “50” is used throughout the separation instructions to indicate the summation of accounts 52-XX-XX, Other casualties, and 53-XX-XX, Insurance, that are reported as one item, “Casualties and Insurance,” (50-XX-XX).
                (h) The number “98” in the function account group (last two digits) is used in the separation rules to designate the summation of a natural expense consisting of more than one functional assignment that is reported as one item. This includes Repairs Billed to Others, Cr.—Equipment (40-2X-XX). For example, the locomotive subactivity contains accounts 40-(21/24/26)-40, 40-(21/24/26)-41, and 40-(21/24/26)-48 which are treated as 40-(21/24/26)-98.
              
              
                § 1242.06
                Instructions for separation.
                (a) Certain instructions for separating common expense accounts (dependent accounts) between freight and passenger services base the allocation on the proportional freight/passenger separation of other common expense accounts (independent accounts). The dependent account is frequently identified by an “XX” symbol in the natural expense position (first two digits) with corresponding independent accounts also identified by the “XX” natural expense symbol. Unless otherwise stated, the applicable natural expense associated with “XX” symbol shall be the same for both the dependent and independent accounts.
                (b) To illustrate, § 1242.10 provides instructions for separating common Way and Structures, Administration—Track accounts (dependent accounts) designated by XX-19-02. The separation is based on certain other common Way and Structures accounts including Roadway—Running, XX-17-10, and Roadway—Switching, XX-18-10.

                (c) As § 1242.05 states, the “XX” symbol denotes the following natural expenses for Way and Structures administration functions:
                
                
                  
                  11—Salaries and wages,
                  21—Materials, tools, supplies, fuels, and lubricants,
                  41—Other purchased services, and
                  61—General.
                
                
                These natural expenses shall be individually applied to the separation rules in § 1242.10. In each case, the independent accounts providing the basis for freight/passenger separation of the dependent account shall have the same natural expense designation. For example, the basis of separating account 11-19-02, Salaries and Wages, Way and Structures, Administration—Track, would be based on certain independent accounts including 11-17/18-10, Salaries and Wages, Way and Structures, Running/Switching, Repair and Maintenance, Roadway.

              § 1244.1
              Definitions.
              (a) Railroad—an individual railroad or terminal company subject to the Interstate Commerce Act and every receiver, trustee, executor, administrator or assignee of any such railroad. If a railroad and its railroad subsidiaries report to the Board on a consolidated basis, they would collectively be considered as a railroad.
              
              (b) A railroad subsidiary—a railroad owned or controlled by another railroad.
              (c) A waybill, which may be referred to by other names such as mine tickets, is the document or instrument prepared from the bill of lading contract or shipper's instructions as to the disposition of the freight, and used by the railroad(s) involved as the authority to move the shipment and as the basis for determining the freight charges and interline settlements.
            
            
              § 1244.2
              Applicability.

              (a) Effective July 1, 1981 and thereafter, unless otherwise ordered, each railroad as defined in § 1244.1 above is required to file waybill sample information for all line-haul revenue waybills terminated on its lines if it terminates at least 4,500 revenue carloads in any of the three preceding years, or if it terminates at least 5% of the revenue carloads terminating in any state in any of the three preceding years. A railroad required to file waybill sample information under this section shall herein be referred to as subject railroad.
              
              (b) Waybill terminations shall include all line-haul revenue movements terminating for waybilling purposes on the subject railroad's line whether the lading is destined for the terminating station as denoted on the waybill or the shipment is being rebilled or forwarded to the ultimate destination by another railroad or another mode of transportation (e.g., lake cargo, inbound transit, or other rebilled movements).
              (c) Each subject railroad shall also file the required waybill sample information for all of its railroad subsidiaries.
              (d) Each subject railroad shall also file the required waybill sample information for any other railroad for which it performs revenue billing and/or interline settlements under special agreement.
              (e) The surviving corporate entity of railroads (subject to the Interstate Commerce Act) who have merged or reorganized shall be required to report waybill sample information if its predecessor railroad or any of its predecessor railroads were required to report under this section.
              (f) In order to determine the number of carloads terminated in each state, railroads not otherwise submitting waybill information must report annually the number of carloads terminated by state for the last calendar year. These reports shall be submitted by March 1 of the year following the report year.
              (g) Transition. This final rule will apply to all subject waybills which are in the subject railroad's audit month of July 1981 and all audit months thereafter. The former rule will continue to apply to all subject waybills for the prior audit months up to and including June 1981.
            
            
              § 1244.3
              Reporting contract shipment waybills and Canadian and Mexican international waybills.
              (a) All railroads shall identify (flag) contract shipment waybills.
              (b) The revenue associated with contract shipments may be encrypted (masked) to safeguard the confidentiality of the contract rates.
              (1) Upon written request, the Board will provide a masking procedure for a railroad's use or will mask the contract revenues when the Waybill Sample is filed with the Board.
              (2) When a railroad intends to use its own proprietary masking procedure, those procedures, and any changes in those procedures, must be approved by the Board thirty (30) days prior to their use.

              (3) All railroads that use a proprietary masking procedure, and intend to continue to use the same procedure, must certify, by letter to the Board, prior to January 31 each year, that the contract revenue masking procedures are unchanged.
              
              (4) All correspondence and certifications concerning masking procedures should be addressed to: Director, Office of Economics, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC ATTN: WAYBILL COORDINATOR.
              (c) Railroads moving traffic on the U.S. rail system to the Canadian or Mexican border shall include a representative sample of such international export traffic in the Waybill Sample.
              (d) Railroads shall identify (flag) such movements as international traffic in the waybill records.
              (e) Railroads may report information on the complete rail routing or report only information related to the U.S. portion of the movement.
              (f) Railroads may mask revenue divisions associated with cross-border traffic following the masking procedures set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

              § 1244.4
              Sampling of waybills.
              (a) Subject railroads shall file waybill sample information in one of the following two ways. (1) Authenticated copies of a sample of audited revenue waybills—the manual system (paragraph (b) of this section). (2) A computer tape containing specified information from a sample of waybills—the computerized system (paragraph (c) of this section).
              (b) The Manual System. (1) The sample of subject waybills shall be as follows:
              (i) All waybills with less than 6 carloads per waybill whose serial numbers are 1 or end in 01,
              (ii) All waybills with 6 to 25 carloads per waybill whose serial numbers end in 1; and,
              (iii) All waybills with 26 or more carloads per waybill whose serial numbers end in 1 or 7.
              (2) The expected sampling rates for the manual system are as follows:
              
                
                  Numbers of carloads on waybill
                  Expected sample rate
                
                
                  1 to 5
                  1/100
                
                
                  6 to 25
                  1/10

                  1/5
                
              
              (3) Upon giving the subject roads 60 days notice, the Board may require random serial number endings in lieu of the respective endings shown in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. These random serial number endings would have the expected sample rates shown in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
              (4) If the subject waybills have no waybill numbers or serial numbers, or have seriously flawed waybill or serial numbers, then the subject railroad should serialize those documents in blocks of 1,000 or blocks of multiples of 1,000 (e.g., 1, 2, . . . 1,000; 1, 2, . . .) and use these constructed serial numbers for selection purposes.
              (c) The Computerized System. (1) The tape shall be required to conform to the standards and format specified in Statement No. 81-1, Procedure for Sampling Waybill Records by Computer (2009 edition), issued by the Surface Transportation Board. The Director of the Federal Register has approved this incorporation by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. To enforce any editions other than those specified in this section, the STB must publish notice of change in the Federal Register and the material must be available to the public. You may obtain or inspect a copy of these standards from the Surface Transportation Board, 395 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20423-0001; from the Surface Transportation Board Web site at www.stb.gov.or by calling (202) 245-0333.

              (d) Controls and Annual Counts. (1) Each subject railroad shall maintain a control procedure to ensure complete and accurate reporting for the waybill sampling. All pertinent waybill data shall be included on hard copy waybill submissions including inbound references for transit waybills. All such pertinent waybill data shall be legible.
              (2) All subject railroads shall maintain a record of the number of line-haul revenue carloads that terminated on their line in a calendar year and shall furnish this number when requested by the Board.
              (3) All subject railroads using the manual system of reporting shall furnish the Board, in accordance with instructions on the Transmittal Form OPAD-2, the total counts of line-haul revenue waybills terminated in each reporting period for the following three categories:
              (i) Waybills, with less than six carloads per waybill,
              (ii) Waybills with 6 to 25 carloads per waybill, and
              (iii) Waybills with 26 or more carloads per waybill.
              (4) All subject railroads on the computerized system of reporting shall furnish the Board the control counts and tape specification information as required by the Statement No. 81-1.
              (5) Certification by a responsible officer of the subject railroad as to the completeness and accuracy of sample shall be made once a year in accordance with the instructions on the Transmittal Forms OPAD-1 or OPAD-2.

              § 1244.9
              Procedures for the release of waybill data.
              (a) General. The procedures for the release of waybill data identify five classes of users of the STB Waybill Sample, define the waybill information or data that each class of users may obtain, and set forth the applicable requirements for the data's release. They also formalize notice and protest procedures for the possible release of waybill data to other users to protect against the inappropriate release of confidential data. The Director of the Office of Economics shall be responsible for releasing waybill data in accordance with these procedures.
              (b) Class of user, available data, and applicable release requirements—(1) Railroads. Each requesting railroad may obtain any waybill record from the STB Waybill Sample covering traffic that originated, terminated, or was bridged by that railroad. The railroad shall not have access to waybill data pertaining to traffic in which it did not participate. Also, it must meet all STB and legal requirements concerning release of shipper information in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 11904(a).
              (2) Federal agencies. Each requesting Federal agency (including quasi-governmental agencies) may obtain any waybill record from the STB Waybill Sample subject to the following requirements:
              (i) The Federal agency shall make the information contained in the STB Waybill Sample available only to its employees or those contractors working on the particular project or study requiring the waybill data.
              (ii) The Federal agency will ensure that railroads and shippers are afforded the same privilege and protection against disclosure of the waybill data as the Board provides.
              (iii) The Federal agency will not release any data to the public unless the data elements are aggregated to contain at least three shippers and to prevent identification of an individual railroad.
              (iv) The Federal agency will refer any requests for waybill data and accompanying documentation to the STB for processing and will so inform the requesting party of such referral to the Board.
              (v) The Federal agency must sign an agreement annually with the Board agreeing to these restrictions.
              (3) States. Each requesting State may obtain any waybill record pertaining to traffic that was originated, terminated, interchanged in, or that passed through its State subject to the same requirements imposed on federal agencies under paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (v) of this section.
              (4) Transportation practitioners, consulting firms, and law firms—specific proceedings. Transportation practitioners, consulting firms and law firms may use data from the STB Waybill Sample in preparing verified statements to be submitted in formal proceedings before the STB and/or State Boards (Board) subject to the following requirements:
              (i) The STB Waybill Sample is the only single source of the data or obtaining the data from other sources is burdensome or costly, and the data is relevant to issues pending before the Board.
              (ii) The requestor submits to the STB a written waybill request that complies with § 1244.9(e).
              (iii) All waybill data must be returned to the STB, and the firm must not keep any copies.

              (iv) A transportation practitioner, consulting firm, or law firm must submit any evidence drawn from the STB Waybill Sample to the Board only unless the evidence is aggregated to the level of at least three shippers and will prevent the identification of an individual railroad. Nonaggregated evidence submitted to the Board will be made part of the public record only if the Board finds that it does not reveal competitively sensitive data. However, evidence found to be sensitive may be provided to counsel or other independent representatives for other parties subject to the usual and customary protective order issued by the Board or appropriate authorized official.
              (v) For each Board proceeding, a firm must sign a confidentiality agreement with the STB agreeing to the above restrictions before any data will be released. This agreement will permit use of the released data for a period of one year from the date the agreement is signed by the user. If the data is required for an additional period of time because a proceeding is still pending before the Board, the firm must sign a new confidentiality agreement covering the data needed for each additional year the proceeding is opened.
              (5) Public use. Nonconfidential waybill data may be obtained from the “Public Use Waybill File”. Reports produced from the Public Use Waybill File may be used, published, or released. The Public Use Waybill File contains the following nonconfidential items:

              (2) All written requests filed by such users are subject to the notice and protest procedures described in paragraph (d) of this section.
              (d) Notice and protest procedures for waybill requests by other users. Railroads and shippers will be notified and afforded the opportunity to protest waybill requests filed by users other than those described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section in accordance with the following procedures:
              (1) Notice of request for confidential waybill data. Affected railroads and shippers will receive notice by Federal Register Publication. If railroad specific or shipper specific data are requested, those parties will be given written notice of the request.
              (2) Form of notice. The notice shall identify the parties requesting the data; describe the type of waybill data requested; and state the purpose for which the data is requested. The notice shall include a statement that parties seeking information concerning the filing of objections should refer to 49 CFR 1224.9, or contact the Surface Transportation Board's Office of Economics.
              (3) Objections to release. (i) Objections to release of the confidential waybill data must be filed by the railroad and/or shipper with the Director, Office of Economics, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC, no later than 14 calendar days from publication of the notice in the Federal Register.
              
              (ii) The objection shall identify the parties seeking the confidential waybill data, reiterate the purpose for which the data is sought, and state all grounds for objection to full or partial disclosure of the requested data.
              (4) Board determination. (i) The Director of the Office of Economics will consider all objections in determining whether to release the requested waybill data. Each railroad or shipper who filed objections will be sent written notice of the Director's decision not less than 14 calendar days prior to the disclosure date.
              (ii) The Board reserves the right to deny the release of waybill data although no objections may be filed.
              (iii) Appeals must be filed with the Board within 10 days of the date of the Director's decision. Responses to appeals must be filed within 10 days thereafter (49 CFR 1011.6(b)). The filing of an appeal will automatically stay the effect of the Director's decision.
              (e) Content of waybill requests. (1) All requestors under paragraphs (b)(4) and (c) of this section shall include the following information:
              (i) A complete and detailed explanation of the purpose for which the requested data are needed.
              (ii) A description of the specific waybill data or fields actually required (including pertinent geographic areas).
              (iii) A detailed justification as to why the specified waybill data are needed.
              (2) The waybill request shall be filed with the Director, Office of Economics, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC.
              (f) Aggregation of confidential shipper data.
              (1) Any shipper data obtained from the Waybill Sample shall not be publicly released unless the data are aggregated to include at least three shippers.
              (2) To aggregate the waybill data to the level of three shippers, the three-FSAC Rule shall be used. Under this rule, there must be at least three different freight stations as identified by the Freight Station Accounting Code (FSAC) on one railroad or there must be at least two more FSAC's than there are railroads present in the waybill data being aggregated.
              (3) The three-FSAC Rule shall apply to every number and calculation publicly released.
              (4) The Director of Office of Economics will consider requests to apply an alternative aggregation method provided the requestor establishes that a particular project necessitates an alternative approach and that approach effectively protects the identity of individual shippers.
              (g) Complaint procedures. (1) Complaints for alleged breaches of confidentiality or misuse of confidential waybill data must include the following:
              (i) Identification of all known parties involved in the alleged violation.
              (ii) The approximate date(s) of the alleged violations.
              (iii) A full and detailed description of the alleged violation.
              (iv) A description of any resulting harm to the complainant.
              (2) Prior to filing a complaint, a complainant, upon written request, may obtain a copy of the incoming waybill request and the applicable confidentiality agreement. This request must identify the party involved, give the approximate date the data was released, briefly describe the alleged violation, and substantiate the need for this information for purposes of filing a complaint.

              (3) The complaint shall be filed with the Director, Office of Economics, and Administration, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC. A copy of the complaint shall also be served on the alleged violator(s).
              (4) An answer must be filed within 20 days after service of the complaint.
              (5) All parties will be notified in writing of the Director's decision. If the Director determines that a violation has occurred, the offending parties will be denied access to the waybill sample for a period of time commensurate with the nature of the violation.
              (6) Appeals to the Director's determination shall be filed in accordance with paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section.
              (h) Munitions shipments. All waybill requests for munition data at the 3-digit Standard Transportation Commodity Code (STCC) level or greater will be forwarded by the STB to the Department of Defense's Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC). The STB will not release this type of information without SDDC's consent.

              § 1245.1
              Rules governing classification of employees, service, and compensation.
              The rules governing the classification of railroad employees and reports of their service and compensation outlined in §§ 1245.3 and 1245.4 are required, and all Class I railroads within the scope of Section 11145 of the Interstate Commerce Act shall be governed by such rules in the preparation and submission of their annual and other periodic reports to the Surface Transportation Board in accordance with the forms adopted for such returns (§ 1245.2); and also with respect to any other matters covered by these rules.

              § 1245.2
              Reports of railroad employees, service and compensation.
              Each Class I railroad is required to file a Quarterly Report of Railroad Employees, Service, and Compensation, (Quarterly Wage Forms A & B). In addition, such carriers shall also file an Annual Report of Railroad Employees, Service, and Compensation, (Annual Wage Forms A & B) for each calendar year. Both reports shall be submitted, in paper or electronically, to the Office of Economics, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC. The quarterly report shall be submitted within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. The annual report shall be submitted within 45 days after the end of the reporting year.
              [81 FR 8856, Feb. 23, 2016]
            
            
              § 1245.3
              Employees; definition, service hours, and compensation.
              (a) Definition of “employees”. The word employees, as used in this part, is intended to include every person in the service of the reporting carrier subject to its continuing authority to supervise and direct the manner of rendition of his service. Persons engaged to render only specifically defined service and not subject to the continuing authority of the carrier to supervise and control their acts, such as customhouse brokers, lawyers retained only for specific cases and not under general or continuing retainer, etc., are not employees in the meaning of the term used in this part.
              
              (b) Counting employees. Since the number of employees fluctuates, carriers are required to classify and count all of their employees at twelve different times each year.
              (c) Joint employees. Each person jointly employed shall, if carried on the payrolls of the several joint employers, be counted by each employer and represented in its return of number of employees by a fraction based on the number of employers reporting him; if a person, for example, is reportable by three employers, each should include him in its number of employees as one-third of an employee. When the entire compensation of a joint employee is shown on the payroll of a single joint employer and is paid to the employee by that employer such employee should, for the purpose of returns, be treated as if employed solely by such employer.
              (d) Service hours. (1) The number of hours on duty, or held for duty, and the number of hours paid for are to be ascertained and recorded for every class of employee. For enginemen and trainmen, the actual number of miles run and miles paid for but not run are to be recorded, as well as the number of hours on duty and the number of hours paid for. (The service time of all classes of employees shall be recorded in hours instead of days or hours as heretofore.)
              (2) Whenever an employee works at more than one occupation, or in more than one class of service, both the number of hours worked and the compensation paid, should be separated and reported under the proper Reporting Divisions.
              (3) If an employee is paid a day's wage for a smaller number of hours than constitutes a day's work, the number of hours paid for as well as the actual number of hours the employee is on duty should be ascertained and recorded. Time allowed for meals, part holidays, holidays, absences on leave, vacations, etc., should be excluded from time actually worked, but if such time is paid for it should be appropriately reported as “Time paid for but not worked” on Form A or as a “constructive allowance” on Form B. These requirements apply to enginemen and trainmen paid on the basis of trips or of miles run, and to employees paid at piece rates, as well as to employees paid on hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or other time basis. Service hours for officers and employees who do not receive payment for overtime should be reported as the number of hours in each month at 8 hours per day contemplated for the position.
              (e) Compensation. The compensation of employees as defined in the rules in this part is to be stated in such manner and detail as the forms adopted for periodical returns require.
            
            
              § 1245.4
              Forms required to be used.
              (a) The report of information to the Surface Transportation Board on railroad employees, service and compensation includes two forms. Form A relates to employees other than train and engine service employees. Form B relates to train and engine service employees.

              (b) With general reference to the statement of the compensation of employees in Forms A and B, it should be understood that the total compensation received by the employees in each Reporting Division, as well as the amount of work they perform, should be shown properly distributed under the prescribed column heads as indicated by the forms. It should be noted that if the work of an employee varies during a report period, his time and compensation should be apportioned accordingly. Amounts reported should be gross compensation paid.
              
              
                
                  Illustrations. (a) In the course of a month, an employee works as a Machinist, and as such earns $200 and he works also as a Gang Foreman and earns $130. The pay received by him in the occupation of Machinist with corresponding time should be included in returns for Division 61, “Machinists”, and his other pay and time as indicated should be included in returns for Division 53, “Gang Foremen and Gang Leaders”. (b) When an employee works at two or more of the occupations of engineer, fireman, conductor, and brakeman, his time and compensation should be assigned in accordance with the facts. For example, in a certain month an employee earns as a Through Freight Engineer $110, as a Local or Way Freight Engineer $140, as a Yard Engineer $100, and as a Local or Way Freight Fireman $75. The time and the compensation of this employee should be correspondingly distributed among Reporting Divisions 122, 123, 124, and 127 as they are respectively applicable, without regard to the predominance of the time worked or the amount earned by him in one occupation.
              
              
              (c) As elsewhere indicated, the statement of the number of employees in the service of a company with respect to Reporting Divisions depends upon the allocation of the individual employees as of the day of count.
              (d) The Reporting Divisions shown in Forms A and B following will also be used in connection with the employees' schedule in the annual reports of railroads of classes I and II to the Board. Railroads of class III and lessor companies shall report only the information required in the annual report forms prescribed for such companies.

              § 1250.1
              General.
              (a) The reporting period covers:
              (1) For § 1250.2(a)(1)-(9), 12:01 a.m. Saturday-11:59 p.m. Friday;
              (2) For § 1250.2(a)(10), the previous calendar month;
              (3) For § 1250.2(a)(11), 12:01 a.m. Sunday-11:59 p.m. Saturday;
              (4) For § 1250.3(a)(1)-(2), 12:01 a.m. Saturday-11:59 p.m. Friday.

              (b) The data required under § 1250.2 and § 1250.3(a) must be reported to the Board via the method and in the form prescribed by the Board's Office of Public Assistance, Governmental Affairs, and Compliance (OPAGAC) by 5 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday of each week. In the event that a particular Wednesday is a Federal holiday or falls on a day when STB offices are closed for any other reason, then the data should be reported on the next business day when the offices are open.
              (c) Each reporting railroad shall provide an explanation of its methodology for deriving the data with its initial filing and an update if and when that methodology changes. This explanation should include the unit train definition that the railroad will use in its data reporting, which shall reflect its assignment of train codes in accordance with its normal business practices. If and when a railroad changes its definition of unit train it shall notify the Board of the change at the time it goes into effect in the form prescribed by OPAGAC.
              (d) Unless otherwise provided, the performance data, Chicago data and alert levels, narrative infrastructure reporting, and any methodologies or explanations of data collection reported to the Board under this part will be publicly available and posted on the Board's Web site.
            
            
              § 1250.2
              Railroad performance data elements.
              (a) Each Class I railroad must report the performance data elements in paragraphs (a)(1)-(9) and (11) of this section on a weekly basis, and the data elements in paragraph (a)(10) on a monthly basis, for the reporting period, as defined in § 1250.1(a). However, with regard to data elements in paragraph (a)(7) and (8), Kansas City Southern Railway Company is not required to report information by state, but instead shall report system-wide data.
              (1) System-average train speed for the overall system and for the following train types for the reporting week. (Train speed should be measured for line-haul movements between terminals. The average speed for each train type should be calculated by dividing total train-miles by total hours operated.)
              (i) Intermodal.
              (ii) Grain unit.
              (iii) Coal unit.
              (iv) Automotive unit.
              (v) Crude oil unit.
              (vi) Ethanol unit.
              (vii) Manifest.
              (viii) System.

              (2) Weekly average terminal dwell time, measured in hours, excluding cars on run-through trains (i.e., cars that arrive at, and depart from, a terminal on the same through train), for the carrier's system and its 10 largest terminals in terms of railcars processed. (Terminal dwell is the average time a car resides at a specified terminal location expressed in hours.)

              (3) Weekly average cars on line by the following car types for the reporting week. (Each railroad shall average its daily on-line inventory of freight cars. Articulated cars should be counted as a single unit. Cars on private tracks (e.g., at a customer's facility) should be counted on the last railroad on which they were located. Maintenance-of-way cars and other cars in railroad service are to be excluded.)
              (i) Box.
              (ii) Covered hopper.
              (iii) Gondola.
              (iv) Intermodal.
              (v) Multilevel (Automotive).
              (vi) Open hopper.
              (vii) Tank.
              (viii) Other.
              (ix) Total.
              (4) Weekly average dwell time at origin for the following train types: Grain unit, coal unit, automotive unit, crude oil unit, ethanol unit, and all other unit trains. (For the purposes of this data element, dwell time refers to the time period from release of a unit train at origin until actual movement by the receiving carrier.)
              (5) The weekly average number of trains holding per day sorted by train type (intermodal, grain unit, coal unit, automotive unit, crude oil unit, ethanol unit, other unit, and manifest) and by cause (crew, locomotive power, or other). (Railroads are instructed to run a same-time snapshot of trains holding each day, and then to calculate the average for the reporting period.)

              (6) The weekly average of loaded and empty cars, operating in normal movement and billed to an origin or destination, which have not moved in 48 hours or more sorted by service type (intermodal, grain, coal, crude oil, automotive, ethanol, fertilizer (the following Standard Transportation Commodity Codes (STCCs): 2871236, 2871235, 2871238, 2819454, 2812534, 2818426, 2819815, 2818170, 2871315, 2818142, 2818146, 2871244, 2819173, 2871313, and 2871451), and all other). In order to derive the averages for the reporting period, carriers should run a same-time snapshot each day of the reporting period, capturing cars that have not moved in 48 hours or more. The number of cars captured on the daily snapshot for each category should be added, and then divided by the number of days in the reporting period. In deriving this data, carriers should include cars in normal service anywhere on their system, but should not include cars placed at a customer facility; in constructive placement; placed for interchange to another carrier; in bad order status; in storage; or operating in railroad service (e.g., ballast).
              (7) The weekly total number of grain cars loaded and billed, reported by state, aggregated for the following STCCs: 01131 (barley), 01132 (corn), 01133 (oats), 01135 (rye), 01136 (sorghum grains), 01137 (wheat), 01139 (grain, not elsewhere classified), 01144 (soybeans), 01341 (beans, dry), 01342 (peas, dry), and 01343 (cowpeas, lentils, or lupines). “Total grain cars loaded and billed” includes cars in shuttle service; dedicated train service; reservation, lottery, open and other ordering systems; and private cars. Additionally, separately report the total cars loaded and billed in shuttle service (or dedicated train service), if any, versus total cars loaded and billed in all other ordering systems, including private cars.
              (8) For the aggregated STCCs listed in § 1250.2(a)(7), for railroad-owned or leased cars that will move in manifest service, each railroad shall report by state the following:
              (i) Running total of orders placed;
              (ii) The running total of orders filled;
              (iii) For orders which have not been filled, the number of orders that are 1-10 days past due and 11+ days past due, as measured from when the car was due for placement under the railroad's governing tariff.
              (9) Weekly average coal unit train loadings or carloadings versus planned loadings for the reporting week by coal production region. Railroads have the option to report unit train loadings or carloadings, but should be consistent week over week.
              (10) For Class I carriers operating a grain shuttle program, the average grain shuttle turns per month, for the total system and by region, versus planned turns per month, for the total system and by region. This data shall be included in the first weekly report of each month, covering the previous calendar month.
              (11) Weekly carloads originated and carloads received in interchange by 23 commodity categories, separated into two subgroups:
              (i) Twenty-two historical commodity categories.
              (A) Chemicals.
              (B) Coal.
              (C) Coke.
              (D) Crushed Stone, Sand and Gravel.
              (E) Farm Products except Grain.
              (F) Food and Kindred Products.
              (G) Grain Mill Products.
              (H) Grain.
              (I) Iron and Steel Scrap.
              (J) Lumber and Wood Products.
              (K) Metallic Ores.
              (L) Metals.
              (M) Motor Vehicles and Equipment.
              (N) Non Metallic Minerals.
              (O) Petroleum Products.
              (P) Primary Forest Products.

              § 1250.3
              Chicago terminal reporting.

              (a) Each Class I railroad operating at the Chicago gateway must jointly report the following performance data on a weekly basis for the reporting period, as defined in § 1250.1(a). The reports required under this section may be submitted by the Association of American Railroads (AAR).
              (1) Average daily car volume in the following Chicago area yards: Barr, Bensenville, Blue Island, Calumet, Cicero, Clearing, Corwith, Gibson, Kirk, Markham, and Proviso for the reporting week; and
              (2) Average daily number of trains held for delivery to Chicago sorted by receiving carrier for the reporting week. The average daily number should be derived by taking a same time snapshot each day of the reporting week, capturing the trains held for each railroad at that time, and then adding those snapshots together and dividing by the days in the reporting week.
              (i) For purposes of this request, “held for delivery” refers to a train staged by the delivering railroad short of its scheduled arrival at the Chicago gateway at the request of the receiving railroad, and that has missed its scheduled window for arrival.
              (ii) If Chicago terminal yards not identified in § 1250.2(b)(1) are included in the Chicago Transportation Coordination Office's (CTCO) assessment of the fluidity of the gateway for purposes of implementing service contingency measures, then the data requested in § 1250.2(b)(1) shall also be reported for those yards.
              (b) The Class I railroad members of the CTCO (or one Class I railroad member of the CTCO designated to file on behalf of all Class I railroad members, or AAR) must:
              (1) File a written notice with the Board when the CTCO changes its operating Alert Level status, within one business day of that change in status.
              (2) If the CTCO revises its protocol of service contingency measures, file with the Board a detailed explanation of the new protocol, including both triggers and countermeasures, within seven days of its adoption.
              (c) Reports under paragraph (b) of this section shall be reported to the Director of the Office of Public Assistance, Governmental Affairs and Compliance (OPAGAC) via the method and in the form prescribed by OPAGAC.
            
            
              § 1250.4
              Rail infrastructure projects reporting.
              (a) Class I railroads shall submit annually a narrative report of significant rail infrastructure projects that will be commenced during the current calendar year, and a six-month update on those projects. The reports should briefly describe each project, its purpose, location (state/counties), and projected date of completion.
              (b) A “significant rail infrastructure project” is defined as a project with anticipated expenditures of $75 million or more over the life of the project.
              (c) The narrative report should be submitted no later than March 1 of each calendar year and the update no later than September 1 of each calendar year via email to the Board's Office of Public Assistance, Governmental Affairs and Compliance (OPAGAC) via the method and in the form prescribed by OPAGAC. In the event that March 1 or September 1 is a Federal holiday, weekend, or falls on a day when STB offices are closed for any other reason, then the data should be reported on the next business day when the offices are open.

              § 1280.2
              Policy.
              It is the policy of the Surface Transportation Board to act in accordance with Executive Order 12356, dated April 6, 1982, in matters relating to national security information.
            
            
              § 1280.3
              Authority to classify.
              The Board does not have authority of its own to classify any of its internally generated documents. The only documents handled by the Board which are classified as confidential, secret, or top secret are those generated by Executive Branch Agencies with original classification authority.
            
            
              § 1280.4
              Responsibility for handling of classified documents.

              (a) Responsible Official. Primary responsibility for the handling of classified documents shall rest with the Assistant to the Director of the Office of Compliance and Consumer Assistance, who is also Emergency Coordinator for the Board. All documents bearing the terms “Top Secret,” “Secret,” and “Confidential” shall be delivered to the Emergency Coordinator or his/her alternate immediately upon receipt. The alternate is also an Assistant to the Director of the Office of Compliance and Consumer Assistance as set forth in § 1280.4(b) of the rules. All potential recipients of such documents shall be advised of the name of the Emergency Coordinator. In the event that the Emergency Coordinator or his/her alternate is not available to receive such documents, they shall be turned over to the Associate Director, Office of Compliance and Consumer Assistance, and secured, unopened, in the combination safe located in Room 5325 of the headquarters building until the Emergency Coordinator or alternate is available. All material not immediately deliverable to either the Emergency Coordinator, alternate, or the Associate Director, Office of Compliance and Consumer Assistance, shall be delivered at the earliest opportunity. Under no circumstances shall classified material that cannot be delivered to the Emergency Coordinator be stored other than in the designated safe in Room 5325 of the STB headquarters building.
              (b) The alternate to the Emergency Coordinator for the receipt and handling of documents mentioned in paragraph (a) of this section, shall be the other Assistant to the Director, Office of Compliance and Consumer Assistance.
              (c) Any person whose position requires access to classified information must execute Form SF #189.
              (d) Any contracts with media representatives by personnel with access to classified material and involving such material will be cleared through the Emergency Coordinator and more than one person shall be present during any briefing or interview.
            
            
              § 1280.5
              Safeguarding of classified material.
              (a) Reproduction of classified material shall take place only when absolutely necessary, and in accordance with section 2001.46 of the Directive. Should copies be made, they are subject to the same controls as the original document. Records showing the number and distribution of copies shall be maintained by the Emergency Coordinator and the log stored with the original documents.
              (b) Any suspected or actual unauthorized disclosures of classified information shall be reported to the Emergency Coordinator or Alternate. An immediate investigation will be undertaken by the Emergency Coordinator or Alternate to establish all facts surrounding the disclosure. The Emergency Coordinator or Alternate shall ascertain the nature of the information disclosed and the extent to which it has been disseminated and will maintain records of disclosures as evaluated and investigated.
              (c) Any suspected or actual unauthorized disclosure of classified information will be reported as soon as possible to the Department of Justice and the Information Security Oversight Office.
              (d) Any unauthorized disclosure of classified information or any failure to cooperate with the investigation of unauthorized disclosures by an employee shall be cause for appropriate disciplinary or other remedial action as provided in the Board's Canons of Conduct, 49 CFR 1000.735-31.

              All classified documents shall be stored in the safe located in Room 5325 of the STB headquarters building. In those instances where the Emergency Coordinator is not available to receive classified documents, they may be stored, unopened, in the safe located in Room 5325.
            
            
              § 1280.7

              All employees who have been granted a security clearance and who have occasion to handle classified materials shall be advised of the procedures outlined in 49 CFR part 1280. They shall also be required to review Executive Order 12356 and appropriate directives of the Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO). This shall be achieved by a memorandum to all affected employees at the time these procedures are implemented, and by appropriate instructions to new employees receiving security clearances in the future.
            
            
              § 1280.8
              Requests for mandatory review.
              Because the Board does not itself generate classified documents, any requests made for mandatory review shall be coordinated by the Emergency Coordinator with appropriate officials of the Department or Agency responsible for issuance of the document involved.

              § 1300.1
              Scope; definitions.
              (a) The provisions of this part address the requirements imposed on rail carriers by 49 U.S.C. 11101(b), 11101(c), 11101(d) and 11101(f).
              (b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of this part apply to any common carriage transportation or service provided by a rail carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board under 49 U.S.C. 10501.
              (c) The provisions of this part do not apply to any transportation or service provided by a rail carrier under a contract authorized under 49 U.S.C. 10709 or former 49 U.S.C. 10713 (repealed effective January 1, 1996).
              (d) The provisions of this part do not apply to any transportation or service provided by a rail carrier to the extent that such transportation or service is exempted from rate notice and disclosure requirements pursuant to an exemption issued under 49 U.S.C. 10502 or former 49 U.S.C. 10505 (repealed effective January 1, 1996).
              (e) For the purposes of this part, “service terms” means all classifications, rules, and practices that affect the rates, charges, or level of service for rail transportation.
            
            
              § 1300.2
              Disclosure requirement for existing rates.
              (a) A rail carrier must disclose to any person, upon formal request, the specific rate(s) requested (or the basis for calculating the specific rate(s)), as well as all charges and service terms that may be applicable to transportation covered by the rate(s). For purposes of § 1300.4(a)(1) of this part, a formal request under this part is one that clearly notifies the railroad that the requester seeks not only immediate information but also notification of any future increases in the rate(s) involved or changes in pertinent service terms.
              (b) The information provided by a rail carrier under this section must be provided immediately. (It is expected that the response will be sent within hours, or at least by the next business day, in most situations.) Such information may be provided either in written or electronic form as agreed to by the parties. If the parties cannot agree, such information is to be provided in electronic (non-passive) form where both parties have the requisite capabilities; otherwise, it is to be provided in writing.
              (c) A rail carrier may, at its option, require that all requests submitted under this section be in written or electronic form, although the carrier may permit oral requests.
            
            
              § 1300.3
              Response to request for establishment of a new rate.

              Where a shipper or a prospective shipper or person acting on behalf of a shipper or a prospective shipper requests that the carrier establish a rate in the absence of an existing rate for particular transportation, the carrier must promptly establish and provide to the requester a rate and applicable service terms. The information may be provided either in written or electronic form, as agreed to by the parties. If the parties cannot agree, such information is to be provided in electronic (non-passive) form where both parties have the requisite capabilities; otherwise, it is to be provided in writing. The response should be provided as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than 10 business days from receipt of the request. If a carrier determines that additional information is required from the requester before a rate or term can be established, the carrier must so notify the requester as soon as possible, but no later than 10 business days after receipt of the request. Once the additional information is received, the carrier must set the rate and related service terms, and relay them to the requester, as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than 10 business days from the receipt of the additional information. (However, the parties may agree to a different time period, in which case these time periods would not apply.) A rail carrier may, at its option, require that requests submitted under this section be in written or electronic form, although the carrier may permit oral requests.
            
            
              § 1300.4
              Notice requirement.
              (a) A rail carrier may not increase any rates or charges, or change any service terms (except for changes that are equivalent to rate reductions), unless 20 days have expired after written or electronic notice has been provided to all persons who, within the previous 12 months:
              (1) Have formally requested under ;§ 1300.2 or § 1300.3 of this part the affected rates or service terms; or
              (2) Have made arrangements with the carrier for a future shipment that would be subject to the increased rates or changed service terms.
              (b) The notice required by this section may be in written or electronic form, as agreed to by the parties. If the parties cannot agree, the information is to be provided in electronic (non-passive) form where both parties have the requisite capabilities; otherwise, it is to be provided in writing.
              (c) For purposes of this section, a mailed notice is deemed “provided” on the date such notice is postmarked.
              (d) The notice required by this section must clearly identify the increases in rates or charges or the changes in service terms.
            
            
              § 1300.5
              Additional publication requirement for agricultural products and fertilizer.
              (a) With respect to transportation of agricultural products (including grain, as defined in 7 U.S.C. 75, and all products thereof) and fertilizer, a rail carrier shall publish, make available, and retain for public inspection its currently effective rates, schedules of rates, charges, and other service terms, and any scheduled changes to such rates, charges, and service terms. This requirement is in addition to the requirements imposed by §§ 1300.2, 1300.3, and 1300.4 of this part.
              (b) The information published under this section must include an accurate description of the services offered to the public; must provide the specific applicable rates (or the basis for calculating the specific applicable rates), charges, and service terms; and must be arranged in a way that allows for the determination of the exact rate, charges, and service terms applicable to any given shipment (or to any given group of shipments). Increases, reductions and other changes must be symbolized or highlighted in some way to facilitate ready identification of the changes, the nature of those changes and their effective dates.

              (c) A rail carrier must make the information available at offices where it normally keeps rate information. Access to the information at such offices must be provided to any person, without charge, during normal business hours. If a rail carrier is a Class I rail carrier, it must also make the information readily available online to any person without charge. Class I rail carriers may require persons accessing such information to register, but such registration requirements may not be overly burdensome, must provide timely access to the information, and cannot prevent specific types of persons from obtaining the information. Persons having difficulty accessing the information required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may either send a written inquiry addressed to the Director, Office of Public Assistance, Governmental Affairs, and Compliance or telephone the Board's Office of Public Assistance, Governmental Affairs, and Compliance.
              
              (d) A rail carrier must also make the required publications available to all persons (hereinafter referred to as subscribers) who have subscribed to a publication service operated either by the rail carrier itself or by an agent acting at the rail carrier's direction. Such publications may be made available either in printed or in electronic form as agreed to by the parties.

              § 1305.1
              Scope; definitions.
              (a) The provisions of this part address the requirements imposed on pipeline carriers by 49 U.S.C. 15701(b) and 15701(c). Such requirements apply to pipeline carriers only with respect to the transportation of commodities other than water, gas, or oil.
              (b) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the provisions of this part apply to any transportation or service provided by a pipeline carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board under 49 U.S.C. 15301.
              (c) The provisions of this part do not apply to any transportation or service provided by a pipeline carrier to the extent that such transportation or service is exempted from rate notice and disclosure requirements pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 15302.
              (d) For the purposes of this part, service terms means all classifications, rules, and practices that affect the rates, charges, or level of service for pipeline transportation.
            
            
              § 1305.2
              Disclosure requirement for existing rates.
              (a) A pipeline carrier must disclose to any person, on request, the specific rate(s) requested (or the basis for calculating the specific rate(s)), as well as all charges and service terms that may be applicable to transportation covered by those rate(s).
              (b) The information provided by a pipeline carrier under this section must be provided immediately. (It is expected that the response will be sent within hours, or at the latest by the next business day, in most situations.) Such information may be provided either in writing or in electronic form, as agreed to by the parties. If the parties cannot agree, such information is to be provided in electronic form where both parties have the requisite capabilities; otherwise, it is to be provided in writing.
              (c) A pipeline carrier may, at its option, require that all requests submitted under this section be in writing or electronic form, or the carrier may permit oral requests.
            
            
              § 1305.3
              Response to request for establishment of a new rate.
              Where a shipper or a prospective shipper, or a person acting on behalf of a shipper or a prospective shipper, requests that the carrier establish a rate in the absence of an existing rate for particular transportation, the carrier must promptly establish and provide to the requester a rate and applicable service terms. The information may be provided either in writing or in electronic form, as agreed to by the parties. If the parties cannot agree, such information is to be provided in electronic form where both parties have the requisite capabilities; otherwise, it is to be provided in writing. The response should be provided as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than 10 business days from receipt of the request. If a carrier determines that additional information is required from the requester before a rate or term can be established, the carrier must so notify the requester as soon as possible, but no later than 10 business days after receipt of the request. Once the additional information is received, the carrier must set the rate and related service terms, and relay them to the requester, as soon as possible, but no later than 10 business days. The time period for response set forth in this section will not apply when the parties agree to a different time period. A pipeline carrier may, at its option, require that requests submitted under this section be in writing or electronic form, or the carrier may permit oral requests.
            
            
              § 1305.4
              Notice requirement.

              (a) A pipeline carrier may not increase any rates or charges, or change any service terms (except for changes that are equivalent to rate reductions) unless 20 days have expired after written or electronic notice has been provided to all persons who, within the previous 12 months:
              
              (1) Have requested, under § 1305.2 or § 1305.3, the affected rates or service terms; or
              (2) Have made arrangements with the carrier for a shipment that would be subject to the increased rates or changed service terms.
              (b) The notice required by this section may be provided either in writing or in electronic form, as agreed to by the parties. If the parties cannot agree, the information is to be provided in electronic form where both parties have the requisite capabilities; otherwise, it is to be provided in writing.
              (c) For purposes of this section, a mailed notice is deemed “provided” on the date such notice is postmarked.
              (d) The notice required by this section must clearly identify the increase in rates or charges or the change in service terms.

              § 1310.1
              Scope; definitions.
              (a) The provisions of this part address the tariff requirements imposed by 49 U.S.C. 13702 on motor carriers and freight forwarders for the transportation of household goods, and the notice requirements with which such carriers must comply in order to be entitled to enforce the provisions of their tariffs against individuals whose shipments are subject to such tariffs.
              (b) The provisions of this part apply to all movements of household goods defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and to those movements of household goods defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section that are not provided under contracts entered into pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 14101(b) or former 49 U.S.C. 10702 (repealed January 1, 1996).
              (c) For the purposes of this part, the term household goods means personal effects and property used or to be used in a dwelling, when a part of the equipment or supply of such dwelling, and similar property if the transportation of such effects or property is:
              (1) Arranged and paid for by the householder, including transportation of property from a factory or store when the property is purchased by the householder with intent to use in his or her dwelling; or
              (2) Arranged and paid for by another party.
              (d) For the purposes of this part service terms means all classifications, rules, regulations and practices that affect the rates, charges, or level of service for movements of household goods.
            
            
              § 1310.2
              Requirement to maintain tariffs.
              (a) Except when providing transportation for charitable purposes without charge, carriers subject to the Board's jurisdiction under Chapter 135 of Title 49 of the United States Code may provide transportation or service for movements of household goods only if the rates, and related rules and practices, for such transportation or service are contained in a published tariff that is in effect under this section. The carrier may not charge or receive a different compensation for the transportation or service than the rate specified in the tariff, whether by returning a part of that rate to a person, by giving a person a privilege, by allowing the use of a facility that affects the value of that transportation or service, or through another device. Tariffs shall be published in the English language and rates shall be stated in money of the United States.
              (b) Tariffs maintained pursuant to this part must be available for inspection by the Board, and must be provided to the Board promptly and free of charge, upon request, by mail or other delivery service.

              (c) A carrier that maintains a tariff pursuant to this part may not enforce the provisions of the tariff unless the carrier has given notice that the tariff is available for inspection in its bill of lading or by other actual notice to individuals whose shipments are subject to the tariff, as provided in § 1310.4 of this part.
              (d) The Board may invalidate a tariff prepared by or on behalf of a carrier under this part if that tariff violates 49 U.S.C. 13702 or the regulations contained in this part.
            
            
              § 1310.3
              Contents of tariffs.
              (a) Tariffs prepared under this part must include an accurate description of the services offered to the public; must provide the specific applicable rates, charges and service terms; and must be arranged in a way that allows for the determination of the exact rate, charges and service terms applicable to any given shipment. Increases, reductions and other changes must be symbolized or highlighted in some way to facilitate ready identification of the changes and their effective dates.
              (b) All information necessary to determine applicable rates, charges and service terms for a given shipment need not be contained in a single tariff, but if multiple tariffs are used to convey that information, the tariff containing the rates must make specific reference to all other tariffs required to determine applicable rates, charges and service terms. The carrier(s) party to the rate(s) must participate in all of the tariffs so linked and all such tariffs must be made available to shippers upon reasonable request.
            
            
              § 1310.4
              Incorporation of tariff provisions by reference.
              (a) Carriers that maintain tariffs pursuant to this part may incorporate the terms of such tariffs by reference (i.e., without stating their full text) into the bill of lading or other document embodying the contract of carriage for the transportation of household goods, provided that:
              (1) The bill of lading or other document must contain a conspicuous notice that the contract of carriage incorporates the terms of the carrier's tariffs; the carrier must give notice that its tariffs are available for inspection in its bill of lading or by other actual notice to individuals whose shipments are subject to such tariffs; and the carrier must make the full text of incorporated terms readily available for inspection by the shipper, free of charge, upon request. If such terms cannot be made available immediately, they must be made available promptly and free of charge by mail or other delivery service.
              (2) If the incorporated terms include any of the terms set forth in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the notice on the bill of lading or other document must indicate that such terms are included; the shipper must be provided with a brief summary of the principal features of such terms on or with the document; and the shipper must be able to obtain a more complete explanation of such terms upon request.
              (i) Limits on the carrier's liability for loss, damage, or delay of goods, including fragile or valuable goods.
              (ii) Claim restrictions, including time periods within which shippers or consignees must file a claim or bring an action against the carrier for its acts or omissions or those of its agents.
              (iii) Rights of the carrier to impose monetary penalties on shippers or consignees, increase the price of the transportation, or change any terms of the contract.
              (b) A carrier may not claim the benefit as against a shipper or consignee of, and a shipper or consignee shall not be bound by, any tariff term that is incorporated by reference under this section unless the carrier has complied with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
              (c) The disclosure requirements established by this section preempt any State requirements on the same subject, for tariff terms that are incorporated by reference into the bill of lading or other document embodying the contract of carriage for the transportation of household goods.
            
            
              § 1310.5
              Availability of tariffs at carrier offices.
              (a) Each carrier shall maintain, at its principal office, a complete set of its effective tariffs and those to which it is a party.

              (b) Each carrier shall also maintain some or all of its tariffs at its other business offices, upon request. Carriers shall provide information regarding all locations where tariffs may be viewed.
              (c) At all points where tariffs are maintained, they shall be made available for inspection by any person during the carrier's normal business hours. The tariffs shall be accessible and readable. The carrier shall also display, in a conspicuous place in those locations, a notice, in large print, which contains a statement that the tariffs are available for public inspection.
              (d) At all other carrier business offices, the carrier shall display a notice advising the public of the location of the nearest available tariff. The notice shall be in large print and posted in a conspicuous place. In addition, the carrier shall, upon request, make its tariffs available at that location as soon as possible but not later than within 20 days, or provide the sought information orally if satisfactory to the requestor.
              (e) Any publication referred to in a tariff must be maintained with that tariff.
              (f) If any tariff maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section has not been used for a substantial length of time, the availability of that tariff, including its reissues, may be discontinued at that office until such time as it is again requested. It shall then be made available within 20 days.
            
            
              § 1310.6
              Furnishing copies of tariff publications.
              (a) Copies of tariffs, specific tariff provisions or tariff subscriptions shall be provided upon request to any interested person.
              (b) Except for providing to shippers the full text of tariff terms incorporated by reference into the bill of lading or other document embodying the contract of carriage for the transportation of household goods, as described in § 1310.4(a)(1), carriers may assess charges for furnishing copies of tariff publications to interested persons. If a charge is made, the charge must be reasonable, and identical for the same publications and delivery service.

              § 1312.2
              Requirement to publish and file a tariff.
              (a) Requirement for tariff. Except when providing transportation for charitable purposes without charge, or when providing transportation or service described in § 1312.1(b), carriers subject to the Board's jurisdiction under 49 U.S.C. Chapter 135 may provide transportation or service described in § 1312.1(a) only if the rates, and related rules and practices, for such transportation or service are contained in a published tariff that is on file with the Board and in effect under this part.
              (b) Adherence to tariff. The carrier may not charge or receive a different compensation for the transportation or service than the rate specified in the tariff, whether by returning a part of that rate to a person, giving a person a privilege, allowing the use of a facility that affects the value of that transportation or service, or another device.
              
              (c) Other information. Provisions for information purposes only may be included in a tariff, provided they are clearly identified as such. Such provisions may include rates and service terms covering transportation not subject to regulation by the Board, and advertising and promotional material.
              (d) Effect of filing. The tender of a tariff and its receipt and acceptance by the Board do not relieve a carrier of liability for violations of the Act, other laws, the Board's regulations, or any decision of the Board or a court, or have any effect on the rights of persons to file complaints for substantive violations of the Act or the Board's regulations.
              (e) Invalidation of tariffs. Tariffs that violate section 13702 of the Act, or a regulation of the Board carrying out that section, may be invalidated by the Board. When a tariff is invalidated, the party that filed it will be furnished a written explanation of the reasons for such action. Tariffs issued in lieu of invalidated tariffs shall so state.

              § 1312.3
              Tariff contents and standards; Essential criteria.
              (a) Contents. Tariffs filed with the Board, including tariffs published, filed, and kept electronically in accordance with § 1312.4(b), must: Be filed in English; include an accurate description of the services offered to the public; provide the specific applicable rates explicitly stated in U.S. dollars and cents (or the basis for calculating the specific applicable rates) and service terms; and be arranged in a way that allows for the determination of the exact rate(s) and service terms applicable to any given shipment (or to any given group of shipments). Tariffs that are electronically kept on the internet must also provide the date on which a new tariff or any change in any tariff matter first appears on the internet and the date on which it becomes effective.
              (b) Use of multiple tariffs. All information necessary to determine applicable rates and service terms for a given shipment need not be contained in a single tariff, but if multiple tariffs are used to convey that information, the tariff containing the rates must make specific reference (by STB tariff designation) to all other tariffs required to determine applicable rates and service terms, and the carrier(s) party to the rates must participate in all of the tariffs so linked.
              (c) Clarity. Tariff information must be presented in a way that facilitates the determination of the prices and services offered, and the related service terms. Ambiguous terms and complex methods of presentation shall not be used.
              (d) Explanations. Reference marks and abbreviations, other than commonly used abbreviations, shall be explained either in the item in which they are used or in a separate item.

              § 1312.4
              Filing of tariffs.
              (a) Paper filing requirements. (1) Two copies of each tariff publication shall be filed with the Board. Packages containing tariff filings should be prominently marked “TARIFF FILING” and addressed to: Office of Public Assistance, Governmental Affairs and Compliance, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423-0001. Tariffs shall be printed on paper not larger than 81/2 x 11 inches.
              (2) A paper tariff filing must be accompanied by an authorized document of transmittal identifying each publication filed, and by the appropriate filing fee (see 49 CFR part 1002). Acknowledgement of Board receipt of a paper tariff filing can be obtained by enclosing a duplicate transmittal letter and a postage-paid, self-addressed return envelope. Each transmittal letter shall clearly indicate in the upper left-hand corner thereof:
              (i) The assigned alpha code of the issuing carrier or agent;
              (ii) The number of pages transmitted;
              (iii) The filing fee enclosed method of payment (pursuant to 49 CFR 1002.2(a)); and
              (iv) The transmittal number if the filer utilizes transmittal numbers.
              (b) Electronic filing requirements. As an alternative to the paper tariff filing procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, a water carrier may file its tariffs electronically in accordance with the procedures and requirements of this section. Tariffs published, filed, and kept electronically in accordance with the requirements of this section shall be deemed to be on file with the Board for purposes of 49 U.S.C. 13702(b).
              (1) Annual certification. A water carrier that seeks to file its tariff electronically must electronically file an annual certification with the Board, made by the water carrier's duly authorized corporate officer. The annual certification must be submitted to the Board on the first business day in October each year. The Director of the Office of Public Assistance, Governmental Affairs, and Compliance or a designee will acknowledge receipt of each carrier's certification in writing. The annual certification shall include the following:
              (i) Certification that it is a water carrier operating in the noncontiguous domestic trade subject to the Board's jurisdiction;
              (ii) Certification that it is in compliance with the regulations of this section for purposes of publishing, filing, and keeping its tariff electronically;
              (iii) Certification that it is in compliance with all other regulations in this part, except those specifically applicable to tariffs maintained in paper format;
              (iv) An active link to the internet address of tariffs;
              (v) The assigned alpha code of the issuing carrier or agent; and
              (vi) Confirmation of electronic payment of the filing fee (pursuant to 49 CFR 1002.2(a)).
              (2) Sample text for the annual certification.
              
              [Name of Director, Office of Public Assistance, Governmental Affairs, and Compliance], Office of Public Assistance, Governmental Affairs and Compliance, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC.
              Dear Director: I, [name of signor], certify that I am [title of office] of [name of water carrier], a water carrier operating in the noncontiguous domestic trade subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board, that [name of water carrier] is in compliance with the regulations at part 1312 for purposes of publishing, filing, and keeping its tariff electronically, and that it is in compliance with all other regulations at part 1312, except those specifically applicable to tariffs maintained in paper format.
              The internet address where [name of water carrier]'s tariffs can be located is:
              This internet address is current as of [date].
              I further declare (certify, verify or state) under penalty of perjury [“under the laws of the United States of America” if executed outside of the United States of America] that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on [date].
              Sincerely,
              [signature of a duly authorized corporate officer of water carrier]
              (3) Tariff access requirement. (i) A water carrier must provide the Board with at least two business days advance notice of any planned outage when its tariff will not be available on the internet, and prompt notice on any occasion when the tariff becomes unavailable due to circumstances beyond the carrier's control. Notice shall be submitted by email to tariffs@stb.gov. In the event of any outage, carriers are required to make alternative arrangements with the agency to ensure that the Board receives the tariffs in effect during the outage.
              (ii) A water carrier may establish reasonable registration requirements for purposes of public access to its current tariff and historical tariff information, such as requiring a user to provide his or her name and email address; however, such requirements may not limit tariff access to any particular group or class of users (such as shippers or potential shippers) or impose unreasonable burdens on the user, such as access fees or a showing of need.
              (4) Historical tariff information and archiving. Tariffs kept on the internet by a water carrier must allow the Board and the public to retrieve historical versions, including all rates and applicable rules, for a period of not less than five years, beginning on the date when a carrier first electronically files its tariffs under these regulations.

              § 1312.5
              Amendments to tariffs.
              (a) Manner of making changes. An amendment is a change in, addition to, or cancellation of part of a tariff. Supplements are the tariff publications used to amend bound tariffs, and new or revised pages are the tariff publications normally used to amend looseleaf tariffs, although looseleaf tariffs can also be amended by supplements. Tariffs can also be canceled by new or reissued tariffs (see § 1312.7).
              (b) Supplements. Supplements issued to amend a tariff shall be consecutively numbered. Each new supplement shall identify any supplement(s) that it cancels, and any supplement(s) that are still in effect. A tariff amendment published in a supplement may be carried forward to later supplements if it is identified as reissued without change from the supplement in which it was originally published.
              (c) Looseleaf pages. Looseleaf pages to an original tariff shall be designated as “Original” (e.g., Original Title Page, Original Page 1, Original Page 2, etc.). Looseleaf pages issued to amend the tariff shall bear consecutive revision numbers and shall cancel the prior version(s) of the same page (e.g., 1st Revised Page 1 Cancels Original Page 1, 2nd Revised Page 1 Cancels 1st Revised Page 1, etc.). Additional original pages may also be issued to amend a tariff, by adding new numbered pages after the last numbered page, or by adding existing numbered pages with alphabetic suffixes (e.g., a page designated as Original Page 2-A could be added between pages 2 and 3, etc.). Each looseleaf tariff shall include a Check Sheet, a Correction Number Check Sheet, or some other method of determining the looseleaf pages issued to amend such tariff.
            
            
              § 1312.6
              Advance notice required.
              (a) Notice requirement. Unless otherwise specifically authorized by the Board, tariffs must be filed with the Board on not less than the notice shown in paragraph (b) of this section. Notice means the number of days the publication is on file with the Board prior to its effective date(s). The date the publication is received by the Board counts as the first day of notice.
              (b) Length of notice. A tariff may not become effective earlier than:
              (1) Thirty days after filing for all collectively established tariff matter.

              (3) Upon filing for independently established new tariff matter, independently established reduced tariff matter, the addition or restoration of a carrier's participation in a tariff, a correction to the list of participating carriers in a tariff (other than the cancellation of a carrier's participation), an extension of the expiration date of tariff matter, or a postponement of the effective date of proposed tariff matter.
              (c) Receipt of tariffs by the Board. The Board will receive tariff filings between the hours of 8:30 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time on workdays. Tariff filings delivered to the Board on other than a workday, or after 5:00 P.M. on a workday, will be considered as received the next workday.
              (d) Definitions. For the purposes of this section:
              
                Increased means any tariff change that results in higher charges to the payer of freight charges or reduced service at the same rate;

                Reduced means any tariff change that results in lower charges to the payer of freight charges or expanded service at the same rate; and
              
                Workdays means all days except Saturdays, Sundays and all Federal holidays observed in the District of Columbia.
              (e) Notice for purposes of electronically filed tariffs. A water carrier that keeps its tariffs on the internet must comply with the notice requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, provided however, that the relevant notice periods set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section shall run from the date on which the tariff matter first appears in the water carrier's tariff on the internet.

              (f) Alternative subscription services. The service described in this section must be available to any subscriber requesting it; however, the requirement to offer such service does not preclude the offering of different services to subscribers requesting those services.

              § 1312.14
              Powers of attorney and concurrences.
              (a) Authorization. Rates and services of a carrier must be filed in a tariff issued in that carrier's name unless they are filed:
              (1) In an agent's tariff when the carrier has executed a power of attorney authorizing that individual or entity to serve as its tariff agent; or
              (2) In a tariff of another carrier through issuance of a concurrence to the latter carrier authorizing the first carrier's participation in joint rates and through routes.
              (b) Disclosure of authorization. If two or more carriers execute powers of attorney to the same agent, it is not necessary for those carriers to exchange concurrences to participate in joint rates in that agent's tariffs. Powers of attorney and concurrences are not to be filed with the Board, but shall be provided to any person on request.
            
            
              § 1312.15
              Change of carrier or agent.
              (a) Change in carrier. When a carrier's name is lawfully changed, or a fiduciary assumes possession and control of a carrier's property, all affected tariffs must be amended to reflect the change. The amendments required by this paragraph shall be filed promptly and, if possible, prior to their effective date, but in no case later than 60 days thereafter. Regardless of the date the tariff is actually filed, the effective date for an amendment required by this paragraph is the date the event occurs. A water carrier that publishes, files, and keeps its tariffs electronically in accordance with § 1312.4(b) shall promptly submit any such change by email to tariffs@stb.gov, but in no case later than 20 days after the effective date.
              (b) Change of agent. When a new agent is appointed to take over an agency, or when an alternate agent assumes the duties of the principal agent, each of the superseded agent's effective tariffs shall immediately be amended to reflect the change, bearing an effective date the same as the date of the transfer. In the case of a new agent, this may only occur after one or more of the participating carriers issues a power of attorney to the new agent, and revokes the previous power of attorney. At the same time, all affected tariffs will be amended to reflect the new powers of attorney, and all carriers who have not issued them must be canceled from the tariff. A water carrier that publishes, files, and keeps its tariffs electronically in accordance with § 1312.4(b) shall promptly submit any such change of agent by email to tariffs@stb.gov, but in no case later than 200 days after the effective date.

              § 1312.16
              Substitution of service.
              If a water or motor carrier (hereafter referred to as Carrier A) desires to have the option of substituting the services of a carrier of a different transportation mode (hereafter referred to as Carrier B) for part of its movement of a shipment, it may do so if:
              (a) The shipment moves on the bill of lading that would be used if Carrier A were performing the service;
              (b) Carrier A assumes the responsibility for the lading while it is in the possession of Carrier B; and
              (c) Movement of the lading has been made prior to, or will be made subsequent to, the service performed by Carrier B.

              61 FR 68669, Dec. 30, 1996, unless otherwise noted.
            
            
              § 1313.1
              Scope; definition of terms.
              (a) This part addresses the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 10709 that require rail carriers to file with the Board a summary of each contract for the transportation of agricultural products (including grain, as defined in 7 U.S.C. 75 and products thereof) and that allow complaints to be filed with the Board regarding such contracts.
              (b) The provisions of this part do not apply to any transportation that is exempted from the Board's contract regulation pursuant to an exemption issued under 49 U.S.C. 10502 or former 49 U.S.C. 10505 (repealed effective January 1, 1996).

              (c) For purposes of this part, the term contract means an agreement, including any amendment thereto, entered into by one or more rail carriers and one or more purchasers of rail services to provide specified transportation of agricultural products (including grain, as defined in 7 U.S.C. 75 and products thereof) under specified rates and conditions. The term amendment includes contract modifications agreed to by the parties.
              
              (d) An amended contract is treated as a new contract under this part. Remedies are revived and review is again available, upon complaint.
            
            
              § 1313.2
              Contract summary filing requirement.
              (a) Rail carriers subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board under 49 U.S.C. 10501 must promptly file with the Board a summary of each contract entered into for the transportation of agricultural products.
              (b) Contract summaries not in compliance with this part may be rejected by the Board. If a contract summary is rejected, it will be considered as not filed, and the carrier must promptly file a corrected contract summary to replace the rejected summary.
            
            
              § 1313.3
              Board review; contract disapproval.
              (a) Board review. (1) No later than 30 days after a contract summary is filed, the Board may, on complaint, begin a proceeding to review such contract on the grounds described in § 1313.9.
              (2) If the Board begins a proceeding, it shall determine, within 30 days after the proceeding is commenced, whether the contract is in violation of 49 U.S.C. 10709.
              (b) Contract disapproval. If the Board finds that the contract is in violation of 49 U.S.C. 10709, it will:
              (1) Disapprove the contract; or
              (2) Where the Board finds unreasonable discrimination, in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 10709(g)(2)(B)(i), order the contracting carrier(s) to provide to the complainant(s) rates and service substantially similar to those contained in the contract at issue, with such differences in terms and conditions as are justified by the evidence.
              (c) Applicable rates/charges if a contract is disapproved. If the Board disapproves a contract (or contract amendment), the appropriate non-contract rates/charges (or the contract provisions otherwise in effect) will be applicable.
            
            
              § 1313.4
              Filing procedures and formats for contract summaries.
              (a) Filing of Summaries. (1) Two copies of each contract summary, containing the applicable information specified in §§ 1313.6, 1313.7, or 1313.8, as appropriate, must be filed with the Board as soon as possible, but no longer than 7 days after the date of the contract (or contract amendment).
              (2) The outside envelope or wrapper containing one or more contract summaries must be prominently marked “Rail Contract Summary” and addressed to: Tariffs Branch, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423.
              (3) A transmittal letter identifying the submitted publication(s), and the name and telephone number of a contact person, must accompany each filing of one or more contract summaries. Each transmittal letter shall clearly indicate in the upper left-hand corner thereof:
              (i) The assigned alpha code of the filing carrier;
              (ii) The number of summaries transmitted;
              (iii) The filing fee enclosed (pursuant to 49 CFR 1002.2(a)); and
              (iv) The transmittal number if the filer utilizes transmittal numbers.
              (b) Contract summary title page. The title page of each contract summary must contain only the following information:
              (1) In the upper right corner, the contract summary number (see paragraph (c) of this section), followed by the amendment number if an amended contract summary.
              (2) In the center of the page, the filing carrier's name, followed by the words “CONTRACT SUMMARY” or “AMENDED CONTRACT SUMMARY”, as applicable, in large print.
              (3) Date of contract and its effective date.
              (4) In the center lower portion, the individual submitting the filing, and the name of the individual(s) for service of complaints (if not the same individual). If not otherwise noted, a complainant may rely on service to the individual submitting the filing.
              (c) Contract summary numbering system. (1) The contract summary identification number must include the word “STB,” the standard carrier alphabetic code for the filing railroad (limited to four letters), the letter “C,” and a sequential number, with each separated by a hyphen. The following is an example: the 357th contract summary filed by the Conrail would have the following identification number: “STB-CR-C-357.”
              (2) At its option, the carrier may issue contract summaries with nonconsecutive numbers if it assigns blocks of numbers for specific uses. An index to the blocks of reserved numbers shall be filed with the Board.
              (d) Format requirements for contract summary information. (1) The contract summary must enumerate and have each item required in §§ 1313.6, 1313.7 or 1313.8 of this part, as applicable, completed. When the item does not pertain to the contract, the term “Not Applicable” (“NA”) shall be used.
              (2) Changes in prior contract summaries must be underscored and must be followed by the words “addition,” “deletion,” “extension,” “cancellation,” or other appropriate descriptive phrase in parentheses. If the change to the contract is only in confidential matter, a statement to that effect must be made in the amended contract summary and must indicate the particular feature to which the change applies (i.e., rate, special feature, etc.). If “not applicable” is permitted in the original summary under §§ 1313.6 through 1313.8 of this part, the amended summary may use “not applicable” with a notation that a change pertained only to confidential data.
              (3) Amended contract summaries may not substitute phrases such as “not applicable” or “no change” where disclosure was required in the original contact summary (such as in the commodity description); amended contract summaries must set forth all required non-confidential terms in the contract, whether amended or not.

              (a)(1) A contract summary filed under these rules shall be made available for public inspection in the Tariffs Branch of the Surface Transportation Board.
              (2) A contract summary filed under these rules also shall be made available by the carrier(s) participating in the contract, upon reasonable request.
              (b) Where not already required by § 1313.10(a)(5) of this part, the contract for which a summary is filed under these rules shall be provided immediately to the Board, upon request, for its use in carrying out its functions under the statute.

              (a) A complaint may be filed against a contract covered by this part:
              (1) By any shipper on the ground that such shipper individually will be harmed because the contract unduly impairs the ability of the contracting rail carrier or carriers to meet their common carrier obligations to the complainant under 49 U.S.C. 11101;
              (2) By a port on the ground that such port individually will be harmed because the contract will result in unreasonable discrimination against such port; and
              (3) By a shipper of agricultural commodities on the ground that such shipper individually will be harmed because:
              (i) The rail carrier has unreasonably discriminated by refusing to enter into a contract with such shipper for rates and services for the transportation of the same type of commodity under similar conditions to the contract at issue, and that such shipper was ready, willing, and able to enter into such a contract at a time essentially contemporaneous with the period during which the contract at issue was offered; or
              (ii) The contract constitutes a destructive competitive practice.
              (b) Unreasonable discrimination, for purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, has the same meaning as the term has under 49 U.S.C. 10741.

              (2) Complaint. A complaint must contain the correct, unabbreviated names and addresses of the complainant(s) and defendant(s). The complainant must set out the statutory provisions under which it has standing to file a complaint, and its reasons for requesting that the Board find the challenged contract unlawful.
              (3) Discovery petition. A discovery petition must note on the front page “Petition for Discovery of Rail Contract” and note the contract (and any applicable amendment) number. It should provide the following information:
              (i) Standing—grounds. The ground upon which the petitioner's complaint is based under § 1313.9.

              (B) The relevant commodities that petitioner ships or receives.
              (C) Comparisons of the petitioner's commodities, locations of shipping facilities and serving carriers, actual or potential traffic patterns and serving carrier(s), with the traffic patterns and serving carrier(s) identified in the contract summary. State whether petitioner is a consignor or consignee.
              (D) The petitioner's ability to ship the commodity in question at a time generally simultaneous with the challenged contract.
              (E) The potential effect of the contract on the petitioner's relevant business.
              (F) Any additional supporting information, including prior negotiations, if any.
              (iii) Relevance. The relevance of the information sought to the petitioner's challenge to the contract.
              (iv) Nexus. Where the complaint challenges a carrier's ability to perform its common carrier obligation, the nexus between the information sought and the common carrier obligation of the contracting carrier(s).
              (4) Service of pleadings. The complainant must certify that 2 copies of the complaint, and discovery petition if filed, have been sent to the contracting carrier(s) either by hand, express mail, or other overnight delivery service the same day as filed at the Board. The contracting carrier shall in turn serve the contracting shipper with a copy of the complaint and petition. Replies shall be served in the same manner on complainant/petitioner.
              (5) Submission of contract. Immediately upon the filing of a complaint, the rail carrier filing the contract summary shall forward to the Board, by hand, express mail, or other overnight delivery service, the subject contract or amended contract.
              (6) Replies. Replies to the complaint/petition are due within 5 days from the date of filing of the complaint/petition, and in no event later than noon on the 23rd day following filing of the contract summary.
              (7) Filings. If a complaint, petition, or reply is filed in paper, it must be filed with the Board in a package marked “Confidential Rail Contract Material”. If a complaint, petition, or reply is electronically filed, it must be designated as confidential in the Board's e-filing system.
              (8) Discovery appeals. If action on a petition for discovery is taken under delegated authority, that action may be appealed to the Board, subject to the following:
              (i) An appeal must be received within 2 days of the initial decision, but in no event later than the 28th day after the contract summary is filed.
              (ii) The appeal must be marked “Appeal of Delegated Authority Action Regarding Rail Contract Discovery”.
              (iii) Telegraphic notice or its equivalent must be given to the opposing parties.

              (iv) Replies to the appeal must be filed within one day after the appeal is filed.
              
              (9) Furnishing of information. If discovery is granted, the carrier must furnish the required information to the petitioner by the 1st working day after the Board issues its decision.
              (b) Informal discovery. (1) Prior to filing a petition for formal discovery under paragraph (a) of this section, a petitioner may request discovery from the carrier.
              (2) The carrier must promptly grant or deny the request.
              (3) Agreements between carriers and shippers for informal discovery are permitted under these rules.
              (c) Confidentiality. If confidential contract data are filed with the Board in a pleading, the party filing these data should submit them as a separate package, clearly marked on the outside “Confidential Material Subject to Protective Order.” The order in paragraph (d) of this section applies to the parties specified in the order who receive confidential information through proceedings before the Board or through informal discovery.
              (d) Protective order. Petitioner and carriers, and their duly authorized agents, shall limit to the contract complaint proceeding the use of contract information or other confidential commercial information which may be revealed in the contract, the complaint, reply, or in any other pleading relating to the contract. This restriction shall be a condition to release of any contract term to a petitioner/complainant and shall operate similarly on a carrier in possession of confidential information which may be contained in a complaint, petition for discovery, or request for informal disclosure. Any information pertaining to parties to the contract or subject to the contract (including consignors, consignees and carriers), or pertaining to the terms of the contract, or relating to the petitioner's/complainant's confidential commercial information, must be kept confidential. Neither the information nor the existence of the information shall be disclosed to third parties, except for: consultants or agents who agree, in writing, to be bound by this regulation; information which is publicly available; information which, after receipt, becomes publicly available through no fault of the party seeking to disclose the information after it has become publicly available, or is acquired from a third party free of any restriction as to its disclosure. The petitioner/complainant or carrier must take all necessary steps to assure that the information will be kept confidential by its employees and agents. No copies of the contract terms or other confidential information are to be retained by the parties not originally privy to the data subsequent to the termination of the proceeding.
              (e) Contract review proceeding. If the Board institutes a proceeding to review the contract, the complainant's case-in-chief is due 9 days after the institution of the proceeding, but no later than 39 days after the filing of the contract summary. Replies are due 16 days after the institution of the proceeding, but no later than 46 days after the filing of the contract summary.

              § 1331.5
              Additional standards for retaining antitrust immunity by passenger bus industry rate bureaus.
              (a) Rate bureaus must comply with the terms of their agreements, as approved by the Board. Failure to do so will result in lack of immunity for that activity.
              (b) The bureaus are required to maintain detailed minutes of all meetings where immunized matters are discussed. The bureaus will be subject to withdrawal of their immunity for serious continuing violations of Board standards, and individual tariff publications will be subject to rejection, suspension, or investigation for improprieties in the rate bureau process.
              (c) Absent Board approval, no other changes may be made in any approved agreement.
              (d) For the purposes of the statute, the following definitions shall apply:
              (1) A general increase is a proposed general adjustment of substantially all the rates published in a rate bureau's tariff(s).
              (2) A broad change in tariff structure modifies in a relatively non-uniform fashion the relationship between most rates published in a rate bureau's tariff, and applies to a large area, either nationally or regionally.
              (3) An innovative fare will be determined on a case-by-case basis; the Board will, on request, issue opinions on whether particular rate proposals may be regarded as innovative. Two examples of an innovative fare are:
              (i) A fare for unlimited passenger travel; and
              (ii) An experimental fare providing for transportation at the passenger's option over the line of one or more carriers.
              (4) A promotional fare generally has three characteristics:
              (i) Limited duration;
              (ii) Attractive price or level of service quality; and
              (iii) Some added feature in addition to those normally offered.

              § 1333.1
              Demurrage defined.
              
                Demurrage is a charge that both compensates rail carriers for the expenses incurred when rail cars are detained beyond a specified period of time (i.e., free time) for loading or unloading, and serves as a penalty for undue car detention to encourage the efficient use of rail cars in the rail network.
            
            
              § 1333.2
              Who may charge demurrage.
              Demurrage shall be assessed by the serving rail carrier, i.e., the rail carrier providing rail cars to a shipper at an origin point or delivering them to a receiver at an end-point or intermediate destination. A serving carrier and its customers (including those to which it delivers rail cars at origin or destination) may enter into contracts pertaining to demurrage, but in the absence of such contracts, demurrage will be governed by the demurrage tariff of the serving carrier.
            
            
              § 1333.3
              Who is subject to demurrage.
              Any person receiving rail cars from a rail carrier for loading or unloading who detains the cars beyond the period of free time set forth in the governing demurrage tariff may be held liable for demurrage if the carrier has provided that person with actual notice of the demurrage tariff providing for such liability prior to the placement of the rail cars. The notice required by this section shall be in written or electronic form.

                This part provides information on TSA's investigative and enforcement procedures.
              
              
                
                § 1503.3
                Reports by the public of security problems, deficiencies, and vulnerabilities.
                This section prescribes the reporting mechanisms that persons may use in order to obtain a receipt for reports to TSA regarding transportation-related security problems, deficiencies, and vulnerabilities.
                (a) Any person who reports to TSA a transportation security-related problem, deficiency, or vulnerability—including the security of aviation, commercial motor vehicle, maritime, pipeline, any mode of public transportation, or railroad transportation—will receive a receipt for their report if they provide valid contact information and report through one of the following:
                (1) U.S. mail to Transportation Security Administration HQ, TSA-2; Attn: 49 CFR 1503.3 Reports; 601 South 12th Street; Arlington, VA 20598-6002;
                (2) Internet at http://www.tsa.gov/contact, selecting “Security Issues”; or
                (3) Telephone (toll-free) at 1-866-289-9673.
                (b) Reports submitted by mail will receive a receipt through the mail, reports submitted by the Internet will receive an e-mail receipt, and reports submitted by phone will receive a call identifier number linked to TSA documents held according to published record schedules. To obtain a paper copy of reports provided by phone, the person who made the report, or their authorized representative, must contact TSA at the address identified in (a)(1) of this section within that period and provide the identifier number.
                (c) TSA will review and consider the information provided in any report submitted under this section and take appropriate steps to address any problems, deficiencies, or vulnerabilities identified.
                (d) Nothing in this section relieves a person of a separate obligation to report information to TSA under another provision of this title, a security program, or a security directive, or to another Government agency under other law.

                (e) Immediate or emergency security or safety concerns should be reported to the appropriate local emergency services operator, such as by telephoning 911. Alleged waste, fraud, and abuse in TSA programs should be reported to the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General: telephone (toll-free) 1-800-323-8603, or e-mail DHSOIGHOTLINE@dhs.gov.

                (c) The last day of a time period is included in a computation of time unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, a legal holiday, or a day on which the enforcement docket is officially closed.

                (c) Response. Not later than 30 days after receipt of the Notice of Violation, the individual charged with a violation must respond to TSA by taking one, and only one, of the following options.

                (1) Submit a certified check or money order for the lesser specified penalty amount in the Notice of Violation, made payable to Transportation Security Administration and sent to the address specified in the Notice of Violation, or make such payment electronically through http://www.pay.gov.
                
                (2) Submit to the office identified in the Notice of Violation one of the following:
                (i) Written information and other evidence, including documents and witness statements, demonstrating that a violation of the regulations did not occur as alleged, or that the proposed penalty is not warranted by the circumstances.
                (ii) A written request to reduce the proposed civil penalty, the amount of requested reduction, together with any documents supporting a reduction of the proposed civil penalty, which reflect a current financial inability to pay or records showing that payment of the proposed civil penalty would prevent the person from continuing in business.
                (iii) A written request for an Informal Conference, at a date to be determined by an agency official, to discuss the matter with the agency official and to submit supporting evidence and information to the agency official before the date of the Informal Conference.
                (3) Submit to the office identified in the Notice of Violation and to TSA's Enforcement Docket Clerk a written request for a formal hearing before an ALJ in accordance with subpart G.

                (e) Order Assessing Civil Penalty. A Final Notice and Order automatically converts to an Order Assessing Civil Penalty if—

                (1) The individual charged with a violation submits a certified check or money order in the amount reflected in the Final Notice and Order to Transportation Security Administration at the address specified in the Final Notice and Order, or makes such payment electronically through http://www.pay.gov; or
                (2) The individual fails to respond to the Final Notice and Order or request a formal hearing within 15 days after receipt of that notice.

                Request for a formal hearing.
                (a) General. Any respondent may request a formal hearing, pursuant to § 1503.413(c)(3) or § 1503.421(c)(3), to be conducted in accordance with the procedures in subpart G of this part. The filing of a request for a formal hearing does not guarantee a person an opportunity to appear before an ALJ in person, because the ALJ may issue an initial decision or dispositive order resolving the case prior to the commencement of the formal hearing.
                (b) Form. The person submitting a request for hearing must date and sign the request, and must include his or her current address. The request for hearing must be typewritten or legibly handwritten.
                (c) Submission of request. A person requesting a hearing must file a written request for a hearing with the Enforcement Docket Clerk in accordance with § 1503.429 and must serve a copy of the request on the agency attorney or other agency official who issued the Notice of Proposed Civil Penalty, or Notice of Violation, as applicable, and any other party, in accordance with § 1503.429.
              
              
                
                § 1503.429
                Filing of documents with the Enforcement Docket Clerk.
                (a) General. This section governs filing of documents with the Enforcement Docket Clerk when required under this part.
                (b) Type of service. A person must file a document with the Enforcement Docket Clerk by delivering two copies of the document as follows:
                (1) By personal delivery or mail, to United States Coast Guard (USCG) ALJ Docketing Center, ATTN: Enforcement Docket Clerk, at the address specified in § 1503.413(c)(3).

                (3) By facsimile transmission, to 410-962-1746. If this number changes, TSA will provide notice of the change by notice in the Federal Register.
                
                (c) Contents. Unless otherwise specified in this part, each document must contain a short, plain statement of the facts supporting the person's position and a brief statement of the action requested in the document. Each document must be typewritten or legibly handwritten.
                (d) Date of filing. The date of filing will be as follows:
                (1) The date of personal delivery.
                (2) If mailed, the mailing date stated on the certificate of service, the date shown on the postmark if there is no certificate of service, or other mailing date shown by other evidence if there is no certificate of service or postmark.
                (3) If sent by electronic mail or facsimile transmission, the date of transmission.
                (e) Service of documents filed with the Enforcement Docket. A person must serve a copy of any document filed with the Enforcement Docket on each party and the ALJ or the chief ALJ if no judge has been assigned to the proceeding at the time of filing. Service on a party's attorney of record or a party's designated representative is service on the party.
              
              
                § 1503.431
                Certification of documents.

                (c) Effect of signing a document. By signing a document, the attorney of record, the party, or the party's representative certifies that he or she has read the document and, based on reasonable inquiry and to the best of that person's knowledge, information, and belief, the document is—
                (1) Consistent with the rules in this part;
                (2) Warranted by existing law or that a good faith and nonfrivolous argument exists for extension, modification, or reversal of existing law;

                (4) Supported by evidence, and any denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence.
                (d) Sanctions. On motion of a party, if the ALJ or TSA decision maker finds that any attorney of record, the party, or the party's representative has signed a document in violation of this section, the ALJ or the TSA decision maker, as appropriate, will do the following:
                (1) Strike the pleading signed in violation of this section.
                (2) Strike the request for discovery or the discovery response signed in violation of this section and preclude further discovery by the party.
                (3) Deny the motion or request signed in violation of this section.

                § 1503.613
                Consolidation and separation of cases.
                (a) Consolidation. If two or more actions involve common questions of law or fact, the Chief Administrative Law Judge may do the following:
                (1) Order a joint hearing or trial on any or all such questions.

                (3) Otherwise make such orders concerning the proceedings as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.
                (b) Consolidation shall not affect the applicability of this part. Consolidation of two or more actions that individually meet the jurisdictional amounts set forth in § 1503.601(a)(2) shall not cause the resulting consolidated action to come under the exclusive jurisdiction of the district courts of the United States as specified in 49 U.S.C. 46301(d)(4)(A).
                (c) Separate trials. The Chief Administrative Law Judge, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any claim, or of any separate issue, or any number of claims or issues.
              
              
                § 1503.615

                (a) Notice. The ALJ must give each party at least 60 days notice of the date, time, and location of the hearing. With the consent of the ALJ, the parties may agree to hold the hearing on an earlier date than the date specified in the notice of hearing.
                (b) Date, time, and location of the hearing. The ALJ to whom the proceedings have been assigned must set a reasonable date, time, and location for the hearing. The ALJ must consider the need for discovery and any joint procedural or discovery schedule submitted by the parties when determining the hearing date. The ALJ must give due regard to the convenience of the parties, the location where the majority of the witnesses reside or work, and whether the location is served by a scheduled air carrier.
              
              
                § 1503.617
                Extension of time.
                (a) Oral requests. The parties may agree to extend for a reasonable period the time for filing a document under this subpart. If the parties agree, the ALJ must grant one extension of time to each party. The party seeking the extension of time must submit a draft order to the ALJ to be signed by the ALJ and filed with the Enforcement Docket Clerk. The ALJ may grant additional oral requests for an extension of time where the parties agree to the extension.
                (b) Written motion. A party must file a written motion for an extension of time not later than 7 days before the document is due unless the party shows good cause for the late filing. The ALJ may grant the extension of time if the party shows good cause.
                (c) Request for continuance of hearing. Either party may request in writing a continuance of the date of a hearing, for good cause shown, no later than seven days before the scheduled date of the hearing. Good cause does not include a scheduling conflict involving the parties or their attorneys which by due diligence could have been foreseen.
                (d) Failure to rule. If the ALJ fails to rule on a written motion for an extension of time by the date the document was due, the motion for an extension of time is deemed granted for no more than 20 days after the original date the document was to be filed. If the ALJ fails to rule on a request for continuance by the scheduled hearing date, the request is deemed granted for no more than 10 days after the scheduled hearing date.
              
              
                § 1503.619
                Intervention.
                (a) A person may file a motion for leave to intervene as a party in a civil penalty action. The person must file a motion for leave to intervene not later than 10 days before the hearing unless the person shows good cause for the late filing.
                (b) If the ALJ finds that intervention will not unduly broaden the issues or delay the proceedings, the ALJ may grant a motion for leave to intervene if the person will be bound by any order or decision entered in the action or the person has a property, financial, or other legitimate interest that may not be addressed adequately by the parties. The ALJ may determine the extent to which an intervenor may participate in the proceedings.

                (2) Less than 15 days before the scheduled date of a hearing, the ALJ may allow amendment of a complaint or an answer only for good cause shown in a motion to amend.
                (c) Responses. The ALJ must allow a reasonable time, but not more than 20 days from the date of filing, for other parties to respond if an amendment to a complaint, answer, or other pleading has been filed with the ALJ.

                At any time before or during a hearing, an agency attorney may withdraw a complaint or a respondent may withdraw a request for a hearing without the consent of the ALJ. If an agency attorney withdraws the complaint or a party withdraws the request for a hearing and the answer, the ALJ must dismiss the proceedings under this subpart with prejudice, unless the withdrawing party shows good cause for dismissal without prejudice, except that a party may withdraw a request for hearing without prejudice at any time before a complaint has been filed.
              
              
                § 1503.625
                Waivers.
                Waivers of any rights provided by statute or regulation must be in writing or by stipulation made at a hearing and entered into the record. The parties must set forth the precise terms of the waiver and any conditions.
              
              
                § 1503.627
                Joint procedural or discovery schedule.
                (a) General. The parties may agree to submit a schedule for filing all prehearing motions, a schedule for conducting discovery in the proceedings, or a schedule that will govern all prehearing motions and discovery in the proceedings.
                (b) Form and content of schedule. If the parties agree to a joint procedural or discovery schedule, one of the parties must file the joint schedule with the ALJ, setting forth the dates to which the parties have agreed, and must serve a copy of the joint schedule on each party.
                (1) The joint schedule may include, but need not be limited to, requests for discovery, any objections to discovery requests, responses to discovery requests to which there are no objections, submission of prehearing motions, responses to prehearing motions, exchange of exhibits to be introduced at the hearing, and a list of witnesses that may be called at the hearing.
                (2) Each party must sign the original joint schedule to be filed with the Enforcement Docket Clerk.
                (c) Time. The parties may agree to submit all prehearing motions and responses and may agree to close discovery in the proceedings under the joint schedule within a reasonable time before the date of the hearing, but not later than 15 days before the hearing.
                (d) Order establishing joint schedule. The ALJ must approve the joint schedule filed by the parties. One party must submit a draft order establishing a joint schedule to the ALJ to be signed by the ALJ and filed with the Enforcement Docket Clerk.
                (e) Disputes. The ALJ must resolve disputes regarding discovery or disputes regarding compliance with the joint schedule as soon as possible so that the parties may continue to comply with the joint schedule.
                (f) Sanctions for failure to comply with joint schedule. If a party fails to comply with the ALJ's order establishing a joint schedule, the ALJ may direct that party to comply with a motion or discovery request or, limited to the extent of the party's failure to comply with a motion or discovery request, the ALJ may do the following:
                (1) Strike that portion of a party's pleadings.
                (2) Preclude prehearing or discovery motions by that party.
                (3) Preclude admission of that portion of a party's evidence at the hearing.
                (4) Preclude that portion of the testimony of that party's witnesses at the hearing.
              
              
                § 1503.629
                Motions.
                (a) General. A party applying for an order or ruling not specifically provided in this subpart must do so by motion. A party must comply with the requirements of this section when filing a motion. A party must serve a copy of each motion on each party.
                (b) Form and contents. A party must state the relief sought by the motion and the particular grounds supporting that relief. If a party has evidence in support of a motion, the party must attach any supporting evidence, including affidavits, to the motion.
                (c) Filing of motions. A motion made prior to the hearing must be in writing or orally on the record. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties or for good cause shown, a party must file any prehearing motion, and must serve a copy on each party, not later than 30 days before the hearing. Motions introduced during a hearing may be made orally on the record unless the ALJ directs otherwise.
                (d) Reply to motions. Any party may file a reply, with affidavits or other evidence in support of the reply, not later than 30 days after service of a written motion on that party. When a motion is made during a hearing, the reply may be made at the hearing on the record, orally or in writing, within a reasonable time determined by the ALJ. At the discretion of the ALJ, the moving party may file a response to the reply.
                (e) Rulings on motions. The ALJ must rule on all motions as follows:
                (1) Discovery motions. The ALJ must resolve all pending discovery motions not later than 10 days before the hearing.
                (2) Prehearing motions. The ALJ must resolve all pending prehearing motions not later than 7 days before the hearing. If the ALJ issues a ruling or order orally, the ALJ must serve a written copy of the ruling or order, within 3 days, on each party. In all other cases, the ALJ must issue rulings and orders in writing and must serve a copy of the ruling or order on each party.
                (3) Motions made during the hearing. The ALJ may issue rulings and orders on motions made during the hearing orally. Oral rulings or orders on motions must be made on the record.
                (f) Specific motions. A party may file, but is not limited to, the following motions with the Enforcement Docket Clerk:
                (1) Motion to dismiss for insufficiency. A respondent may file a motion to dismiss the complaint for insufficiency instead of filing an answer. If the ALJ denies the motion to dismiss the complaint for insufficiency, the respondent must file an answer not later than 20 days after service of the ALJ's denial of the motion. A motion to dismiss the complaint for insufficiency must show that the complaint fails to state a violation of a TSA requirement. If the ALJ grants the motion to dismiss the complaint for insufficiency, the agency attorney may amend the complaint in accordance with § 1503.621.
                (2) Motion to dismiss. A party may file a motion to dismiss, specifying the grounds for dismissal. If an ALJ grants a motion to dismiss in part, a party may appeal the ALJ's ruling on the motion to dismiss under § 1503.631(b).
                (i) Motion to dismiss a request for a hearing. An agency attorney may file a motion to dismiss a request for a hearing as untimely instead of filing a complaint. If the motion to dismiss is not granted, the agency attorney must file the complaint and must serve a copy of the complaint on each party not later than 20 days after service of the ALJ's ruling or order on the motion to dismiss. If the motion to dismiss is granted and the proceedings are terminated without a hearing, the respondent may file an appeal pursuant to § 1503.657. If required by the decision on appeal, the agency attorney must file a complaint and must serve a copy of the complaint on each party not later than 30 days after service of the decision on appeal.
                (ii) Motion to dismiss a complaint. A respondent may file a motion to dismiss a complaint instead of filing an answer, on the ground that the complaint was not timely filed or on other grounds. If the ALJ does not grant the motion to dismiss, the respondent must file an answer and must serve a copy of the answer on each party not later than 30 days after service of the ALJ's ruling or order on the motion to dismiss. If the ALJ grants the motion to dismiss and the proceedings are terminated without a hearing, the agency attorney may file an appeal pursuant to § 1503.657. If required by the decision on appeal, the respondent must file an answer and must serve a copy of the answer on each party not later than 20 days after service of the decision on appeal.
                (iii) Motion to dismiss based on settlement. A party may file a motion to dismiss based on a mutual settlement of the parties.
                (3) Motion for more definite statement. A party may file a motion for more definite statement of any pleading that requires a response under this subpart. A party must set forth, in detail, the indefinite or uncertain allegations contained in a complaint or response to any pleading and must submit the details that the party believes would make the allegation or response definite and certain.
                (i) Complaint. A respondent may file a motion requesting a more definite statement of the allegations contained in the complaint instead of filing an answer. If the ALJ grants the motion, the agency attorney must supply a more definite statement not later than 15 days after service of the ruling granting the motion. If the agency attorney fails to supply a more definite statement, the ALJ must strike the allegations in the complaint to which the motion is directed. If the ALJ denies the motion, the respondent must file an answer and must serve a copy of the answer on each party not later than 20 days after service of the order of denial.
                (ii) Answer. An agency attorney may file a motion requesting a more definite statement if an answer fails to respond clearly to the allegations in the complaint. If the ALJ grants the motion, the respondent must supply a more definite statement not later than 15 days after service of the ruling on the motion. If the respondent fails to supply a more definite statement, the ALJ must strike those statements in the answer to which the motion is directed. The respondent's failure to supply a more definite statement may be deemed an admission of unanswered allegations in the complaint.
                (4) Motion to strike. Any party may move to strike any insufficient allegation or defense, or any redundant, immaterial, or irrelevant matter in a pleading. A party must file a motion to strike before a response is required under this subpart or, if a response is not required, not later than 10 days after service of the pleading.
                (5) Motion for decision. A party may move for decision, regarding all or any part of the proceedings, at any time before the ALJ has issued an initial decision in the proceedings. A party may include with a motion for decision affidavits as well as any other evidence in support of the motion. The ALJ must grant a party's motion for decision if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, affidavits, matters that the ALJ has officially noticed, or evidence introduced during the hearing show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the party making the motion is entitled to a decision as a matter of law. The party moving for decision has the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact.
                (6) Motion for disqualification. A party may file the motion at any time after the ALJ has been assigned to the proceedings but must make the motion before the ALJ files an initial decision in the proceedings.
                (i) Motion and supporting affidavit. A party must state the grounds for disqualification, including, but not limited to, personal bias, pecuniary interest, or other factors supporting disqualification, in the motion for disqualification. A party must submit an affidavit with the motion for disqualification that sets forth, in detail, the matters alleged to constitute grounds for disqualification.
                (ii) Answer. A party must respond to the motion for disqualification not later than 5 days after service of the motion for disqualification.
                (iii) Decision on motion for disqualification. The ALJ must render a decision on the motion for disqualification not later than 20 days after the motion has been filed. If the ALJ finds that the motion for disqualification and supporting affidavit show a basis for disqualification, the ALJ must withdraw from the proceedings immediately. If the ALJ finds that disqualification is not warranted, the ALJ must deny the motion and state the grounds for the denial on the record. If the ALJ fails to rule on a party's motion for disqualification within 20 days after the motion has been filed, the motion is deemed granted.
                (iv) Appeal. A party may appeal the ALJ's denial of the motion for disqualification in accordance with § 1503.631(b).
                [74 FR 36039, July 21, 2009, as amended at 75 FR 58333, Sept. 24, 2010]
              
              
                § 1503.631
                Interlocutory appeals.
                (a) General. Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, a party may not appeal a ruling or decision of the ALJ to the TSA decision maker until the initial decision has been entered on the record. A decision or order of the TSA decision maker on the interlocutory appeal does not constitute a final order of the Administrator for the purposes of judicial appellate review under 49 U.S.C. 46110.
                (b) Interlocutory appeal for cause. If a party files a written request for an interlocutory appeal for cause with the ALJ, or orally requests an interlocutory appeal for cause, the proceedings are stayed until the ALJ issues a decision on the request. If the ALJ grants the request, the proceedings are stayed until the TSA decision maker issues a decision on the interlocutory appeal. The ALJ must grant an interlocutory appeal for cause if a party shows that delay of the appeal would be detrimental to the public interest or would result in undue prejudice to any party.
                (c) Interlocutory appeals of right. If a party notifies the ALJ of an interlocutory appeal of right, the proceedings are stayed until the TSA decision maker issues a decision on the interlocutory appeal. A party may file an interlocutory appeal, without the consent of the ALJ, before an initial decision has been entered in the following cases:
                (1) A ruling or order by the ALJ barring a person from the proceedings.
                (2) Failure of the ALJ to dismiss the proceedings in accordance with § 1503.623.
                (3) A ruling or order by the ALJ in violation of § 1503.607(b).
                (4) A ruling or order by the ALJ regarding public access to a particular docket or documents.
                (d) Procedure. Not later than 10 days after the ALJ's decision forming the basis of an interlocutory appeal of right or not later than 10 days after the ALJ's decision granting an interlocutory appeal for cause, a party must file a notice of interlocutory appeal, with supporting documents, and the party must serve a copy of the notice and supporting documents on each party. Not later than 10 days after service of the appeal brief, a party must file a reply brief, if any, and the party must serve a copy of the reply brief on each party. The TSA decision maker must render a decision on the interlocutory appeal, on the record and as a part of the decision in the proceedings, within a reasonable time after receipt of the interlocutory appeal.
                (e) Frivolous appeals. The TSA decision maker may reject frivolous, repetitive, or dilatory appeals, and may issue an order precluding one or more parties from making further interlocutory appeals in a proceeding in which there have been frivolous, repetitive, or dilatory interlocutory appeals.
                [74 FR 36039, July 21, 2009, as amended at 75 FR 58334, Sept. 24, 2010]
              
              
                § 1503.633
                Discovery.
                (a) Initiation of discovery. Any party may initiate discovery described in this section, without the consent or approval of the ALJ, at any time after a complaint has been filed in the proceedings.
                (b) Methods of discovery. The following methods of discovery are permitted under this section: depositions on oral examination or written questions of any person; written interrogatories directed to a party; requests for production of documents or tangible items to any person; and requests for admission by a party. A party is not required to file written discovery requests and responses with the ALJ or the Enforcement Docket Clerk. In the event of a discovery dispute, a party must attach a copy of these documents in support of a motion made under this section.
                (c) Service on the agency. A party must serve each discovery request directed to the agency or any agency employee on the agency attorney of record.
                (d) Time for response to discovery requests. Unless otherwise directed by this subpart, agreed by the parties, or by order of the ALJ, a party must respond to a request for discovery, including filing objections to a request for discovery, not later than 30 days after service of the request.
                (e) Scope of discovery. Subject to the limits on discovery set forth in paragraph (f) of this section, a party may discover any matter that is not privileged and that is relevant to the subject matter of the proceeding. A party may discover information that relates to the claim or defense of any party including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any document or other tangible item and the identity and location of any person having knowledge of discoverable matter. A party may discover facts known, or opinions held, by an expert who any other party expects to call to testify at the hearing. A party may not object to a discovery request on the basis that the information sought would not be admissible at the hearing if the information sought during discovery is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
                (f) Limiting discovery. The ALJ must limit the frequency and extent of discovery permitted by this section if a party shows that—
                (1) The information requested is cumulative or repetitious;
                (2) The information requested can be obtained from another less burdensome and more convenient source;
                (3) The party requesting the information has had ample opportunity to obtain the information through other discovery methods permitted under this section; or
                (4) The method or scope of discovery requested by the party is unduly burdensome or expensive.
                (g) Disclosure of Sensitive Security Information (SSI). At the request of a party, TSA may provide SSI to the party when, in the sole discretion of TSA, access to the SSI is necessary for the party to prepare a response to allegations contained the complaint. TSA may provide such information subject to such restrictions on further disclosure and such safeguarding requirements as TSA determines appropriate.
                (h) Confidential orders. A party or person who has received a discovery request for information, other than SSI, that is related to a trade secret, confidential or sensitive material, competitive or commercial information, proprietary data, or information on research and development, may file a motion for a confidential order with the ALJ and must serve a copy of the motion for a confidential order on each party.
                (1) The party or person making the motion must show that the confidential order is necessary to protect the information from disclosure to the public.
                (2) If the ALJ determines that the requested material is not necessary to decide the case, the ALJ must preclude any inquiry into the matter by any party.
                (3) If the ALJ determines that the requested material may be disclosed during discovery, the ALJ may order that the material may be discovered and disclosed under limited conditions or may be used only under certain terms and conditions.
                (4) If the ALJ determines that the requested material is necessary to decide the case and that a confidential order is warranted, the ALJ must provide the following:
                (i) An opportunity for review of the document by the parties off the record.
                (ii) Procedures for excluding the information from the record.
                (iii) An order that the parties must not disclose the information in any manner and the parties must not use the information in any other proceeding.
                (i) Protective orders. A party or a person who has received a request for discovery may file a motion for protective order and must serve a copy of the motion for protective order on each party. The party or person making the motion must show that the protective order is necessary to protect the party or the person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. As part of the protective order, the ALJ may do the following:
                (1) Deny the discovery request.
                (2) Order that discovery be conducted only on specified terms and conditions, including a designation of the time or place for discovery or a determination of the method of discovery.
                (3) Limit the scope of discovery or preclude any inquiry into certain matters during discovery.
                (j) Duty to supplement or amend responses. A party who has responded to a discovery request has a duty to supplement or amend the response, as soon as the information is known, as follows:

                (1) A party must supplement or amend any response to a question requesting the identity and location of any person having knowledge of discoverable matters.
                
                (2) A party must supplement or amend any response to a question requesting the identity of each person who will be called to testify at the hearing as an expert witness and the subject matter and substance of that witness' testimony.
                (3) A party must supplement or amend any response that was incorrect when made or any response that was correct when made but is no longer correct, accurate, or complete.
                (k) Depositions. The following rules apply to depositions taken pursuant to this section:
                (1) Form. A deposition must be taken on the record and reduced to writing. The person being deposed must sign the deposition unless the parties agree to waive the requirement of a signature.
                (2) Administration of oaths. Within the United States, or a territory or possession subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, a party must take a deposition before a person authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States or authorized by the law of the place where the examination is held. Outside the United States, a party will take a deposition in any manner allowed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C. App.).
                (3) Notice of deposition. A party must serve a notice of deposition, stating the time and place of the deposition and the name and address of each person to be examined, on the person to be deposed, on the ALJ, on the Enforcement Docket Clerk, and on each party not later than 7 days before the deposition. A party may serve a notice of deposition less than 7 days before the deposition only with consent of the ALJ and for good cause shown. If a subpoena “duces tecum” is to be served on the person to be examined, the party must attach a copy of the subpoena duces tecum that describes the materials to be produced at the deposition to the notice of deposition.
                (4) Use of depositions. A party may use any part or all of a deposition at a hearing authorized under this subpart only upon a showing of good cause. The deposition may be used against any party who was present or represented at the deposition or who had reasonable notice of the deposition.
                (l) Interrogatories. A party, the party's attorney, or the party's representative may sign the party's responses to interrogatories. A party must answer each interrogatory separately and completely in writing. If a party objects to an interrogatory, the party must state the objection and the reasons for the objection. An opposing party may use any part or all of a party's responses to interrogatories at a hearing authorized under this subpart to the extent that the response is relevant, material, and not repetitious.
                (1) A party must not serve more than 30 interrogatories to each other party. Each subpart of an interrogatory will be counted as a separate interrogatory.
                (2) Before serving additional interrogatories on a party, a party must file a motion for leave to serve additional interrogatories on a party with the ALJ and must serve a copy on each party before serving additional interrogatories on a party. The ALJ may grant the motion only if the party shows good cause for the party's failure to inquire about the information previously and that the information cannot reasonably be obtained using less burdensome discovery methods or be obtained from other sources.
                (m) Requests for admission. A party may serve a written request for admission of the truth of any matter within the scope of discovery under this section or the authenticity of any document described in the request. A party must set forth each request for admission separately. A party must serve copies of documents referenced in the request for admission unless the documents have been provided or are reasonably available for inspection and copying.
                (1) Time. A party's failure to respond to a request for admission, in writing and signed by the attorney or the party, not later than 30 days after service of the request, is deemed an admission of the truth of the statement or statements contained in the request for admission. The ALJ may determine that a failure to respond to a request for admission is not deemed an admission of the truth if a party shows that the failure was due to circumstances beyond the control of the party or the party's attorney.
                
                (2) Response. A party may object to a request for admission and must state the reasons for objection. A party may specifically deny the truth of the matter or describe the reasons why the party is unable to truthfully deny or admit the matter. If a party is unable to deny or admit the truth of the matter, the party must show that the party has made reasonable inquiry into the matter or that the information known to, or readily obtainable by, the party is insufficient to enable the party to admit or deny the matter. A party may admit or deny any part of the request for admission. If the ALJ determines that a response does not comply with the requirements of this rule or that the response is insufficient, the matter is deemed admitted.
                (3) Effect of admission. Any matter admitted or deemed admitted under this section is conclusively established for the purpose of the hearing and appeal.
                (n) Motion to compel discovery. A party may move to compel discovery if a person refuses to answer a question during a deposition, a party fails or refuses to answer an interrogatory, if a person gives an evasive or incomplete answer during a deposition or when responding to an interrogatory, or a party fails or refuses to produce documents or tangible items. During a deposition, the proponent of a question may complete the deposition or may adjourn the examination before moving to compel if a person refuses to answer.
                (o) Failure to comply with a discovery order or order to compel. If a party fails to comply with a discovery order or an order to compel, the ALJ, limited to the extent of the party's failure to comply with the discovery order or motion to compel, may do the following:
                (1) Strike that portion of a party's pleadings.
                (2) Preclude prehearing or discovery motions by that party.
                (3) Preclude admission of that portion of a party's evidence at the hearing.
                (4) Preclude that portion of the testimony of that party's witnesses at the hearing.
              
              
                § 1503.635
                Evidence.
                (a) General. A party is entitled to present the party's case or defense by oral, documentary, or demonstrative evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct any cross-examination that may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
                (b) Admissibility. A party may introduce any oral, documentary, or demonstrative evidence in support of the party's case or defense. The ALJ must admit any oral, documentary, or demonstrative evidence introduced by a party, but must exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.
                (c) Hearsay evidence. Hearsay evidence is admissible in proceedings governed by this subpart. The fact that evidence submitted by a party is hearsay goes only to the weight of the evidence and does not affect its admissibility.

                The ALJ may issue an initial decision or may rule in a party's favor only if the decision or ruling is supported by a preponderance of the evidence contained in the record. In order to prevail, the party with the burden of proof must prove the party's case or defense by a preponderance of the evidence.
              
              
                § 1503.639

                § 1503.643
                Public disclosure of evidence.
                This section applies to information other than Sensitive Security Information (SSI). All release of SSI is governed by § 1503.415 and 49 CFR part 1520.

                (a) The ALJ may order that any other information contained in the record be withheld from public disclosure. Any person may object to disclosure of information in the record by filing a written motion to withhold specific information with the ALJ and serving a copy of the motion on each party. The party must state the specific grounds for nondisclosure in the motion.
                (b) The ALJ must grant the motion to withhold information in the record if, based on the motion and any response to the motion, the ALJ determines that disclosure would be detrimental to transportation safety, disclosure would not be in the public interest, or that the information is not otherwise required to be made available to the public.
              
              
                § 1503.645

                An employee of the agency may not be called as an expert or opinion witness, for any party other than TSA, in any proceeding governed by this subpart. An employee of a respondent may not be called by an agency attorney as an expert or opinion witness for TSA in any proceeding governed by this subpart to which the respondent is a party.
              
              
                § 1503.647
                Subpoenas.
                (a) Request for subpoena. A party may obtain a subpoena to compel the attendance of a witness at a deposition or hearing, or to require the production of documents or tangible items, from the ALJ who is assigned to the case, or, if no ALJ is assigned or the assigned law judge is unavailable, from the chief ALJ. The party must complete the subpoena, stating the title of the action and the date and time for the witness' attendance or production of documents or items. The party who obtained the subpoena must serve the subpoena on the witness or the custodian of the documents or tangible items sought to be produced.
                (b) Motion to quash or modify the subpoena. A party, or any person upon whom a subpoena has been served, may file a motion to quash or modify the subpoena at or before the time specified in the subpoena for compliance. The applicant must describe, in detail, the basis for the application to quash or modify the subpoena including, but not limited to, a statement that the testimony, document, or tangible evidence is not relevant to the proceeding, that the subpoena is not reasonably tailored to the scope of the proceeding, or that the subpoena is unreasonable and oppressive. A motion to quash or modify the subpoena will stay the effect of the subpoena pending a decision by the ALJ on the motion.
                (c) Enforcement of subpoena. Upon a showing that a person has failed or refused to comply with a subpoena, a party may apply to the U.S. district court having jurisdiction to seek judicial enforcement of the subpoena in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 46104.

                (a) General. Unless otherwise authorized by the ALJ, the party who applies for a subpoena to compel the attendance of a witness at a deposition or hearing, or the party at whose request a witness appears at a deposition or hearing, must pay the witness fees described in this section.
                (b) Amount. Except for an employee of the agency who appears at the direction of the agency, a witness who appears at a deposition or hearing is entitled to the same fees and mileage expenses as are paid to a witness in a court of the United States in comparable circumstances.
              
              
                § 1503.651
                Record.
                (a) Exclusive record. The request for hearing, complaint, answer, transcript of all testimony in the hearing, all exhibits received into evidence, and all motions, responses to motions, applications, requests, and rulings will constitute the exclusive record for decision of the proceedings and the basis for the issuance of any orders in the proceeding.
                (b) Examination and copying of record. (1) Generally. Any person interested in reviewing or obtaining a copy of a record may do so only by submitting a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request under 5 U.S.C. 552, et seq., 49 CFR part 7, and any applicable DHS regulations.

                § 1503.653
                Argument before the ALJ.
                (a) Arguments during the hearing. During the hearing, the ALJ must give the parties a reasonable opportunity to present arguments on the record supporting or opposing motions, objections, and rulings if the parties request an opportunity for argument. The ALJ may request written arguments during the hearing if the ALJ finds that submission of written arguments is necessary before the ALJ issues the ruling or order.
                (b) Final oral argument. At the conclusion of the hearing and before the ALJ issues an initial decision in the proceedings, the parties are entitled to submit oral proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, exceptions to rulings of the ALJ, and supporting arguments for the findings, conclusions, or exceptions. At the conclusion of the hearing, a party may waive final oral argument.
                (c) Posthearing briefs. The ALJ may request written posthearing briefs before the ALJ issues an initial decision in the proceedings. If a party files a written posthearing brief, the party must include proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, exceptions to rulings of the ALJ, and supporting arguments for the findings, conclusions, or exceptions. The ALJ must give the parties a reasonable opportunity, not more than 30 days after receipt of the transcript, to prepare and submit the briefs.
              
              
                § 1503.655
                Initial decision.
                (a) Contents. The ALJ may issue an initial decision after the conclusion of the hearing or after the submission of written posthearing briefs, if so ordered. In each oral or written decision, the ALJ must include findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the grounds supporting those findings and conclusions, upon all material issues of fact, the credibility of witnesses, the applicable law, any exercise of the ALJ's discretion, the amount of any civil penalty found appropriate by the ALJ, and a discussion of the basis for any order issued in the proceedings. The ALJ is not required to provide a written explanation for rulings on objections, procedural motions, and other matters not directly relevant to the substance of the initial decision. If the ALJ refers to any previous unreported or unpublished initial decision, the ALJ must make copies of that initial decision available to all parties and the TSA decision maker.
                (b) Written decision. At the conclusion of the hearing, the ALJ may issue the initial decision and order orally on the record. The ALJ must issue a written initial decision and order not later than 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing or submission of the last posthearing brief. The ALJ must serve a copy of any written initial decision on each party.
                (c) Order assessing civil penalty. Unless appealed pursuant to § 1503.657, the initial decision issued by the ALJ will be considered an order assessing civil penalty if the ALJ finds that an alleged violation occurred and determines that a civil penalty, in an amount found appropriate by the ALJ, is warranted.
                (d) Effect of initial decision. An initial decision of an ALJ is persuasive authority in any other civil penalty action, unless appealed and reversed by the TSA decision maker or a court of competent jurisdiction.
              
              
                § 1503.657
                Appeal from initial decision.
                (a) Notice of appeal. Either party may appeal the initial decision, and any decision not previously appealed pursuant to § 1503.631, by filing a notice of appeal with the Enforcement Docket Clerk. A party must file the notice of appeal with USCG ALJ Docketing Center, ATTN: Enforcement Docket Clerk, 40 S. Gay Street, Room 412, Baltimore, Maryland 21202-4022. A party must file the notice of appeal not later than 10 days after entry of the oral initial decision on the record or service of the written initial decision on the parties and must serve a copy of the notice of appeal on each party. Upon filing of a notice of appeal, the effectiveness of the initial decision is stayed until a final decision and order of the TSA decision maker have been entered on the record.
                (b) Issues on appeal. A party may appeal only the following issues:
                (1) Whether each finding of fact is supported by a preponderance of the evidence.
                (2) Whether each conclusion of law is made in accordance with applicable law, precedent, and public policy.
                (3) Whether the ALJ committed any prejudicial errors during the hearing that support the appeal.
                (c) Perfecting an appeal. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a party must perfect an appeal, not later than 50 days after entry of the oral initial decision on the record or service of the written initial decision on the party, by filing an appeal brief with the Enforcement Docket Clerk.
                (1) Extension of time by agreement of the parties. The parties may agree to extend the time for perfecting the appeal with the consent of the TSA decision maker. If the TSA decision maker grants an extension of time to perfect the appeal, the Enforcement Docket Clerk will serve a letter confirming the extension of time on each party.
                (2) Written motion for extension. If the parties do not agree to an extension of time for perfecting an appeal, a party desiring an extension of time may file a written motion for an extension with the Enforcement Docket Clerk and must serve a copy of the motion on each party. The TSA decision maker may grant an extension if good cause for the extension is shown in the motion.
                (d) Appeal briefs. A party must file the appeal brief with the Enforcement Docket Clerk and must serve a copy of the appeal brief on each party.
                (1) In the appeal brief, a party must set forth, in detail, the party's specific objections to the initial decision or rulings, the basis for the appeal, the reasons supporting the appeal, and the relief requested in the appeal. If, for the appeal, the party relies on evidence contained in the record for the appeal, the party must specifically refer in the appeal brief to the pertinent evidence contained in the transcript.
                (2) The TSA decision maker may dismiss an appeal, on the TSA decision maker's own initiative or upon motion of any other party, where a party has filed a notice of appeal but fails to perfect the appeal by timely filing an appeal brief.
                (e) Reply brief. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, any party may file a reply brief not later than 35 days after the appeal brief has been served on that party. The party filing the reply brief must serve a copy of the reply brief on each party. If the party relies on evidence contained in the record for the reply, the party must specifically refer to the pertinent evidence contained in the transcript in the reply brief.
                (1) Extension of time by agreement of the parties. The parties may agree to extend the time for filing a reply brief with the consent of the TSA decision maker. If the TSA decision maker grants an extension of time to file the reply brief, the Enforcement Docket Clerk will serve a letter confirming the extension of time on each party.
                (2) Written motion for extension. If the parties do not agree to an extension of time for filing a reply brief, a party desiring an extension of time may file a written motion for an extension and will serve a copy of the motion on each party. The TSA decision maker may grant an extension if good cause for the extension is shown in the motion.
                (f) Other briefs. The TSA decision maker may allow any person to submit an amicus curiae brief in an appeal of an initial decision. A party may not file more than one appeal brief or reply brief. A party may petition the TSA decision maker, in writing, for leave to file an additional brief and must serve a copy of the petition on each party. The party may not file the additional brief with the petition. The TSA decision maker may grant leave to file an additional brief if the party demonstrates good cause for allowing additional argument on the appeal. The TSA decision maker will allow a reasonable time for the party to file the additional brief.
                (g) Number of copies. A party must file the original appeal brief or the original reply brief, and two copies of the brief, with the Enforcement Docket Clerk.
                (h) Oral argument. The TSA decision maker has sole discretion to permit oral argument on the appeal. On the TSA decision maker's own initiative or upon written motion by any party, the TSA decision maker may find that oral argument will contribute substantially to the development of the issues on appeal and may grant the parties an opportunity for oral argument.
                (i) Waiver of objections on appeal. If a party fails to object to any alleged error regarding the proceedings in an appeal or a reply brief, the party waives any objection to the alleged error. The TSA decision maker is not required to consider any objection in an appeal brief or any argument in the reply brief if a party's objection is based on evidence contained in the record and the party does not specifically refer to the pertinent evidence from the record in the brief.
                (j) The TSA decision maker's decision on appeal. The TSA decision maker will review the briefs on appeal and the oral argument, if any, to determine if the ALJ committed prejudicial error in the proceedings or that the initial decision should be affirmed, modified, or reversed. The TSA decision maker may affirm, modify, or reverse the initial decision, make any necessary findings, or may remand the case for any proceedings that the TSA decision maker determines may be necessary.
                (1) The TSA decision maker may raise any issue, on the TSA decision maker's own initiative, that is required for proper disposition of the proceedings. The TSA decision maker will give the parties a reasonable opportunity to submit arguments on the new issues before making a decision on appeal. If an issue raised by the TSA decision maker requires the consideration of additional testimony or evidence, the TSA decision maker will remand the case to the ALJ for further proceedings and an initial decision related to that issue. If the TSA decision maker raises an issue that is solely an issue of law, or the issue was addressed at the hearing but was not raised by a party in the briefs on appeal, the TSA decision maker need not remand the case to the ALJ for further proceedings but has the discretion to do so.
                (2) The TSA decision maker will issue the final decision and order of the Administrator on appeal in writing and will serve a copy of the decision and order on each party. Unless a petition for review is filed pursuant to § 1503.659, a final decision and order of the Administrator will be considered an order assessing civil penalty if the TSA decision maker finds that an alleged violation occurred and a civil penalty is warranted.
                (3) A final decision and order of the Administrator after appeal is binding precedent in any other civil penalty action unless appealed and reversed by a court of competent jurisdiction.
                (4) The TSA decision maker will determine whether the decision and order of the TSA decision maker, with the ALJ's initial decision or order attached, may be released to the public, either in whole or in redacted form. In making this determination, the TSA decision maker will consider whether disclosure of any of the information in the decision and order would be detrimental to transportation security, would not be in the public interest, or should not otherwise be required to be made available to the public.
              
              
                § 1503.659
                Petition to reconsider or modify a final decision and order of the TSA decision maker on appeal.
                (a) General. Any party may petition the TSA decision maker to reconsider or modify a final decision and order issued by the TSA decision maker on appeal from an initial decision. A party must file a petition to reconsider or modify not later than 30 days after service of the TSA decision maker's final decision and order on appeal and must serve a copy of the petition on each party. The TSA decision maker will not reconsider or modify an initial decision and order issued by an ALJ that has not been appealed by any party to the TSA decision maker and filed with the Enforcement Docket Clerk.
                
                (b) Form and number of copies. A party must file in writing a petition to reconsider or modify. The party must file the original petition with the Enforcement Docket Clerk and must serve a copy of the petition on each party.
                (c) Contents. A party must state briefly and specifically the alleged errors in the final decision and order on appeal, the relief sought by the party, and the grounds that support the petition to reconsider or modify.
                (1) If the petition is based, in whole or in part, on allegations regarding the consequences of the TSA decision maker's decision, the party must describe and support those allegations.
                (2) If the petition is based, in whole or in part, on new material not previously raised in the proceedings, the party must set forth the new material and include affidavits of prospective witnesses and authenticated documents that would be introduced in support of the new material. The party must explain, in detail, why the new material was not discovered through due diligence prior to the hearing.
                (d) Repetitious and frivolous petitions. The TSA decision maker will not consider repetitious or frivolous petitions. The TSA decision maker may summarily dismiss repetitious or frivolous petitions to reconsider or modify.
                (e) Reply petitions. Any other party may reply to a petition to reconsider or modify, not later than 30 days after service of the petition on that party, by filing a reply with the Enforcement Docket Clerk. A party must serve a copy of the reply on each party.
                (f) Effect of filing petition. Unless otherwise ordered by the TSA decision maker, filing a petition pursuant to this section will stay the effective date of the TSA decision maker's final decision and order on appeal.
                (g) The TSA decision maker's decision on petition. The TSA decision maker has sole discretion to grant or deny a petition to reconsider or modify. The TSA decision maker will grant or deny a petition to reconsider or modify within a reasonable time after receipt of the petition or receipt of the reply petition, if any. The TSA decision maker may affirm, modify, or reverse the final decision and order on appeal, or may remand the case for any proceedings that the TSA decision maker determines may be necessary.

                Applicability of this subpart.
                (a) Jurisdictional minimums. This subpart applies to a civil penalty action under this part in which the total amount in controversy exceeds the following amounts.
                (b) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, in the case of violation of title 49 U.S.C. or 46 U.S.C chapter 701, a regulation prescribed, or order issued under any of those provisions, the amount in controversy exceeds the following:
                (1) $50,000, in the case of violation by an individual or small business concern, as defined in section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).
                (2) $400,000, in the case of violation by any other person.
                (c) Certain aviation related violations. In the case of a violation of 49 U.S. C. chapter 449 (except sections 44902, 44903(d), 44907(a)-(d)(1)(A), 44907(d)(1)(C)-(f), 44908, and 44909), or a regulation prescribed or order issued under any of those provisions, the amount in controversy exceeds the following:

                (1) $50,000, in the case of violation by an individual (except an airman serving as an airman), any person not operating an aircraft for the transportation of passengers or property for compensation, or a small business concern, as defined in section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).
                
                (2) $400,000, in the case of violation by a person operating an aircraft for the transportation of passengers or property for compensation (except an individual serving as an airman).
              
              
                § 1503.703
                Civil penalty letter; referral.
                (a) Issuance. In a civil penalty action in which the amount in controversy exceeds the amounts set forth in § 1503.701, the Administrator will send a civil penalty letter to the person charged with a violation of a TSA requirement.
                (b) Contents. The civil penalty letter will contain a statement of the charges; the applicable law, rule, regulation, or order; the amount of civil penalty that the Administrator will accept in full settlement of the action or an offer to compromise the civil penalty.
                (c) Response. Not later than 30 days after receipt of the civil penalty letter, the person charged with a violation may present to the agency attorney any material or information in answer to the charges, either orally or in writing, that may explain, mitigate, or deny the violation or that may show extenuating circumstances. The Administrator will consider any material or information submitted in accordance with this paragraph (c) to determine whether the person is subject to a civil penalty or to determine the amount for which the Administrator will compromise the action.
                (d) Compromise. If the person charged with a violation offers to compromise the civil penalty action for a specific amount, that person must send payment in a form and manner acceptable to TSA for that amount to the agency, made payable to the Transportation Security Administration, or make payment electronically through http://www.pay.gov. The Chief Counsel or the Deputy Chief Counsel for Civil Enforcement may accept the payment or may refuse and return the payment. If the Administrator accepts the offer to compromise, the agency will send a letter to the person charged with the violation stating that the payment is accepted in full settlement of the civil penalty action and that the matter is closed.
                (e) Referral for prosecution and collection. If the parties cannot agree to compromise the civil penalty action or the offer to compromise is rejected and the payment submitted in compromise is returned, the Administrator may refer the civil penalty action to the United States Attorney General, or the delegate of the Attorney General, to begin proceedings in a United States district court, pursuant to the authority in 49 U.S.C. 114 or 46305 to prosecute and collect the civil penalty.
                (f) The Administrator delegates to the Chief Counsel and the Deputy Chief Counsel for Enforcement the authority to carry out any function of the Administrator described in this § 1503.703.

              § 1507.1
              Scope.

              This part implements provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (the Act) that permit TSA to exempt any system of records within the agency from certain requirements of the Act. The procedures governing access to, and correction of, records in a TSA system of records are set forth in 6 CFR part 5, subpart B.
            
            
              § 1507.3
              Exemptions.
              The following TSA systems of records are exempt from certain provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j), (k), or both, as set forth in this section. During the course of normal agency functions, exempt materials from one system of records may become part of one or more other systems of records. To the extent that any portion of system of records becomes part of another Privacy Act system of records, TSA hereby claims the same exemptions as were claimed in the original primary system of which they are a part and claims any additional exemptions in accordance with this part.
              (a) Transportation Security Enforcement Record System (DHS/TSA 001). The Transportation Security Enforcement Record System (TSERS) (DHS/TSA 001) enables TSA to maintain a system of records related to the screening of passengers and property and they may be used to identify, review, analyze, investigate, and prosecute violations or potential violations of criminal statutes and transportation security laws. Pursuant to exemptions (j)(2), (k)(1), and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, DHS/TSA 001 is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:
              (1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures) because release of the accounting of disclosures could alert the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal, civil, or regulatory violation to the existence of the investigation and reveal investigative interest on the part of TSA, as well as the recipient agency. Disclosure of the accounting would therefore present a serious impediment to transportation security, law enforcement efforts, and efforts to preserve national security. Disclosure of the accounting would also permit the individual who is the subject of a record to impede the investigation and avoid detection or apprehension, which undermines the entire system.
              (2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records) because access to the records contained in this system of records could inform the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal, civil, or regulatory violation to the existence of the investigation and reveal investigative interest on the part of TSA, as well as the recipient agency. Access to the records would permit the individual who is the subject of a record to impede the investigation and avoid detection or apprehension. Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing investigations and law enforcement activities, and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations to be continuously reinvestigated. The information contained in the system may also include properly classified information, the release of which would pose a threat to national defense and/or foreign policy. In addition, permitting access and amendment to such information also could disclose sensitive security information, which could be detrimental to transportation security.
              (3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information) because in the course of investigations into potential violations of transportation security laws, the accuracy of information obtained or introduced occasionally may be unclear or the information may not be strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In the interests of effective enforcement of transportation security laws, it is appropriate to retain all information that may aid in establishing patterns of unlawful activity.
              (4) From subsection (e)(3) (Privacy Act Statement) because disclosing the authority, purpose, routine uses, and potential consequences of not providing information could reveal the investigative interests of TSA, as well as the nature and scope of an investigation, the disclosure of which could enable individuals to circumvent agency regulations or statutes.

              (5) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because this system is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d).
              
              (b) Transportation Workers Employment Investigations System (DHS/TSA 002). The Transportation Workers Employment Investigations System (TWEI) (DHS/TSA 002) enables TSA to facilitate the performance of background checks on employees of transportation operators and others who are issued credentials or clearances by transportation operators, other than TSA employees. Pursuant to exemptions (k)(1) and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, DHS/TSA 002 is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), and (f). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:
              (1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures), because release of the accounting of disclosures could reveal investigative interest on the part of the recipient agency that obtained the record pursuant to a routine use. Disclosure of the accounting could therefore present a serious impediment to law enforcement efforts on the part of the recipient agency, as the individual who is the subject of a record would learn of third-agency investigate interests and thereby avoid detection or apprehension.
              (2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records), because access to the records contained in this system could reveal investigate techniques and procedures in the transportation workers employment investigation process, as well as the nature and scope of the employment investigation, the disclosure of which could enable individuals to circumvent agency regulations or statutes and obtain access to sensitive information and restricted areas in the transportation industry. The information contained in the system might include properly classified information, the release of which would pose a threat to national defense and/or foreign policy. In addition, permitting access and amendment to such information could reveal sensitive security information protected pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 114(s), the disclosure of which could be detrimental to the security of transportation.
              (3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information), because third-agency records obtained or made available to TSA during the course of an employment investigation may occasionally contain information that is not strictly relevant or necessary to a specific employment investigation. In the interests of administering an effective and comprehensive transportation worker employment investigation program, it is appropriate and necessary for TSA to retain all such information that may aid in that process.
              (4) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because this system is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d).
              (c) Personnel Background Investigation File System (DHS/TSA 004). The Personnel Background Investigation File System (PBIFS) (DHS/TSA 004) enables TSA to maintain investigative and background material used to make suitability and eligibility determinations regarding current and former TSA employees, applicants for TSA employment, and TSA contract employees. Pursuant to exemptions (k)(1) and (k)(5) of the Privacy Act, the Personnel Background Investigation File System is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) (Accounting of Disclosures) and (d) (Access to Records). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified because this system contains investigatory material compiled solely for determining suitability, eligibility, and qualifications for Federal civilian employment. To the extent that the disclosure of material would reveal any classified material or the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, the applicability of exemption (k)(5) will be required to honor promises of confidentiality should the data subject request access to or amendment of the record, or access to the accounting of disclosures of the record. Exemption (k)(1) will be required to protect any classified information that may be in this system.
              (d) Internal Investigation Record System (DHS/TSA 005). The Internal Investigation Record System (IIRS) (DHS/TSA 005) contains records of internal investigations for all modes of transportation for which TSA has security-related duties. This system covers information regarding investigations of allegations or appearances of misconduct of current or former TSA employees or contractors and provides support for any adverse action that may occur as a result of the findings of the investigation. It is being modified to cover investigations of security-related incidents and reviews of TSA programs and operations. Pursuant to exemptions (j)(2), (k)(1), and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, DHS/TSA 005 is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:
              (1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures) because release of the accounting of disclosures could reveal investigative interest on the part of the recipient agency that obtained the record pursuant to a routine use. Disclosure of the accounting could, therefore, present a serious impediment to law enforcement efforts on the part of the recipient agency, as the individual who is the subject of a record would learn of third-agency investigative interests and thereby avoid detection or apprehension, as well as to TSA investigative efforts.
              (2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records) because access to the records contained in this system could reveal investigative techniques and procedures of the investigators, as well as the nature and scope of the investigation, the disclosure of which could enable individuals to circumvent agency regulations or statutes. The information contained in the system might include properly classified information, the release of which would pose a threat to national defense and/or foreign policy. In addition, permitting access and amendment to such records could reveal sensitive security information protected pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 114(s), the disclosure of which could be detrimental to the security of transportation.
              (3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information) because third agency records obtained or made available to TSA during the course of an investigation may occasionally contain information that is not strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In the interests of administering an effective and comprehensive investigation program, it is appropriate and necessary for TSA to retain all such information that may aid in that process.
              (4) From subsection (e)(3) (Privacy Act Statement) because disclosing the authority, purpose, routine uses, and potential consequences of not providing information could reveal the targets of interests of the investigating office, as well as the nature and scope of an investigation, the disclosure of which could enable individuals to circumvent agency regulations or statutes.
              (5) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because this system is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d).
              (e) Correspondence and Matters Tracking Records (DHS/TSA 006). The Correspondence and Matters Tracking Records (CMTR) (DHS/TSA 006) system allows TSA to manage, track, retrieve, and respond to incoming correspondence, inquiries, claims and other matters presented to TSA for disposition, and to monitor the assignment, disposition and status of such matters. This system covers information coming into TSA from individuals as well as information recorded by TSA employees in the performance of their duties. Pursuant to exemptions (k)(1) and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, DHS/TSA 006 is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), and (f). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:

              (1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures), because release of the accounting of disclosures could reveal investigative interest on the part of the recipient agency that obtained the record pursuant to a routine use. Disclosure of the accounting could therefore present a serious impediment to law enforcement efforts on the part of the recipient agency, as the individual who is the subject of a record would lean of third-agency investigative interests and thereby avoid detection or apprehension.
              (2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records), because access to the records contained in this system could reveal investigative interest on the part of TSA or other agency and the nature of that interest, the disclosure of which could enable individuals to circumvent agency regulations or statutes. The information contained in the system might include properly classified information, the release of which would pose a threat to national defense and/or foreign policy. In addition, permitting access and amendment to such information could reveal sensitive security information protected pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 114(s), the disclosure of which could be detrimental to transportation security.
              (3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and necessity of Information), because third-agency records obtained or made available to TSA during the course of an investigation may occasionally contain information that is not strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In the interests of administering an effective and comprehensive investigation program, it is appropriate and necessary for TSA to retain all such information that may aid in that process.
              (4) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency rules), because this system is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d).
              (f) Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Records (DHS/TSA 007). The Freedom of Information and Privacy Act (FOIA/PA) Records System (DHS/TSA 007) system enables TSA to maintain records that will assist in processing access requests and administrative appeals under FOIA and access and amendments requests and appeals under the PA; participate in associated litigation; and assist TSA in carrying out any other responsibilities under FOIA/PA. Pursuant to exemptions (k)(1) and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), and (f). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:
              (1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures), because release of the accounting of disclosures could reveal investigative interest on the part of the recipient agency that obtained the record pursuant to a routine use. Disclosure of the accounting could therefore present a serious impediment to law enforcement efforts on the part of the recipient agency, as the individual who is the subject of a record would learn of third-agency investigative interests and thereby avoid detection or apprehension.
              (2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records), because access to the records contained in this system could reveal investigative interest on the part of TSA or other agency and the nature of that interest, the disclosure of which could enable individuals to circumvent agency regulations or statutes. The information contained in the system might include properly classified information, the release of which would pose a threat to national defense and/or foreign policy. In addition, permitting access and amendment to such information could reveal sensitive security information protected pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 114(s), the disclosure of which would be detrimental to transportation security.
              (3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and necessity of Information), because third-agency records obtained or made available to TSA during the course of an investigation may occasionally contain information that is not strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In the interests of administering an effective and comprehensive investigation program, it is appropriate and necessary for TSA to retain all such information that may aid in that process.
              (4) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because this system is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d).
              (g) General Legal Records System (DHS/TSA 009). The General Legal Records (GLR) System (DHS/TSA 009) enables TSA to maintain records that will assist attorneys to perform their functions within the office of Chief Counsel, to include providing legal advice, responding to claims filed by employees and others, and assisting in litigation and in the settlement of claims. Pursuant to exemptions (k)(1) and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, DHS/TSA 009 is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), and (f). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:
              (1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures), because release of the accounting of disclosures could reveal investigative interest on the part of the recipient agency that obtained the record pursuant to a routine use. Disclosure of the accounting could therefore present a serious impediment to law enforcement efforts on the part of the recipient agency, as the individual who is the subject of a record would learn of third-agency investigative interests and thereby avoid detection or apprehension.
              (2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records), because access to the records contained in this system could reveal investigative interest on the part of TSA or other agency and the nature of that interest, the disclosure of which would enable individuals to circumvent agency regulations or statutes. The information contained in the system might include properly classified information, the release of which would pose a threat to national defense and/or foreign policy. In addition, permitting access and amendment to such information could reveal sensitive security information protected pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 114(s), the disclosure of which could be detrimental to transportation security.
              (3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information), because third-agency records obtained or made available to TSA during the course of an investigation may occasionally contain information that is not strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In the interests of administering an effective and comprehensive investigation program, it is appropriate and necessary for TSA to retain all such information that may aid in that process.
              (4) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because this system is exempt from the access provisions of subsections (d).
              (h) Federal Flight Deck Officer Records System (DHS/TSA 013). The Federal Flight Deck Officer Record System (FFDORS) (DHS/TSA 013) enables TSA to maintain a system of records documenting the application, selection, training, and requalification of pilots deputized by TSA to perform the duties of a Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO). Pursuant to exemptions (k)(1), (k)(2), and (k)(6) of the Privacy Act, DHS/TSA 013 is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), and (e)(1). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:

              (1) From (c)(3) (Accounting of Certain Disclosures) and (d) (Access to Records), because access to the accounting of disclosures in this system could reveal the identity of a confidential source that provided information during the background check process. Without the ability to protect the identity of a confidential source, the agency's ability to gather pertinent information about candidates for the program may be limited. In addition, the system might contain information that is properly classified, the release of which would pose a threat to national security and/or foreign policy, or information the disclosure of which could be detrimental to the security of transportation pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 114(s). Finally, the agency must be able to protect against access to testing or examination material as release of this material could compromise the effectiveness of the testing and examination procedure itself. The examination material contained in this system is so similar in form and content to the examination material used in the selection process for TSA security screeners, or potential selection processes that TSA may utilize in the future, that release of the material would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process of those TSA employees.
              
              (2) From (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information), because information obtained or made available to TSA from other agencies and other sources during the evaluation of an individual's suitability for an FFDO position may occasionally include information that is not strictly relevant or necessary to the specific determination regarding that individual. In the interests of effective program administration, it is appropriate and necessary for TSA to collect all such information that may aid in the FFDO selection process.
              (i) Registered Traveler Operations Files (DHS/TSA 015). The purpose of this system is to pre-screen and positively identify volunteer travelers using advanced identification technologies and conduct a security threat assessment to ensure that the volunteer does not pose a security threat. This system may expedite the pre-boarding process for the traveler and improve the allocation of TSA's security resources on individuals who may pose a security threat. Pursuant to exemptions (k)(1) and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, DHS/TSA 015 is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), and (f). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:
              (1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures) because release of the accounting of disclosures could alert the subject of heightened security concerns relating to an actual or potential criminal, civil, or regulatory violation to the existence of an investigative interest on the part of the Department of Homeland Security or another Federal law enforcement or other recipient agency. Disclosure of the accounting would therefore present a serious impediment to transportation security law enforcement efforts and efforts to preserve national security. Disclosure of the accounting would also permit the individual who is the subject of a record to impede the program suitability determination, which undermines the entire system.
              (2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records) because access to some of the records contained in this system of records could permit the individual who is the subject of a record to impede the program suitability determination. Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing security assessment investigations and program suitability determinations and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring such investigations to be continuously reinvestigated. The information contained in the system may also include classified information, the release of which would pose a threat to national defense and/or foreign policy. In addition, permitting access and amendment to such information also could disclose sensitive security information protected pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 114(s) and 49 CFR part 1520, the disclosure of which could be detrimental to transportation security.
              (3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information) because in the course of screening applicants for program suitability, TSA must be able to review information from a variety of sources. What information is relevant and necessary may not always be apparent until after the evaluation is completed. In the interests of transportation security, it is appropriate to include a broad range of information that may aid in determining an applicant's suitability for the Registered Traveler program.
              (4) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because this system is exempt from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d).
              (j) Transportation Security Intelligence Service (TSIS) Operations Files. Transportation Security Intelligence Service Operations Files (TSIS) (DHS/TSA 011) enables TSA to maintain a system of records related to intelligence gathering activities used to identify, review, analyze, investigate, and prevent violations or potential violations of transportation security laws. This system also contains records relating to determinations about individuals' qualifications, eligibility, or suitability for access to classified information. Pursuant to exemptions (j)(2), (k)(1), (k)(2), and (k)(5) of the Privacy Act, DHS/TSA 011 is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f). Exemptions from particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:
              
              (1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures) because release of the accounting of disclosures could alert the subject of intelligence gather operations and reveal investigative interest on the part of the Transportation Security Administration, as well as the recipient agency. Disclosure of the accounting would therefore present a serious impediment to transportation security law enforcement efforts and efforts to preserve national security. Disclosure of the accounting would also permit the individual who is the subject of a record to impede operations and avoid detection and apprehension, which undermined the entire system. Disclosure of the accounting may also reveal the existence of information that is classified or sensitive security information, the release of which would be detrimental to the security of transportation.
              (2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records) because access to the records contained in this system of records could inform the subject of intelligence gathering operations and reveal investigative interest on the part of the Transportation Security Administration. Access to the records would permit the individual who is the subject of a record to impede operations and possibly avoid detection or apprehension. Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing intelligence and law enforcement activities and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations to be continually reinvestigated. The information contained in the system may also include properly classified information, the release of which would pose a threat to national defense and/or foreign policy. In addition, permitting access and amendment to such information also could disclose sensitive security information, which could be detrimental to transportation security if released. This system may also include information necessary to make a determination as to an individual's qualifications, eligibility, or suitability for access to classified information, the release of which would reveal the identity of a source who received an express or implied assurance that their identity would not be revealed to the subject of the record.
              (3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information) because in the course of gathering and analyzing information about potential threats to transportation security, the accuracy of information obtained or introduced occasionally may be unclear or the information may not be strictly relevant or necessary to a specific operation. In the interests of transportation security, it is appropriate to retain all information that may aid in identifying threats to transportation security and establishing other patterns of unlawful activity.
              (4) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because this system is exempt from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d).
              (k) Secure Flight Records. (1) Secure Flight Records (DHS/TSA 019) enables TSA to maintain a system of records related to watch list matching applied to air passengers and to non-traveling individuals authorized to enter an airport sterile area. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and (k)(2), TSA is claiming the following exemptions for certain records within the Secure Flight Records system: 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (4); (d)(1), (2), (3), and (4); (e)(1), (2), (3), (4)(G) through (I), (5), and (8); (f), and (g).
              (2) In addition to records under the control of TSA, the Secure Flight system of records may include records originating from systems of records of other law enforcement and intelligence agencies which may be exempt from certain provisions of the Privacy Act. However, TSA does not assert exemption to any provisions of the Privacy Act with respect to information submitted by or on behalf of individual passengers or non-travelers in the course of making a reservation or seeking access to a secured area under the Secure Flight program.

              (3) To the extent the Secure Flight system contains records originating from other systems of records, TSA will rely on the exemptions claimed for those records in the originating system of records. Exemptions for certain records within the Secure Flight Records system from particular subsections of the Privacy Act are justified for the following reasons:
              
              (i) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures) because giving a record subject access to the accounting of disclosures from records concerning him or her could reveal investigative interest on the part of the recipient agency that obtained the record pursuant to a routine use. Disclosure of the accounting could therefore present a serious impediment to law enforcement efforts on the part of the recipient agency because the individual who is the subject of the record would learn of third agency investigative interests and could take steps to evade detection or apprehension. Disclosure of the accounting also could reveal the details of watch list matching measures under the Secure Flight program, as well as capabilities and vulnerabilities of the watch list matching process, the release of which could permit an individual to evade future detection and thereby impede efforts to ensure transportation security.
              (ii) From subsection (c)(4) because portions of this system are exempt from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d).
              (iii) From subsections (d)(1), (2), (3), and (4) because these provisions concern individual access to and amendment of certain records contained in this system, including law enforcement counterterrorism, investigatory and intelligence records. Compliance with these provisions could alert the subject of an investigation of the fact and nature of the investigation, and/or the investigative interest of intelligence or law enforcement agencies; compromise sensitive information related to national security; interfere with the overall law enforcement process by leading to the destruction of evidence, improper influencing of witnesses, fabrication of testimony, and/or flight of the subject; identify a confidential source or disclose information which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of another's personal privacy; reveal a sensitive investigative or intelligence technique; or constitute a potential danger to the health or safety of law enforcement personnel, confidential informants, and witnesses. Amendment of these records would interfere with ongoing counterterrorism, law enforcement, or intelligence investigations and analysis activities and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations, analyses, and reports to be continuously reinvestigated and revised.
              (iv) From subsection (e)(1) because it is not always possible for TSA or other agencies to know in advance what information is both relevant and necessary for it to complete an identity comparison between aviation passengers or certain non-travelers and a known or suspected terrorist. In addition, because TSA and other agencies may not always know what information about an encounter with a known or suspected terrorist will be relevant to law enforcement for the purpose of conducting an operational response.
              (v) From subsection (e)(2) because application of this provision could present a serious impediment to counterterrorism, law enforcement, or intelligence efforts in that it would put the subject of an investigation, study or analysis on notice of that fact, thereby permitting the subject to engage in conduct designed to frustrate or impede that activity. The nature of counterterrorism, law enforcement, or intelligence investigations is such that vital information about an individual frequently can be obtained only from other persons who are familiar with such individual and his/her activities. In such investigations, it is not feasible to rely upon information furnished by the individual concerning his own activities.
              (vi) From subsection (e)(3), to the extent that this subsection is interpreted to require TSA to provide notice to an individual if TSA or another agency receives or collects information about that individual during an investigation or from a third party. Should the subsection be so interpreted, exemption from this provision is necessary to avoid impeding counterterrorism, law enforcement, or intelligence efforts by putting the subject of an investigation, study or analysis on notice of that fact, thereby permitting the subject to engage in conduct intended to frustrate or impede that activity.

              (vii) From subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H) (Agency Requirements) and (f) (Agency Rules), because this system is exempt from the access provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d).
              (viii) From subsection (e)(5) because many of the records in this system coming from other system of records are derived from other domestic and foreign agency record systems and therefore it is not possible for TSA to ensure their compliance with this provision, however, TSA has implemented internal quality assurance procedures to ensure that data used in the watch list matching process is as thorough, accurate, and current as possible. In addition, in the collection of information for law enforcement, counterterrorism, and intelligence purposes, it is impossible to determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. With the passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to light. The restrictions imposed by (e)(5) would limit the ability of those agencies' trained investigators and intelligence analysts to exercise their judgment in conducting investigations and impede the development of intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts. However, TSA has implemented internal quality assurance procedures to ensure that the data used in the watch list matching process is as thorough, accurate, and current as possible.
              (ix) From subsection (e)(8) because to require individual notice of disclosure of information due to compulsory legal process would pose an impossible administrative burden on TSA and other agencies and could alert the subjects of counterterrorism, law enforcement, or intelligence investigations to the fact of those investigations when not previously known.
              (x) From subsection (f) (Agency Rules) because portions of this system are exempt from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d).
              (xi) From subsection (g) to the extent that the system is exempt from other specific subsections of the Privacy Act.

              Appendix A to Part 1511—Aviation Security Infrastructure Fee
              Instructions
              General guidance
              When filling out this form, the responding air carrier or foreign air carrier shall include all costs incurred in calendar year 2000 by that air carrier for the screening of passengers and property. Costs are those attributed to the screening of passengers and property in the United States for both flights within the United States and flights from the United States to foreign destinations. Reported costs must be consistent with the air carrier's financial accounting information reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
              Where actual costs of screening passengers and property cannot be directly identified through an air carrier's accounting system, the air carrier shall use an appropriate alternate cost assignment methodology. Documentation that explains and supports the assignment methodology used, the applicable pool and the allocation basis must be made available upon request. For costs related to capitalized property, please report the associated depreciation expense incurred during calendar year 2000. Capitalization policy must also be made available upon request.
              To the extent necessary, the reporting air carrier may aggregate those specific costs that have been incurred but cannot be stated in the detailed cost categories requested by this form. However, all of the costs identified by this form must be included in the total calculations. In addition, explanations regarding costs that have been aggregated need to be provided. Costs reported in Appendix A do not need to include costs that may have been incurred for a position higher than those of the air carrier's director of security (or equivalent). Costs incurred for higher positions, such as those of the air carrier's chief executive officer, do not need to be included.
              When including cost information on acquired and/or merged air carriers, the successor air carrier must specify the names of all of such entities whose calendar year 2000 passenger and property screening costs are included in that air carrier's submission as Appendix A.
              The costs listed below are to be in US dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar. Place a zero in the appropriate box to indicate cost categories in which the air carrier did not incur costs for passenger and property screening in calendar year 2000.
              Supporting Notes
              Examples of cost types that appear in the supporting notes below are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to set forth all relevant costs that must be reported by air carriers and foreign air carriers. In submitting information to TSA, air carriers and foreign air carriers must submit all of their relevant costs, regardless of whether those costs have been specifically illustrated in the notes.
              Submission of Data

              This form will be available electronically from the Department of Transportation's website at www.dot.gov.

              Appeal of Initial Determination of Threat Assessment based on criminal conviction, immigration status, or mental capacity.
              (a) Scope. This section applies to applicants appealing from an Initial Determination of Threat Assessment that was based on one or more of the following:
              (1) TSA has determined that an applicant for an HME or a TWIC has a disqualifying criminal offense described in 49 CFR 1572.103.
              (2) TSA has determined that an applicant for an HME or a TWIC does not meet the immigration status requirements as described in 49 CFR 1572.105.
              (3) TSA has determined that an applicant for an HME or a TWIC is lacking mental capacity as described in 49 CFR 1572.109.
              (b) Grounds for appeal. An applicant may appeal an Initial Determination of Threat Assessment if the applicant is asserting that he or she meets the standards for the security threat assessment for which he or she is applying.
              (1) Initiating an appeal. An applicant initiates an appeal by submitting a written reply to TSA, a written request for materials from TSA, or by requesting an extension of time in accordance with § 1515.5(f). If the applicant does not initiate an appeal within 60 days of receipt, the Initial Determination of Threat Assessment becomes a Final Determination of Threat Assessment.
              (i) In the case of an HME, TSA also serves a Final Determination of Threat Assessment on the licensing State.
              (ii) In the case of a mariner applying for TWIC, TSA also serves a Final Determination of Threat Assessment on the Coast Guard.
              (iii) In the case of a TWIC, TSA serves a Final Determination of Threat Assessment on the appropriate Federal Maritime Security Coordinator (FMSC).
              (2) Request for materials. Within 60 days of the date of service of the Initial Determination of Threat Assessment, the applicant may serve upon TSA a written request for copies of the materials upon which the Initial Determination was based.
              (3) TSA response. (i) Within 60 days of receiving the applicant's request for materials, TSA serves the applicant with copies of the releasable materials upon the applicant on which the Initial Determination was based. TSA will not include any classified information or other protected information described in paragraph (f) of this section.
              (ii) Within 60 days of receiving the applicant's request for materials or written reply, TSA may request additional information or documents from the applicant that TSA believes are necessary to make a Final Determination.
              (4) Correction of records. If the Initial Determination of Threat Assessment was based on a record that the applicant believes is erroneous, the applicant may correct the record, as follows:
              (i) The applicant contacts the jurisdiction or entity responsible for the information and attempts to correct or complete information contained in his or her record.
              (ii) The applicant provides TSA with the revised record, or a certified true copy of the information from the appropriate entity, before TSA determines that the applicant meets the standards for the security threat assessment.
              (5) Reply. (i) The applicant may serve upon TSA a written reply to the Initial Determination of Threat Assessment within 60 days of service of the Initial Determination, or 60 days after the date of service of TSA's response to the applicant's request for materials under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if the applicant served such request. The reply must include the rationale and information on which the applicant disputes TSA's Initial Determination.
              (ii) In an applicant's reply, TSA will consider only material that is relevant to whether the applicant meets the standards applicable for the security threat assessment for which the applicant is applying.
              (6) Final determination. Within 60 days after TSA receives the applicant's reply, TSA serves a Final Determination of Threat Assessment or a Withdrawal of the Initial Determination as provided in paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section.
              (c) Final Determination of Threat Assessment. (1) If the Assistant Administrator concludes that an HME or TWIC applicant does not meet the standards described in 49 CFR 1572.103, 1572.105, or 1572.109, TSA serves a Final Determination of Threat Assessment upon the applicant. In addition—
              (i) In the case of an HME, TSA serves a Final Determination of Threat Assessment on the licensing State.
              (ii) In the case of a TWIC, TSA serves a Final Determination of Threat Assessment on the Coast Guard.

              (2) The Final Determination includes a statement that the Assistant Administrator has reviewed the Initial Determination, the applicant's reply and any accompanying information, and any other materials or information available to him or her, and has determined that the applicant poses a security threat warranting denial of the security threat assessment for which the applicant has applied.
              
              (d) Withdrawal of Initial Determination. If the Assistant Administrator or Assistant Secretary concludes that the applicant does not pose a security threat, TSA serves a Withdrawal of the Initial Determination upon the applicant, and the applicant's employer where applicable.
              (e) Nondisclosure of certain information. In connection with the procedures under this section, TSA does not disclose classified information to the applicant, as defined in E.O. 12968 sec. 1.1(d), and reserves the right not to disclose any other information or material not warranting disclosure or protected from disclosure under law.
              (f) Extension of time. TSA may grant an applicant an extension of time of the limits for good cause shown. An applicant's request for an extension of time must be in writing and be received by TSA within a reasonable time before the due date to be extended; or an applicant may request an extension after the expiration of a due date by sending a written request describing why the failure to file within the time limits was excusable. TSA may grant itself an extension of time for good cause.
              (g) Judicial review. For purposes of judicial review, the Final Determination of Threat Assessment constitutes a final TSA order of the determination that the applicant does not meet the standards for a security threat assessment, in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 46110. The Final Determination is not a final TSA order to grant or deny a waiver, the procedures for which are in 49 CFR 1515.7 and 1515.11.
              (h) Appeal of immediate revocation. If TSA directs an immediate revocation, the applicant may appeal this determination by following the appeal procedures described in paragraph (b) of this section. This applies—
              (1) If TSA directs a State to revoke an HME pursuant to 49 CFR 1572.13(a).
              (2) If TSA invalidates a TWIC by issuing an Initial Determination of Threat Assessment and Immediate Revocation pursuant to 49 CFR 1572.21(d)(3).

              (i) An applicant for an HME or TWIC who has a disqualifying criminal offense described in 49 CFR 1572.103(a)(5) through (a)(12) or 1572.103(b) and who requests a waiver.
              (ii) An applicant for an HME or TWIC who is an alien under temporary protected status as described in 49 CFR 1572.105 and who requests a waiver.
              (iii) An applicant applying for an HME or TWIC who lacks mental capacity as described in 49 CFR 1572.109 and who requests a waiver.
              (b) Grounds for waiver. TSA may issue a waiver of the standards described in paragraph (a) and grant an HME or TWIC if TSA determines that an applicant does not pose a security threat based on a review of information described in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (c) Initiating waiver. (1) An applicant initiates a waiver as follows:
              (i) Providing to TSA the information required in 49 CFR 1572.9 for an HME or 49 CFR 1572.17 for a TWIC.
              (ii) Paying the fees required in 49 CFR 1572.405 for an HME or in 49 CFR 1572.501 for a TWIC.
              (iii) Sending a written request to TSA for a waiver at any time, but not later than 60 days after the date of service of the Final Determination of Threat Assessment. The applicant may request a waiver during the application process, or may first pursue some or all of the appeal procedures in 49 CFR 1515.5 to assert that he or she does not have a disqualifying condition.
              (2) In determining whether to grant a waiver, TSA will consider the following factors, as applicable to the disqualifying condition:
              (i) The circumstances of the disqualifying act or offense.
              (ii) Restitution made by the applicant.
              (iii) Any Federal or State mitigation remedies.
              (iv) Court records or official medical release documents indicating that the applicant no longer lacks mental capacity.

              (v) Other factors that indicate the applicant does not pose a security threat warranting denial of the HME or TWIC.
              (d) Grant or denial of waivers. (1) The Assistant Administrator will send a written decision granting or denying the waiver to the applicant within 60 days of service of the applicant's request for a waiver, or longer period as TSA may determine for good cause.
              (2) In the case of an HME, if the Assistant Administrator grants the waiver, the Assistant Administrator will send a Determination of No Security Threat to the licensing State within 60 days of service of the applicant's request for a waiver, or longer period as TSA may determine for good cause.
              (3) In the case of a mariner applying for a TWIC, if the Assistant Administrator grants the waiver, the Assistant Administrator will send a Determination of No Security Threat to the Coast Guard within 60 days of service of the applicant's request for a waiver, or longer period as TSA may determine for good cause.
              (4) If the Assistant Administrator denies the waiver the applicant may seek review in accordance with 49 CFR 1515.11. A denial of a waiver under this section does not constitute a final order of TSA as provided in 49 U.S.C. 46110.
              (e) Extension of time. TSA may grant an applicant an extension of the time limits for good cause shown. An applicant's request for an extension of time must be in writing and be received by TSA within a reasonable time before the due date to be extended; or an applicant may request an extension after the expiration of a due date by sending a written request describing why the failure to file within the time limits was excusable. TSA may grant itself an extension of time for good cause.
            
            
              § 1515.9
              Appeal of security threat assessment based on other analyses.
              (a) Scope. This section applies to an applicant appealing an Initial Determination of Threat Assessment as follows:

              (c) Final Determination of Threat Assessment. (1) If the Assistant Administrator concludes that the applicant poses a security threat, following an appeal, TSA serves a Final Determination of Threat Assessment upon the applicant. In addition—

              (e) Further review. If the Assistant Administrator denies the appeal, the applicant may seek review in accordance with § 1515.11 of this part. A Final Determination issued under this section does not constitute a final order of TSA as provided in 49 U.S.C. 46110.
              (f) Appeal of immediate revocation. If TSA directs an immediate revocation, the applicant may appeal this determination by following the appeal procedures described in paragraph (b) of this section. This applies—

No later than 30 calendar days from the date of service of the decision by TSA denying a waiver or of the Final Determination of Threat Assessment, the applicant may request a review. The review will be conducted by an administrative law judge who possesses the appropriate security clearance necessary to review classified or otherwise protected information and evidence. If the applicant fails to seek review within 30 calendar days, the Final Determination of Threat Assessment will be final with respect to the parties.
              (1) The request for review must clearly state the issue(s) to be considered by the administrative law judge (ALJ), and include the following documents in support of the request:
              (i) In the case of a review of a denial of waiver, a copy of the applicant's request for a waiver under 49 CFR 1515.7, including all materials provided by the applicant to TSA in support of the waiver request; and a copy of the decision issued by TSA denying the waiver request.

              (3) The applicant must file the request for review with the ALJ Docketing Center, U.S. Coast Guard, 40 S. Gay Street, Room 412, Baltimore, Maryland 21202-4022, ATTN: Hearing Docket Clerk.
              
              (c) Extension of Time. The ALJ may grant an extension of the time limits described in this section for good cause shown.

              (1) Receive information and evidence presented to TSA in the request for a waiver under 49 CFR 1515.7 or an appeal under 49 CFR 1515.9.
              (2) Consider the following criteria to determine whether a request for an in-person hearing is warranted:
              (i) The credibility of evidence or information submitted in the applicant's request for a waiver; and
              (ii) Whether TSA's waiver denial was made in accordance with the governing regulations codified at 49 CFR part 1515 and 49 CFR part 1572.
              (3) Give notice of and hold conferences and hearings;

              (e) Hearing. If the ALJ grants a request for a hearing, except for good cause shown, it will begin within 60 calendar days of the date of receipt of the request for hearing. The hearing is a limited discovery proceeding and is conducted as follows:
              (1) If applicable and upon request, TSA will provide to the applicant requesting a review an unclassified summary of classified evidence upon which the denial of the waiver or Final Determination was based.

              (3) The ALJ will review any classified information on an ex parte, in camera basis, and may consider such information in rendering a decision if the information appears to be material and relevant.
              (4) The standard of proof is substantial evidence on the record.
              (5) The parties may submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.

              (8) The hearing will be held at TSA's Headquarters building or, on request of a party, at an alternate location selected by the administrative law judge for good cause shown.
              (f) Decision of the Administrative Law Judge. (1) The record is closed once the certified transcript and all documents and materials have been submitted for the record.
              (2) The ALJ issues an unclassified written decision to the applicant no later than 30 calendar days from the close of the record and serves the decision on the parties. The ALJ may issue a classified decision to TSA.

              (ii) In the case of review of a waiver denial, unless appealed to the TSA Final Decision Maker, if the ALJ reverses the denial of the applicant's request for waiver, TSA will issue a Final Order granting a waiver to the applicant; and
              (A) In the case of an HME, send a Determination of No Security Threat to the licensing State.
              (B) In the case applicant for a TWIC, send a Determination of No Security Threat to the Coast Guard.

              (5) Dispose of SSI as specified in § 1520.19.
              (b) Unmarked SSI. If a covered person receives a record containing SSI that is not marked as specified in § 1520.13, the covered person must—

              (1) Mark the record as specified in § 1520.13; and
              
              (2) Inform the sender of the record that the record must be marked as specified in § 1520.13.
              (c) Duty to report unauthorized disclosure. When a covered person becomes aware that SSI has been released to unauthorized persons, the covered person must promptly inform TSA or the applicable DOT or DHS component or agency.
              (d) Additional Requirements for Critical Infrastructure Information. In the case of information that is both SSI and has been designated as critical infrastructure information under section 214 of the Homeland Security Act, any covered person who is a Federal employee in possession of such information must comply with the disclosure restrictions and other requirements applicable to such information under section 214 and any implementing regulations.
            
            
              § 1520.11
              Persons with a need to know.
              (a) In general. A person has a need to know SSI in each of the following circumstances:
              (1) When the person requires access to specific SSI to carry out transportation security activities approved, accepted, funded, recommended, or directed by DHS or DOT.
              (2) When the person is in training to carry out transportation security activities approved, accepted, funded, recommended, or directed by DHS or DOT.
              (3) When the information is necessary for the person to supervise or otherwise manage individuals carrying out transportation security activities approved, accepted, funded, recommended, or directed by the DHS or DOT.
              (4) When the person needs the information to provide technical or legal advice to a covered person regarding transportation security requirements of Federal law.
              (5) When the person needs the information to represent a covered person in connection with any judicial or administrative proceeding regarding those requirements.
              (b) Federal, State, local, or tribal government employees, contractors, and grantees. (1) A Federal, State, local, or tribal government employee has a need to know SSI if access to the information is necessary for performance of the employee's official duties, on behalf or in defense of the interests of the Federal, State, local, or tribal government.
              (2) A person acting in the performance of a contract with or grant from a Federal, State, local, or tribal government agency has a need to know SSI if access to the information is necessary to performance of the contract or grant.
              (c) Background check. TSA or Coast Guard may make an individual's access to the SSI contingent upon satisfactory completion of a security background check or other procedures and requirements for safeguarding SSI that are satisfactory to TSA or the Coast Guard.
              (d) Need to know further limited by the DHS or DOT. For some specific SSI, DHS or DOT may make a finding that only specific persons or classes of persons have a need to know.

              § 1520.13
              Marking SSI.
              (a) Marking of paper records. In the case of paper records containing SSI, a covered person must mark the record by placing the protective marking conspicuously on the top, and the distribution limitation statement on the bottom, of—
              (1) The outside of any front and back cover, including a binder cover or folder, if the document has a front and back cover;
              (2) Any title page; and
              (3) Each page of the document.
              (b) Protective marking. The protective marking is: SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION.
              (c) Distribution limitation statement. The distribution limitation statement is:
              
              
                
                  WARNING: This record contains Sensitive Security Information that is controlled under 49 CFR parts 15 and 1520. No part of this record may be disclosed to persons without a “need to know”, as defined in 49 CFR parts 15 and 1520, except with the written permission of the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration or the Secretary of Transportation. Unauthorized release may result in civil penalty or other action. For U.S. government agencies, public disclosure is governed by 5 U.S.C. 552 and 49 CFR parts 15 and 1520.
              
              
              (d) Other types of records. In the case of non-paper records that contain SSI, including motion picture films, videotape recordings, audio recording, and electronic and magnetic records, a covered person must clearly and conspicuously mark the records with the protective marking and the distribution limitation statement such that the viewer or listener is reasonably likely to see or hear them when obtaining access to the contents of the record.
            
            
              § 1520.15
              SSI disclosed by TSA or the Coast Guard.
              (a) In general. Except as otherwise provided in this section, and notwithstanding the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a), and other laws, records containing SSI are not available for public inspection or copying, nor does TSA or the Coast Guard release such records to persons without a need to know.
              (b) Disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act. If a record contains both SSI and information that is not SSI, TSA or the Coast Guard, on a proper Freedom of Information Act or Privacy Act request, may disclose the record with the SSI redacted, provided the record is not otherwise exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act or Privacy Act.
              (c) Disclosures to committees of Congress and the General Accounting Office. Nothing in this part precludes TSA or the Coast Guard from disclosing SSI to a committee of Congress authorized to have the information or to the Comptroller General, or to any authorized representative of the Comptroller General.
              (d) Disclosure in enforcement proceedings—(1) In general. TSA or the Coast Guard may provide SSI to a person in the context of an administrative enforcement proceeding when, in the sole discretion of TSA or the Coast Guard, as appropriate, access to the SSI is necessary for the person to prepare a response to allegations contained in a legal enforcement action document issued by TSA or the Coast Guard.
              (2) Security background check. Prior to providing SSI to a person under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, TSA or the Coast Guard may require the individual or, in the case of an entity, the individuals representing the entity, and their counsel, to undergo and satisfy, in the judgment of TSA or the Coast Guard, a security background check.
              (e) Other conditional disclosure. TSA may authorize a conditional disclosure of specific records or information that constitute SSI upon the written determination by TSA that disclosure of such records or information, subject to such limitations and restrictions as TSA may prescribe, would not be detrimental to transportation security.
              (f) Obligation to protect information. When an individual receives SSI pursuant to paragraph (d) or (e) of this section that individual becomes a covered person under § 1520.7 and is subject to the obligations of a covered person under this part.
              (g) No release under FOIA. When TSA discloses SSI pursuant to paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section, TSA makes the disclosure for the sole purpose described in that paragraph. Such disclosure is not a public release of information under the Freedom of Information Act.
              (h) Disclosure of Critical Infrastructure Information. Disclosure of information that is both SSI and has been designated as critical infrastructure information under section 214 of the Homeland Security Act is governed solely by the requirements of section 214 and any implementing regulations.
            
            
              § 1520.17
              Consequences of unauthorized disclosure of SSI.
              Violation of this part is grounds for a civil penalty and other enforcement or corrective action by DHS, and appropriate personnel actions for Federal employees. Corrective action may include issuance of an order requiring retrieval of SSI to remedy unauthorized disclosure or an order to cease future unauthorized disclosure.
            
            
              § 1520.19
              Destruction of SSI.
              (a) DHS. Subject to the requirements of the Federal Records Act (5 U.S.C. 105), including the duty to preserve records containing documentation of a Federal agency's policies, decisions, and essential transactions, DHS destroys SSI when no longer needed to carry out the agency's function.
              (b) Other covered persons—(1) In general. A covered person must destroy SSI completely to preclude recognition or reconstruction of the information when the covered person no longer needs the SSI to carry out transportation security measures.
              (2) Exception. Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not require a State or local government agency to destroy information that the agency is required to preserve under State or local law.

I understand that a knowing and willful false statement, or an omission of a material fact, on this application can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both (see section 1001 of Title 18 United States Code), and may be grounds for denial of authorization or in the case of parties regulated under this section, removal of authorization to operate under this chapter, if applicable.
                  I acknowledge that if I do not successfully complete the security threat assessment, the Transportation Security Administration may notify my employer. If TSA or other law enforcement agency becomes aware that I may pose an imminent threat to an operator or facility, TSA may provide limited information necessary to reduce the risk of injury or damage to the operator or facility.
                
                
                (d) Each operator must retain the following for 180 days following the end of the applicant's service to the operator:
                (1) The applicant's signed security threat assessment application.
                (2) Copies of the applicant's document(s) used to verify identity and work authorization.
                (3) Any notifications or documents sent to or received from TSA relating to the applicant's application and security threat assessment.
                (4) As applicable, a copy of the applicant's credential evidencing completion of a threat assessment deemed comparable under paragraph (f) of this section.
                (e) Records under this section may include electronic documents with electronic signature or other means of personal authentication, where accepted by TSA.

                (f) TSA may determine that a security threat assessment conducted by another governmental agency is comparable to a security threat assessment conducted under this subpart. Individuals who have successfully completed a comparable security threat assessment are not required to undergo the security threat assessments described in this subpart. If TSA makes a comparability determination under this section, TSA will so notify the public. In making a comparability determination, TSA will consider—
                
                (i) The minimum standards used for the security threat assessment;
                (ii) The frequency of the security threat assessment;
                (iii) The date of the most recent threat assessment; and
                (iv) Other factors TSA deems appropriate.
                (g) To apply for a comparability determination, the agency seeking the determination must contact the Assistant Program Manager, Attn: Federal Agency Comparability Check, Hazmat Threat Assessment Program, Transportation Security Administration, 601 South 12th Street, Arlington, VA 20598-6019.
                (h) TSA has determined that each of the following are comparable to the security threat assessment required in this subpart:
                (1) A CHRC conducted in accordance with §§ 1542.209, 1544.229, or 1544.230 that includes a name-based check conducted by TSA.
                (2) A security threat assessment conducted under 49 CFR part 1572 for the Transportation Worker Identification Credential or Hazardous Materials Endorsement programs.
                (3) A security threat assessment conducted for the Free and Secure Trade (FAST) program administered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
                (i) If asserting completion of a comparable threat assessment listed in paragraph (h) of this section, an individual must—
                (1) Present the credential that corresponds to successful completion of the comparable assessment to the operator so the operator may retain a copy of it; and
                (2) Notify the operator when the credential that corresponds to successful completion of the comparable assessment expires or is revoked for any reason.
                (j) A security threat assessment conducted under this subpart remains valid for five years from the date that TSA issues a Determination of No Security Threat or a Final Determination of Threat Assessment, except—
                (1) If the applicant is no longer authorized to be in the United States, the security threat assessment and the privileges it conveys expire on the date lawful presence expires; or
                (2) If the applicant asserts completion of a comparable threat assessment, it expires five years from the date of issuance of the credential that corresponds to the comparable assessment, or the date on which the credential is revoked for any reason.

                § 1540.205
                Procedures for security threat assessment.
                (a) Contents of security threat assessment. The security threat assessment TSA conducts under this subpart includes an intelligence-related check and a final disposition.
                (b) Intelligence-related check. To conduct an intelligence-related check, TSA completes the following procedures:
                (1) Reviews the applicant information required in 49 CFR 1540.203.
                (2) Searches domestic and international government databases to determine if an applicant meets the requirements of 49 CFR 1540.201(c) or to confirm an applicant's identity.
                (3) Adjudicates the results in accordance with 49 CFR 1540.201(c).
                (c) Wants, warrants, deportable aliens. If the searches listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section indicate that an applicant has an outstanding want or warrant, or is a deportable alien under the immigration laws of the United States, TSA sends the applicant's information to the appropriate law enforcement or immigration agency.
                (d) Final disposition. Following completion of the procedures described in paragraph (b), the following procedures apply, as appropriate:
                (1) TSA serves a Determination of No Security Threat on the applicant and operator if TSA determines that the applicant meets the security threat assessment standards in 49 CFR 1540.201(c).
                (2) TSA serves an Initial Determination of Threat Assessment on the applicant, if TSA determines that the applicant does not meet the security threat assessment standards in 49 CFR 1540.201(c). The Initial Determination of Threat Assessment includes—

                (i) A statement that TSA has determined that the applicant is suspected of posing or poses a security threat;
                
                (ii) The basis for the determination;
                (iii) Information about how the applicant may appeal the determination, as described in 49 CFR 1515.9; and
                (iv) A statement that if the applicant chooses not to appeal TSA's determination within 60 days of receipt of the Initial Determination, or does not request an extension of time within 60 days of the Initial Determination of Threat Assessment in order to file an appeal, the Initial Determination becomes a Final Determination of Security Threat Assessment.
                (3) TSA serves an Initial Determination of Threat Assessment and Immediate Revocation on the applicant and the applicant's operator or other operator as approved by TSA, where appropriate, if TSA determines that the applicant does not meet the security threat assessment standards in 49 CFR 1540.201(c) and may pose an imminent threat to transportation or national security, or of terrorism. The Initial Determination of Threat Assessment and Immediate Revocation includes—
                (i) A statement that TSA has determined that the applicant is suspected of posing or poses an imminent security threat;
                (ii) The basis for the determination;
                (iii) Information about how the applicant may appeal the determination, as described in 49 CFR 1515.5(h) or 1515.9(h), as applicable; and
                (iv) A statement that if the applicant chooses not to appeal TSA's determination within 60 days of receipt of the Initial Determination, or does not request an extension of time within 60 days of the Initial Determination of Threat Assessment in order to file an appeal, the Initial Determination becomes a Final Determination of Security Threat Assessment.
                (4) If the applicant does not appeal the Initial Determination of Threat Assessment or Initial Determination of Threat Assessment and Immediate Revocation, or if TSA does not grant the appeal, TSA serves a Final Determination of Threat Assessment on the individual and the applicant.
                (5) If the applicant appeals an Initial Determination of Threat Assessment, the procedures in 49 CFR 1515.5 or 1515.9 apply.

                § 1540.209
                Fees for security threat assessment.
                This section describes the payment process for completion of the security threat assessments required under this subpart.
                (a) Fees for security threat assessment. (1) TSA routinely establishes and collects fees to conduct the security threat assessment process. These fees apply to all entities requesting a security threat assessment. TSA reviews the amount of the fee periodically, at least once every two years, to determine the current cost of conducting security threat assessments. TSA determines fee amounts and any necessary revisions to the fee amounts based on current costs, using a method of analysis consistent with widely accepted accounting principles and practices, and calculated in accordance with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 9701 and other applicable Federal law.

                (2) TSA will publish fee amounts and any revisions to the fee amounts as a notice in the Federal Register.
                
                (b) [Reserved]
                (c) Remittance of fees. (1) The fees required under this subpart must be remitted to TSA in a form and manner acceptable to TSA each time the applicant or an aircraft operator, foreign air carrier, indirect air carrier, or certified cargo screening facility submits the information required under § 1540.203 or § 1540.207 to TSA.
                (2) Fees remitted to TSA under this subpart must be payable to the “Transportation Security Administration” in U.S. currency and drawn on a U.S. bank.
                (3) TSA will not issue any fee refunds, unless a fee was paid in error.

                § 1540.301
                Withdrawal of approval of a security program.
                (a) Applicability. This section applies to holders of a security program approved or accepted by TSA under 49 CFR chapter XII, subchapter C.
                (b) Withdrawal of security program approval. TSA may withdraw the approval of a security program, if TSA determines continued operation is contrary to security and the public interest, as follows:
                (1) Notice of proposed withdrawal of approval. TSA will serve a Notice of Proposed Withdrawal of Approval, which notifies the holder of the security program, in writing, of the facts, charges, and applicable law, regulation, or order that form the basis of the determination.
                (2) Security program holder's reply. The holder of the security program may respond to the Notice of Proposed Withdrawal of Approval no later than 15 calendar days after receipt of the withdrawal by providing the designated official, in writing, with any material facts, arguments, applicable law, and regulation.
                (3) TSA review. The designated official will consider all information available, including any relevant material or information submitted by the holder of the security program, before either issuing a Withdrawal of Approval of the security program or rescinding the Notice of Proposed Withdrawal of Approval. If TSA issues a Withdrawal of Approval, it becomes effective upon receipt by the holder of the security program, or 15 calendar days after service, whichever occurs first.
                (4) Petition for reconsideration. The holder of the security program may petition TSA to reconsider its Withdrawal of Approval by serving a petition for consideration no later than 15 calendar days after the holder of the security program receives the Withdrawal of Approval. The holder of the security program must serve the Petition for Reconsideration on the designated official. Submission of a Petition for Reconsideration will not stay the Withdrawal of Approval. The holder of the security program may request the designated official to stay the Withdrawal of Approval pending review of and decision on the Petition.
                (5) Assistant Secretary's review. The designated official transmits the Petition together with all pertinent information to the Assistant Secretary for reconsideration. The Assistant Secretary will dispose of the Petition within 15 calendar days of receipt by either directing the designated official to rescind the Withdrawal of Approval or by affirming the Withdrawal of Approval. The decision of the Assistant Secretary constitutes a final agency order subject to judicial review in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 46110.
                (6) Emergency withdrawal. If TSA finds that there is an emergency with respect to aviation security requiring immediate action that makes the procedures in this section contrary to the public interest, the designated official may issue an Emergency Withdrawal of Approval of a security program without first issuing a Notice of Proposed Withdrawal of Approval. The Emergency Withdrawal would be effective on the date that the holder of the security program receives the emergency withdrawal. In such a case, the designated official will send the holder of the security program a brief statement of the facts, charges, applicable law, regulation, or order that forms the basis for the Emergency Withdrawal. The holder of the security program may submit a Petition for Reconsideration under the procedures in paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(5) of this section; however, this petition will not stay the effective date of the Emergency Withdrawal.
                (c) Service of documents for withdrawal of approval of security program proceedings. Service may be accomplished by personal delivery, certified mail, or express courier. Documents served on the holder of a security program will be served at its official place of business as designated in its application for approval or its security program. Documents served on TSA must be served to the address noted in the Notice of Withdrawal of Approval or Withdrawal of Approval, whichever is applicable.
                (1) Certificate of service. An individual may attach a certificate of service to a document tendered for filing. A certificate of service must consist of a statement, dated and signed by the person filing the document, that the document was personally delivered, served by certified mail on a specific date, or served by express courier on a specific date.
                (2) Date of service. The date of service is—
                (i) The date of personal delivery;
                (ii) If served by certified mail, the mailing date shown on the certificate of service, the date shown on the postmark if there is no certificate of service, or other mailing date shown by other evidence if there is no certificate of service or postmark; or
                (iii) If served by express courier, the service date shown on the certificate of service, or by other evidence if there is no certificate of service.
                (d) Extension of time. TSA may grant an extension of time to the limits set forth in this section for good cause shown. A security program holder must submit a request for an extension of time in writing, and TSA must receive it at least two days before the due date in order to be considered. TSA may grant itself an extension of time for good cause.

                Applicability of this part.
                This part describes aviation security rules governing:
                (a) The operation of airports regularly serving aircraft operations required to be under a security program under part 1544 of this chapter, as described in this part.
                (b) The operation of airport regularly serving foreign air carrier operations required to be under a security program under part 1546 of this chapter, as described in this part.
                (c) Each airport operator that receives a Security Directive or Information Circular and each person who receives information from a Security Directive or Information Circular issued by the Designated official for Civil Aviation Security.
                (d) Each airport operator that does not have a security program under this part that serves an aircraft operator operating under a security program under part 1544 of this chapter, or a foreign air carrier operating under a security program under part 1546 of this chapter. Such airport operators must comply with § 1542.5(e).
                [67 FR 8355, Feb. 22, 2002, as amended at 71 FR 30509, May 26, 2006]
              
              
                § 1542.3
                Airport security coordinator.
                (a) Each airport operator must designate one or more Airport Security Coordinator(s) (ASC) in its security program.

                (b) The airport operator must ensure that one or more ASCs:
                
                (1) Serve as the airport operator's primary and immediate contact for security-related activities and communications with TSA. Any individual designated as an ASC may perform other duties in addition to those described in this paragraph (b).
                (2) Is available to TSA on a 24-hour basis.
                (3) Review with sufficient frequency all security-related functions to ensure that all are effective and in compliance with this part, its security program, and applicable Security Directives.
                (4) Immediately initiate corrective action for any instance of non-compliance with this part, its security program, and applicable Security Directives.
                (5) Review and control the results of employment history, verification, and criminal history records checks required under § 1542.209.
                (6) Serve as the contact to receive notification from individuals applying for unescorted access of their intent to seek correction of their criminal history record with the FBI.
                (c) After July 17, 2003, no airport operator may use, nor may it designate any person as, an ASC unless that individual has completed subject matter training, as specified in its security program, to prepare the individual to assume the duties of the position. The airport operator must maintain ASC training documentation until at least 180 days after the withdrawal of an individual's designation as an ASC.
                (d) An individual's satisfactory completion of initial ASC training required under paragraph (c) of this section satisfies that requirement for all future ASC designations for that individual, except for site specific information, unless there has been a two or more year break in service as an active and designated ASC.
              
              
                § 1542.5

                (a) Each airport operator must allow TSA, at any time or place, to make any inspections or tests, including copying records, to determine compliance of an airport operator, aircraft operator, foreign air carrier, indirect air carrier, or other airport tenants with—
                (1) This subchapter and any security program under this subchapter, and part 1520 of this chapter; and
                (2) 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII, as amended.

                § 1542.105
                Approval and amendments.
                (a) Initial approval of security program. Unless otherwise authorized by the designated official, each airport operator required to have a security program under this part must submit its initial proposed security program to the designated official for approval at least 90 days before the date any aircraft operator or foreign air carrier required to have a security program under part 1544 or part 1546 of this chapter is expected to begin operations. Such requests will be processed as follows:
                (1) The designated official, within 30 days after receiving the proposed security program, will either approve the program or give the airport operator written notice to modify the program to comply with the applicable requirements of this part.
                (2) The airport operator may either submit a modified security program to the designated official for approval, or petition the Administrator to reconsider the notice to modify within 30 days of receiving a notice to modify. A petition for reconsideration must be filed with the designated official.

                (3) The designated official, upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, either amends or withdraws the notice, or transmits the petition, together with any pertinent information, to the Administrator for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within 30 days of receipt by either directing the designated official to withdraw or amend the notice to modify, or by affirming the notice to modify.
                (b) Amendment requested by an airport operator. Except as provided in § 1542.103(c), an airport operator may submit a request to the designated official to amend its security program, as follows:
                (1) The request for an amendment must be filed with the designated official at least 45 days before the date it proposes for the amendment to become effective, unless a shorter period is allowed by the designated official.
                (2) Within 30 days after receiving a proposed amendment, the designated official, in writing, either approves or denies the request to amend.
                (3) An amendment to a security program may be approved if the designated official determines that safety and the public interest will allow it, and the proposed amendment provides the level of security required under this part.
                (4) Within 30 days after receiving a denial, the airport operator may petition the Administrator to reconsider the denial.
                (5) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated official either approves the request to amend or transmits the petition within 30 days of receipt, together with any pertinent information, to the Administrator for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within 30 days of receipt by either directing the designated official to approve the amendment or affirming the denial.
                (c) Amendment by TSA. If safety and the public interest require an amendment, the designated official may amend a security program as follows:
                (1) The designated official sends to the airport operator a notice, in writing, of the proposed amendment, fixing a period of not less than 30 days within which the airport operator may submit written information, views, and arguments on the amendment.
                (2) After considering all relevant material, the designated official notifies the airport operator of any amendment adopted or rescinds the notice. If the amendment is adopted, it becomes effective not less than 30 days after the airport operator receives the notice of amendment, unless the airport operator petitions the Administrator to reconsider no later than 15 days before the effective date of the amendment. The airport operator must send the petition for reconsideration to the designated official. A timely petition for reconsideration stays the effective date of the amendment.
                (3) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated official either amends or withdraws the notice, or transmits the petition, together with any pertinent information to the Administrator for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within 30 days of receipt by either directing the designated official to withdraw or amend the amendment, or by affirming the amendment.
                (d) Emergency amendments. Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section, if the designated official finds that there is an emergency requiring immediate action with respect to safety and security in air transportation or in air commerce that makes procedures in this section contrary to the public interest, the designated official may issue an amendment, effective without stay on the date the airport operator receives the notice of it. In such a case, the designated official must incorporate in the notice a brief statement of the reasons and findings for the amendment to be adopted. The airport operator may file a petition for reconsideration under paragraph (c) of this section; however, this does not stay the effective date of the emergency amendment.
              
              
                § 1542.107

                Alternate means of compliance.
                If in TSA's judgment, the overall safety and security of the airport, and aircraft operator or foreign air carrier operations are not diminished, TSA may approve a security program that provides for the use of alternate measures. Such a program may be considered only for an operator of an airport at which service by aircraft operators or foreign air carriers under part 1544 or 1546 of this chapter is determined by TSA to be seasonal or infrequent.
              
              
                § 1542.111
                Exclusive area agreements.
                (a) TSA may approve an amendment to an airport security program under which an aircraft operator or foreign air carrier that has a security program under part 1544 or 1546 of this chapter assumes responsibility for specified security measures for all or portions of the secured area, AOA, or SIDA, including access points, as provided in § 1542.201, § 1542.203, or § 1542.205. The assumption of responsibility must be exclusive to one aircraft operator or foreign air carrier, and shared responsibility among aircraft operators or foreign air carriers is not permitted for an exclusive area.
                (b) An exclusive area agreement must be in writing, signed by the airport operator and aircraft operator or foreign air carrier, and maintained in the airport security program. This agreement must contain the following:
                (1) A description, a map, and, where appropriate, a diagram of the boundaries and pertinent features of each area, including individual access points, over which the aircraft operator or foreign air carrier will exercise exclusive security responsibility.

                (3) The tenant must assume the responsibility within the tenant's leased areas or areas designated for the tenant's exclusive use. A tenant may not assume responsibility under a tenant security program for the airport passenger terminal.
                (4) Responsibility must be exclusive to one tenant, and shared responsibility among tenants is not permitted.
                (5) TSA must find that the tenant is able and willing to carry out the airport tenant security program.

                (3) Provide a means to differentiate between individuals authorized to have access to an entire secured area and individuals authorized access to only a particular portion of a secured area.
                (b) Alternative systems. TSA may approve an amendment to a security program that provides alternative measures that provide an overall level of security equal to that which would be provided by the measures described in paragraph (a) of this section.
                (c) Air operations area. The measures for controlling entry to the AOA required under § 1542.203(b)(1) must incorporate accountability procedures to maintain their integrity.
                (d) Secondary access media. An airport operator may issue a second access medium to an individual who has unescorted access to secured areas or the AOA, but is temporarily not in possession of the original access medium, if the airport operator follows measures and procedures in the security program that—
                (1) Verifies the authorization of the individual to have unescorted access to secured areas or AOAs;
                (2) Restricts the time period of entry with the second access medium;
                (3) Retrieves the second access medium when expired;
                (4) Deactivates or invalidates the original access medium until the individual returns the second access medium; and
                (5) Provides that any second access media that is also used as identification media meet the criteria of § 1542.211(b).
              
              
                § 1542.209

                (3) The airport operator must verify the identity of the individual through two forms of identification prior to fingerprinting, and ensure that the printed name on the fingerprint application is legible. At least one of the two forms of identification must have been issued by a government authority, and at least one must include a photo.
                (4) The airport operator must advise the individual that:
                (i) A copy of the criminal record received from the FBI will be provided to the individual, if requested by the individual in writing; and
                (ii) The ASC is the individual's point of contact if he or she has questions about the results of the CHRC.

                (5) The airport operator must collect, control, and process one set of legible and classifiable fingerprints under direct observation of the airport operator or a law enforcement officer.
                (6) Fingerprints may be obtained and processed electronically, or recorded on fingerprint cards approved by the FBI and distributed by TSA for that purpose.
                (7) The fingerprint submission must be forwarded to TSA in the manner specified by TSA.

If there is no disposition, or if the disposition did not result in a conviction or in a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity of one of the offenses listed in paragraph (d) of this section, the individual is not disqualified under this section.
                (3) The airport operator may only make the determinations required in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section for individuals for whom it is issuing, or has issued, unescorted access authority, and who are not covered by a certification from an aircraft operator under paragraph (n) of this section. The airport operator may not make determinations for individuals described in § 1544.229 of this chapter.
                (h) Correction of FBI records and notification of disqualification. (1) Before making a final decision to deny unescorted access authority to an individual described in paragraph (b) of this section, the airport operator must advise him or her that the FBI criminal record discloses information that would disqualify him or her from receiving or retaining unescorted access authority and provide the individual with a copy of the FBI record if he or she requests it.
                (2) The airport operator must notify an individual that a final decision has been made to grant or deny unescorted access authority.
                (3) Immediately following the suspension of unescorted access authority of an individual, the airport operator must advise him or her that the FBI criminal record discloses information that disqualifies him or her from retaining unescorted access authority and provide the individual with a copy of the FBI record if he or she requests it.
                (i) Corrective action by the individual. The individual may contact the local jurisdiction responsible for the information and the FBI to complete or correct the information contained in his or her record, subject to the following conditions—
                (1) For an individual seeking unescorted access authority on or after December 6, 2001, the following applies:

                (i) Within 30 days after being advised that the criminal record received from the FBI discloses a disqualifying criminal offense, the individual must notify the airport operator in writing of his or her intent to correct any information he or she believes to be inaccurate. The airport operator must obtain a copy, or accept a copy from the individual, of the revised FBI record, or a certified true copy of the information from the appropriate court, prior to granting unescorted access authority.
                
                (ii) If no notification, as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, is received within 30 days, the airport operator may make a final determination to deny unescorted access authority.
                (2) For an individual with unescorted access authority before December 6, 2001, the following applies: Within 30 days after being advised of suspension because the criminal record received from the FBI discloses a disqualifying criminal offense, the individual must notify the airport operator in writing of his or her intent to correct any information he or she believes to be inaccurate. The airport operator must obtain a copy, or accept a copy from the individual, of the revised FBI record, or a certified true copy of the information from the appropriate court, prior to reinstating unescorted access authority.
                (j) Limits on dissemination of results. Criminal record information provided by the FBI may be used only to carry out this section and § 1544.229 of this chapter. No person may disseminate the results of a CHRC to anyone other than:
                (1) The individual to whom the record pertains, or that individual's authorized representative.
                (2) Officials of other airport operators who are determining whether to grant unescorted access to the individual under this part.
                (3) Aircraft operators who are determining whether to grant unescorted access to the individual or authorize the individual to perform screening functions under part 1544 of this chapter.
                (4) Others designated by TSA.
                (k) Recordkeeping. The airport operator must maintain the following information:
                (1) Investigations conducted before December 6, 2001. The airport operator must maintain and control the access or employment history investigation files, including the criminal history records results portion, or the appropriate certifications, for investigations conducted before December 6, 2001.
                (2) Fingerprint application process on or after December 6, 2001. Except when the airport operator has received a certification under paragraph (n) of this section, the airport operator must physically maintain, control, and, as appropriate, destroy the fingerprint application and the criminal record. Only direct airport operator employees may carry out the responsibility for maintaining, controlling, and destroying criminal records.
                (3) Certification on or after December 6, 2001. The airport operator must maintain the certifications provided under paragraph (n) of this section.
                (4) Protection of records—all investigations. The records required by this section must be maintained in a manner that is acceptable to TSA and in a manner that protects the confidentiality of the individual.
                (5) Duration—all investigations. The records identified in this section with regard to an individual must be maintained until 180 days after the termination of the individual's unescorted access authority. When files are no longer maintained, the criminal record must be destroyed.
                (l) Continuing responsibilities. (1) Each individual with unescorted access authority on December 6, 2001, who had a disqualifying criminal offense in paragraph (d) of this section on or after December 6, 1991, must, by January 7, 2002, report the conviction to the airport operator and surrender the SIDA access medium to the issuer.
                (2) Each individual with unescorted access authority who has a disqualifying criminal offense must report the offense to the airport operator and surrender the SIDA access medium to the issuer within 24 hours of the conviction or the finding of not guilty by reason of insanity.
                (3) If information becomes available to the airport operator or the airport user indicating that an individual with unescorted access authority has a disqualifying criminal offense, the airport operator must determine the status of the conviction. If a disqualifying offense is confirmed the airport operator must immediately revoke any unescorted access authority.
                (m) Exceptions. Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, an airport operator must authorize the following individuals to have unescorted access authority:

                (1) An employee of the Federal, state, or local government (including a law enforcement officer) who, as a condition of employment, has been subjected to an employment investigation that includes a criminal records check.
                (2) Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, an airport operator may authorize the following individuals to have unescorted access authority:
                (i) An individual who has been continuously employed in a position requiring unescorted access authority by another airport operator, airport user, or aircraft operator, or contractor to such an entity, provided the grant for his or her unescorted access authority was based upon a fingerprint-based CHRC through TSA or FAA.
                (ii) An individual who has been continuously employed by an aircraft operator or aircraft operator contractor, in a position with authority to perform screening functions, provided the grant for his or her authority to perform screening functions was based upon a fingerprint-based CHRC through TSA or FAA.
                (n) Certifications by aircraft operators. An airport operator is in compliance with its obligation under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section when the airport operator accepts, for each individual seeking unescorted access authority, certification from an aircraft operator subject to part 1544 of this chapter indicating it has complied with § 1544.229 of this chapter for the aircraft operator's employees and contractors seeking unescorted access authority. If the airport operator accepts a certification from the aircraft operator, the airport operator may not require the aircraft operator to provide a copy of the CHRC.
                (o) Airport operator responsibility. The airport operator must—
                (1) Designate the ASC, in the security program, or a direct employee if the ASC is not a direct employee, to be responsible for maintaining, controlling, and destroying the criminal record files when their maintenance is no longer required by paragraph (k) of this section.
                (2) Designate the ASC, in the security program, to serve as the contact to receive notification from individuals applying for unescorted access authority of their intent to seek correction of their FBI criminal record.
                (3) Audit the employment history investigations performed by the airport operator in accordance with this section and 14 CFR 107.31 in effect prior to November 14, 2001 (see 14 CFR Parts 60 through 139 revised as of January 1, 2001), and those investigations conducted by the airport users who provided certification to the airport operator. The audit program must be set forth in the airport security program.
                (p) Airport user responsibility. (1) The airport user must report to the airport operator information, as it becomes available, that indicates an individual with unescorted access authority may have a disqualifying criminal offense.
                (2) The airport user must maintain and control, in compliance with paragraph (k) of this section, the employment history investigation files for investigations conducted before December 6, 2001, unless the airport operator decides to maintain and control the employment history investigation file.
                (3) The airport user must provide the airport operator with either the name or title of the individual acting as custodian of the files described in this paragraph (p), the address of the location where the files are maintained, and the phone number of that location. The airport user must provide the airport operator and TSA with access to these files.

                (1) The designated official, within 30 days after receiving the proposed aircraft operator security program, will either approve the program or give the aircraft operator written notice to modify the program to comply with the applicable requirements of this part.

                (2) The aircraft operator may either submit a modified security program to the designated official for approval, or petition the Administrator to reconsider the notice to modify within 30 days of receiving a notice to modify. A petition for reconsideration must be filed with the designated official.
                
                (3) The designated official, upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, either amends or withdraws the notice, or transmits the petition, together with any pertinent information, to the Administrator for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within 30 days of receipt by either directing the designated official to withdraw or amend the notice to modify, or by affirming the notice to modify.
                (b) Amendment requested by an aircraft operator. An aircraft operator may submit a request to TSA to amend its security program as follows:
                (1) The request for an amendment must be filed with the designated official at least 45 days before the date it proposes for the amendment to become effective, unless a shorter period is allowed by the designated official.
                (2) Within 30 days after receiving a proposed amendment, the designated official, in writing, either approves or denies the request to amend.
                (3) An amendment to an aircraft operator security program may be approved if the designated official determines that safety and the public interest will allow it, and the proposed amendment provides the level of security required under this part.
                (4) Within 30 days after receiving a denial, the aircraft operator may petition the Administrator to reconsider the denial. A petition for reconsideration must be filed with the designated official.
                (5) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated official either approves the request to amend or transmits the petition, together with any pertinent information, to the Administrator for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within 30 days of receipt by either directing the designated official to approve the amendment, or affirming the denial.
                (6) Any aircraft operator may submit a group proposal for an amendment that is on behalf of it and other aircraft operators that co-sign the proposal.
                (c) Amendment by TSA. If safety and the public interest require an amendment, TSA may amend a security program as follows:
                (1) The designated official notifies the aircraft operator, in writing, of the proposed amendment, fixing a period of not less than 30 days within which the aircraft operator may submit written information, views, and arguments on the amendment.
                (2) After considering all relevant material, the designated official notifies the aircraft operator of any amendment adopted or rescinds the notice. If the amendment is adopted, it becomes effective not less than 30 days after the aircraft operator receives the notice of amendment, unless the aircraft operator petitions the Administrator to reconsider no later than 15 days before the effective date of the amendment. The aircraft operator must send the petition for reconsideration to the designated official. A timely petition for reconsideration stays the effective date of the amendment.
                (3) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated official either amends or withdraws the notice or transmits the petition, together with any pertinent information, to the Administrator for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within 30 days of receipt by either directing the designated official to withdraw or amend the amendment, or by affirming the amendment.
                (d) Emergency amendments. If the designated official finds that there is an emergency requiring immediate action with respect to safety in air transportation or in air commerce that makes procedures in this section contrary to the public interest, the designated official may issue an amendment, without the prior notice and comment procedures in paragraph (c) of this section, effective without stay on the date the aircraft operator receives notice of it. In such a case, the designated official will incorporate in the notice a brief statement of the reasons and findings for the amendment to be adopted. The aircraft operator may file a petition for reconsideration under paragraph (c) of this section; however, this does not stay the effective date of the emergency amendment.

                (2) When a CHRC on an individual described in paragraph (a)(2) or (4) of this section discloses an arrest for any disqualifying criminal offense without indicating a disposition, the aircraft operator must suspend the individual's authority to perform a covered function not later than 45 days after obtaining the CHRC unless the aircraft operator determines, after investigation, that the arrest did not result in a disqualifying criminal offense. If there is no disposition, or if the disposition did not result in a conviction or in a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity of one of the offenses listed in paragraph (d) of this section, the individual is not disqualified under this section.
                (3) The aircraft operator may only make the determinations required in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section for individuals for whom it is issuing, or has issued, authority to perform a covered function; and individuals who are covered by a certification from an aircraft operator under § 1542.209(n) of this chapter. The aircraft operator may not make determinations for individuals described in § 1542.209(a) of this chapter.
                (h) Correction of FBI records and notification of disqualification. (1) Before making a final decision to deny authority to an individual described in paragraph (a)(1) or (3) of this section, the aircraft operator must advise him or her that the FBI criminal record discloses information that would disqualify him or her from receiving or retaining authority to perform a covered function and provide the individual with a copy of the FBI record if he or she requests it.
                (2) The aircraft operator must notify an individual that a final decision has been made to grant or deny authority to perform a covered function.
                (3) Immediately following the suspension of authority to perform a covered function, the aircraft operator must advise the individual that the FBI criminal record discloses information that disqualifies him or her from retaining his or her authority, and provide the individual with a copy of the FBI record if he or she requests it.

                (b) CHRC required. Each aircraft operator must ensure that each flightcrew member has undergone a fingerprint-based CHRC that does not disclose that he or she has a disqualifying criminal offense, as described in § 1544.229(d), before allowing that individual to serve as a flightcrew member.
                (c) Application and fees. Each aircraft operator must ensure that each flightcrew member's fingerprints are obtained and submitted as described in § 1544.229 (e) and (f).
                (d) Determination of arrest status. (1) When a CHRC on an individual described in paragraph (a) of this section discloses an arrest for any disqualifying criminal offense listed in § 1544.229(d) without indicating a disposition, the aircraft operator must determine, after investigation, that the arrest did not result in a disqualifying offense before the individual may serve as a flightcrew member. If there is no disposition, or if the disposition did not result in a conviction or in a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity of one of the offenses listed in § 1544.229(d), the flight crewmember is not disqualified under this section.

                (2) When a CHRC on an individual described in paragraph (a) of this section discloses an arrest for any disqualifying criminal offense listed in § 1544.229(d) without indicating a disposition, the aircraft operator must suspend the individual's flightcrew member privileges not later than 45 days after obtaining a CHRC, unless the aircraft operator determines, after investigation, that the arrest did not result in a disqualifying criminal offense. If there is no disposition, or if the disposition did not result in a conviction or in a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity of one of the offenses listed in § 1544.229(d), the flight crewmember is not disqualified under this section.
                (3) The aircraft operator may only make the determinations required in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section for individuals whom it is using, or will use, as a flightcrew member. The aircraft operator may not make determinations for individuals described in § 1542.209(a) of this chapter.
                (e) Correction of FBI records and notification of disqualification. (1) Before making a final decision to deny the individual the ability to serve as a flightcrew member, the aircraft operator must advise the individual that the FBI criminal record discloses information that would disqualify the individual from serving as a flightcrew member and provide the individual with a copy of the FBI record if the individual requests it.
                (2) The aircraft operator must notify the individual that a final decision has been made to allow or deny the individual flightcrew member status.
                (3) Immediately following the denial of flightcrew member status, the aircraft operator must advise the individual that the FBI criminal record discloses information that disqualifies him or her from retaining his or her flightcrew member status, and provide the individual with a copy of the FBI record if he or she requests it.
                (f) Corrective action by the individual. The individual may contact the local jurisdiction responsible for the information and the FBI to complete or correct the information contained in his or her record, subject to the following conditions—
                (1) Within 30 days after being advised that the criminal record received from the FBI discloses a disqualifying criminal offense, the individual must notify the aircraft operator in writing of his or her intent to correct any information he or she believes to be inaccurate. The aircraft operator must obtain a copy, or accept a copy from the individual, of the revised FBI record or a certified true copy of the information from the appropriate court, prior to allowing the individual to serve as a flightcrew member.
                (2) If no notification, as described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, is received within 30 days, the aircraft operator may make a final determination to deny the individual flightcrew member status.
                (g) Limits on the dissemination of results. Criminal record information provided by the FBI may be used only to carry out this section. No person may disseminate the results of a CHRC to anyone other than—
                (1) The individual to whom the record pertains, or that individual's authorized representative.
                (2) Others designated by TSA.
                (h) Recordkeeping—(1) Fingerprint application process. The aircraft operator must physically maintain, control, and, as appropriate, destroy the fingerprint application and the criminal record. Only direct aircraft operator employees may carry out the responsibility for maintaining, controlling, and destroying criminal records.
                (2) Protection of records. The records required by this section must be maintained by the aircraft operator in a manner that is acceptable to TSA that protects the confidentiality of the individual.
                (3) Duration. The records identified in this section with regard to an individual must be made available upon request by TSA, and maintained by the aircraft operator until 180 days after the termination of the individual's privileges to perform flightcrew member duties with the aircraft operator. When files are no longer maintained, the aircraft operator must destroy the CHRC results.
                (i) Continuing responsibilities. (1) Each flightcrew member identified in paragraph (a) of this section who has a disqualifying criminal offense must report the offense to the aircraft operator within 24 hours of the conviction or the finding of not guilty by reason of insanity.

                (2) If information becomes available to the aircraft operator indicating that a flightcrew member identified in paragraph (a) of this section has a possible conviction for any disqualifying criminal offense in § 1544.229 (d), the aircraft operator must determine the status of the conviction. If a disqualifying criminal offense is confirmed, the aircraft operator may not assign that individual to flightcrew duties in operations identified in paragraph (a).
                (j) Aircraft operator responsibility. The aircraft operator must—(1) Designate a direct employee to maintain, control, and, as appropriate, destroy criminal records.
                (2) Designate an individual(s) to maintain the CHRC results.
                (3) Designate an individual(s) at appropriate locations to receive notification from individuals of their intent to seek correction of their FBI criminal record.
                (k) Compliance date. Each aircraft operator must comply with this section for each flightcrew member described in paragraph (a) of this section not later than December 6, 2002.

                Bomb or air piracy threats.
                (a) Flight: Notification. Upon receipt of a specific and credible threat to the security of a flight, the aircraft operator must—
                (1) Immediately notify the ground and in-flight security coordinators of the threat, any evaluation thereof, and any measures to be applied; and

                (2) Ensure that the in-flight security coordinator notifies all crewmembers of the threat, any evaluation thereof, and any measures to be applied; and
                (3) Immediately notify the appropriate airport operator.
                (b) Flight: Inspection. Upon receipt of a specific and credible threat to the security of a flight, each aircraft operator must attempt to determine whether or not any explosive or incendiary is present by doing the following:
                (1) Conduct a security inspection on the ground before the next flight or, if the aircraft is in flight, immediately after its next landing.
                (2) If the aircraft is on the ground, immediately deplane all passengers and submit that aircraft to a security search.
                (3) If the aircraft is in flight, immediately advise the pilot in command of all pertinent information available so that necessary emergency action can be taken.

At such locations the aircraft operator may use screeners who are not United States citizens.
              
              
                § 1544.407
                Training, testing, and knowledge of individuals who perform screening functions.
                (a) Training required. Before performing screening functions, an individual must have completed initial, recurrent, and appropriate specialized training as specified in this section and the aircraft operator's security program. No aircraft operator may use any screener, screener in charge, or checkpoint security supervisor unless that individual has satisfactorily completed the required training. This paragraph does not prohibit the performance of screening functions during on-the-job training as provided in § 1544.409 (b).
                (b) Use of training programs. Training for screeners must be conducted under programs provided by TSA. Training programs for screeners-in-charge and checkpoint security supervisors must be conducted in accordance with the aircraft operator's security program.
                (c) Citizenship. A screener must be a citizen or national of the United States.
                (d) Screener readiness test. Before beginning on-the-job training, a screener trainee must pass the screener readiness test prescribed by TSA.
                (e) On-the-job training and testing. Each screener must complete at least 60 hours of on-the-job training and must pass an on-the-job training test prescribed by TSA. No aircraft operator may permit a screener trainee to exercise independent judgment as a screener, until the individual passes an on-the-job training test prescribed by TSA.
                (f) Knowledge requirements. Each aircraft operator must ensure that individuals performing as screeners, screeners-in-charge, and checkpoint security supervisors for the aircraft operator have knowledge of the provisions of this part, the aircraft operator's security program, and applicable Security Directives and Information Circulars to the extent necessary to perform their duties.
                (g) Disclosure of sensitive security information during training. The aircraft operator may not permit a trainee to have access to sensitive security information during screener training unless a criminal history records check has successfully been completed for that individual in accordance with § 1544.229, and the individual has no disqualifying criminal offense.

                § 1544.409
                Integrity of screener tests.
                (a) Cheating or other unauthorized conduct. (1) Except as authorized by the TSA, no person may—
                (i) Copy or intentionally remove a test under this part;
                (ii) Give to another or receive from another any part or copy of that test;
                (iii) Give help on that test to or receive help on that test from any person during the period that the test is being given; or
                (iv) Use any material or aid during the period that the test is being given.
                (2) No person may take any part of that test on behalf of another person.
                (3) No person may cause, assist, or participate intentionally in any act prohibited by this paragraph (a).
                (b) Administering and monitoring screener tests. (1) Each aircraft operator must notify TSA of the time and location at which it will administer each screener readiness test required under § 1544.405(d).
                (2) Either TSA or the aircraft operator must administer and monitor the screener readiness test. Where more than one aircraft operator or foreign air carrier uses a screening location, TSA may authorize an employee of one or more of the aircraft operators or foreign air carriers to monitor the test for a trainee who will screen at that location.
                (3) If TSA or a representative of TSA is not available to administer and monitor a screener readiness test, the aircraft operator must provide a direct employee to administer and monitor the screener readiness test.
                (4) An aircraft operator employee who administers and monitors a screener readiness test must not be an instructor, screener, screener-in-charge, checkpoint security supervisor, or other screening supervisor. The employee must be familiar with the procedures for administering and monitoring the test and must be capable of observing whether the trainee or others are engaging in cheating or other unauthorized conduct.
              
              
                § 1544.411
                Continuing qualifications of screening personnel.
                (a) Impairment. No individual may perform a screening function if he or she shows evidence of impairment, such as impairment due to illegal drugs, sleep deprivation, medication, or alcohol.
                
                (b) Training not complete. An individual who has not completed the training required by § 1544.405 may be deployed during the on-the-job portion of training to perform security functions provided that the individual—
                (1) Is closely supervised; and
                (2) Does not make independent judgments as to whether individuals or property may enter a sterile area or aircraft without further inspection.
                (c) Failure of operational test. No aircraft operator may use an individual to perform a screening function after that individual has failed an operational test related to that function, until that individual has successfully completed the remedial training specified in the aircraft operator's security program.
                (d) Annual proficiency review. Each individual assigned screening duties shall receive an annual evaluation. The aircraft operator must ensure that a Ground Security Coordinator conducts and documents an annual evaluation of each individual who performs screening functions. An individual who performs screening functions may not continue to perform such functions unless the evaluation demonstrates that the individual—
                (1) Continues to meet all qualifications and standards required to perform a screening function;
                (2) Has a satisfactory record of performance and attention to duty based on the standards and requirements in the aircraft operator's security program; and
                (3) Demonstrates the current knowledge and skills necessary to courteously, vigilantly, and effectively perform screening functions.

                § 1546.103
                Form, content, and availability of security program.
                (a) General requirements. The security program must be:
                (1) Acceptable to TSA. A foreign air carrier's security program is acceptable only if TSA finds that the security program provides a level of protection similar to the level of protection provided by U.S. aircraft operators serving the same airports. Foreign air carriers must employ procedures equivalent to those required of U.S. aircraft operators serving the same airport, if TSA determines that such procedures are necessary to provide a similar level of protection.
                (2) In English unless TSA requests that the program be submitted in the official language of the foreign air carrier's country.
                (b) Content of security program. Each security program required by § 1546.101(a), (b), (c), (e), or (f) must be designed to—

                (1) Prevent or deter the carriage aboard airplanes of any unauthorized explosive, incendiary, or weapon on or about each individual's person or accessible property, except as provided in § 1546.201(d), through screening by weapon-detecting procedures or facilities;
                
                (2) Prohibit unauthorized access to airplanes;
                (3) Ensure that checked baggage is accepted by a responsible agent of the foreign air carrier; and
                (4) Prevent cargo and checked baggage from being loaded aboard its airplanes unless handled in accordance with the foreign air carrier's security procedures.
                (c) Law enforcement support. Each security program required by § 1546.101(d) must include the procedures used to comply with the applicable requirements of § 1546.209 regarding law enforcement officers.
                (d) Availability. Each foreign air carrier required to adopt and use a security program under this part must—
                (1) Restrict the distribution, disclosure, and availability of sensitive security information, as defined in part 1520 of this chapter, to persons with a need to know; and
                (2) Refer requests for sensitive security information by other persons to TSA.

                § 1546.105
                Acceptance of and amendments to the security program.
                (a) Initial acceptance of security program. Unless otherwise authorized by TSA, each foreign air carrier required to have a security program by this part must submit its proposed program to TSA at least 90 days before the intended date of passenger operations. TSA will notify the foreign air carrier of the security program's acceptability, or the need to modify the proposed security program for it to be acceptable under this part, within 30 days after receiving the proposed security program. The foreign air carrier may petition TSA to reconsider the notice to modify the security program within 30 days after receiving a notice to modify.
                (b) Amendment requested by a foreign air carrier. A foreign air carrier may submit a request to TSA to amend its accepted security program as follows:
                (1) The proposed amendment must be filed with the designated official at least 45 calendar days before the date it proposes for the amendment to become effective, unless a shorter period is allowed by the designated official.
                (2) Within 30 calendar days after receiving a proposed amendment, the designated official, in writing, either approves or denies the request to amend.
                (3) An amendment to a foreign air carrier security program may be approved if the designated official determines that safety and the public interest will allow it, and the proposed amendment provides the level of security required under this part.
                (4) Within 45 calendar days after receiving a denial, the foreign air carrier may petition the Administrator to reconsider the denial. A petition for reconsideration must be filed with the designated official.
                (5) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated official either approves the request to amend or transmits the petition, together with any pertinent information, to the Administrator for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within 30 calendar days of receipt by either directing the designated official to approve the amendment, or affirming the denial.
                (6) Any foreign air carrier may submit a group proposal for an amendment that is on behalf of it and other aircraft operators that co-sign the proposal.
                (c) Amendment by TSA. If the safety and the public interest require an amendment, the designated official may amend an accepted security program as follows:
                (1) The designated official notifies the foreign air carrier, in writing, of the proposed amendment, fixing a period of not less than 45 calendar days within which the foreign air carrier may submit written information, views, and arguments on the amendment.

                (2) After considering all relevant material, the designated official notifies the foreign air carrier of any amendment adopted or rescinds the notice. If the amendment is adopted, it becomes effective not less than 30 calendar days after the foreign air carrier receives the notice of amendment, unless the foreign air carrier petitions the Administrator to reconsider no later than 15 calendar days before the effective date of the amendment. The foreign air carrier must send the petition for reconsideration to the designated official. A timely petition for reconsideration stays the effective date of the amendment.
                (3) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated official either amends or withdraws the notice or transmits the petition, together with any pertinent information, to the Administrator for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within 30 calendar days of receipt by either directing the designated official to withdraw or amend the amendment, or by affirming the amendment.
                (d) Emergency amendments. If the designated official finds that there is an emergency requiring immediate action with respect to safety in air transportation or in air commerce that makes procedures in this section contrary to the public interest, the designated official may issue an amendment, without the prior notice and comment procedures in paragraph (c) of this section, effective without stay on the date the foreign air carrier receives notice of it. In such a case, the designated official will incorporate in the notice a brief statement of the reasons and findings for the amendment to be adopted. The foreign air carrier may file a petition for reconsideration under paragraph (c) of this section; however, this does not stay the effectiveness of the emergency amendment.

                Use of X-ray systems.
                (a) TSA authorization required. No foreign air carrier may use any X-ray system within the United States to screen accessible property or checked baggage, unless specifically authorized under its security program. No foreign air carrier may use such a system in a manner contrary to its security program. TSA authorizes foreign air carriers to use X-ray systems for inspecting accessible property or checked baggage under a security program if the foreign air carrier shows that—
                (1) The system meets the standards for cabinet X-ray systems primarily for the inspection of baggage issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and published in 21 CFR 1020.40;
                (2) A program for initial and recurrent training of operators of the system is established, which includes training in radiation safety, the efficient use of X-ray systems, and the identification of weapons, explosives, and incendiaries; and
                (3) The system meets the imaging requirements set forth in its security program using the step wedge specified in American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) Standard F792-88 (Reapproved 1993). This standard is incorporated by reference in paragraph (g) of this section.
                (b) Annual radiation survey. No foreign air carrier may use any X-ray system unless, within the preceding 12 calendar months, a radiation survey is conducted that shows that the system meets the applicable performance standards in 21 CFR 1020.40.
                (c) Radiation survey after installation or moving. No foreign air carrier may use any X-ray system after the system has been installed at a screening point or after the system has been moved unless a radiation survey is conducted which shows that the system meets the applicable performance standards in 21 CFR 1020.40. A radiation survey is not required for an X-ray system that is designed and constructed as a mobile unit and the foreign air carrier shows that it can be moved without altering its performance.
                (d) Defect notice or modification order. No foreign air carrier may use any X-ray system that is not in full compliance with any defect notice or modification order issued for that system by the FDA, unless the FDA has advised TSA that the defect or failure to comply does not create a significant risk of injury, including genetic injury, to any person.
                (e) Signs and inspection of photographic equipment and film. (1) At locations at which a foreign air carrier uses an X-ray system to inspect accessible property the foreign air carrier must ensure that a sign is posted in a conspicuous place at the screening checkpoint.
                (2) At locations at which a foreign air carrier or TSA uses an X-ray system to inspect checked baggage the foreign air carrier must ensure that a sign is posted in a conspicuous place where the foreign air carrier accepts checked baggage.
                (3) The signs required under this paragraph must notify individuals that such items are being inspected by an X-ray and advise them to remove all X-ray, scientific, and high-speed film from accessible property and checked baggage before inspection. This sign must also advise individuals that they may request that an inspection be made of their photographic equipment and film packages without exposure to an X-ray system. If the X-ray system exposes any accessible property or checked baggage to more than one milliroentgen during the inspection, the sign must advise individuals to remove film of all kinds from their articles before inspection.
                (4) If requested by individuals, their photographic equipment and film packages must be inspected without exposure to an X-ray system.
                (f) Radiation survey verification after installation or moving. Each foreign air carrier must maintain at least one copy of the results of the most recent radiation survey conducted under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section and must make it available for inspection upon request by TSA at each of the following locations—
                (1) The foreign air carrier's principal business office; and
                (2) The place where the X-ray system is in operation.
                (g) Incorporation by reference. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard F792-88 (Reapproved 1993), “Standard Practice for Design and Use of Ionizing Radiation Equipment for the Detection of Items Prohibited in Controlled Access Areas,” is approved for incorporation by reference by the Director of the Federal Register pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

                (d) Screener readiness test. Before beginning on-the-job training, a screener trainee must pass the screener readiness test prescribed by TSA.
                (e) On-the-job training and testing. Each screener must complete at least 60 hours of on-the-job training and must pass an on-the-job training test prescribed by TSA. No foreign air carrier may permit a screener trainee to exercise independent judgment as a screener, until the individual passes an on-the-job training test prescribed by TSA.
                (f) Knowledge requirements. Each foreign air carrier must ensure that individuals performing as screeners, screeners-in-charge, and checkpoint security supervisors for the foreign air carrier have knowledge of the provisions of this part, the foreign air carrier's security program, and applicable emergency amendments to the foreign air carrier's security program to the extent necessary to perform their duties.
              
              
                § 1546.409
                Integrity of screener tests.
                (a) Cheating or other unauthorized conduct. (1) Except as authorized by TSA, no person may—
                (i) Copy or intentionally remove a test under this part;
                (ii) Give to another or receive from another any part or copy of that test;
                (iii) Give help on that test to or receive help on that test from any person during the period that the test is being given; or
                (iv) Use any material or aid during the period that the test is being given.
                (2) No person may take any part of that test on behalf of another person.
                (3) No person may cause, assist, or participate intentionally in any act prohibited by this paragraph (a).
                (b) Administering and monitoring screener tests. (1) Each foreign air carrier must notify TSA of the time and location at which it will administer each screener readiness test required under § 1544.405 (d).

                (2) Either TSA or the foreign air carrier must administer and monitor the screener readiness test. Where more than one foreign air carrier or foreign air carrier uses a screening location, TSA may authorize an employee of one or more of the foreign air carriers or foreign air carriers to monitor the test for a trainee who will screen at that location.
                (3) If TSA or a representative of TSA is not available to administer and monitor a screener readiness test, the foreign air carrier must provide a direct employee to administer and monitor the screener readiness test.
                (4) An foreign air carrier employee who administers and monitors a screener readiness test must not be an instructor, screener, screener-in-charge, checkpoint security supervisor, or other screening supervisor. The employee must be familiar with the procedures for administering and monitoring the test and must be capable of observing whether the trainee or others are engaging in cheating or other unauthorized conduct.
              
              
                § 1546.411
                Continuing qualifications of screening personnel.
                (a) Impairment. No individual may perform a screening function if he or she shows evidence of impairment, such as impairment due to illegal drugs, sleep deprivation, medication, or alcohol.
                (b) Training not complete. An individual who has not completed the training required by § 1546.405 may be deployed during the on-the-job portion of training to perform security functions provided that the individual—
                (1) Is closely supervised; and
                (2) Does not make independent judgments as to whether individuals or property may enter a sterile area or aircraft without further inspection.
                (c) Failure of operational test. No foreign air carrier may use an individual to perform a screening function after that individual has failed an operational test related to that function, until that individual has successfully completed the remedial training specified in the foreign air carrier's security program.
                (d) Annual proficiency review. Each individual assigned screening duties shall receive an annual evaluation. The foreign air carrier must conduct and document an annual evaluation of each individual who performs screening functions. An individual who performs screening functions may not continue to perform such functions unless the evaluation demonstrates that the individual—
                (1) Continues to meet all qualifications and standards required to perform a screening function;
                (2) Has a satisfactory record of performance and attention to duty based on the standards and requirements in the foreign air carrier's security program; and
                (3) Demonstrates the current knowledge and skills necessary to courteously, vigilantly, and effectively perform screening functions.

              § 1548.3
              TSA inspection authority.

              (a) Each indirect air carrier must allow TSA, at any time or place, to make any inspections or tests, including copying records, to determine compliance of an airport operator, aircraft operator, foreign air carrier, indirect air carrier, or airport tenant with—
              (1) This subchapter, and any security program approved under this subchapter, and part 1520 of this chapter; and
              (2) 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII, as amended.
              (b) At the request of TSA, each indirect air carrier must provide evidence of compliance with this subchapter and its indirect air carrier security program, including copies of records.
              (c) TSA may enter and be present within areas where security measures required by TSA are carried out without access media or identification media issued or approved by the indirect air carrier, an airport operator, or aircraft operator, in order to inspect or test compliance, or perform other such duties as TSA may direct.
              [67 FR 8382, Feb. 22, 2002, as amended at 71 FR 30513, May 26, 2006]
            
            
              § 1548.5
              Adoption and implementation of the security program.
              (a) Security program required. No indirect air carrier may offer cargo to an aircraft operator operating under a full program or a full all-cargo program specified in part 1544 of this subchapter, or to a foreign air carrier operating under a program under § 1546.101(a), (b), or (e) of this subchapter, unless that indirect air carrier has and carries out an approved security program under this part. Each indirect air carrier that does not currently hold a security program under part 1548, and that offers cargo to an aircraft operator operating under a full all-cargo program or a comparable operation by a foreign air carrier must comply with this section not later than December 1, 2006.
              (b) General requirements. (1) The security program must provide for the security of the aircraft, as well as that of persons and property traveling in air transportation against acts of criminal violence and air piracy and against the introduction into the aircraft of any unauthorized person, and any unauthorized explosive, incendiary, and other destructive substance or item as provided in the indirect air carrier's security program. This requirement applies—
              (i) From the time the indirect air carrier accepts the cargo to the time it transfers the cargo to an entity that is not an employee or agent of the indirect air carrier;
              (ii) While the cargo is stored, en route, or otherwise being handled by an employee or agent of the indirect air carrier; and
              (iii) Regardless of whether the indirect air carrier has or ever had physical possession of the cargo.
              (2) The indirect air carrier must ensure that its employees and agents carry out the requirements of this chapter and the indirect air carrier's security program.
              (c) Content. Each security program under this part must—
              (1) Be designed to prevent or deter the introduction of any unauthorized person, and any unauthorized explosive, incendiary, and other destructive substance or item onto an aircraft.
              (2) Include the procedures and description of the facilities and equipment used to comply with the requirements of §§ 1548.9 and 1548.17 regarding the acceptance and offering of cargo.
              (3) Include the procedures and syllabi used to accomplish the training required under § 1548.11 of persons who accept, handle, transport, or deliver cargo on behalf of the indirect air carrier.
              (d) Availability. Each indirect air carrier having a security program must:
              (1) Maintain an original of the security program at its corporate office.
              (2) Have accessible a complete copy, or the pertinent portions of its security program, or appropriate implementing instructions, at each office where cargo is accepted. An electronic version is adequate.
              (3) Make a copy of the security program available for inspection upon the request of TSA.

              (4) Restrict the distribution, disclosure, and availability of information contained in its security program to persons with a need to know, as described in part 1520 of this chapter.
              
              (5) Refer requests for such information by other persons to TSA.
              [67 FR 8382, Feb. 22, 2002, as amended at 71 FR 30513, May 26, 2006; 71 FR 31964, June 2, 2006]
            
            
              § 1548.7
              Approval, amendment, annual renewal, and withdrawal of approval of the security program.
              (a) Original Application—(1) Application. The applicant must apply for a security program in a form and a manner prescribed by TSA not less than 90 calendar days before the applicant intends to begin operations. The application must be in writing and include:

              (vii) A statement acknowledging and ensuring that each employee and agent of the indirect air carrier, who is subject to training under § 1548.11, will have successfully completed the training outlined in its security program before performing security-related duties.
              (viii) Other information requested by TSA concerning Security Threat Assessments.
              (ix) A statement acknowledging and ensuring that each employee and agent will successfully complete a Security Threat Assessment under § 1548.15 before authorizing the individual to have unescorted access to cargo.
              (2) Approval. TSA will approve the security program by providing the indirect air carrier with the Indirect Air Carrier Standard Security Program and any Security Directive upon determining that—
              (i) The indirect air carrier has met the requirements of this part, its security program, and any applicable Security Directive;
              (ii) The approval of its security program is not contrary to the interests of security and the public interest; and
              (iii) The indirect air carrier has not held a security program that was withdrawn within the previous year, unless otherwise authorized by TSA.
              (3) Commencement of operations. The indirect air carrier may operate under a security program when it meets all requirements, including but not limited to successful completion of training and Security Threat Assessments by relevant personnel.
              (4) Duration of security program. The security program will remain effective until the end of the calendar month one year after the month it was approved.
              (5) Requirement to report changes in information. Each indirect air carrier with an approved security program under this part must notify TSA, in a form and manner approved by TSA, of any changes to the information submitted during its initial application.
              (i) This notification must be submitted to the designated official not later than 30 days after the date the change occurred.
              (ii) Changes included in the requirement of this paragraph include, but are not limited to, changes in the indirect air carrier's contact information, owners, business addresses and locations, and form of business entity.
              (b) Renewal Application. Upon timely submittal of an application for renewal, and unless and until TSA denies the application, the indirect air carrier's approved security program remains in effect.

              (1) Unless otherwise authorized by TSA, each indirect air carrier that has a security program under this part must timely submit to TSA, at least 30 calendar days prior to the first day of the anniversary month of initial approval of its security program, an application for renewal of its security program in a form and a manner approved by TSA.

              (2) The application for renewal must be in writing and include a signed statement that the indirect air carrier has reviewed and ensures the continuing accuracy of the contents of its initial application for a security program, subsequent renewal applications, or other submissions to TSA confirming a change of information and noting the date such applications and submissions were sent to TSA, including the following certification:
              
              
                [Name of indirect air carrier] (hereinafter “the IAC”) has adopted and is currently carrying out a security program in accordance with the Transportation Security Regulations as originally approved on [Insert date of TSA initial approval]. In accordance with TSA regulations, the IAC has notified TSA of any new or changed information required for the IAC's initial security program. If new or changed information is being submitted to TSA as part of this application for reapproval, that information is stated in this filing.
                The IAC understands that intentional falsification of certification to an air carrier or to TSA may be subject to both civil and criminal penalties under 49 CFR 1540 and 1548 and 18 U.S.C. 1001. Failure to notify TSA of any new or changed information required for initial approval of the IAC's security program in a timely fashion and in a form acceptable to TSA may result in withdrawal by TSA of approval of the IAC's security program.
              
              
              (3) TSA will renew approval of the security program if TSA determines that—
              (i) The indirect air carrier has met the requirements of this chapter, its security program, and any Security Directive; and
              (ii) The renewal of its security program is not contrary to the interests of security and the public interest.
              (4) If TSA determines that the indirect air carrier meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, it will renew the indirect air carrier's security program. The security program will remain effective until the end of the calendar month one year after the month it was renewed.
              (c) Amendment requested by an indirect air carrier or applicant. An indirect air carrier or applicant may file a request for an amendment to its security program with the TSA designated official at least 45 calendar days before the date it proposes for the amendment to become effective, unless the designated official allows a shorter period. Any indirect air carrier may submit a group proposal for an amendment that is on behalf of it and other indirect air carriers that co-sign the proposal.
              (1) Within 30 calendar days after receiving a proposed amendment, the designated official, in writing, either approves or denies the request to amend.
              (2) An amendment to an indirect air carrier security program may be approved, if the designated official determines that safety and the public interest will allow it, and if the proposed amendment provides the level of security required under this part.
              (3) Within 30 calendar days after receiving a denial of the proposed amendment, the indirect air carrier may petition TSA to reconsider the denial. A petition for reconsideration must be filed with the designated official.
              (4) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated official either approves the request to amend or transmits the petition, together with any pertinent information, to the TSA for reconsideration. TSA will dispose of the petition within 30 calendar days of receipt by either directing the designated official to approve the amendment or by affirming the denial.
              (d) Amendment by TSA. TSA may amend a security program in the interest of safety and the public interest, as follows:
              (1) TSA notifies the indirect air carrier, in writing, of the proposed amendment, fixing a period of not less than 30 calendar days within which the indirect air carrier may submit written information, views, and arguments on the amendment.

              (2) After considering all relevant material, the designated official notifies the indirect air carrier of any amendment adopted or rescinds the notice of amendment. If the amendment is adopted, it becomes effective not less than 30 calendar days after the indirect air carrier receives the notice of amendment, unless the indirect air carrier disagrees with the proposed amendment and petitions the TSA to reconsider, no later than 15 calendar days before the effective date of the amendment. The indirect air carrier must send the petition for reconsideration to the designated official. A timely petition for reconsideration stays the effective date of the amendment.
              (3) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated official either amends or withdraws the notice of amendment, or transmits the petition, together with any pertinent information, to TSA for reconsideration. TSA disposes of the petition within 30 calendar days of receipt, either by directing the designated official to withdraw or amend the notice of amendment, or by affirming the notice of amendment.
              (e) Emergency Amendments. (1) If TSA finds that there is an emergency requiring immediate action, with respect to aviation security that makes procedures in this section contrary to the public interest, the designated official may issue an emergency amendment, without the prior notice and comment procedures described in paragraph (d) of this section.
              (2) The emergency amendment is effective without stay on the date the indirect air carrier receives notification. TSA will incorporate in the notification a brief statement of the reasons and findings for the emergency amendment to be adopted.
              (3) The indirect air carrier may file a petition for reconsideration with the TSA no later than 15 calendar days after TSA issued the emergency amendment. The indirect air carrier must send the petition for reconsideration to the designated official; however, the filing does not stay the effective date of the emergency amendment.
              (f) Withdrawal of approval of a security program. Section 1540.301 includes procedures for withdrawal of approval of a security program.
              (g) Service of documents for withdrawal of approval of security program proceedings. Service may be accomplished by personal delivery, certified mail, or express courier. Documents served on an indirect air carrier will be served at the indirect air carrier's official place of business as designated in its application for approval or its security program. Documents served on TSA must be served to the address noted in the notice of withdrawal of approval or withdrawal of approval, whichever is applicable.
              (1) Certificate of service. An individual may attach a certificate of service to a document tendered for filing. A certificate of service must consist of a statement, dated and signed by the person filing the document, that the document was personally delivered, served by certified mail on a specific date, or served by express courier on a specific date.
              (2) Date of service. The date of service will be—
              (i) The date of personal delivery;
              (ii) If served by certified mail, the mailing date shown on the certificate of service, the date shown on the postmark, if there is no certificate of service, or other mailing date shown by other evidence if there is no certificate of service or postmark; or
              (iii) If served by express courier, the service date shown on the certificate of service, or by other evidence if there is no certificate of service.
              (h) Extension of time. TSA may grant an extension of time of the limits set forth in this section for good cause shown. An indirect air carrier's request for an extension of time must be in writing and be received by TSA at least 2 days before the due date to be extended. TSA may grant itself an extension of time for good cause.

                (vi) TSA determines that the applicant is qualified to be a certified cargo screening facility.
                (4) Approval and certification. If TSA determines that the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this section are met and the application is approved, TSA will send the applicant a written notice of approval of its security program, and certification to operate as a certified cargo screening facility.
                (5) Commencement of operations. The certified cargo screening facility may operate under a security program when it meets all TSA requirements, including but not limited to an assessment by TSA, successful completion of training, and Security Threat Assessments by relevant personnel.
                (6) Duration of security program. The security program will remain effective until the end of the calendar month three years after the month it was approved or until the program has been surrendered or withdrawn, whichever is earlier.
                (7) Requirement to report changes in information. Each certified cargo screening facility under this part must notify TSA, in a form and manner approved by TSA, of any changes to the information submitted during its initial application.

                (ii) Changes included in the requirement of this paragraph include, but are not limited to, changes in the certified cargo screening facility's contact information, senior manager or representative, business addresses and locations, and form of business facility.
                (iii) If the certified cargo screening facility relocates, TSA will withdraw the existing certification and require the new facility to undergo a validation and certification process.
                (b) Renewal Application. Upon timely submittal of an application for renewal, and unless and until TSA denies the application, the certified cargo screening facility's approved security program remains in effect.
                (1) Unless otherwise authorized by TSA, each certified cargo screening facility must timely submit to TSA, at least 30 calendar days prior to the first day of the 36th anniversary month of initial approval of its security program, an application for renewal of its security program in a form and a manner approved by TSA.
                (2) The certified cargo screening facility must demonstrate that it has successfully undergone a revalidation of its operations by TSA prior to the first day of the 36th anniversary month of initial approval of its security program.

                (3) The application for renewal must be in writing and include a signed statement that the certified cargo screening facility has reviewed and ensures the continuing accuracy of the contents of its initial application for a security program, subsequent renewal applications, or other submissions to TSA confirming a change of information and noting the date such applications and submissions were sent to TSA, including the following certification:
                
                
                  [Name of certified cargo screening facility] (hereinafter “the CCSF”) has adopted and is currently carrying out a security program in accordance with the Transportation Security Regulations as originally approved on [Insert date of TSA initial approval]. In accordance with TSA regulations, the CCSF has notified TSA of any new or changed information required for the CCSF's initial security program. If new or changed information is being submitted to TSA as part of this application for reapproval, that information is stated in this filing.
                  The CCSF understands that intentional falsification of certification to an aircraft operator, foreign air carrier, indirect air carrier, or to TSA may be subject to both civil and criminal penalties under 49 CFR part 1540 and 18 U.S.C. 1001. Failure to notify TSA of any new or changed information required for initial approval of the CCSF's security program in a timely fashion and in a form acceptable to TSA may result in withdrawal by TSA of approval of the CCSF's security program.
                
                
                (4) TSA will renew approval of the security program if TSA determines that—
                (i) The CCSF has met the requirements of this chapter, its security program, and any Security Directive; and
                (ii) The renewal of its security program is not contrary to the interests of security and the public interest.
                (5) If TSA determines that the certified cargo screening facility meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, it will renew the certified cargo screening facility's security program and certification. The security program and certification will remain effective until the end of the calendar month three years after the month it was renewed.
                (c) Amendment requested by a certified cargo screening entity or applicant. A certified cargo screening facility or applicant may file a request for an amendment to its security program with the TSA designated official at least 45 calendar days before the date it proposes for the amendment to become effective, unless the designated official allows a shorter period. Any certified cargo screening facility may submit to TSA a group proposal for an amendment that is on behalf of it and other certified cargo screening facilities that co-sign the proposal.
                (1) Within 30 calendar days after receiving a proposed amendment, the designated official, in writing, either approves or denies the request to amend.
                (2) TSA may approve an amendment to a certified cargo screening facility's security program, if the TSA designated official determines that safety and the public interest will allow it, and if the proposed amendment provides the level of security required under this part.
                (3) Within 30 calendar days after receiving a denial of the proposed amendment, the certified cargo screening facility may petition TSA to reconsider the denial. The CCSF must file the Petition for Reconsideration with the designated official.
                (4) Upon receipt of a Petition for Reconsideration, the designated official either approves the request to amend or transmits the petition, together with any pertinent information, to TSA for reconsideration. TSA will dispose of the petition within 30 calendar days of receipt by either directing the designated official to approve the amendment or by affirming the denial.
                (d) Amendment by TSA. TSA may amend a security program in the interest of safety and the public interest, as follows:
                (1) TSA notifies the certified cargo screening facility, in writing, of the proposed amendment, fixing a period of not less than 30 calendar days within which the certified cargo screening facility may submit written information, views, and arguments on the amendment.
                (2) After considering all relevant material, the designated official notifies the certified cargo screening facility of any amendment adopted or rescinds the notice of amendment. If the amendment is adopted, it becomes effective not less than 30 calendar days after the certified cargo screening facility receives the notice of amendment, unless the certified cargo screening facility disagrees with the proposed amendment and petitions the TSA to reconsider, no later than 15 calendar days before the effective date of the amendment. The certified cargo screening facility must send the petition for reconsideration to the designated official. A timely Petition for Reconsideration stays the effective date of the amendment.
                (3) Upon receipt of a Petition for Reconsideration, the designated official either amends or withdraws the notice of amendment, or transmits the Petition, together with any pertinent information, to TSA for reconsideration. TSA disposes of the Petition within 30 calendar days of receipt, either by directing the designated official to withdraw or amend the notice of amendment, or by affirming the notice of amendment.
                (e) Emergency amendments. (1) If TSA finds that there is an emergency requiring immediate action, with respect to aviation security that makes procedures in this section contrary to the public interest, the designated official may issue an emergency amendment, without the prior notice and comment procedures described in paragraph (d) of this section.
                (2) The emergency amendment is effective without stay on the date the certified cargo screening facility receives notification. TSA will incorporate in the notification a brief statement of the reasons and findings for the emergency amendment to be adopted.
                (3) The certified cargo screening facility may file a Petition for Reconsideration with the TSA no later than 15 calendar days after TSA issued the emergency amendment. The certified cargo screening facility must send the Petition for Reconsideration to the designated official; however, the filing does not stay the effective date of the emergency amendment.

                Security Measures.
                (a) Applicability of this section. This section applies to part 145 certificated repair stations located—
                (1) On airport. On an air operations area or security identification display area of an airport covered by an airport security program under 49 CFR part 1542 in the United States, or on the security restricted area of any commensurate airport outside the United States regulated by a government entity; or
                (2) Adjacent to an airport. Adjacent to an area of the airport described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section if there is an access point between the repair station and the airport of sufficient size to allow the movement of large aircraft between the repair station and the area described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
                (b) Security Measures. Each repair station described in paragraph (a) of this section must carry out the following measures:
                (1) Provide TSA with the name and means of contact on a 24-hour basis of a person or persons designated by the repair station with responsibility for—
                (i) Compliance with the regulations in this part;
                (ii) Serving as the primary point(s) of contact for security-related activities and communications with TSA;

                (2) When not attended, prevent the unauthorized operation of all large aircraft capable of flight, by using one or more of the means listed in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section. In these examples, a key, if used, must only be available to an individual authorized by the repair station who has successfully undergone a check as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
                (i) Block the path of the aircraft such that it cannot be moved, and control the vehicle key if a vehicle is used to block the path.
                (ii) Park the aircraft in a locked hangar and control the key to the hangar.
                (iii) Move stairs away from the aircraft and shut and, if feasible, lock all cabin and/or cargo doors, and control the key.
                (iv) Other means approved in writing by TSA.
                (3) Verify background information of those individuals who are designated as the TSA point(s) of contact and those who have access to any keys or other means used to prevent the operation of large aircraft described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section by one or more of the following means:
                (i) Verify an employee's employment history. The repair station obtains the employee's employment history for the most recent five year period or the time period since the employee's 18th birthday, whichever period is shorter. The repair station verifies the employee's employment history for the most recent 5-year period via telephone, email, or in writing. If the information is verified telephonically, the repair station must record the date of the communication and with whom the information was verified. If there is a gap in employment of six months or longer, without a satisfactory explanation of the gap, employment history is not verified. The repair station must retain employment history verification records for at least 180 days after the individual's employment ends. The repair station must maintain these records electronically or in hardcopy, and provide them to TSA upon request.
                (ii) Confirm an employee holds an airman certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration.
                (iii) Confirm an employee of a repair station located within the United States has obtained a security threat assessment or comparable security threat assessment pursuant to part 1540, subpart C of this chapter, such as by holding a SIDA identification media issued by an airport operator that holds a complete program under 49 CFR part 1542.

                (iv) Confirm an employee of a repair station located outside the United States has successfully completed a security threat assessment commensurate to a security threat assessment described in part 1540, subpart C of this chapter.

                Security Directives.
                (a) General. When TSA determines that additional security measures are necessary to respond to a threat assessment or to a specific threat against civil aviation, TSA issues a Security Directive setting forth mandatory measures.
                (b) Compliance. Each repair station must comply with each Security Directive TSA issues to the repair station within the time prescribed. Each repair station that receives a Security Directive must—
                (1) Acknowledge receipt of the Security Directive as directed by TSA;
                (2) Specify the method by which security measures have been or will be implemented to meet the effective date; and
                (3) Notify TSA to obtain approval of alternative measures if the repair station is unable to implement the measures in the Security Directive.
                (c) Availability. Each repair station that receives a Security Directive and each person who receives information from a Security Directive must—
                (1) Restrict the availability of the Security Directive and the information contained in the document to persons who have an operational need to know; and
                (2) Refuse to release the Security Directive or the information contained in the document to persons other than those who have an operational need to know without the prior written consent of TSA.
                (d) Comments. Each repair station that receives a Security Directive may comment on the Security Directive by submitting data, views, or arguments in writing to TSA. TSA may amend the Security Directive based on comments received. Submission of a comment does not delay the effective date of the Security Directive.

TSA may share information you provide with law enforcement or intelligence agencies or others under its published system of records notice. For more on TSA Privacy policies, or to view the system of records notice and the privacy impact assessment, please see TSA's Web site at www.tsa.gov.
                  
                
              
              
                § 1560.105
                Denial of transport or sterile area access; designation for enhanced screening.
                (a) Applicability. (1) This section applies to each covered aircraft operator beginning on the date that TSA assumes the watch list matching function for the passengers and non-traveling individuals to whom that covered aircraft operator issues a boarding pass or other authorization to enter a sterile area. TSA will provide prior written notification to the covered aircraft operator no later than 60 days before the date on which it will assume the watch list matching function from that covered aircraft operator.
                
                (2) Prior to the date that TSA assumes the watch list matching function from a covered aircraft operator, the covered aircraft operator must comply with existing watch list matching procedures for passengers and non-traveling individuals, including denial of transport or sterile area access or designation for enhanced screening for individuals identified by the covered aircraft operator or TSA.
                (b) Watch list matching results. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a covered aircraft operator must not issue a boarding pass or other authorization to enter a sterile area to a passenger or a non-traveling individual, and must not allow that individual to board an aircraft or enter a sterile area, until TSA informs the covered aircraft operator of the results of watch list matching for that passenger or non-traveling individual, in response to the covered aircraft operator's most recent SFPD submission for that passenger or non-traveling individual.
                (1) Denial of boarding pass. If TSA sends a covered aircraft operator a boarding pass printing result that says the passenger or non-traveling individual must be placed on inhibited status, the covered aircraft operator must not issue a boarding pass or other authorization to enter a sterile area to that individual and must not allow that individual to board an aircraft or enter a sterile area.
                (2) Selection for enhanced screening. If TSA sends a covered aircraft operator a boarding pass printing result that says the passenger has been selected for enhanced screening at a security checkpoint, the covered aircraft operator may issue a boarding pass to that individual and must identify the individual for enhanced screening, in accordance with procedures approved by TSA. The covered aircraft operator must place a code on the boarding pass that meets the requirements described in the Consolidated User Guide. If TSA sends a covered aircraft operator a boarding pass printing result that says the non-traveling individual has been selected for enhanced screening at a security checkpoint, the covered aircraft operator must not issue an authorization to enter a sterile area to that individual.
                (3) Cleared for boarding or entry into a sterile area. If TSA sends a covered aircraft operator a boarding pass printing result that instructs a covered aircraft operator that a passenger or non-traveling individual is cleared, the covered aircraft operator may issue a boarding pass or other authorization to enter a sterile area to that individual, unless required under another TSA requirement to identify the passenger or non-traveling individual for enhanced screening or to deny entry into the sterile area. The covered aircraft operator must place a code on the boarding pass or authorization to enter the sterile area that meets the requirements described in the Consolidated User Guide.
                (4) Override by a covered aircraft operator. No covered aircraft operator may override a TSA boarding pass printing result that instructs a covered aircraft operator to place a passenger or non-traveling individual in an inhibited status or to identify a passenger or non-traveling individual for enhanced screening, unless explicitly authorized by TSA to do so.
                (5) Updated SFPD from covered aircraft operator. When a covered aircraft operator sends updated SFPD to TSA under § 1560.101(d) for a passenger or non-traveling individual for whom TSA has already issued a boarding pass printing result, all previous TSA results concerning the passenger or non-traveling individual are voided. The covered aircraft operator may not issue a boarding pass or grant authorization to enter a sterile area until it receives an updated result from TSA authorizing the issuance of a boarding pass or authorization to enter a sterile area. Upon receiving an updated result from TSA, the covered aircraft operator must acknowledge receipt of the updated result, comply with the updated result, and disregard all previous boarding pass printing results.
                (6) Updated boarding pass printing results from TSA. After TSA sends a covered aircraft operator a result under paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this section, TSA may receive additional information concerning the passenger or non-traveling individual and may send an updated boarding pass printing result concerning that passenger or non-traveling individual to the covered aircraft operator. Upon receiving an updated boarding pass printing result from TSA, the covered aircraft operator must acknowledge receipt of the updated result, comply with the updated result, and disregard all previous results.
                (7) Boarding pass issuance for covered flights to or overflying the United States. Covered aircraft operators may permit another aircraft operator to issue a boarding pass for a covered flight departing from a foreign location to the United States or overflying the United States without regard to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section provided that—
                (i) Before allowing the individual to board the aircraft for a covered flight, the covered aircraft operator confirms that it has received a boarding pass printing result from DHS for individuals who are issued boarding passes under paragraph (b)(7) of this section;
                (ii) Before allowing the individual to board an aircraft for a covered flight, the covered aircraft operator applies the measures in its security program to prevent an individual for whom DHS has returned an inhibited status boarding pass printing result under paragraph (b)(1) of this section from boarding the aircraft; and
                (iii) The covered aircraft operator applies the measures in its security program, as provided in 49 CFR part 1544, subpart B or 49 CFR part 1546, subpart B, to ensure that an individual for whom DHS returns a Selectee result under paragraph (b)(2) of this section undergoes enhanced screening pursuant to the covered aircraft operator's security program prior to that individual boarding the aircraft.
                (c) Request for identification—(1) In general. If TSA has not informed the covered aircraft operator of the results of watch list matching for an individual by the time the individual attempts to check in, or informs the covered aircraft operator that an individual has been placed in inhibited status, the aircraft operator must request from the individual a verifying identity document pursuant to procedures in its security program., as provided in 49 CFR part 1544, subpart B or 49 CFR part 1546, subpart B. The individual must present a verifying identity document to the covered aircraft operator at the airport.
                (2) Transmission of Updated Secure Flight Passenger Data. Upon reviewing a passenger's verifying identity document, the covered aircraft operator must transmit the SFPD elements from the individual's verifying identity document to TSA.
                (3) Provision of Passenger Resolution Information. If requested by TSA, the covered aircraft operator must also provide to TSA the individual's Passenger Resolution Information as specified by TSA.
                (4) Exception for minors. If a covered aircraft operator is required to obtain information from an individual's verifying identity document under this paragraph (c), and the individual is younger than 18 years of age and does not have a verifying identity document, TSA may, on a case-by-case basis, authorize the minor or an adult accompanying the minor to state the individual's full name and date of birth in lieu of providing a verifying identity document.
                (d) Failure to obtain identification. If a passenger or non-traveling individual does not present a verifying identity document when requested by the covered aircraft operator, in order to comply with paragraph (c) of this section, the covered aircraft operator must not issue a boarding pass or give authorization to enter a sterile area to that individual and must not allow that individual to board an aircraft or enter a sterile area, unless otherwise authorized by TSA.

              Subpart A—Procedures and General Standards
              
                § 1572.1
                Applicability.
                This part establishes regulations for credentialing and security threat assessments for certain maritime and land transportation workers.
              
              
                § 1572.3
                Scope.
                This part applies to—
                (a) State agencies responsible for issuing a hazardous materials endorsement (HME); and
                (b) An applicant who—
                (1) Is qualified to hold a commercial driver's license under 49 CFR parts 383 and 384, and is applying to obtain, renew, or transfer an HME; or
                (2) Is applying to obtain or renew a TWIC in accordance with 33 CFR parts 104 through 106 or 46 CFR part 10; is a commercial driver licensed in Canada or Mexico and is applying for a TWIC to transport hazardous materials in accordance with 49 CFR 1572.201; or other individuals approved by TSA.
                [72 FR 3595, Jan. 25, 2007, as amended at 72 FR 55048, Sept. 28, 2007]
              
              
                § 1572.5
                Standards for security threat assessments.
                (a) Standards. TSA determines that an applicant poses a security threat warranting denial of an HME or TWIC, if—
                (1) The applicant has a disqualifying criminal offense described in 49 CFR 1572.103;
                (2) The applicant does not meet the immigration status requirements described in 49 CFR 1572.105;
                (3) TSA conducts the analyses described in 49 CFR 1572.107 and determines that the applicant poses a security threat; or
                (4) The applicant has been adjudicated as lacking mental capacity or committed to a mental health facility, as described in 49 CFR 1572.109.
                (b) Immediate Revocation/Invalidation. TSA may invalidate a TWIC or direct a State to revoke an HME immediately, if TSA determines during the security threat assessment that an applicant poses an immediate threat to transportation security, national security, or of terrorism.
                (c) Violation of FMCSA Standards. The regulations of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) provide that an applicant is disqualified from operating a commercial motor vehicle for specified periods, if he or she has an offense that is listed in the FMCSA rules at 49 CFR 383.51. If records indicate that an applicant has committed an offense that would disqualify the applicant from operating a commercial motor vehicle under 49 CFR 383.51, TSA will not issue a Determination of No Security Threat until the State or the FMCSA determine that the applicant is not disqualified under that section.
                (d) Waiver. In accordance with the requirements of § 1515.7, applicants may apply for a waiver of certain security threat assessment standards.
                (e) Comparability of Other Security Threat Assessment Standards. TSA may determine that security threat assessments conducted by other governmental agencies are comparable to the threat assessment described in this part, which TSA conducts for HME and TWIC applicants.
                (1) In making a comparability determination, TSA will consider—
                (i) The minimum standards used for the security threat assessment;
                (ii) The frequency of the threat assessment;
                (iii) The date of the most recent threat assessment; and
                (iv) Whether the threat assessment includes biometric identification and a biometric credential.

                (2) To apply for a comparability determination, the agency seeking the determination must contact the Assistant Program Manager, Attn: Federal Agency Comparability Check, Hazmat Threat Assessment Program, Transportation Security Administration, 601 South 12th Street, Arlington, VA 20598-6019.
                (3) TSA will notify the public when a comparability determination is made.
                (4) An applicant, who has completed a security threat assessment that is determined to be comparable under this section to the threat assessment described in this part, must complete the enrollment process and provide biometric information to obtain a TWIC, if the applicant seeks unescorted access to a secure area of a vessel or facility. The applicant must pay the fee listed in 49 CFR 1572.503 for information collection/credential issuance.
                (5) TSA has determined that the security threat assessment for an HME under this part is comparable to the security threat assessment for TWIC.
                (6) TSA has determined that the security threat assessment for a FAST card, under the Free and Secure Trade program administered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, is comparable to the security threat assessment described in this part.

                § 1572.9
                Applicant information required for HME security threat assessment.
                An applicant must supply the information required in this section, in a form acceptable to TSA, when applying to obtain or renew an HME. When applying to transfer an HME from one State to another, 49 CFR 1572.13(e) applies.
                (a) Except as provided in (a)(12) through (16), the applicant must provide the following identifying information:

                (10) Name, telephone number, facsimile number, and address of the applicant's current employer(s), if the applicant's work for the employer(s) requires an HME. If the applicant's current employer is the U.S. military service, include branch of the service.
                (11) Whether the applicant is applying to obtain, renew, or transfer an HME or for a waiver.
                (12) Social security number. Providing the social security number is voluntary; however, failure to provide it will delay and may prevent completion of the threat assessment.
                (13) Passport number. This information is voluntary and may expedite the adjudication process for applicants who are U.S. citizens born abroad.
                (14) Department of State Consular Report of Birth Abroad. This information is voluntary and may expedite the adjudication process for applicants who are U.S. citizens born abroad.

                  Privacy Act Notice: Authority: The authority for collecting this information is 49 U.S.C. 114, 40113, and 5103a. Purpose: This information is needed to verify your identity and to conduct a security threat assessment to evaluate your suitability for a hazardous materials endorsement for a commercial driver's license. Furnishing this information, including your SSN or alien registration number, is voluntary; however, failure to provide it will delay and may prevent completion of your security threat assessment. Routine Uses: Routine uses of this information include disclosure to the FBI to retrieve your criminal history record; to TSA contractors or other agents who are providing services relating to the security threat assessments; to appropriate governmental agencies for licensing, law enforcement, or security purposes, or in the interests of national security; and to foreign and international governmental authorities in accordance with law and international agreement.
                
                

                (d) The applicant must certify and date receipt the following statement, immediately before the signature line:
                
                

                  The information I have provided on this application is true, complete, and correct, to the best of my knowledge and belief, and is provided in good faith. I understand that a knowing and willful false statement, or an omission of a material fact on this application can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both (See section 1001 of Title 18 United States Code), and may be grounds for denial of a hazardous materials endorsement.
                
                

                (e) The applicant must certify the following statement in writing:
                
                
                  I acknowledge that if the Transportation Security Administration determines that I pose a security threat, my employer, as listed on this application, may be notified. If TSA or other law enforcement agency becomes aware of an imminent threat to a maritime facility or vessel, TSA may provide limited information necessary to reduce the risk of injury or damage to the facility or vessel.

                (16) Whether the applicant currently holds a federal security clearance, and if so, the date of and agency for which the clearance was performed.

I understand that a knowing and willful false statement, or an omission of a material fact on this application, can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both (see section 1001 of Title 18 United States Code), and may be grounds for denial of a Transportation Worker Identification Credential.
                
                
                

                (g) The applicant must certify the following statement in writing:

                (4) If the applicant does not appeal the Initial Determination of Threat Assessment or Initial Determination of Threat Assessment and Immediate Revocation, TSA serves a Final Determination of Threat Assessment on the FMSC and in the case of a mariner, on the Coast Guard, and the applicant's employer where appropriate.
                (5) If the applicant appeals the Initial Determination of Threat Assessment or the Initial Determination of Threat Assessment and Immediate Revocation, the procedures in 49 CFR 1515.5 or 1515.9 apply.
                (6) Applicants who do not meet certain standards in 49 CFR 1572.103, 1572.105, or 1572.109 may seek a waiver in accordance with 49 CFR 1515.7.
              
              
                § 1572.23
                TWIC expiration.
                (a) A TWIC expires five years after the date it was issued at the end of the calendar day, except as follows:
                (1) The TWIC was issued based on a determination that the applicant completed a comparable threat assessment. If issued pursuant to a comparable threat assessment, the TWIC expires five years from the date on the credential associated with the comparable threat assessment.

                (2) The applicant is in a lawful nonimmigrant status category listed in 1572.105(a)(7), and the status expires, the employer terminates the employment relationship with the applicant, or the applicant otherwise ceases working for the employer. Under any of these circumstances, TSA deems the TWIC to have expired regardless of the expiration date on the face of the TWIC.
                (b) TSA may issue a TWIC for a term less than five years to match the expiration of a visa.

                (2) The railroad carrier must ensure that it, its offeror, and each of its crew members have been determined to be a known railroad carrier, known offeror, and known train crew member, respectively. If any has not been so determined, the railroad carrier must submit the following information to Transport Canada:

                (4) TSA will update and maintain the list of known railroad carriers, offerors, and train crew members and forward the list to CBP.
                (5) Once included on the list, the railroad carriers, offerors, and train crew members need not obtain prior approval for future transport of explosives under this section.
                (d) TSA checks. TSA may periodically check the data on the railroad carriers, offerors, and train crew members to confirm their continued eligibility, and may remove from the list any that TSA determines is not known or is a threat to security.
                (e) At the border. (1) Train crew members who are not U.S. nationals or lawful permanent resident aliens. Upon arrival at a point designated by CBP for inspection of trains crossing into the United States, the train crew members of a train transporting explosives must provide sufficient identification to CBP to enable that agency to determine if each crew member is on the list of known train crew members maintained by TSA.
                (2) Train crew members who are U.S. nationals or lawful permanent resident aliens. If CBP cannot verify that the crew member is on the list and the crew member is a U.S. national or lawful permanent resident alien, the crew member may be cleared by CBP upon providing—
                (i) A valid U.S. passport; or
                (ii) One or more other document(s), including a form of U.S. Federal or state Government-issued identification with photograph, acceptable to CBP.

                § 1572.403
                Procedures for collection by States.
                This section describes the procedures that a State, which collects fingerprints and applicant information under 49 CFR part 1572; and the procedures an individual who applies to obtain or renew an HME, for a CDL in that State, must follow for collection and transmission of the Threat Assessment Fee and the FBI Fee.
                (a) Imposition of fees. (1) An individual who applies to obtain or renew an HME, or the individuals' employer, must remit to the State the Threat Assessment Fee and the FBI Fee, in a form and manner approved by TSA and the State, when the individual submits the application for the HME to the State.

                (2) TSA shall publish the Threat Assessment Fee described in this subpart for an individual who applies to obtain or renew and HME as a Notice in the Federal Register. TSA reviews the amount of the fees periodically, at least once every two years, to determine the current cost of conducting security threat assessments. Fee amounts and any necessary revisions to the fee amounts shall be determined by current costs, using a method of analysis consistent with widely accepted accounting principles and practices, and calculated in accordance with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 9701 and other applicable Federal law.
                (3) The FBI Fee required for the FBI to process fingerprint identification records and name checks required under 49 CFR part 1572 is determined by the FBI under Public Law 101-515. If the FBI amends this fee, the individual must remit the amended fee.
                (b) Collection of fees. (1) A State must collect the Threat Assessment Fee and FBI Fee, when an individual submits an application to the State to obtain or renew an HME.
                (2) Once TSA receives an application from a State for a security threat assessment under 49 CFR part 1572, the State is liable for the Threat Assessment Fee.
                (3) Nothing in this subpart prevents a State from collecting any other fees that a State may impose on an individual who applies to obtain or renew an HME.
                (c) Handling of fees. (1) A State must safeguard all Threat Assessment Fees, from the time of collection until remittance to TSA.
                
                (2) All Threat Assessment Fees are held in trust by a State for the beneficial interest of the United States in paying for the costs of conducting the security threat assessment, required by 49 U.S.C. 5103a and 49 CFR part 1572. A State holds neither legal nor equitable interest in the Threat Assessment Fees, except for the right to retain any accrued interest on the principal amounts collected pursuant to this section.
                (3) A State must account for Threat Assessment Fees separately, but may commingle such fees with other sources of revenue.
                (d) Remittance of fees. (1) TSA will generate and provide an invoice to a State on a monthly basis. The invoice will indicate the total fee dollars (number of applicants times the Threat Assessment Fee) that are due for the month.
                (2) A State must remit to TSA full payment for the invoice, within 30 days after TSA sends the invoice.
                (3) TSA accepts Threat Assessment Fees only from a State, not from an individual applicant for an HME.
                (4) A State may retain any interest that accrues on the principal amounts collected between the date of collection and the date the Threat Assessment Fee is remitted to TSA, in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
                (5) A State may not retain any portion of the Threat Assessment Fee to offset the costs of collecting, handling, or remitting Threat Assessment Fees.
                (6) Threat Assessment Fees, remitted to TSA by a State, must be in U.S. currency, drawn on a U.S. bank, and made payable to the “Transportation Security Administration.”
                (7) Threat Assessment Fees must be remitted by check, money order, wire, or any other payment method acceptable to TSA.
                (8) TSA will not issue any refunds of Threat Assessment Fees.
                (9) If a State does not remit the Threat Assessment Fees for any month, TSA may decline to process any HME applications from that State.

                (2) TSA shall publish the Information Collection Fee and Threat Assessment Fee described in this subpart for an individual who applies to obtain or renew an HME as a Notice in the Federal Register. TSA reviews the amount of the fees periodically, at least once every two years, to determine the current cost of conducting security threat assessments. Fee amounts and any necessary revisions to the fee amounts shall be determined by current costs, using a method of analysis consistent with widely accepted accounting principles and practices, and calculated in accordance with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 9701 and other applicable Federal law.
                (3) The FBI Fee required for the FBI to process fingerprint identification records and name checks required under 49 CFR part 1572 is determined by the FBI under Public Law 101-515. If the FBI amends this fee, TSA or its agent, will collect the amended fee.
                (b) Collection of fees. A TSA agent will collect the fees required under this section, when an individual submits an application to the TSA agent, in accordance with 49 CFR part 1572.
                (c) Remittance of fees. (1) Fees required under this section, which are remitted to a TSA agent, must be made in U.S. currency, drawn on a U.S. bank, and made payable to the “Transportation Security Administration.”

                (2) Fees required under this section must be remitted by check, money order, wire, or any other payment method acceptable to TSA.
                
                (3) TSA will not issue any refunds of fees required under this section.
                (4) Applications, submitted in accordance with 49 CFR part 1572, will be processed only upon receipt of all applicable fees under this section.
