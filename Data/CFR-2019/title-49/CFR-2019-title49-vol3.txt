      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.

        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
        There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

              § 178.1
              Purpose and scope.
              This part prescribes the manufacturing and testing specifications for packaging and containers used for the transportation of hazardous materials in commerce.
              [Amdt. 178-40, 42 FR 2689, Jan. 13, 1977. Redesignated by Amdt. 178-97, 55 FR 52715, Dec. 21, 1990]
            
            
              § 178.2
              Applicability and responsibility.
              (a) Applicability. (1) The requirements of this part apply to packagings manufactured—
              (i) To a DOT specification, regardless of country of manufacture; or
              (ii) To a UN standard, for packagings manufactured within the United States. For UN standard packagings manufactured outside the United States, see § 173.24(d)(2) of this subchapter. For UN standard packagings for which standards are not prescribed in this part, see § 178.3(b).
              (2) A manufacturer of a packaging subject to the requirements of this part is primarily responsible for compliance with the requirements of this part. However, any person who performs a function prescribed in this part shall perform that function in accordance with this part.
              (b) Specification markings. When this part requires that a packaging be marked with a DOT specification or UN standard marking, marking of the packaging with the appropriate DOT or UN markings is the certification that—
              (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, all requirements of the DOT specification or UN standard, including performance tests, are met; and
              (2) All functions performed by, or on behalf of, the person whose name or symbol appears as part of the marking conform to requirements specified in this part.
              (c) Notification. (1) Except as specifically provided in §§ 178.337-18, 178.338-19, and 178.345-15 of this part, the manufacturer or other person certifying compliance with the requirements of this part, and each subsequent distributor of that packaging must:
              (i) Notify each person to whom that packaging is transferred—
              (A) Of all requirements in this part not met at the time of transfer, and

              (B) With information specifying the type(s) and dimensions of the closures, including gaskets and any other components needed to ensure that the packaging is capable of successfully passing the applicable performance tests. This information must include any procedures to be followed, including closure instructions for inner packagings and receptacles, to effectively assemble and close the packaging for the purpose of preventing leakage in transportation. Closure instructions must provide for a consistent and repeatable means of closure that is sufficient to ensure the packaging is closed in the same manner as it was tested. For packagings sold or represented as being in conformance with the requirements of this subchapter applicable to transportation by aircraft, this information must include relevant guidance to ensure that the packaging, as prepared for transportation, will withstand the pressure differential requirements in § 173.27 of this subchapter.
              
              (ii) Retain copies of each written notification for at least one year from date of issuance; and
              (iii) Make copies of all written notifications available for inspection by a representative of the Department.
              (2) The notification required in accordance with this paragraph (c) may be in writing or by electronic means, including e-mailed transmission or transmission on a CD or similar device. If a manufacturer or subsequent distributor of the packaging utilizes electronic means to make the required notifications, the notification must be specific to the packaging in question and must be in a form that can be printed in hard copy by the person receiving the notification.
              (d) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a packaging not conforming to the applicable specifications or standards in this part may not be marked to indicate such conformance.
              (e) Definitions. For the purpose of this part—
              
                Manufacturer means the person whose name and address or symbol appears as part of the specification markings required by this part or, for a packaging marked with the symbol of an approval agency, the person on whose behalf the approval agency certifies the packaging.
              
                Specification markings mean the packaging identification markings required by this part including, where applicable, the name and address or symbol of the packaging manufacturer or approval agency.

              (f) No packaging may be manufactured or marked to a packaging specification that was in effect on September 30, 1991, and that was removed from this part 178 by a rule published in the Federal Register on December 21, 1990 and effective October 1, 1991.

              § 178.3
              Marking of packagings.
              (a) Each packaging represented as manufactured to a DOT specification or a UN standard must be marked on a non-removable component of the packaging with specification markings conforming to the applicable specification, and with the following:
              (1) In an unobstructed area, with letters, and numerals identifying the standards or specification (e.g. UN 1A1, DOT 4B240ET, etc.).
              (2) Unless otherwise specified in this part, the name and address or symbol of the packaging manufacturer or the person certifying compliance with a UN standard. Symbols, if used, must be registered with the Associate Administrator. Unless authorized in writing by the holder of the symbol, symbols must represent either the packaging manufacturer or the approval agency responsible for providing the most recent certification for the packaging through design certification testing or periodic retesting, as applicable. Duplicative symbols are not authorized.
              (3) The markings must be stamped, embossed, burned, printed or otherwise marked on the packaging to provide adequate accessibility, permanency, contrast, and legibility so as to be readily apparent and understood.
              (4) Unless otherwise specified, letters and numerals must be at least 12.0 mm (0.47 inches) in height except that for packagings of less than or equal to 30 L (7.9 gallons) capacity for liquids or 30 kg (66 pounds) capacity for solids the height must be at least 6.0 mm (0.2 inches). For packagings having a capacity of 5 L (1 gallon) or 5 kg (11 pounds) or less, letters and numerals must be of an appropriate size.
              (5) For packages with a gross mass of more than 30 kg (66 pounds), the markings or a duplicate thereof must appear on the top or on a side of the packaging.

              (b) A UN standard packaging for which the UN standard is set forth in this part may be marked with the United Nations symbol and other specification markings only if it fully conforms to the requirements of this part. A UN standard packaging for which the UN standard is not set forth in this part may be marked with the United Nations symbol and other specification markings for that standard as provided in the ICAO Technical Instructions or the IMDG Code subject to the following conditions:
              (1) The U.S. manufacturer must establish that the packaging conforms to the applicable provisions of the ICAO Technical Instructions (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter) or the IMDG Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), respectively.
              (2) If an indication of the name of the manufacturer or other identification of the packaging as specified by the competent authority is required, the name and address or symbol of the manufacturer or the approval agency certifying compliance with the UN standard must be entered. Symbols, if used, must be registered with the Associate Administrator.
              (3) The letters “USA” must be used to indicate the State authorizing the allocation of the specification marks if the packaging is manufactured in the United States.
              (c) Where a packaging conforms to more than one UN standard or DOT specification, the packaging may bear more than one marking, provided the packaging meets all the requirements of each standard or specification. Where more than one marking appears on a packaging, each marking must appear in its entirety.
              (d) No person may mark or otherwise certify a packaging or container as meeting the requirements of a manufacturing special permit unless that person is the holder of or a party to that special permit, an agent of the holder or party for the purpose of marking or certification, or a third party tester.

One group must be conditioned at 38 °C (100 °F) for 26 weeks, the second group for 100 hours at 50 °C (122 °F) and the third group for 18 hours at 55 °C (131 °F), prior to performing the drop test. The closure, or sealing component of the container, must not be protected during the test. The orientation of the test container at drop must be statistically random, but direct impact on the valve or valve closure must be avoided.
                (2) Criteria for passing the drop test: The containers must not break or leak.
                (b) Design qualification testing must be completed if the design is manufactured with a new mold or if there is any change in the properties of the material of construction.

Otherwise, ten (10) additional containers of each container design produced may be selected at random and subjected to the test. These containers shall be complete with ends assembled. Should any of the containers thus tested fail, the entire lot must be rejected. All containers constituting a lot shall be of like material, size, design construction, finish, and quality.
                (c) Marking. By means of printing, lithographing, embossing, or stamping, each container must be marked:
                (1) DOT-2Q2.
                (2) With the name or symbol of the person making the mark. A symbol, if used, must be registered with the Associate Administrator.

              Subpart C—Specifications for Cylinders
              
                § 178.35
                General requirements for specification cylinders.
                (a) Compliance. Compliance with the requirements of this subpart is required in all details.
                (b) Inspections and analyses. Chemical analyses and tests required by this subchapter must be made within the United States, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Associate Administrator, in accordance with subpart I of part 107 of this chapter. Inspections and verification must be performed by—
                (1) An independent inspection agency approved in writing by the Associate Administrator, in accordance with subpart I of part 107 of this chapter; or
                (2) For DOT Specifications 3B, 3BN, 3E, 4B, 4BA, 4D (water capacity less than 1,100 cubic inches), 4B240ET, 4AA480, 4L, 8, 8AL, 4BW, 39 (marked service pressure 900 p.s.i.g. or lower) and 4E manufactured in the United States, a competent inspector of the manufacturer.
                (c) Duties of inspector. The inspector shall determine that each cylinder made is in conformance with the applicable specification. Except as otherwise specified in the applicable specification, the inspector shall perform the following:
                (1) Inspect all material and reject any not meeting applicable requirements. For cylinders made by the billet-piercing process, billets must be inspected and shown to be free from pipe, cracks, excessive segregation and other injurious defects after parting or, when applicable, after nick and cold break.
                (2) Verify the material of construction meets the requirements of the applicable specification by—
                (i) Making a chemical analysis of each heat of material;
                (ii) Obtaining a certified chemical analysis from the material manufacturer for each heat of material (a ladle analysis is acceptable); or
                (iii) If an analysis is not provided for each heat of material by the material manufacturer, by making a check analysis of a sample from each coil, sheet, or tube.
                (3) Verify compliance of cylinders with the applicable specification by—
                (i) Verifying identification of material is proper;
                (ii) Inspecting the inside of the cylinder before closing in ends;
                (iii) Verifying that the heat treatment is proper;

                (iv) Obtaining samples for all tests and check chemical analyses (Note: Recommended locations for test specimens taken from welded cylinders are depicted in Figures 1 through 5 in Appendix C to this subpart for the specific construction design.);
                (v) Witnessing all tests;
                (vi) Verify threads by gauge;
                (vii) Reporting volumetric capacity and tare weight (see report form) and minimum thickness of wall noted; and
                (viii) Verifying that each cylinder is marked in accordance with the applicable specification.
                (4) Inspector's report. Prepare a report containing, at a minimum, the applicable information listed in CGA C-11 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). Any additional information or markings that are required by the applicable specification must be shown on the test report. The signature of the inspector on the reports certifies that the processes of manufacture and heat treatment of cylinders were observed and found satisfactory. The inspector must furnish the completed test reports required by this subpart to the maker of the cylinder and, upon request, to the purchaser. The test report must be retained by the inspector for fifteen years from the original test date of the cylinder.
                (d) Defects and attachments. Cylinders must conform to the following:
                (1) A cylinder may not be constructed of material with seams, cracks or laminations, or other injurious defects.
                (2) Metal attachments to cylinders must have rounded or chamfered corners or must be protected in such a manner as to prevent the likelihood of causing puncture or damage to other hazardous materials packages. This requirement applies to anything temporarily or permanently attached to the cylinder, such as metal skids.
                (e) Safety devices. Pressure relief devices and protection for valves, safety devices, and other connections, if applied, must be as required or authorized by the appropriate specification, and as required in § 173.301 of this subchapter.
                (f) Markings. Markings on a DOT Specification cylinder must conform to applicable requirements.
                (1) Each cylinder must be marked with the following information:
                (i) The DOT specification marking must appear first, followed immediately by the service pressure. For example, DOT-3A1800.
                (ii) The serial number must be placed just below or immediately following the DOT specification marking.
                (iii) A symbol (letters) must be placed just below, immediately before or following the serial number. Other variations in sequence of markings are authorized only when necessitated by a lack of space. The symbol and numbers must be those of the manufacturer. The symbol must be registered with the Associate Administrator; duplications are not authorized.

                (iv) The inspector's official mark and date of test (such as 5-95 for May 1995) must be placed near the serial number. This information must be placed so that dates of subsequent tests can be easily added. An example of the markings prescribed in this paragraph (f)(1) is as follows:
                
                
                  DOT-3A1800
                  1234
                  XY
                  AB 5-95
                
                
                Or;
                
                
                  DOT-3A1800-1234-XY
                  AB 5-95
                  
                  Where:
                  
                  DOT-3A = specification number
                  1800 = service pressure
                  1234 = serial number
                  XY = symbol of manufacturer
                  AB = inspector's mark
                  5-95 = date of test
                
                
                (2) Additional required marking must be applied to the cylinder as follows:
                (i) The word “spun” or “plug” must be placed near the DOT specification marking when an end closure in the finished cylinder has been welded by the spinning process, or effected by plugging.
                (ii) As prescribed in specification 3HT (§ 178.44) or 3T (§ 178.45), if applicable.
                (3) Marking exceptions. A DOT 3E cylinder is not required to be marked with an inspector's mark or a serial number.
                (4) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable specification, the markings on each cylinder must be stamped plainly and permanently on the shoulder, top head, or neck.
                (5) The size of each marking must be at least 0.25 inch or as space permits.
                (6) Other markings are authorized provided they are made in low stress areas other than the side wall and are not of a size and depth that will create harmful stress concentrations. Such marks may not conflict with any DOT required markings.
                (7) Marking exceptions. A DOT 8 or 8AL cylinder is not required to be marked with the service pressure.
                (g) Manufacturer's reports. At or before the time of delivery to the purchaser, the cylinder manufacturer must have all completed certification documents listed in CGA C-11. The manufacturer of the cylinders must retain the reports required by this subpart for 15 years from the original test date of the cylinder.

                § 178.36
                Specification 3A and 3AX seamless steel cylinders.
                (a) Type size and service pressure. In addition to the requirements of § 178.35, cylinders must conform to the following:
                (1) A DOT-3A cylinder is a seamless steel cylinder with a water capacity (nominal) not over 1,000 pounds and a service pressure of at least 150 psig.
                (2) A DOT-3AX is a seamless steel cylinder with a water capacity not less than 1,000 pounds and a service pressure of at least 500 psig, conforming to the following requirements:
                (i) Assuming the cylinder is to be supported horizontally at its two ends only and to be uniformly loaded over its entire length consisting of the weight per unit of length of the straight cylindrical portion filled with water and compressed to the specified test pressure; the sum of two times the maximum tensile stress in the bottom fibers due to bending, plus that in the same fibers (longitudinal stress), due to hydrostatic test may not exceed 80 percent of the minimum yield strength of the steel at such maximum stress. Wall thickness must be increased when necessary to meet the requirement.

                (ii) To calculate the maximum longitudinal tensile stress due to bending, the following formula must be used:
                
                S = Mc/I
                

                (iii) To calculate the maximum longitudinal tensile stress due to hydrostatic test pressure, the following formula must be used:
                
                S = A1 P/A2
                
                
                
                  where:
                  
                  S = tensile stress—p.s.i.;
                  M = bending moment-inch pounds—(wl2)/8;
                  w = weight per inch of cylinder filled with water;
                  l = length of cylinder-inches;
                  c = radius (D)/(2) of cylinder-inches;
                  I = moment of inertia—0.04909 (D4−d4) inches fourth;
                  D = outside diameter-inches;
                  d = inside diameter-inches;
                  A1 = internal area in cross section of cylinder-square inches;
                  A2 = area of metal in cross section of cylinder-square inches;
                  P = hydrostatic test pressure-psig.
                
                
                (b) Steel. Open-hearth or electric steel of uniform quality must be used. Content percent may not exceed the following: Carbon, 0.55; phosphorous, 0.045; sulphur, 0.050.
                (c) Identification of material. Material must be identified by any suitable method, except that plates and billets for hot-drawn cylinders must be marked with the heat number.
                (d) Manufacture. Cylinders must be manufactured using equipment and processes adequate to ensure that each cylinder produced conforms to the requirements of this subpart. No fissure or other defect is permitted that is likely to weaken the finished cylinder appreciably. A reasonably smooth and uniform surface finish is required. If not originally free from such defects, the surface may be machined or otherwise treated to eliminate these defects. The thickness of the bottoms of cylinders welded or formed by spinning is, under no condition, to be less than two times the minimum wall thickness of the cylindrical shell; such bottom thicknesses must be measured within an area bounded by a line representing the points of contact between the cylinder and floor when the cylinder is in a vertical position.
                (e) Welding or brazing. Welding or brazing for any purpose whatsoever is prohibited except as follows:
                (1) Welding or brazing is authorized for the attachment of neckrings and footrings which are non-pressure parts and only to the tops and bottoms of cylinders having a service pressure of 500 psig or less. Cylinders, neckrings, and footrings must be made of weldable steel, the carbon content of which may not exceed 0.25 percent except in the case of 4130X steel which may be used with proper welding procedures.
                (2) As permitted in paragraph (d) of this section.
                (3) Cylinders used solely in anhydrous ammonia service may have a 1/2 inch diameter bar welded within their concave bottoms.
                (f) Wall thickness. For cylinders with service pressure less than 900 psig, the wall stress may not exceed 24,000 psig. A minimum wall thickness of 0.100 inch is required for any cylinder over 5 inches outside diameter. Wall stress calculation must be made by using the following formula:
                
                S = [P(1.3D2 + 0.4d2)]/(D2−d2)
                
                
                  
                  Where:
                  
                  S = wall stress in psi;
                  P = minimum test pressure prescribed for water jacket test or 450 psig whichever is the greater;
                  D = outside diameter in inches;
                  d = inside diameter in inches.
                
                
                (g) Heat treatment. The completed cylinder must be uniformly and properly heat-treated prior to tests.
                (h) Openings in cylinders and connections (valves, fuse plugs, etc.) for those openings. Threads are required on openings.
                (1) Threads must be clean cut, even, without checks, and to gauge.
                (2) Taper threads, when used, must be of length not less than as specified for American Standard taper pipe threads.
                (3) Straight threads having at least 6 engaged threads are authorized. Straight threads must have a tight fit and calculated shear strength of at least 10 times the test pressure of the cylinder. Gaskets, adequate to prevent leakage, are required.
                (i) Hydrostatic test. Each cylinder must successfully withstand a hydrostatic test, as follows:
                (1) The test must be by water-jacket, or other suitable methods, operated so as to obtain accurate data. The pressure gauge must permit reading to an accuracy of 1 percent. The expansion gauge must permit reading of total expansion to an accuracy of either 1 percent or 0.1 cubic centimeter.
                (2) Pressure must be maintained for at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure applied after heat-treatment and previous to the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure. If, due to failure of the test apparatus the test pressure cannot be maintained the test may be repeated at a pressure increased by 10 percent or 100 psig, whichever is the lower.
                (3) Permanent, volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of the total volumetric expansion at test pressure.
                (4) Each cylinder must be tested to at least 5/3 times service pressure.
                (j) Flattening test. A flattening test must be performed on one cylinder taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less, by placing the cylinder between wedge shaped knife edges having a 60° included angle, rounded to 1/2-inch radius. The longitudinal axis of the cylinder must be at a 90-degree angle to knife edges during the test. For lots of 30 or less, flattening tests are authorized to be made on a ring at least 8 inches long cut from each cylinder and subjected to same heat treatment as the finished cylinder.
                (k) Physical test. A physical test must be conducted to determine yield strength, tensile strength, elongation, and reduction of area of material as follows:
                (1) The test is required on 2 specimens cut from 1 cylinder taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less. For lots of 30 or less, physical tests are authorized to be made on a ring at least 8 inches long cut from each cylinder and subjected to same heat treatment as the finished cylinder.
                (2) Specimens must conform to the following:
                (i) Gauge length of 8 inches with a width of not over 11/2 inches, a gauge length of 2 inches with a width of not over 11/2 inches, or a gauge length of at least 24 times thickness with width not over 6 times thickness is authorized when cylinder wall is not over 3/16 inch thick.
                (ii) The specimen, exclusive of grip ends, may not be flattened. Grip ends may be flattened to within 1 inch of each end of the reduced section.
                (iii) When size of cylinder does not permit securing straight specimens, the specimens may be taken in any location or direction and may be straightened or flattened cold, by pressure only, not by blows. When specimens are so taken and prepared, the inspector's report must show in connection with record of physical tests detailed information in regard to such specimens.
                (iv) Heating of a specimen for any purpose is not authorized.
                (3) The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length. The following conditions apply:

                (i) The yield strength must be determined by either the “offset” method or the “extension under load” method as prescribed in ASTM E 8 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                
                (ii) In using the “extension under load” method, the total strain (or “extension under load”) corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2-percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length. Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 30,000,000. In the event of controversy the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset.
                (iii) For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psig and the strain indicator reading must be set at the calculated corresponding strain.
                (iv) Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed 1/8 inch per minute during yield strength determination.
                (l) Acceptable results for physical and flattening tests. Either of the following is an acceptable result:
                (1) An elongation at least 40 percent for a 2-inch gauge length or at least 20 percent in other cases and yield strength not over 73 percent of tensile strength. In this instance, the flattening test is not required.
                (2) An elongation at least 20 percent for a 2-inch gauge length or 10 percent in other cases and a yield strength not over 73 percent of tensile strength. In this instance, the flattening test is required, without cracking, to 6 times the wall thickness.
                (m) Leakage test. All spun cylinders and plugged cylinders must be tested for leakage by gas or air pressure after the bottom has been cleaned and is free from all moisture subject to the following conditions and limitations:
                (1) Pressure, approximately the same as but no less than service pressure, must be applied to one side of the finished bottom over an area of at least 1/16 of the total area of the bottom but not less than 3/4 inch in diameter, including the closure, for at least 1 minute, during which time the other side of the bottom exposed to pressure must be covered with water and closely examined for indications of leakage. Except as provided in paragraph (n) of this section, a cylinder that is leaking must be rejected.
                (2) A spun cylinder is one in which an end closure in the finished cylinder has been welded by the spinning process.
                (3) A plugged cylinder is one in which a permanent closure in the bottom of a finished cylinder has been effected by a plug.
                (4) As a safety precaution, if the manufacturer elects to make this test before the hydrostatic test, the manufacturer should design the test apparatus so that the pressure is applied to the smallest area practicable, around the point of closure, and so as to use the smallest possible volume of air or gas.
                (n) Rejected cylinders. Reheat treatment is authorized for rejected cylinders. Subsequent thereto, cylinders must pass all prescribed tests to be acceptable. Repair by welding or spinning is not authorized. Spun cylinders rejected under the provisions of paragraph (m) of this section may be removed from the spun cylinder category by drilling to remove defective material, tapping and plugging.

                (b) Authorized steel. Open-hearth, basic oxygen, or electric steel of uniform quality must be used. A heat of steel made under the specifications in table 1 of this paragraph (b), check chemical analysis of which is slightly out of the specified range, is acceptable, if satisfactory in all other respects, provided the tolerances shown in table 2 of this paragraph (b) are not exceeded. When a carbon-boron steel is used, a hardenability test must be performed on the first and last ingot of each heat of steel. The results of this test must be recorded on the Record of Chemical Analysis of Material for Cylinders required by § 178.35. This hardness test must be made 5/16-inch from the quenched end of the Jominy quench bar and the hardness must be at least Rc 33 and no more than Rc 53. The following chemical analyses are authorized:

                (c) Identification of material. Material must be identified by any suitable method except that plates and billets for hot-drawn cylinders must be marked with the heat number.
                (d) Manufacture. Cylinders must be manufactured using equipment and processes adequate to ensure that each cylinder produced conforms to the requirements of this subpart. No fissure or other defects is permitted that is likely to weaken the finished cylinder appreciably. A reasonably smooth and uniform surface finish is required. If not originally free from such defects, the surface may be machined or otherwise treated to eliminate these defects. The thickness of the bottoms of cylinders welded or formed by spinning is, under no condition, to be less than two times the minimum wall thickness of the cylindrical shell; such bottom thicknesses must be measured within an area bounded by a line representing the points of contact between the cylinder and floor when the cylinder is in a vertical position.
                (e) Welding or brazing. Welding or brazing for any purpose whatsoever is prohibited except as follows:
                (1) Welding or brazing is authorized for the attachment of neckrings and footrings which are non-pressure parts, and only to the tops and bottoms of cylinders having a service pressure of 500 psig or less. Cylinders, neckrings, and footrings must be made of weldable steel, the carbon content of which may not exceed 0.25 percent except in the case of 4130X steel which may be used with proper welding procedure.
                (2) As permitted in paragraph (d) of this section.
                (f) Wall thickness. The thickness of each cylinder must conform to the following:
                (1) For cylinders with a service pressure of less than 900 psig, the wall stress may not exceed 24,000 psi. A minimum wall thickness of 0.100 inch is required for any cylinder with an outside diameter of over 5 inches.
                (2) For cylinders with service pressure of 900 psig or more the minimum wall must be such that the wall stress at the minimum specified test pressure may not exceed 67 percent of the minimum tensile strength of the steel as determined from the physical tests required in paragraphs (k) and (l) of this section and must be not over 70,000 psi.
                (3) Calculation must be made by the formula:
                
                S = [P(1.3D2 + 0.4d2)]/(D2−d2)
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  S = wall stress in psi;
                  P = minimum test pressure prescribed for water jacket test or 450 psig whichever is the greater;
                  D = outside diameter in inches;
                  d = inside diameter in inches.
                
                
                (g) Heat treatment. The completed cylinders must be uniformly and properly heat treated prior to tests. Heat treatment of cylinders of the authorized analyses must be as follows:
                (1) All cylinders must be quenched by oil, or other suitable medium except as provided in paragraph (g)(5) of this section.
                (2) The steel temperature on quenching must be that recommended for the steel analysis, but may not exceed 1750 °F.

                (3) All steels must be tempered at a temperature most suitable for that steel.
                
                (4) The minimum tempering temperature may not be less than 1000 °F except as noted in paragraph (g)(6) of this section.
                (5) Steel 4130X may be normalized at a temperature of 1650 °F instead of being quenched and cylinders so normalized need not be tempered.
                (6) Intermediate manganese steels may be tempered at temperatures not less than 1150 °F., and after heat treating each cylinder must be submitted to a magnetic test to detect the presence of quenching cracks. Cracked cylinders must be rejected and destroyed.
                (7) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g)(6) of this section, all cylinders, if water quenched or quenched with a liquid producing a cooling rate in excess of 80 percent of the cooling rate of water, must be inspected by the magnetic particle, dye penetrant or ultrasonic method to detect the presence of quenching cracks. Any cylinder designed to the requirements for specification 3AA and found to have a quenching crack must be rejected and may not be requalified. Cylinders designed to the requirements for specification 3AAX and found to have cracks must have cracks removed to sound metal by mechanical means. Such specification 3AAX cylinders will be acceptable if the repaired area is subsequently examined to assure no defect, and it is determined that design thickness requirements are met.
                (h) Openings in cylinders and connections (valves, fuse plugs, etc.) for those openings. Threads are required on openings.
                (1) Threads must be clean cut, even, without checks, and to gauge.
                (2) Taper threads, when used, must be of a length not less than as specified for American Standard taper pipe threads.
                (3) Straight threads having at least 6 engaged threads are authorized. Straight threads must have a tight fit and a calculated shear strength of at least 10 times the test pressure of the cylinder. Gaskets, adequate to prevent leakage, are required.
                (i) Hydrostatic test. Each cylinder must successfully withstand a hydrostatic test as follows:
                (1) The test must be by water-jacket, or other suitable method, operated so as to obtain accurate data. The pressure gauge must permit reading to an accuracy of 1 percent. The expansion gauge must permit reading of total expansion to an accuracy of either 1 percent or 0.1 cubic centimeter.
                (2) Pressure must be maintained for at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure applied after heat-treatment and previous to the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure. If, due to failure of the test apparatus, the test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be repeated at a pressure increased by 10 percent or 100 psig, whichever is the lower.
                (3) Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of total volumetric expansion at test pressure.
                (4) Each cylinder must be tested to at least 5/3 times the service pressure.
                (j) Flattening test. A flattening test must be performed on one cylinder taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less, by placing the cylinder between wedge shaped knife edges having a 60° included angle, rounded to 1/2-inch radius. The longitudinal axis of the cylinder must be at a 90-degree angle to knife edges during the test. For lots of 30 or less, flattening tests are authorized to be made on a ring at least 8 inches long cut from each cylinder and subjected to the same heat treatment as the finished cylinder. Cylinders may be subjected to a bend test in lieu of the flattening test. Two bend test specimens must be taken in accordance with ISO 9809-1 or ASTM E 290 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), and must be subjected to the bend test specified therein.
                (k) Physical test. A physical test must be conducted to determine yield strength, tensile strength, elongation, and reduction of area of material as follows:
                (1) The test is required on 2 specimens cut from 1 cylinder taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less. For lots of 30 or less, physical tests are authorized to be made on a ring at least 8 inches long cut from each cylinder and subjected to the same heat treatment as the finished cylinder.
                (2) Specimens must conform to the following:
                
                (i) Gauge length of 8 inches with a width of not over 11/2 inches, a gauge length of 2 inches with a width of not over 11/2 inches, or a gauge length of at least 24 times the thickness with width not over 6 times thickness when the thickness of the cylinder wall is not over 3/16 inch.
                (ii) The specimen, exclusive of grip ends, may not be flattened. Grip ends may be flattened to within 1 inch of each end of the reduced section.
                (iii) When size of cylinder does not permit securing straight specimens, the specimens may be taken in any location or direction and may be straightened or flattened cold, by pressure only, not by blows. When specimens are so taken and prepared, the inspector's report must show in connection with record of physical tests detailed information in regard to such specimens.
                (iv) Heating of a specimen for any purpose is not authorized.
                (3) The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length. The following conditions apply:
                (i) The yield strength must be determined by either the “offset” method or the “extension under load” method as prescribed in ASTM E 8 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (ii) In using the “extension under load” method, the total strain (or “extension under load”) corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length. Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 30,000,000. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset.
                (iii) For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psi, the strain indicator reading being set at the calculated corresponding strain.
                (iv) Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed 1/8 inch per minute during yield strength determination.
                (l) Acceptable results for physical, flattening and bend tests. An acceptable result for physical and flattening tests is elongation of at least 20 percent for 2 inches of gauge length or at least 10 percent in other cases. Flattening is required, without cracking, to 6 times the wall thickness of the cylinder. An acceptable result for the alternative bend test is no crack when the cylinder is bent inward around the mandrel until the interior edges are not further apart than the diameter of the mandrel.
                (m) Leakage test. All spun cylinders and plugged cylinders must be tested for leakage by gas or air pressure after the bottom has been cleaned and is free from all moisture. Pressure, approximately the same as but no less than the service pressure, must be applied to one side of the finished bottom over an area of at least 1/16 of the total area of the bottom but not less than 3/4 inch in diameter, including the closure, for at least one minute, during which time the other side of the bottom exposed to pressure must be covered with water and closely examined for indications of leakage. Except as provided in paragraph (n) of this section, a cylinder must be rejected if there is any leaking.
                (1) A spun cylinder is one in which an end closure in the finished cylinder has been welded by the spinning process.
                (2) A plugged cylinder is one in which a permanent closure in the bottom of a finished cylinder has been effected by a plug.
                (3) As a safety precaution, if the manufacturer elects to make this test before the hydrostatic test, the manufacturer should design the test apparatus so that the pressure is applied to the smallest area practicable, around the point of closure, and so as to use the smallest possible volume of air or gas.
                (n) Rejected cylinders. Reheat treatment is authorized for rejected cylinders. Subsequent thereto, cylinders must pass all prescribed tests to be acceptable. Repair by welding or spinning is not authorized. Spun cylinders rejected under the provision of paragraph (m) of this section may be removed from the spun cylinder category by drilling to remove defective material, tapping and plugging.

                (3) Other cylinders must be examined under pressure of at least 3,000 psig and not to exceed 4,500 psig and show no defect. Cylinders tested at a pressure in excess of 3,600 psig must burst at a pressure higher than 7,500 psig when tested as specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. The pressure must be maintained for at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to ensure complete examination.
                (g) Leakage test. All spun cylinders and plugged cylinders must be tested for leakage by gas or air pressure after the bottom has been cleaned and is free from all moisture subject to the following conditions and limitations:
                (1) A pressure, approximately the same as but not less than the service pressure, must be applied to one side of the finished bottom over an area of at least 1/16 of the total area of the bottom but not less than 3/4 inch in diameter, including the closure, for at least one minute, during which time the other side of the bottom exposed to pressure must be covered with water and closely examined for indications of leakage. Accept as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, a cylinder must be rejected if there is any leakage.
                (2) A spun cylinder is one in which an end closure in the finished cylinder has been welded by the spinning process.
                (3) A plugged cylinder is one in which a permanent closure in the bottom of a finished cylinder has been effected by a plug.
                (4) As a safety precaution, if the manufacturer elects to make this test before the hydrostatic test, the manufacturer shall design the test apparatus so that the pressure is applied to the smallest area practicable, around the point of closure, and so as to use the smallest possible volume of air or gas.
                (h) Rejected cylinders. Reheat treatment is authorized for rejected cylinders. Subsequent thereto, cylinders must pass all prescribed tests to be acceptable. Repair by welding or spinning is not authorized. Spun cylinders rejected under the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section may be removed from the spun cylinder category by drilling to remove defective material, tapping and plugging.
                (i) Marking. Markings required by § 178.35 must be stamped plainly and permanently on the shoulder, top head, neck or sidewall of each cylinder.

                (c) Identification of material. Material must be identified by any suitable method. Steel stamping of heat identifications may not be made in any area which will eventually become the side wall of the cylinder. Depth of stamping may not encroach upon the minimum prescribed wall thickness of the cylinder.
                (d) Manufacture. Cylinders must be manufactured using equipment and processes adequate to ensure that each cylinder produced conforms to the requirements of this subpart. No fissure or other defect is permitted that is likely to weaken the finished container appreciably. The general surface finish may not exceed a roughness of 250 RMS. Individual irregularities such as draw marks, scratches, pits, etc., should be held to a minimum consistent with good high stress pressure vessel manufacturing practices. If the cylinder is not originally free of such defects or does not meet the finish requirements, the surface may be machined or otherwise treated to eliminate these defects. The point of closure of cylinders closed by spinning may not be less than two times the prescribed wall thickness of the cylindrical shell. The cylinder end contour must be hemispherical or ellipsoidal with a ratio of major-to-minor axis not exceeding two to one and with the concave side to pressure.
                (e) Welding or brazing. Welding or brazing for any purpose whatsoever is prohibited, except that welding by spinning is permitted to close the bottom of spun cylinders. Machining or grinding to produce proper surface finish at point of closure is required.
                (f) Wall thickness. (1) Minimum wall thickness for any cylinder must be 0.050 inch. The minimum wall thickness must be such that the wall stress at the minimum specified test pressure may not exceed 75 percent of the minimum tensile strength of the steel as determined from the physical tests required in paragraph (m) of this section and may not be over 105,000 psi.
                (2) Calculations must be made by the formula:
                
                S = [P(1.3D2 + 0.4d2)] / (D2 − d2)
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  S = Wall stress in psi;
                  P = Minimum test pressure prescribed for water jacket test;
                  D = Outside diameter in inches;
                  d = Inside diameter in inches.
                
                
                (3) Wall thickness of hemispherical bottoms only permitted to 90 percent of minimum wall thickness of cylinder sidewall but may not be less than 0.050 inch. In all other cases, thickness to be no less than prescribed minimum wall.
                (g) Heat treatment. The completed cylinders must be uniformly and properly heated prior to tests. Heat treatment of the cylinders of the authorized analysis must be as follows:
                (1) All cylinders must be quenched by oil, or other suitable medium.
                (2) The steel temperature on quenching must be that recommended for the steel analysis, but may not exceed 1750 °F.
                (3) The steel must be tempered at a temperature most suitable for the particular steel analysis but not less than 850 °F.
                (4) All cylinders must be inspected by the magnetic particle or dye penetrant method to detect the presence of quenching cracks. Any cylinder found to have a quenching crack must be rejected and may not be requalified.
                (h) Openings in cylinders and connections (valves, fuse plugs, etc.) for those openings. Threads conforming to the following are required on openings:
                (1) Threads must be clean cut, even, without cracks, and to gauge.

                (2) Taper threads, when used, must be of length not less than as specified for National Gas Tapered Thread (NGT) as required by American Standard Compressed Gas Cylinder Valve Outlet and Inlet Connections.
                (3) Straight threads having at least 6 engaged threads are authorized. Straight threads must have a tight fit and a calculated shear stress of at least 10 times the test pressure of the cylinder. Gaskets, adequate to prevent leakage, are required.
                (i) Hydrostatic test. Each cylinder must withstand a hydrostatic test, as follows:
                (1) The test must be by water-jacket, or other suitable method, operated so as to obtain accurate data. Pressure gauge must permit reading to an accuracy of 1 percent. The expansion gauge must permit reading of total expansion to an accuracy either of 1 percent of 0.1 cubic centimeter.
                (2) Pressure must be maintained for at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure applied after heat treatment and previous to the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure. If, due to failure of the test apparatus, the test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be repeated at a pressure increased by 10 percent or 100 psig, which ever is the lower.
                (3) Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of total volumetric expansion at test pressure.
                (4) Each cylinder must be tested to at least 5/3 times service pressure.
                (j) Cycling tests. Prior to the initial shipment of any specific cylinder design, cyclic pressurization tests must have been performed on at least three representative samples without failure as follows:
                (1) Pressurization must be performed hydrostatically between approximately zero psig and the service pressure at a rate not in excess of 10 cycles per minute. Adequate recording instrumentation must be provided if equipment is to be left unattended for periods of time.
                (2) Tests prescribed in paragraph (j)(1) of this section must be repeated on one random sample out of each lot of cylinders. The cylinder may then be subjected to a burst test.
                (3) A lot is defined as a group of cylinders fabricated from the same heat of steel, manufactured by the same process and heat treated in the same equipment under the same conditions of time, temperature, and atmosphere, and may not exceed a quantity of 200 cylinders.
                (4) All cylinders used in cycling tests must be destroyed.
                (k) Burst test. One cylinder taken at random out of each lot of cylinders must be hydrostatically tested to destruction.
                (l) Flattening test. A flattening test must be performed on one cylinder taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less, by placing the cylinder between wedge shaped knife edges having a 60° included angle, rounded to 1/2-inch radius. The longitudinal axis of the cylinder must be at a 90-degree angle to knife edges during the test. For lots of 30 or less, flattening tests are authorized to be made on a ring at least 8 inches long cut from each cylinder and subjected to same heat treatment as the finished cylinder.
                (m) Physical tests. A physical test must be conducted to determine yield strength, tensile strength, elongation, and reduction of area of material, as follows:
                (1) Test is required on 2 specimens cut from 1 cylinder taken at random out of each lot of cylinders.
                (2) Specimens must conform to the following:
                (i) A gauge length of at least 24 times the thickness with a width not over six times the thickness. The specimen, exclusive of grip ends, may not be flattened. Grip ends may be flattened to within one inch of each end of the reduced section. When size of cylinder does not permit securing straight specimens, the specimens may be taken in any location or direction and may be straightened or flattened cold by pressure only, not by blows. When specimens are so taken and prepared, the inspector's report must show in connection with the record of physical tests detailed information in regard to such specimens.
                (ii) Heating of a specimen for any purpose is not authorized.

                (3) The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length.
                
                (i) The yield strength must be determined by either the “offset” method or the “extension under load” method as prescribed in ASTM E 8 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (ii) In using the “extension under load” method, the total strain (or “extension under load”) corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length. Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 30,000,000. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset.
                (iii) For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psi, the strain indicator reading being set at the calculated corresponding strain.
                (iv) Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed 1/8 inch per minute during yield strength determination.
                (n) Magnetic particle inspection. Inspection must be performed on the inside of each container before closing and externally on each finished container after heat treatment. Evidence of discontinuities, which in the opinion of a qualified inspector may appreciably weaken or decrease the durability of the cylinder, must be cause for rejection.
                (o) Leakage test. All spun cylinders and plugged cylinders must be tested for leakage by dry gas or dry air pressure after the bottom has been cleaned and is free from all moisture, subject to the following conditions and limitations:
                (1) Pressure, approximately the same as but not less than service pressure, must be applied to one side of the finished bottom over an area of at least 1/16 of the total area of the bottom but not less than 3/4 inch in diameter, including the closure, for at least one minute, during which time the other side of the bottom exposed to pressure must be covered with water and closely examined for indications of leakage. Except as provided in paragraph (q) of this section, a cylinder must be rejected if there is leakage.
                (2) A spun cylinder is one in which an end closure in the finished cylinder has been welded by the spinning process.
                (3) A plugged cylinder is one in which a permanent closure in the bottom of a finished cylinder has been effected by a plug.
                (4) As a safety precaution, if the manufacturer elects to make this test before the hydrostatic test, the manufacturer should design the test apparatus so that the pressure is applied to the smallest area practicable, around the point of closure, and so as to use the smallest possible volume of air or gas.
                (p) Acceptable results of tests. Results of the flattening test, physical tests, burst test, and cycling test must conform to the following:
                (1) Flattening required without cracking to ten times the wall thickness of the cylinder.
                (2) Physical tests:
                (i) An elongation of at least 6 percent for a gauge length of 24 times the wall thickness.
                (ii) The tensile strength may not exceed 165,000 p.s.i.
                (3) The burst pressure must be at least 4/3 times the test pressure.
                (4) Cycling-at least 10,000 pressurizations.
                (q) Rejected cylinders. Reheat treatment is authorized for rejected cylinders. Subsequent thereto, cylinders must pass all prescribed tests to be acceptable. Repair by welding or spinning is not authorized. For each cylinder subjected to reheat treatment during original manufacture, sidewall measurements must be made to verify that the minimum sidewall thickness meets specification requirements after the final heat treatment.
                (r) Marking. (1) Cylinders must be marked by low stress type steel stamping in an area and to a depth which will insure that the wall thickness measured from the root of the stamping to the interior surface is equal to or greater than the minimum prescribed wall thickness. Stamping must be permanent and legible. Stamping on side wall not authorized.
                
                (2) The rejection elastic expansion (REE), in cubic cm (cc), must be marked on the cylinder near the date of test. The REE for a cylinder is 1.05 times its original elastic expansion.
                (3) Name plates are authorized, provided that they can be permanently and securely attached to the cylinder. Attachment by either brazing or welding is not permitted. Attachment by soldering is permitted provided steel temperature does not exceed 500 °F.
                (s) Inspector's report. In addition to the requirements of § 178.35, the inspector's report must indicate the rejection elastic expansion (REE), in cubic cm (cc).

                (1) A heat of steel made under the specifications in the table in this paragraph (b), the ladle analysis of which is slightly out of the specified range, is acceptable if satisfactory in all other aspects. However, the check analysis tolerances shown in the table in this paragraph (b) may not be exceeded except as approved by the Department.
                (2) Material with seams, cracks, laminations, or other injurious defects is not permitted.
                (3) Material used must be identified by any suitable method.
                (c) Manufacture. General manufacturing requirements are as follows:
                (1) Surface finish must be uniform and reasonably smooth.
                (2) Inside surfaces must be clean, dry, and free of loose particles.
                (3) No defect of any kind is permitted if it is likely to weaken a finished cylinder.
                (4) If the cylinder surface is not originally free from the defects, the surface may be machined or otherwise treated to eliminate these defects provided the minimum wall thickness is maintained.
                (5) Welding or brazing on a cylinder is not permitted.
                (d) Wall thickness. The minimum wall thickness must be such that the wall stress at the minimum specified test pressure does not exceed 67 percent of the minimum tensile strength of the steel as determined by the physical tests required in paragraphs (j) and (k) of this section. A wall stress of more than 90,500 p.s.i. is not permitted. The minimum wall thickness for any cylinder may not be less than 0.225 inch.

                (1) Calculation of the stress for cylinders must be made by the following formula:
                
                S = [P(1.3D2 + 0.4d2)] / (D2 − d2)
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  S = Wall stress in psi;
                  P = Minimum test pressure, at least 5/3 service pressure;
                  D = Outside diameter in inches;
                  d = Inside diameter in inches.
                
                

                (2) Each cylinder must meet the following additional requirement which assumes a cylinder horizontally supported at its two ends and uniformly loaded over its entire length. This load consists of the weight per inch of length of the straight cylindrical portion filled with water compressed to the specified test pressure. The wall thickness must be increased when necessary to meet this additional requirement:
                (i) The sum of two times the maximum tensile stress in the bottom fibers due to bending (see paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section), plus the maximum tensile stress in the same fibers due to hydrostatic testing (see paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section) may not exceed 80 percent of the minimum yield strength of the steel at this maximum stress.

                (ii) The following formula must be used to calculate the maximum tensile stress due to bending:
                
                S = Mc / I
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  S = Tensile stress in psi;
                  M = Bending moment in inch-pounds (wl2/8);
                  I = Moment of inertia—0.04909 (D4−d4) in inches fourth;
                  c = Radius (D/2) of cylinder in inches;
                  w = Weight per inch of cylinder filled with water;
                  l = Length of cylinder in inches;
                  D = Outside diameter in inches;
                  d = Inside diameter in inches.
                
                

                (iii) The following formula must be used to calculate the maximum longitudinal tensile stress due to hydrostatic test pressure:
                
                S = A1 P / A2
                
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  S = Tensile stress in psi;
                  A1 = Internal area in cross section of cylinder in square inches;
                  P = Hydrostatic test pressure-psig;
                  A2 = Area of metal in cross section of cylinder in square inches.
                
                
                (e) Heat treatment. Each completed cylinder must be uniformly and properly heat treated prior to testing, as follows:
                (1) Each cylinder must be heated and held at the proper temperature for at least one hour per inch of thickness based on the maximum thickness of the cylinder and then quenched in a suitable liquid medium having a cooling rate not in excess of 80 percent of water. The steel temperature on quenching must be that recommended for the steel analysis, but it must never exceed 1750 °F.
                (2) After quenching, each cylinder must be reheated to a temperature below the transformation range but not less than 1050 °F., and must be held at this temperature for at least one hour per inch of thickness based on the maximum thickness of the cylinder. Each cylinder must then be cooled under conditions recommended for the steel.
                (f) Openings. Openings in cylinders must comply with the following:
                (1) Openings are permitted on heads only.
                (2) The size of any centered opening in a head may not exceed one half the outside diameter of the cylinder.
                (3) Openings in a head must have ligaments between openings of at least three times the average of their hole diameter. No off-center opening may exceed 2.625 inches in diameter.
                (4) All openings must be circular.
                (5) All openings must be threaded. Threads must be in compliance with the following:
                (i) Each thread must be clean cut, even, without any checks, and to gauge.
                (ii) Taper threads, when used, must be the American Standard Pipe thread (NPT) type and must be in compliance with the requirements of NBS Handbook H-28 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (iii) Taper threads conforming to National Gas Taper thread (NGT) standards must be in compliance with the requirements of NBS Handbook H-28.
                (iv) Straight threads conforming with National Gas Straight thread (NGS) standards are authorized. These threads must be in compliance with the requirements of NBS Handbook H-28.
                (g) Hydrostatic test. Each cylinder must be tested at an internal pressure by the water jacket method or other suitable method, conforming to the following requirements:
                (1) The testing apparatus must be operated in a manner that will obtain accurate data. Any pressure gauge used must permit reading to an accuracy of one percent. Any expansion gauge used must permit reading of the total expansion to an accuracy of one percent.

                (2) Any internal pressure applied to the cylinder after heat treatment and before the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure.
                
                (3) The pressure must be maintained sufficiently long to assure complete expansion of the cylinder. In no case may the pressure be held less than 30 seconds.
                (4) If, due to failure of the test apparatus, the required test pressure cannot be maintained, the test must be repeated at a pressure increased by 10 percent or 100 psig, whichever is lower or, the cylinder must be reheat treated.
                (5) Permanent volumetric expansion of the cylinder may not exceed 10 percent of its total volumetric expansion at the required test pressure.
                (6) Each cylinder must be tested to at least 5/3 times its service pressure.
                (h) Ultrasonic examination. After the hydrostatic test, the cylindrical section of each vessel must be examined in accordance with ASTM E 213 for shear wave and E 114 for straight beam (IBR, Standard see § 171.7 of this subchapter). The equipment used must be calibrated to detect a notch equal to five percent of the design minimum wall thickness. Any discontinuity indication greater than that produced by the five percent notch must be cause for rejection of the cylinder, unless the discontinuity is repaired within the requirements of this specification.
                (i) Basic requirements for tension and Charpy impact tests. Cylinders must be subjected to a tension and Charpy impact as follows:
                (1) When the cylinders are heat treated in a batch furnace, two tension specimens and three Charpy impact specimens must be tested from one of the cylinders or a test ring from each batch. The lot size represented by these tests may not exceed 200 cylinders.
                (2) When the cylinders are heat treated in a continuous furnace, two tension specimens and three Charpy impact specimens must be tested from one of the cylinders or a test ring from each four hours or less of production. However, in no case may a test lot based on this production period exceed 200 cylinders.
                (3) Each specimen for the tension and Charpy impact tests must be taken from the side wall of a cylinder or from a ring which has been heat treated with the finished cylinders of which the specimens must be representative. The axis of the specimens must be parallel to the axis of the cylinder. Each cylinder or ring specimen for test must be of the same diameter, thickness, and metal as the finished cylinders they represent. A test ring must be at least 24 inches long with ends covered during the heat treatment process so as to simulate the heat treatment process of the finished cylinders it represents.
                (4) A test cylinder or test ring need represent only one of the heats in a furnace batch provided the other heats in the batch have previously been tested and have passed the tests and that such tests do not represent more than 200 cylinders from any one heat.
                (5) The test results must conform to the requirements specified in paragraphs (j) and (k) of this section.
                (6) When the test results do not conform to the requirements specified, the cylinders represented by the tests may be reheat treated and the tests repeated. Paragraph (i)(5) of this section applies to any retesting.
                (j) Basic conditions for acceptable physical testing. The following criteria must be followed to obtain acceptable physical test results:
                (1) Each tension specimen must have a gauge length of two inches with a width not exceeding one and one-half inches. Except for the grip ends, the specimen may not be flattened. The grip ends may be flattened to within one inch of each end of the reduced section.
                (2) A specimen may not be heated after heat treatment specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
                (3) The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gage length.
                (i) This yield strength must be determined by the “offset” method or the “extension under load” method described in ASTM E 8 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

                (ii) For the “extension under load” method, the total strain (or extension under load) corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gage length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gage length. Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 30,000,000. However, when the degree of accuracy of this method is questionable the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset.
                (iii) For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain must be set with the specimen under a stress of 12,000 p.s.i. and the strain indicator reading set at the calculated corresponding strain.
                (iv) The cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed 1/8 inch per minute during the determination of yield strength.
                (4) Each impact specimen must be Charpy V-notch type size 10 mm × 10 mm taken in accordance with paragraph 11 of ASTM A 333 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). When a reduced size specimen is used, it must be the largest size obtainable.
                (k) Acceptable physical test results. Results of physical tests must conform to the following:
                (1) The tensile strength may not exceed 155,000 p.s.i.
                (2) The elongation must be at least 16 percent for a two-inch gage length.
                (3) The Charpy V-notch impact properties for the three impact specimens which must be tested at 0 °F may not be less than the values shown as follows:

                (4) After the final heat treatment, each vessel must be hardness tested on the cylindrical section. The tensile strength equivalent of the hardness number obtained may not be more than 165,000 p.s.i. (Rc 36). When the result of a hardness test exceeds the maximum permitted, two or more retests may be made; however, the hardness number obtained in each retest may not exceed the maximum permitted.
                (l) Rejected cylinders. Reheat treatment is authorized for rejected cylinders. However, each reheat treated cylinder must subsequently pass all the prescribed tests. Repair by welding is not authorized.
                (m) Markings. Marking must be done by stamping into the metal of the cylinder. All markings must be legible and located on a shoulder.
                (n) Inspector's report. In addition to the requirements of § 178.35, the inspector's report for the physical test report, must indicate the average value for three specimens and the minimum value for one specimen for each lot number.

                    1 “D” represents specimen diameters. When the cylinder wall is greater than 3/16 inch thick, a retest without reheat treatment using the 4D size specimen is authorized if the test using the 2 inch size specimen fails to meet elongation requirements.
                  
                    2 When cylinder wall is not over 3/16-inch thick, 10 percent elongation is authorized when using a 24t × 6t size test specimen.
                
                (5) All starting stock must be 100 percent ultrasonically inspected, along the length at right angles to the central axis from two positions at 90° to one another. The equipment and continuous scanning procedure must be capable of detecting and rejecting internal defects such as cracks which have an ultrasonic response greater than that of a calibration block with a 5/64-inch diameter flat bottomed hole.
                (6) Cast stock must have uniform equiaxed grain structure not to exceed 500 microns maximum.
                (7) Any starting stock not complying with the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section must be rejected.
                (c) Manufacture. Cylinders must be manufactured in accordance with the following requirements:
                (1) Cylinder shells must be manufactured by the backward extrusion method and have a cleanliness level adequate to ensure proper inspection. No fissure or other defect is acceptable that is likely to weaken the finished cylinder below the design strength requirements. A reasonably smooth and uniform surface finish is required. If not originally free from such defects, the surface may be machined or otherwise conditioned to eliminate these defects.
                (2) Thickness of the cylinder base may not be less than the prescribed minimum wall thickness of the cylindrical shell. The cylinder base must have a basic torispherical, hemispherical, or ellipsoidal interior base configuration where the dish radius is no greater than 1.2 times the inside diameter of the shell. The knuckle radius may not be less than 12 percent of the inside diameter of the shell. The interior base contour may deviate from the true torispherical, hemispherical or ellipsoidal configuration provided that—
                (i) Any areas of deviation are accompanied by an increase in base thickness;
                (ii) All radii of merging surfaces are equal to or greater than the knuckle radius;
                (iii) Each design has been qualified by successfully passing the cycling tests in this paragraph (c); and
                (iv) Detailed specifications of the base design are available to the inspector.
                (3) For free standing cylinders, the base thickness must be at least two times the minimum wall thickness along the line of contact between the cylinder base and the floor when the cylinders are in the vertical position.
                (4) Welding or brazing is prohibited.
                (5) Each new design and any significant change to any acceptable design must be qualified for production by testing prototype samples as follows:

                (i) Three samples must be subjected to 100,000 pressure reversal cycles between zero and service pressure or 10,000 pressure reversal cycles between zero and test pressure, at a rate not in excess of 10 cycles per minute without failure.
                (ii) Three samples must be pressurized to destruction and failure may not occur at less than 2.5 times the marked cylinder service pressure. Each cylinder must remain in one piece. Failure must initiate in the cylinder sidewall in a longitudinal direction. Rate of pressurization may not exceed 200 psig per second.
                (6) In this specification “significant change” means a 10 percent or greater change in cylinder wall thickness, service pressure, or diameter; a 30 percent or greater change in water capacity or base thickness; any change in material; over 100 percent increase in size of openings; or any change in the number of openings.
                (d) Wall thickness. The minimum wall thickness must be such that the wall stress at the minimum specified test pressure will not exceed 80 percent of the minimum yield strength nor exceed 67 percent of the minimum ultimate tensile strength as verified by physical tests in paragraph (i) of this section. The minimum wall thickness for any cylinder with an outside diameter greater than 5 inches must be 0.125 inch. Calculations must be made by the following formula:
                
                S = [P(1.3D2 + 0.4d2)] / (D2 − d2)
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  S = Wall stress in psi;
                  P = Prescribed minimum test pressure in psig (see paragraph (g) of this section);
                  D = Outside diameter in inches; and
                  d = Inside diameter in inches.
                
                
                (e) Openings. Openings must comply with the following requirements:
                (1) Openings are permitted in heads only.
                (2) The size of any centered opening in a head may not exceed one-half the outside diameter of the cylinder.
                (3) Other openings are permitted in the head of a cylinder if:
                (i) Each opening does not exceed 2.625 inches in diameter, or one-half the outside diameter of the cylinder; whichever is less;
                (ii) Each opening is separated from each other by a ligament; and
                (iii) Each ligament which separates two openings must be at least three times the average of the diameters of the two openings.
                (4) All openings must be circular.
                (5) All openings must be threaded. Threads must comply with the following:
                (i) Each thread must be clean cut, even, without checks, and to gauge.
                (ii) Taper threads, when used, must conform to one of the following:
                (A) American Standard Pipe Thread (NPT) type, conforming to the requirements of NBS Handbook H-28 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter);
                (B) National Gas Taper Thread (NGT) type, conforming to the requirements of NBS Handbook H-28; or
                (C) Other taper threads conforming to other standards may be used provided the length is not less than that specified for NPT threads.
                (iii) Straight threads, when used, must conform to one of the following:
                (A) National Gas Straight Thread (NGS) type, conforming to the requirements of NBS Handbook H-28;
                (B) Unified Thread (UN) type, conforming to the requirements of NBS Handbook H-28;
                (C) Controlled Radius Root Thread (UN) type, conforming to the requirements of NBS Handbook H-28; or
                (D) Other straight threads conforming to other recognized standards may be used provided that the requirements in paragraph (e)(5)(iv) of this section are met.
                (iv) All straight threads must have at least 6 engaged threads, a tight fit, and a factor of safety in shear of at least 10 at the test pressure of the cylinder. Shear stress must be calculated by using the appropriate thread shear area in accordance with NBS Handbook H-28.
                (f) Heat treatment. Prior to any test, all cylinders must be subjected to a solution heat treatment and aging treatment appropriate for the aluminum alloy used.
                (g) Hydrostatic test. Each cylinder must be subjected to an internal test pressure using the water jacket equipment and method or other suitable equipment and method and comply with the following requirements:

                (1) The testing apparatus must be operated in a manner so as to obtain accurate data. The pressure gauge used must permit reading to an accuracy of one percent. The expansion gauge must permit reading the total expansion to an accuracy of either one percent or 0.1 cubic centimeter.
                (2) The test pressure must be maintained for a sufficient period of time to assure complete expansion of the cylinder. In no case may the pressure be held less than 30 seconds. If, due to failure of the test apparatus, the required test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be repeated at a pressure increased by 10 percent or 100 psig, whichever is lower. If the test apparatus again fails to maintain the test pressure, the cylinder being tested must be rejected. Any internal pressure applied to the cylinder before any official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure.
                (3) The minimum test pressure is the greatest of the following:
                (i) 450 psig regardless of service pressure;
                (ii) Two times the service pressure for cylinders having service pressure less than 500 psig; or
                (iii) Five-thirds times the service pressure for cylinders having a service pressure of at least 500 psig.
                (4) Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of total volumetric expansion at test pressure.
                (h) Flattening test. One cylinder taken at random out of each lot must be subjected to a flattening test as follows:
                (1) The test must be between knife edges, wedge shaped, having a 60° included angle, and rounded in accordance with the following table. The longitudinal axis of the cylinder must be at an angle 90° to the knife edges during the test. The flattening test table is as follows:

                (2) An alternate bend test in accordance with ASTM E 290 using a mandrel diameter not more than 6 times the wall thickness is authorized to qualify lots that fail the flattening test of this section without reheat treatment. If used, this test must be performed on two samples from one cylinder taken at random out of each lot of 200 cylinders or less.
                (3) Each test cylinder must withstand flattening to nine times the wall thickness without cracking. When the alternate bend test is used, the test specimens must remain uncracked when bent inward around a mandrel in the direction of curvature of the cylinder wall until the interior edges are at a distance apart not greater than the diameter of the mandrel.
                (i) Mechanical properties test. Two test specimens cut from one cylinder representing each lot of 200 cylinders or less must be subjected to the mechanical properties test, as follows:
                (1) The results of the test must conform to at least the minimum acceptable mechanical property limits for aluminum alloys as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
                (2) Specimens must be 4D bar or gauge length 2 inches with width not over 11/2 inch taken in the direction of extrusion approximately 180° from each other; provided that gauge length at least 24 times thickness with width not over 6 times thickness is authorized, when cylinder wall is not over 3/16 inch thick. The specimen, exclusive of grip ends, may not be flattened. Grip ends may be flattened to within one inch of each end of the reduced section. When the size of the cylinder does not permit securing straight specimens, the specimens may be taken in any location or direction and may be straightened or flattened cold by pressure only, not by blows. When such specimens are used, the inspector's report must show that the specimens were so taken and prepared. Heating of specimens for any purpose is forbidden.
                (3) The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length.

                (i) The yield strength must be determined by either the “offset” method or the “extension under load” method as prescribed in ASTM B 557 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                
                (ii) In using the “extension under load” method, the total strain (or “extension under load”) corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length. Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 10,000,000 psi. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset.
                (iii) For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 6,000 psi, the strain indicator reading being set at the calculated corresponding strain.
                (iv) Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed 1/8 inch per minute during yield strength determination.
                (j) Rejected cylinder. Reheat treatment of rejected cylinders is authorized one time. Subsequent thereto, cylinders must pass all prescribed tests to be acceptable.
                (k) Duties of inspector. In addition to the requirements of § 178.35, the inspector shall:
                (1) Verify compliance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section by:
                (i) Performing or witnessing the performance of the chemical analyses on each melt or cast lot or other unit of starting material; or
                (ii) Obtaining a certified chemical analysis from the material or cylinder manufacturer for each melt, or cast of material; or
                (iii) Obtaining a certified check analysis on one cylinder out of each lot of 200 cylinders or less, if a certificate containing data to indicate compliance with the material specification is obtained.
                (2) The inspector must verify ultrasonic inspection of all material by inspection or by obtaining the material producer's certificate of ultrasonic inspection. Ultrasonic inspection must be performed or verified as having been performed in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
                (3) The inspector must also determine that each cylinder complies with this specification by:
                (i) Selecting the samples for check analyses performed by other than the material producer;
                (ii) Verifying that the prescribed minimum thickness was met by measuring or witnessing the measurement of the wall thickness; and
                (iii) Verifying that the identification of material is proper.
                (4) Prior to initial production of any design or design change, verify that the design qualification tests prescribed in paragraph (c)(6) of this section have been performed with acceptable results.
                (l) Definitions. (1) In this specification, a “lot” means a group of cylinders successively produced having the same:
                (i) Size and configuration;
                (ii) Specified material of construction;
                (iii) Process of manufacture and heat treatment;
                (iv) Equipment of manufacture and heat treatment; and
                (v) Conditions of time, temperature and atmosphere during heat treatment.
                (2) In no case may the lot size exceed 200 cylinders, but any cylinder processed for use in the required destructive physical testing need not be counted as being one of the 200.
                (m) Inspector's report. In addition to the information required by § 178.35, the record of chemical analyses must also include the alloy designation, and applicable information on iron, titanium, zinc, magnesium and any other applicable element used in the construction of the cylinder.

                (c) Identification of material. Materials must be identified by any suitable method.
                (d) Manufacture. Cylinders must be manufactured using equipment and processes adequate to ensure that each cylinder produced conforms to the requirements of this subpart. No defect is permitted that is likely to weaken the finished cylinder appreciably, a reasonably smooth and uniform surface finish is required. No abrupt change in wall thickness is permitted. Welding procedures and operators must be qualified in accordance with CGA Pamphlet C-3 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). All seams of the sphere or cylinder must be fusion welded.

                (f) Wall thickness. The minimum wall thickness must be such that the wall stress at the minimum specified test pressure may not be over 60,000 psig. A minimum wall thickness of 0.040 inch is required for any diameter container. Calculations must be made by the following formulas:
                

                (1) Calculation for sphere must be made by the formula:
                
                S = PD / 4tE
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  S = Wall stress in psi;
                  P = Test pressure prescribed for water jacket test, i.e., at least two times service pressure, in psig;

                  E = 1.0 (for all other areas).
                
                

                (2) Calculation for a cylinder must be made by the formula:
                
                S = [P(1.3D2 + 0.4d2)] / (D2 − d2)
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  S = Wall stress in psi;
                  P = Test pressure prescribed for water jacket test, i.e., at least two times service pressure, in psig;
                  D = Outside diameter in inches;
                  d = Inside diameter in inches.
                
                
                (g) Heat treatment. The seamless hemispheres and cylinders may be stress relieved or annealed for forming. Welded container must be stress relieved at a temperature of 775 °F ±25° after process treatment and before hydrostatic test.
                (h) Openings in container. Openings must comply with the following:
                (1) Each opening in the container must be provided with a fitting, boss or pad of weldable stainless steel securely attached to the container by fusion welding.
                (2) Attachments to a fitting, boss, or pad must be adequate to prevent leakage. Threads must comply with the following:
                (i) Threads must be clean cut, even, without checks, and tapped to gauge.
                (ii) Taper threads to be of length not less than as specified for American Standard taper pipe threads.
                (iii) Straight threads having at least 4 engaged threads, to have tight fit and calculated shear strength at least 10 times the test pressure of the container; gaskets required, adequate to prevent leakage.
                (i) Process treatment. Each container must be hydraulically pressurized in a water jacket to at least 100 percent, but not more than 110 percent, of the test pressure and maintained at this pressure for a minimum of 3 minutes. Total and permanent expansion must be recorded and included in the inspector's report.
                (j) Hydrostatic test. Each cylinder must successfully withstand a hydrostatic test as follows:
                (1) The test must be by water-jacket, operated so as to obtain accurate data. The pressure gauge must permit reading to an accuracy of 1 percent. The expansion gauge must permit reading of total expansion to an accuracy either of 1 percent or 0.1 cubic centimeter.
                (2) Pressure must be maintained for at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. If, due to failure of the test apparatus, the test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be repeated at a pressure increased by 10 percent or 100 psig, whichever is the lower.
                (3) Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of total volumetric expansion at test pressure.
                (4) Each container must be tested to at least 2 times service pressure.
                (5) Container must then be inspected. Any wall thickness lower than that required by paragraph (f) of this section must be cause for rejection. Bulges and cracks must be cause for rejection. Welded joint defects exceeding requirements of paragraph (k) of this section must be cause for rejection.
                (k) Radiographic inspection. Radiographic inspection is required on all welded joints which are subjected to internal pressure, except that at the discretion of the disinterested inspector, openings less than 25 percent of the container diameter need not be subjected to radiographic inspection. Evidence of any defects likely to seriously weaken the container is cause for rejection. Radiographic inspection must be performed subsequent to the hydrostatic test.
                (l) Burst test. One container taken at random out of 200 or less must be hydrostatically tested to destruction. Rupture pressure must be included as part of the inspector's report.
                (m) Flattening test. A flattening test must be performed as follows:

                (1) For spheres the test must be at the weld between parallel steel plates on a press with welded seam at right angles to the plates. Test one sphere taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less after the hydrostatic test. Any projecting appurtenances may be cut off (by mechanical means only) prior to crushing.
                (2) For cylinders the test must be between knife edges, wedge shaped, 60° angle, rounded to 1/2-inch radius. Test one cylinder taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less, after the hydrostatic test.

                (2) Burst pressure must be at least 3 times the service pressure.
                (o) Rejected containers. Repair of welded seams by welding prior to process treatment is authorized. Subsequent thereto, containers must be heat treated and pass all prescribed tests.
                (p) Duties of inspector. In addition to the requirements of § 178.35, the inspector must verify that all tests are conducted at temperatures between 60 °F and 90 °F.
                (q) Marking. Markings must be stamped plainly and permanently on a permanent attachment or on a metal nameplate permanently secured to the container by means other than soft solder.

                § 178.50
                Specification 4B welded or brazed steel cylinders.
                (a) Type, size, and service pressure. A DOT 4B is a welded or brazed steel cylinder with longitudinal seams that are forged lap-welded or brazed and with water capacity (nominal) not over 1,000 pounds and a service pressure of at least 150 but not over 500 psig. Cylinders closed in by spinning process are not authorized.
                (b) Steel. Open-hearth, electric or basic oxygen process steel of uniform quality must be used. Content percent may not exceed the following: Carbon, 0.25; phosphorus, 0.045; sulphur, 0.050.
                (c) Identification of material. Material must be identified by any suitable method except that plates and billets for hotdrawn cylinders must be marked with the heat number.
                (d) Manufacture. Cylinders must be manufactured using equipment and processes adequate to ensure that each cylinder produced conforms to the requirements of this subpart. No defect is permitted that is likely to weaken the finished cylinder appreciably. A reasonably smooth and uniform surface finish is required. Exposed bottom welds on cylinders over 18 inches long must be protected by footrings. Welding procedures and operators must be qualified in accordance with CGA Pamphlet C-3 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). Seams must be made as follows:
                (1) Welded or brazed circumferential seams. Heads attached by brazing must have a driving fit with the shell, unless the shell is crimped, swedged, or curled over the skirt or flange of the head, and be thoroughly brazed until complete penetration by the brazing material of the brazed joint is secured. Depth of brazing from end of shell must be at least four times the thickness of shell metal.
                (2) Longitudinal seams in shells. Longitudinal seams must be forged lap welded, by copper brazing, by copper alloy brazing, or by silver alloy brazing. Copper alloy composition must be: Copper, 95 percent minimum; Silicon, 1.5 percent to 3.85 percent; Manganese, 0.25 percent to 1.10 percent. The melting point of the silver alloy brazing material must be in excess of 1000 °F. When brazed, the plate edge must be lapped at least eight times the thickness of plate, laps being held in position, substantially metal to metal, by riveting or electric spot-welding; brazing must be done by using a suitable flux and by placing brazing material on one side of seam and applying heat until this material shows uniformly along the seam of the other side.
                (e) Welding or brazing. Only the attachment of neckrings, footrings, handles, bosses, pads, and valve protection rings to the tops and bottoms of cylinders by welding or brazing is authorized. Such attachments and the portion of the container to which they are attached must be made of weldable steel, the carbon content of which may not exceed 0.25 percent except in the case of 4130X steel which may be used with proper welding procedure.
                (f) Wall thickness. The wall thickness of the cylinder must comply with the following requirements:
                (1) For cylinders with outside diameters over 6 inches the minimum wall thickness must be 0.090 inch. In any case, the minimum wall thickness must be such that calculated wall stress at minimum test pressure (paragraph (i)(4) of this section) may not exceed the following values:
                (i) 24,000 psi for cylinders without longitudinal seam.
                (ii) 22,800 psig for cylinders having copper brazed or silver alloy brazed longitudinal seam.
                (iii) 18,000 psi for cylinders having forged lapped welded longitudinal seam.
                (2) Calculation must be made by the formula:
                
                S = [P(1.3D2 + 0.4d2)] / (D2 − d2)
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  S = wall stress in psi;
                  P = minimum test pressure prescribed for water jacket test or 450 psig whichever is the greater;
                  D = outside diameter in inches;
                  d = inside diameter in inches.
                
                
                (g) Heat treatment. Cylinder body and heads, formed by drawing or pressing, must be uniformly and properly heat treated prior to tests.
                (h) Opening in cylinders. Openings in cylinders must conform to the following:
                (1) Each opening in cylinders, except those for safety devices, must be provided with a fitting, boss, or pad, securely attached to cylinder by brazing or by welding or by threads. Fitting, boss, or pad must be of steel suitable for the method of attachment employed, and which need not be identified or verified as to analysis except that if attachment is by welding, carbon content may not exceed 0.25 percent. If threads are used, they must comply with the following:
                (i) Threads must be clean cut, even without checks, and tapped to gauge.
                (ii) Taper threads to be of length not less than as specified for American Standard taper pipe threads.
                (iii) Straight threads, having at least 4 engaged threads, to have tight fit and calculated shear strength at least 10 times the test pressure of the cylinder; gaskets required, adequate to prevent leakage.
                (iv) A brass fitting may be brazed to the steel boss or flange on cylinders used as component parts of hand fire extinguishers.
                (2) The closure of a fitting, boss, or pad must be adequate to prevent leakage.
                (i) Hydrostatic test. Cylinders must withstand a hydrostatic test as follows:
                (1) The test must be by water-jacket, or other suitable method, operated so as to obtain accurate data. The pressure gauge must permit reading to an accuracy of 1 percent. The expansion gauge must permit reading of total expansion to an accuracy either of 1 percent or 0.1 cubic centimeter.
                (2) Pressure must be maintained for at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure applied after heat-treatment and previous to the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure. If, due to failure of the test apparatus, the test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be repeated at a pressure increased by 10 percent or 100 psig, whichever is the lower.
                (3) Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of total volumetric expansion at test pressure.
                (4) Cylinders must be tested as follows:
                (i) At least one cylinder selected at random out of each lot of 200 or less must be tested as outlined in paragraphs (i)(1), (i)(2), and (i)(3) of this section to at least two times service pressure.
                (ii) All cylinders not tested as outlined in paragraph (i)(4)(i) of this section must be examined under pressure of at least two times service pressure and show no defect.
                (j) Flattening test. After the hydrostatic test, a flattening test must be performed on one cylinder taken at random out or each lot of 200 or less, by placing the cylinder between wedge shaped knife edges having a 60° included angle, rounded to 1/2-inch radius. The longitudinal axis of the cylinder must be at a 90-degree angle to knife edges during the test. For lots of 30 or less, flattening tests are authorized to be made on a ring at least 8 inches long cut from each cylinder and subjected to same heat treatment as the finished cylinder.
                (k) Physical test. A physical test must be conducted to determine yield strength, tensile strength, elongation, and reduction of area of material as follows:
                (1) The test is required on 2 specimens cut from 1 cylinder, or part thereof heat-treated as required, taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less. For lots of 30 or less, physical tests are authorized to be made on a ring at least 8 inches long cut from each cylinder and subjected to same heat treatment as the finished cylinder.
                (2) Specimens must conform to the following:
                (i) A gauge length of 8 inches with a width of not over 11/2 inches, a gauge length of 2 inches with a width of not over 11/2 inches, or a gauge length at least 24 times the thickness with a width not over 6 times the thickness is authorized when a cylinder wall is not over 3/16 inch thick.
                (ii) The specimen, exclusive of grip ends, may not be flattened. Grip ends may be flattened to within one inch of each end of the reduced section.
                (iii) When size of cylinder does not permit securing straight specimens, the specimens may be taken in any location or direction and may be straightened or flattened cold, by pressure only, not by blows. When specimens are so taken and prepared, the inspector's report must show in connection with record of physical tests detailed information in regard to such specimens.
                (iv) Heating of a specimen for any purpose is not authorized.
                (3) The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length. The following conditions apply:
                (i) The yield strength must be determined by either the “offset” method or the “extension under load” method as prescribed in ASTM E 8 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (ii) In using the “extension under load” method, the total strain (or “extension under load”) corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length. Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 30,000,000. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset.
                (iii) For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psi, and strain indicator reading must be set at the calculated corresponding strain.
                (iv) Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed 1/8 inch per minute during yield strength determination.
                (l) Acceptable results for physical and flattening tests. Either of the following is an acceptable result:
                (1) An elongation of at least 40 percent for a 2-inch gauge length or at least 20 percent in other cases and yield strength not over 73 percent of tensile strength. In this instance, a flattening test is not required.
                (2) When cylinders are constructed of lap welded pipe, flattening test is required, without cracking, to 6 times the wall thickness. In such case, the rings (crop ends) cut from each end of pipe, must be tested with the weld 45° or less from the point of greatest stress. If a ring fails, another from the same end of pipe may be tested.
                (m) Rejected cylinders. Reheat treatment is authorized for rejected cylinder. Subsequent thereto, cylinders must pass all prescribed tests to be acceptable. Repair of brazed seams by brazing and welded seams by welding is authorized.
                (n) Markings. Markings must be stamped plainly and permanently in any of the following locations on the cylinder:

                (1) On shoulders and top heads when they are not less than 0.087-inch thick.
                
                (2) On side wall adjacent to top head for side walls which are not less than 0.090 inch thick.
                (3) On a cylindrical portion of the shell which extends beyond the recessed bottom of the cylinder, constituting an integral and non-pressure part of the cylinder.
                (4) On a metal plate attached to the top of the cylinder or permanent part thereof; sufficient space must be left on the plate to provide for stamping at least six retest dates; the plate must be at least 1/16-inch thick and must be attached by welding, or by brazing. The brazing rod must melt at a temperature of 1100 °F. Welding or brazing must be along all the edges of the plate.
                (5) On the neck, neckring, valve boss, valve protection sleeve, or similar part permanently attached to the top of the cylinder.
                (6) On the footring permanently attached to the cylinder, provided the water capacity of the cylinder does not exceed 25 pounds.

                (a) Type, size, and service pressure. A DOT 4BA cylinder is a cylinder, either spherical or cylindrical in shape, with a water capacity of 1,000 pounds or less and a service pressure of at least 225 and not over 500 psig. Closures made by the spinning process are not authorized.
                (1) Spherical type cylinders must be made from two seamless hemispheres joined by the welding of one circumferential seam.
                (2) Cylindrical type cylinders must be of circumferentially welded or brazed construction.
                (b) Steel. The steel used in the construction of the cylinder must be as specified in table 1 of appendix A to this part.
                (c) Identification of material. Material must be identified by any suitable method except that plates and billets for hotdrawn cylinders must be marked with the heat number.
                (d) Manufacture. Cylinders must be manufactured using equipment and processes adequate to ensure that each cylinder produced conforms to the requirements of this subpart. No defect is permitted that is likely to weaken the finished cylinder appreciably. A reasonably smooth and uniform surface finish is required. Exposed bottom welds on cylinders over 18 inches long must be protected by footrings.
                (1) Seams must be made as follows:
                (i) Minimum thickness of heads and bottoms must be not less than 90 percent of the required thickness of the side wall.
                (ii) Circumferential seams must be made by welding or by brazing. Heads must be attached by brazing and must have a driving fit with the shell, unless the shell is crimped, swedged or curled over the skirt or flange of the head and must be thoroughly brazed until complete penetration by the brazing material of the brazed joint is secured. Depth of brazing from end of the shell must be at least four times the thickness of shell metal.
                (iii) Longitudinal seams in shells must be made by copper brazing, copper alloy brazing, or by silver alloy brazing. Copper alloy composition must be: Copper 95 percent minimum, Silicon 1.5 percent to 3.85 percent, Manganese 0.25 percent to 1.10 percent. The melting point of the silver alloy brazing material must be in excess of 1,000 °F. The plate edge must be lapped at least eight times the thickness of plate, laps being held in position, substantially metal to metal, by riveting or by electric spot-welding. Brazing must be done by using a suitable flux and by placing brazing material on one side of seam and applying heat until this material shows uniformly along the seam of the other side. Strength of longitudinal seam: Copper brazed longitudinal seam must have strength at least 3/2 times the strength of the steel wall.
                (2) Welding procedures and operators must be qualified in accordance with CGA Pamphlet C-3 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (e) Welding and brazing. Only the welding or brazing of neckrings, footrings, handles, bosses, pads, and valve protection rings to the tops and bottoms of cylinders is authorized. Provided that such attachments and the portion of the container to which they are attached are made of weldable steel, the carbon content of which may not exceed 0.25 percent except in the case of 4130 × steel which may be used with proper welding procedure.
                (f) Wall thickness. The minimum wall thickness of the cylinder must meet the following conditions:
                (1) For any cylinder with an outside diameter of greater than 6 inches, the minimum wall thickness is 0.078 inch. In any case the minimum wall thickness must be such that the calculated wall stress at the minimum test pressure may not exceed the lesser value of any of the following:
                (i) The value shown in table 1 of appendix A to this part, for the particular material under consideration;
                (ii) One-half of the minimum tensile strength of the material determined as required in paragraph (j) of this section;
                (iii) 35,000 psi; or
                (iv) Further provided that wall stress for cylinders having copper brazed longitudinal seams may not exceed 95 percent of any of the above values. Measured wall thickness may not include galvanizing or other protective coating.

                (2) Cylinders that are cylindrical in shape must have the wall stress calculated by the formula:
                
                S = [P(1.3D2 + 0.4d2)] / (D2 − d2)
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  S = wall stress in psi;
                  P = minimum test pressure prescribed for water jacket test;
                  D = outside diameter in inches;
                  d = inside diameter in inches.
                
                

                (3) Cylinders that are spherical in shape must have the wall stress calculated by the formula:
                
                S = PD / 4tE
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  S = wall stress in psi;
                  P = minimum test pressure prescribed for water jacket test;
                  D = outside diameter in inches;
                  t = minimum wall thickness in inches;
                  E = 0.85 (provides 85 percent weld efficiency factor which must be applied in the girth weld area and heat affected zones which zone must extend a distance of 6 times wall thickness from center line of weld);
                  E = 1.0 (for all other areas).
                
                
                (4) For a cylinder with a wall thickness less than 0.100 inch, the ratio of tangential length to outside diameter may not exceed 4.1.
                (g) Heat treatment. Cylinders must be heat treated in accordance with the following requirements:
                (1) Each cylinder must be uniformly and properly heat treated prior to test by the applicable method shown in table 1 of appendix A to this part. Heat treatment must be accomplished after all forming and welding operations, except that when brazed joints are used, heat treatment must follow any forming and welding operations, but may be done before, during or after the brazing operations.
                (2) Heat treatment is not required after the welding or brazing of weldable low carbon parts to attachments of similar material which have been previously welded or brazed to the top or bottom of cylinders and properly heat treated, provided such subsequent welding or brazing does not produce a temperature in excess of 400 °F in any part of the top or bottom material.
                (h) Openings in cylinders. Openings in cylinders must comply with the following requirements:
                (1) Any opening must be placed on other than a cylindrical surface.
                (2) Each opening in a spherical type cylinder must be provided with a fitting, boss, or pad of weldable steel securely attached to the container by fusion welding.
                (3) Each opening in a cylindrical type cylinder must be provided with a fitting, boss, or pad, securely attached to container by brazing or by welding.
                (4) If threads are used, they must comply with the following:
                (i) Threads must be clean-cut, even, without checks and tapped to gauge.
                (ii) Taper threads must be of a length not less than that specified for American Standard taper pipe threads.

                (iii) Straight threads, having at least 4 engaged threads, must have a tight fit and a calculated shear strength of at least 10 times the test pressure of the cylinder. Gaskets, adequate to prevent leakage, are required.
                
                (i) Hydrostatic test. Each cylinder must successfully withstand a hydrostatic test, as follows:
                (1) The test must be by water jacket, or other suitable method, operated so as to obtain accurate data. A pressure gauge must permit reading to an accuracy of 1 percent. An expansion gauge must permit reading of total expansion to an accuracy of either 1 percent or 0.1 cubic centimeter.
                (2) Pressure must be maintained for at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure applied after heat treatment and previous to the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure.
                (3) Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of the total volumetric expansion at test pressure.
                (4) Cylinders must be tested as follows:
                (i) At least one cylinder selected at random out of each lot of 200 or less must be tested as outlined in paragraphs (i)(1), (i)(2), and (i)(3) of this section to at least two times service pressure.
                (ii) All cylinders not tested as outlined in paragraph (i)(4)(i) of this section must be examined under pressure of at least two times service pressure and show no defect.
                (j) Physical test. A physical test must be conducted to determine yield strength, tensile strength, elongation, and reduction of area of material, as follows:
                (1) The test is required on 2 specimens cut from one cylinder or part thereof having passed the hydrostatic test and heat-treated as required, taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less. Physical tests for spheres are required on 2 specimens cut from flat representative sample plates of the same heat taken at random from the steel used to produce the spheres. This flat steel from which 2 specimens are to be cut must receive the same heat treatment as the spheres themselves. Sample plates must be taken from each lot of 200 or less spheres.
                (2) Specimens must conform to the following:
                (i) A gauge length of 8 inches with a width not over 11/2 inches, or a gauge length of 2 inches with a width not over 11/2 inches, or a gauge length at least 24 times the thickness with a width not over 6 times the thickness is authorized when a cylinder wall is not over 3/16 inch thick.
                (ii) The specimen, exclusive of grip ends, may not be flattened. Grip ends may be flattened to within one inch of each end of the reduced section.
                (iii) When size of the cylinder does not permit securing straight specimens, the specimens may be taken in any location or direction and may be straightened or flattened cold, by pressure only, not by blows. When specimens are so taken and prepared, the inspector's report must show in connection with record of physical tests detailed information in regard to such specimens.
                (iv) Heating of a specimen for any purpose is not authorized.
                (3) The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length. The following conditions apply:
                (i) The yield strength must be determined by either the “offset” method or the “extension under load” method as prescribed in ASTM E 8 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (ii) In using the “extension under load” method, the total strain (or “extension under load”), corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length. Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 30,000,000. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset.
                (iii) For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain reference must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psi, and the strain indicator reading must be set at the calculated corresponding strain.

                (iv) Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed 1/8 inch per minute during yield strength determination.
                
                (k) Elongation. Physical test specimens must show at least a 40 percent elongation for a 2-inch gauge length or at least 20 percent in other cases. Except that these elongation percentages may be reduced numerically by 2 for 2-inch specimens, and by 1 in other cases, for each 7,500 psi increment of tensile strength above 50,000 psi to a maximum of four such increments.
                (l) Tests of welds. Except for brazed seams, welds must be tested as follows:
                (1) Tensile test. A specimen must be cut from one cylinder of each lot of 200 or less, or welded test plate. The welded test plate must be of one of the heats in the lot of 200 or less which it represents, in the same condition and approximately the same thickness as the cylinder wall except that in no case must it be of a lesser thickness than that required for a quarter size Charpy impact specimen. The weld must be made by the same procedures and subjected to the same heat treatment as the major weld on the cylinder. The specimen must be taken from across the major seam and must be prepared and tested in accordance with and must meet the requirements of CGA Pamphlet C-3 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). Should this specimen fail to meet the requirements, specimens may be taken from two additional cylinders or welded test plates from the same lot and tested. If either of the latter specimens fail to meet the requirements, the entire lot represented must be rejected.
                (2) Guided bend test. A root bend test specimen must be cut from the cylinder or welded test plate, used for the tensile test specified in paragraph (l)(1) of this section. Specimens must be taken from across the major seam and must be prepared and tested in accordance with and must meet the requirements of CGA Pamphlet C-3.
                (3) Alternate guided-bend test. This test may be used and must be as required by CGA Pamphlet C-3. The specimen must be bent until the elongation at the outer surface, adjacent to the root of the weld, between the lightly scribed gage lines a to b, must be at least 20 percent, except that this percentage may be reduced for steels having a tensile strength in excess of 50,000 psig, as provided in paragraph (k) of this section.
                (m) Rejected cylinders. Reheat treatment is authorized for rejected cylinders. Subsequent thereto, cylinders must pass all prescribed tests to be acceptable. Repair of brazed seams by brazing and welded seams by welding is authorized.
                (n) Markings. Markings must be stamped plainly and permanently in one of the following locations on the cylinder:
                (1) On shoulders and top heads not less than 0.087 inch thick.
                (2) On side wall adjacent to top head for side walls not less than 0.090 inch thick.
                (3) On a cylindrical portion of the shell which extends beyond the recessed bottom of the cylinder constituting an integral and non-pressure part of the cylinder.
                (4) On a plate attached to the top of the cylinder or permanent part thereof; sufficient space must be left on the plate to provide for stamping at least six retest dates; the plate must be at least 1/16 inch thick and must be attached by welding, or by brazing at a temperature of at least 1100 °F., throughout all edges of the plate.
                (5) On the neck, neckring, valve boss, valve protection sleeve, or similar part permanently attached to the top of the cylinder.
                (6) On the footring permanently attached to the cylinder, provided the water capacity of the cylinder does not exceed 25 pounds.

                (c) Identification of material. Material must be identified by any suitable method except that plates and billets for hotdrawn cylinders must be marked with the heat number.
                (d) Manufacture. Cylinders must be manufactured using equipment and processes adequate to ensure that each cylinder produced conforms to the requirements of this subpart. No defect is permitted that is likely to weaken the finished container appreciably. A reasonably smooth and uniform surface finish is required. Welding procedures and operators must be qualified in accordance with CGA Pamphlet C-3 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (e) Wall thickness. The wall stress at the minimum test pressure may not exceed 24,000 psi, except where steels commercially known as 4130X, types 304, 316, 321, and 347 stainless steels are used, stress at the test pressures may not exceed 37,000 psi. The minimum wall thickness for any container having a capacity of 1,100 cubic inches or less is 0.04 inch. The minimum wall thickness for any container having a capacity in excess of 1,100 cubic inches is 0.095 inch. Calculations must be done by the following:

                (1) Calculation for a “sphere” must be made by the formula:
                
                S = PD / 4tE
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  S = wall stress in psi;
                  P = test pressure prescribed for water jacket test, i.e., at least two times service pressure, in psig;
                  D = outside diameter in inches;
                  t = minimum wall thickness in inches;
                  E = 0.85 (provides 85 percent weld efficiency factor which must be applied in the girth weld area and heat affected zones which zone must extend a distance of 6 times wall thickness from center line of weld);
                  E = 1.0 (for all other areas).
                
                

                (2) Calculation for a cylinder must be made by the formula:
                
                S = [P(1.3D2 + 0.4d2)] / (D2 − dT12)
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  S = wall stress in psi;
                  P = test pressure prescribed for water jacket test, i.e., at least two times service pressure, in psig;
                  D = outside diameter in inches;
                  d = inside diameter in inches.
                
                
                (f) Heat treatment. The completed cylinders must be uniformly and properly heat-treated prior to tests.
                (g) Openings in container. Openings in cylinders must comply with the following:
                (1) Each opening in the container, except those for safety devices, must be provided with a fitting, boss, or pad, securely attached to the container by brazing or by welding or by threads. If threads are used, they must comply with the following:
                (i) Threads must be clean cut, even, without checks, and tapped to gauge.
                (ii) Taper threads must be of a length not less than that specified for American Standard taper pipe threads.
                (iii) Straight threads, having at least 4 engaged threads, must have a tight fit and calculated shear strength of at least 10 times the test pressure of the container. Gaskets, adequate to prevent leakage, are required.
                (2) Closure of a fitting, boss, or pad must be adequate to prevent leakage.
                (h) Hydrostatic test. Each cylinder must successfully withstand a hydrostatic test, as follows:
                (1) The test must be by water-jacket, or other suitable method, operated so as to obtain accurate data. A pressure gauge must permit a reading to an accuracy of 1 percent. An expansion gauge must permit reading of total expansion to an accuracy of either 1 percent or 0.1 cubic centimeter.
                (2) Pressure must be maintained for at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure applied after heat-treatment and previous to the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure. If, due to failure of the test apparatus, the test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be repeated at a pressure increased by 10 percent or 100 psig, whichever is the lower.
                (3) Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of the total volumetric expansion at test pressure.
                (4) Containers must be tested as follows:
                (i) Each container to at least 2 times service pressure; or
                (ii) One container out of each lot of 200 or less to at least 3 times service pressure. Others must be examined under pressure of 2 times service pressure and show no defects.
                (i) Flattening test for spheres and cylinders. Spheres and cylinders must be subjected to a flattening test as follows:
                (1) One sphere taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less must be subjected to a flattening test as follows:

                (i) The test must be performed after the hydrostatic test.
                
                (ii) The test must be between parallel steel plates on a press with a welded seam at right angles to the plates. Any projecting appurtenances may be cut off (by mechanical means only) prior to crushing.
                (2) One cylinder taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less must be subjected to a flattening test, as follows:
                (i) The test must be performed after the hydrostatic test.
                (ii) The test must be between knife edges, wedge shaped, 60° angle, rounded to 1/2 inch radius. For lots of 30 or less, physical tests are authorized to be made on a ring at least 8 inches long cut from each cylinder and subjected to the same heat treatment as the finished cylinder.
                (j) Physical test and specimens for spheres and cylinders. Spheres and cylinders must be subjected to a physical test as follows:
                (1) Physical test for spheres are required on 2 specimens cut from a flat representative sample plate of the same heat taken at random from the steel used to produce the sphere. This flat steel from which the 2 specimens are to be cut must receive the same heat-treatment as the spheres themselves. Sample plates must be taken for each lot of 200 or less spheres.
                (2) Specimens for spheres must have a gauge length 2 inches with a width not over 11/2 inches, or a gauge length at least 24 times the thickness with a width not over 6 times the thickness is authorized when a wall is not over 3/16 inch thick.
                (3) Physical test for cylinders is required on 2 specimens cut from 1 cylinder taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less. For lots of 30 or less, physical tests are authorized to be made on a ring at least 8 inches long cut from each cylinder and subjected to the same heat treatment as the finished cylinder.
                (4) Specimens for cylinders must conform to the following:
                (i) A gauge length of 8 inches with a width not over 11/2 inches, or a gauge length of 2 inches with a width not over 11/2 inches, or a gauge length at least 24 times the thickness with a width not over 6 times the thickness is authorized when a cylinder wall is not over 3/16 inch thick.
                (ii) The specimen, exclusive of grip ends, may not be flattened. Grip ends may be flattened to within 1 inch of each end of the reduced section. Heating of the specimen for any purpose is not authorized.
                (5) The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length. The following conditions apply:
                (i) The yield strength must be determined by either the “offset” method or the “extension under load” method as prescribed in ASTM E 8 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (ii) In using the “extension under load” method, the total strain (or “extension under load”) corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length. Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 30,000,000. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset.
                (iii) For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psi and the strain indicator reading being set at the calculated corresponding strain.
                (iv) Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed 1/8 inch per minute during yield strength determination.
                (k) Acceptable results for physical and flattening tests. Either of the following is an acceptable result:
                (1) An elongation of at least 40 percent for a 2 inch gauge length or at least 20 percent in other cases and yield strength not over 73 percent of tensile strength. In this instance, the flattening test is not required.
                (2) An elongation of at least 20 percent for a 2 inch gauge length or 10 percent in other cases. Flattening is required to 50 percent of the original outside diameter without cracking.
                (l) Rejected cylinders. Reheat-treatment is authorized for rejected cylinders. Subsequent thereto, containers must pass all prescribed tests to be acceptable. Repair of welded seams by welding prior to reheat-treatment is authorized.
                (m) Marking. Marking on each container by stamping plainly and permanently are only authorized where the metal is at least 0.09 inch thick, or on a metal nameplate permanently secured to the container by means other than soft solder, or by means that would not reduce the wall thickness.

                § 178.55
                Specification 4B240ET welded or brazed cylinders.
                (a) Type, spinning process, size and service pressure. A DOT 4B240ET cylinder is a brazed type cylinder made from electric resistance welded tubing. The maximum water capacity of this cylinder is 12 pounds or 333 cubic inches and the service must be 240 psig. The maximum outside diameter of the shell must be five inches and maximum length of the shell is 21 inches. Cylinders closed in by a spinning process are authorized.
                (b) Steel. Open-hearth, basic oxygen, or electric steel of uniform quality must be used. Plain carbon steel content may not exceed the following: Carbon, 0.25; phosphorus, 0.045; sulfur, 0.050. The addition of other elements for alloying effect is prohibited.
                (c) Identification of material. Material must be identified by any suitable method.
                (d) Manufacture. Cylinders must be manufactured using equipment and processes adequate to ensure that each cylinder produced conforms to the requirements of this subpart. No defect is permitted that is likely to weaken the finished cylinder appreciably. A reasonably smooth and uniform surface finish is required. Heads may be attached to shells by lap brazing or may be formed integrally. The thickness of the bottom of cylinders welded or formed by spinning is, under no condition, to be less than two times the minimum wall thickness of the cylindrical shell. Such bottom thicknesses must be measured within an area bounded by a line representing the points of contact between the cylinder and the floor when the cylinder is in a vertical position. Seams must conform to the following:
                (1) Circumferential seams must be by brazing only. Heads must be attached to shells by the lap brazing method and must overlap not less than four times the wall thickness. Brazing material must have a melting point of not less than 1000 °F. Heads must have a driving fit with the shell unless the shell is crimped, swedged, or curled over the skirt or flange of the head and be thoroughly brazed until complete penetration of the joint by the brazing material is secured. Brazed joints may be repaired by brazing.
                (2) Longitudinal seams in shell must be by electric resistance welded joints only. No repairs to longitudinal joints is permitted.
                (3) Welding procedures and operators must be qualified in accordance with CGA C-3 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (e) Welding or brazing. Only the attachment, by welding or brazing, to the tops and bottoms of cylinders of neckrings, footrings, handles, bosses, pads, and valve protection rings is authorized. Provided that such attachments and the portion of the container to which they are attached are made of weldable steel, the carbon content of which may not exceed 0.25 percent.
                (f) Wall thickness. The wall stress must be at least two times the service pressure and may not exceed 18,000 psi. The minimum wall thickness is 0.044 inch. Calculation must be made by the following formula:
                
                S = [P(1.3D2 + 0.4d2)] / (D2 − d2)
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  S = wall stress in psig;
                  P = 2 times service pressure;
                  D = outside diameter in inches;
                  d = inside diameter in inches.
                
                
                (g) Heat treatment. Heads formed by drawing or pressing must be uniformly and properly heat treated prior to tests. Cylinders with integral formed heads or bases must be subjected to a normalizing operation. Normalizing and brazing operations may be combined, provided the operation is carried out at a temperature in excess of the upper critical temperature of the steel.
                
                (h) Openings in cylinders. Openings in cylinders must comply with the following:
                (1) Each opening in cylinders, except those for safety devices, must be provided with a fitting, boss, or pad, securely attached to the cylinder by brazing or by welding or by threads. A fitting, boss, or pad must be of steel suitable for the method of attachment employed, and which need not be identified or verified as to analysis, except that if attachment is by welding, carbon content may not exceed 0.25 percent. If threads are used, they must comply with the following:
                (i) Threads must be clean cut, even without checks, and tapped to gauge.
                (ii) Taper threads to be of length not less than as specified for American Standard taper pipe threads.
                (iii) Straight threads, having at least 4 engaged threads, to have tight fit and calculated shear strength at least 10 times the test pressure of the cylinder; gaskets required, adequate to prevent leakage.
                (2) Closure of a fitting, boss, or pad must be adequate to prevent leakage.
                (i) Hydrostatic test. Each cylinder must successfully withstand a hydrostatic test as follows:
                (1) The test must be by water-jacket, or other suitable method, operated so as to obtain accurate data. The pressure gauge must permit reading to an accuracy of 1 percent. The expansion gauge must permit reading of total expansion to an accuracy of either 1 percent or 0.1 cubic centimeter.
                (2) Pressure must be maintained for at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure applied after heat-treatment and previous to the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure. If, due to failure of the test apparatus, the test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be repeated at a pressure increased by 10 percent or 100 psig, whichever is the lower.
                (3) Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of total volumetric expansion at test pressure.
                (4) Cylinders must be tested as follows:
                (i) At least one cylinder selected at random out of each lot of 200 or less must be tested as outlined in paragraphs (i)(1), (i)(2), and (i)(3) of this section to at least two times service pressure.
                (ii) All cylinders not tested as outlined in paragraph (i)(4)(i) of this section must be examined under pressure of at least two times service pressure and show no defect.
                (5) Each 1000 cylinders or less successively produced each day must constitute a lot. One cylinder must be selected from each lot and hydrostatically tested to destruction. If this cylinder bursts below five times the service pressure, then two additional cylinders must be selected and subjected to this test. If either of these cylinders fails by bursting below five times the service pressure then the entire lot must be rejected. All cylinders constituting a lot must be of identical size, construction heat-treatment, finish, and quality.
                (j) Flattening test. Following the hydrostatic test, one cylinder taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less, must be subjected to a flattening test that is between knife edges, wedge shaped, 60° angle, rounded to 1/2 inch radius.
                (k) Physical test. A physical test must be conducted to determine yield strength, tensile strength, elongation, and reduction of area of material, as follows:
                (1) The test is required on 2 specimens cut from 1 cylinder, or part thereof heat-treated as required, taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less in the case of cylinders of capacity greater than 86 cubic inches and out of each lot of 500 or less for cylinders having a capacity of 86 cubic inches or less.
                (2) Specimens must conform to the following:
                (i) A gauge length of 8 inches with a width not over 11/2 inches, a gauge length of 2 inches with a width not over 11/2 inches, or a gauge length at least 24 times the thickness with a width not over 6 times the thickness is authorized when a cylinder wall is not over 3/16 inch thick.

                (ii) The specimen, exclusive of grip ends, may not be flattened. Grip ends may be flattened to within one inch of each end of the reduced section.
                
                (iii) When size of cylinder does not permit securing straight specimens, the specimens may be taken in any location or direction and may be straightened or flattened cold by pressure only, not by blows. When specimens are so taken and prepared, the inspector's report must show in connection with record of physical tests detailed information in regard to such specimens.
                (iv) Heating of a specimen for any purpose is not authorized.
                (3) The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length. The following conditions apply:
                (i) The yield strength must be determined by either the “offset” method or the “extension under load” method as prescribed in ASTM E 8 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (ii) In using the “extension under load” method, the total strain (or “extension under load”) corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length. Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 30,000,000. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset.
                (iii) For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psi and the strain indicator reading being set at the calculated corresponding strain.
                (iv) Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed 1/8 inch per minute during yield strength determination.
                (l) Acceptable results for physical and flattening tests. Acceptable results for the physical and flattening tests are an elongation of at least 40 percent for a 2 inch gauge length or at least 20 percent in other cases and a yield strength not over 73 percent of tensile strength. In this instance the flattening test is required, without cracking, to six times the wall thickness with a weld 90° from the direction of the applied load. Two rings cut from the ends of length of pipe used in production of a lot may be used for the flattening test provided the rings accompany the lot which they represent in all thermal processing operations. At least one of the rings must pass the flattening test.
                (m) Leakage test. All spun cylinders and plugged cylinders must be tested for leakage by gas or air pressure after the bottom has been cleaned and is free from all moisture, subject to the following conditions:
                (1) Pressure, approximately the same as but no less than service pressure, must be applied to one side of the finished bottom over an area of at least 1/16 of the total area of the bottom but not less than 3/4 inch in diameter, including the closure, for at least 1 minute, during which time the other side of the bottom exposed to pressure must be covered with water and closely examined for indications of leakage. Except as provided in paragraph (n) of this section, cylinders which are leaking must be rejected.
                (2) A spun cylinder is one in which an end closure in the finished cylinder has been welded by the spinning process.
                (3) A plugged cylinder is one in which a permanent closure in the bottom of a finished cylinder has been effected by a plug.
                (4) As a safety precaution, if the manufacturer elects to make this test before the hydrostatic test, he should design his apparatus so that the pressure is applied to the smallest area practicable, around the point of closure, and so as to use the smallest possible volume of air or gas.
                (n) Rejected cylinders. Repairs of rejected cylinders is authorized. Cylinders that are leaking must be rejected, except that:
                (1) Spun cylinders rejected under the provisions of paragraph (m) of this section may be removed from the spun cylinder category by drilling to remove defective material, tapping, and plugging.
                (2) Brazed joints may be rebrazed.

                (3) Subsequent to the operations noted in paragraphs (n)(1) and (n)(2) of this section, acceptable cylinders must pass all prescribed tests.
                
                (o) Marking. Markings on each cylinder must be by stamping plainly and permanently on shoulder, top head, neck or valve protection collar which is permanently attached to the cylinders and forming an integral part thereof, provided that cylinders not less than 0.090 inch thick may be stamped on the side wall adjacent to top head.

The welded test plate must be of one of the heats in the lot of 200 or less which it represents, in the same condition and approximately the same thickness as the cylinder wall except that it may not be of a lesser thickness than that required for a quarter size Charpy impact specimen. The weld must be made by the same procedures and subjected to the same heat treatment as the major weld on the cylinder. The specimens must be taken across the major seam and must be prepared and tested in accordance with and must meet the requirements of CGA Pamphlet C-3. Should this specimen fail to meet the requirements, specimens may be taken from two additional cylinders or welded test plates from the same lot and tested. If either of the latter specimens fail to meet the requirements, the entire lot represented must be rejected.
                (2) Guided bend test. A root bend test specimen must be cut from the cylinder or a welded test plate, used for the tensile test specified in paragraph (l)(1) of this section. Specimens must be taken from across the major seam and must be prepared and tested in accordance with and must meet the requirements of CGA Pamphlet C-3.
                (3) Alternate guided-bend test. This test may be used and must be as required by CGA Pamphlet C-3. The specimen must be bent until the elongation at the outer surface, adjacent to the root of the weld, between the lightly scribed gage lines-a to b, is at least 20 percent, except that this percentage may be reduced for steels having a tensile strength in excess of 50,000 psi, as provided in paragraph (k) of this section.
                (m) Rejected cylinders. Reheat treatment of rejected cylinders is authorized. Subsequent thereto, cylinders must pass all prescribed tests to be acceptable. Repair of welded seams by welding is authorized.

                (1) On shoulders and top heads not less than 0.087 inch thick.
                (2) On neck, valve boss, valve protection sleeve, or similar part permanently attached to top end of cylinder.
                (3) On a plate attached to the top of the cylinder or permanent part thereof: sufficient space must be left on the plate to provide for stamping at least six retest dates: the plate must be at least 1/16 inch thick and must be attached by welding or by brazing at a temperature of at least 1100 °F, throughout all edges of the plate.
                (4) Variations in location of markings authorized only when necessitated by lack of space.

                (d) Manufacture. Cylinders must be manufactured using equipment and processes adequate to ensure that each cylinder produced conforms to the requirements of this subpart and to the following requirements:
                (1) No defect is permitted that is likely to weaken the finished cylinder appreciably. A reasonably smooth and uniform surface finish is required. The shell portion must be a reasonably true cylinder.
                (2) The heads must be seamless, concave side to the pressure, hemispherical or ellipsoidal in shape with the major diameter not more than twice the minor diameter.

The insulation on non-evacuated jackets must be covered with a steel jacket not less than 0.060-inch thick or an aluminum jacket not less than 0.070 inch thick, so constructed that moisture cannot come in contact with the insulating material. If a vacuum is maintained in the insulation space, the evacuated jacket must be designed for a minimum collapsing pressure of 30 psig differential whether made of steel or aluminum. The construction must be such that the total heat transfer, from the atmosphere at ambient temperature to the contents of the cylinder, will not exceed 0.0005 Btu per hour, per Fahrenheit degree differential in temperature, per pound of water capacity of the cylinder. For hydrogen, cryogenic liquid service, the total heat transfer, with a temperature differential of 520 Fahrenheit degrees, may not exceed that required to vent 30 SCF of hydrogen gas per hour.
                (4) For a cylinder having a design service temperature colder than minus 320 °F, a calculation of the maximum weight of contents must be made and that weight must be marked on the cylinder as prescribed in § 178.35.

In addition, an impact test of the weld must be performed in accordance with paragraph (l) of this section as part of the qualification of each welding procedure and operator.
                (e) Welding. Welding of the cylinder must be as follows:
                (1) All seams of the cylinder must be fusion welded. A means must be provided for accomplishing complete penetration of the joint. Only butt or joggle butt joints for the cylinder seams are authorized. All joints in the cylinder must have reasonably true alignment.

                (2) All attachments to the sidewalls and heads of the cylinder must be by fusion welding and must be of a weldable material complying with the impact requirements of paragraph (l) of this section.
                (3) For welding the cylinder, each procedure and operator must be qualified in accordance with the sections of CGA Pamphlet C-3 that apply. In addition, impact tests of the weld must be performed in accordance with paragraph (l) of this section as part of the qualification of each welding procedure and operator.
                (4) Brazing, soldering and threading are permitted only for joints not made directly to the cylinder body. Threads must comply with the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.
                (f) Wall thickness. The minimum wall thickness of the cylinder must be such that the calculated wall stress at the minimum required test pressure may not exceed the least value of the following:
                (1) 45,000 psi.
                (2) One-half of the minimum tensile strength across the welded seam determined in paragraph (l) of this section.
                (3) One-half of the minimum tensile strength of the base metal determined as required in paragraph (j) of this section.
                (4) The yield strength of the base metal determined as required in paragraph (l) of this section.
                (5) Further provided that wall stress for cylinders having longitudinal seams may not exceed 85 percent of the above value, whichever applies.

                (6) Calculation must be made by the following formula:
                
                S = [P(1.3D2 + 0.4d2)] / (D2 − d2)
                
                
                  where:
                  
                  S = wall stress in pounds psi;
                  P = minimum test pressure prescribed for pressure test in psig;
                  D = outside diameter in inches;
                  d = inside diameter in inches.
                
                
                (g) Heat treatment. Heat treatment is not permitted.
                (h) Openings in cylinder. Openings in cylinders must conform to the following:
                (1) Openings are permitted in heads only. They must be circular and may not exceed 3 inches in diameter or one third of the cylinder diameter, whichever is less. Each opening in the cylinder must be provided with a fitting, boss or pad, either integral with, or securely attached to, the cylinder body by fusion welding. Attachments to a fitting, boss or pad may be made by welding, brazing, mechanical attachment, or threading.
                (2) Threads must comply with the following:
                (i) Threads must be clean-cut, even, without checks and cut to gauge.
                (ii) Taper threads to be of a length not less than that specified for NPT.
                (iii) Straight threads must have at least 4 engaged threads, tight fit and calculated shear strength at least 10 times the test pressure of the cylinder. Gaskets, which prevent leakage and are inert to the hazardous material, are required.
                (i) Pressure test. Each cylinder, before insulating and jacketing, must be examined under a pressure of at least 2 times the service pressure maintained for at least 30 seconds without evidence of leakage, visible distortion or other defect. The pressure gauge must permit reading to an accuracy of 1 percent.
                (j) Physical test. A physical test must be conducted to determine yield strength, tensile strength, and elongation as follows:
                (1) The test is required on 2 specimens selected from material of each heat and in the same condition as that in the completed cylinder.
                (2) Specimens must conform to the following:
                (i) A gauge length of 8 inches with a width not over 11/2 inches, a gauge length of 2 inches with width not over 11/2 inches, or a gauge length at least 24 times thickness with a width not over 6 times thickness (authorized when cylinder wall is not over 1/16 inch thick).
                (ii) The specimen, exclusive of grip ends, may not be flattened. Grip ends may be flattened to within one inch of each end of the reduced section.

                (iii) When size of the cylinder does not permit securing straight specimens, the specimens may be taken in any location or direction and may be straightened or flattened cold by pressure only, not by blows. When specimens are so taken and prepared, the inspector's report must show in connection with record of physical tests detailed information in regard to such specimens.
                
                (iv) Heating of a specimen for any purpose is not authorized.
                (3) The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length. The following conditions apply:
                (i) The yield strength must be determined by either the “offset” method or the “extension under load” method as prescribed in ASTM E 8 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (ii) In using the “extension under load” method, the total strain (or “extension under load”), corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient accuracy by calculating the elastic expansion of the gauge length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length. Elastic extension calculations must be based on the elastic modulus of the material used. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset.
                (iii) For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain reference must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psi and the strain indicator reading being set at the calculated corresponding strain.
                (iv) Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed 1/8 inch per minute during yield strength determination.
                (k) Acceptable results for physical tests. Physical properties must meet the limits specified in paragraph (o)(1), table 1, of this section, for the particular steel in the annealed condition. The specimens must show at least a 20 percent elongation for a 2-inch gage length. Except that the percentage may be reduced numerically by 2 for each 7,500 psi increment of tensile strength above 100,000 psi to a maximum of 5 such increments. Yield strength and tensile strength must meet the requirements of paragraph (o)(1), table 1, of this section.
                (l) Tests of welds. Welds must be tested as follows:
                (1) Tensile test. A specimen must be cut from one cylinder of each lot of 200 or less, or welded test plate. The welded test plate must be of one of the heats in the lot of 200 or less which it represents, in the same condition and approximately the same thickness as the cylinder wall except that it may not be of a lesser thickness than that required for a quarter size Charpy impact specimen. The weld must be made by the same procedures and subjected to the same heat treatment as the major weld on the cylinder. The specimen must be taken across the major seam and must be prepared in accordance with and must meet the requirements of CGA Pamphlet C-3. Should this specimen fail to meet the requirements, specimens may be taken from two additional cylinders or welded test plates from the same lot and tested. If either of the latter specimens fails to meet the requirements, the entire lot represented must be rejected.
                (2) Guided bend test. A “root” bend test specimen must be cut from the cylinder or welded test plate, used for the tensile test specified in paragraph (l)(1) of this section and from any other seam or equivalent welded test plate if the seam is welded by a procedure different from that used for the major seam. Specimens must be taken across the particular seam being tested and must be prepared and tested in accordance with and must meet the requirements of CGA Pamphlet C-3.
                (3) Alternate guided-bend test. This test may be used and must be as specified in CGA Pamphlet C-3. The specimen must be bent until the elongation at the outer surface, adjacent to the root of the weld, between the lightly scribed gage lines a to b, is at least 20 percent, except that this percentage may be reduced for steels having a tensile strength in excess of 100,000 psig, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
                (4) Impact tests. One set of three impact test specimens (for each test) must be prepared and tested for determining the impact properties of the deposited weld metal—
                (i) As part of the qualification of the welding procedure.
                (ii) As part of the qualification of the operators.

                (iii) For each “heat” of welding rodor wire used.
                
                (iv) For each 1,000 feet of weld made with the same heat of welding rod or wire.
                (v) All impact test specimens must be of the charpy type, keyhole or milled U-notch, and must conform in all respects to ASTM E 23 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). Each set of impact specimens must be taken across the weld and have the notch located in the weld metal. When the cylinder material thickness is 2.5 mm or thicker, impact specimens must be cut from a cylinder or welded test plate used for the tensile or bend test specimens. The dimension along the axis of the notch must be reduced to the largest possible of 10 mm, 7.5 mm, 5 mm or 2.5 mm, depending upon cylinder thickness. When the material in the cylinder or welded test plate is not of sufficient thickness to prepare 2.5 mm impact test specimens, 2.5 mm specimens must be prepared from a welded test plate made from 1/8 inch thick material meeting the requirements specified in paragraph (o)(1), table 1, of this section and having a carbon analysis of .05 minimum, but not necessarily from one of the heats used in the lot of cylinders. The test piece must be welded by the same welding procedure as used on the particular cylinder seam being qualified and must be subjected to the same heat treatment.
                (vi) Impact test specimens must be cooled to the design service temperature. The apparatus for testing the specimens must conform to requirements of ASTM Standard E 23. The test piece, as well as the handling tongs, must be cooled for a length of time sufficient to reach the service temperature. The temperature of the cooling device must be maintained within a range of plus or minus 3 °F. The specimen must be quickly transferred from the cooling device to the anvil of the testing machine and broken within a time lapse of not more than six seconds.
                (vii) The impact properties of each set of impact specimens may not be less than the values in the following table:
                
                  
                    Size of specimen

                (viii) When the average value of the three specimens equals or exceeds the minimum value permitted for a single specimen and the value for more than one specimen is below the required average value, or when the value for one specimen is below the minimum value permitted for a single specimen, a retest of three additional specimens must be made. The value of each of these retest specimens must equal or exceed the required average value. When an erratic result is caused by a defective specimen, or there is uncertainty in test procedure, a retest is authorized.
                (m) Radiographic examination. Cylinders must be subject to a radiographic examination as follows:
                (1) The techniques and acceptability of radiographic inspection must conform to the standards set forth in CGA Pamphlet C-3.
                (2) One finished longitudinal seam must be selected at random from each lot of 100 or less successively produced and be radiographed throughout its entire length. Should the radiographic examination fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (m)(1) of this section, two additional seams of the same lot must be examined, and if either of these fail to meet the requirements of (m)(1) of this section, only those passing are acceptable.
                (n) Rejected cylinders. Reheat treatment of rejected cylinders is authorized. Subsequent thereto, cylinders must pass all prescribed tests to be acceptable. Welds may be repaired by suitable methods of fusion welding.
                (o) Authorized materials of construction. Authorized materials of construction are as follows:
                (1) Inner containment vessel (cylinder). Electric furnace steel of uniform quality must be used. Chemical analysis must conform to ASTM A 240/A 240M (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), Type 304 stainless steel. Chemical analysis must conform to ASTM A240, Type 304 Stainless Steel. A heat of steel made under table 1 and table 2 in this paragraph (o)(1) is acceptable, even though its check chemical analysis is slightly out of the specified range, if it is satisfactory in all other respects, provided the tolerances shown in table 3 in this paragraph (o)(1) are not exceeded. The following chemical analyses and physical properties are authorized:

                (4) Special orientation instructions must be marked on the cylinder (for example, THIS END UP), if the cylinder is used in an orientation other than vertical with openings at the top of the cylinder.
                (5) If the jacket of the cylinder is constructed of aluminum, the letters “AL” must be marked after the service pressure marking. Example: DOT-4L150 AL.
                (6) Except for serial number and jacket material designation, each marking prescribed in this paragraph (p) must be duplicated on each cylinder by any suitable means.
                (q) Inspector's report. In addition to the information required by § 178.35, the inspector's reports must contain information on:
                (1) The jacket material and insulation type;
                (2) The design service temperature

                (c) Identification of material. Materials must be identified by any suitable method except that plates and billets for hot-drawn containers must be marked with the heat number.
                (d) Manufacture. Cylinders must be manufactured in accordance with the following requirements:
                (1) By best appliances and methods. No defect is acceptable that is likely to weaken the finished container appreciably. A reasonably smooth and uniform surface finish is required. No abrupt change in wall thickness is permitted. Welding procedures and operators must be qualified in accordance with CGA Pamphlet C-3 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (2) All seams of the sphere or cylinders must be fusion welded. Seams must be of the butt or joggle butt type and means must be provided for accomplishing complete penetration of the joint.
                (e) Welding. Attachments to the container are authorized by fusion welding provided that such attachments are made of weldable steel, the carbon content of which may not exceed 0.25 percent except in the case of 4130 steel.
                (f) Wall thickness. The minimum wall thickness must be such that the wall stress at the minimum specified test pressure may not exceed 67 percent of the minimum tensile strength of the steel as determined from the physical and burst tests required and may not be over 70,000 p.s.i. For any diameter container, the minimum wall thickness is 0.040 inch. Calculations must be made by the formulas in (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section:

                (1) Calculation for a sphere must be made by the following formula:
                
                S = PD / 4tE
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  S = wall stress in pounds psi;
                  P = test pressure prescribed for water jacket test, i.e., at least 2 times service pressure, in psig;
                  D = outside diameter in inches;
                  t = minimum wall thickness in inches;
                  E = 0.85 (provides 85 percent weld efficiency factor which must be applied in the girth weld area and heat affected zones which zone must extend a distance of 6 times wall thickness from center line of weld);
                  E = 1.0 (for all other areas).
                
                

                (2) Calculation for a cylinder must be made by the following formula:
                
                S = [P(1.3D 2 + 0.4d 2)] / (D 2 − d 2)
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  S = wall stress in pounds psi;
                  P = test pressure prescribed for water jacket test, i.e., at least 2 times service pressure, in psig;
                  D = outside diameter in inches;
                  d = inside diameter in inches.
                
                
                
                (g) Heat treatment. The completed containers must be uniformly and properly heat-treated prior to tests. Heat-treatment of containers of the authorized analysis must be as follows:
                (1) All containers must be quenched by oil, or other suitable medium except as provided in paragraph (g)(4) of this section.
                (2) The steel temperature on quenching must be that recommended for the steel analysis, but may not exceed 1,750 °F.
                (3) The steel must be tempered at the temperature most suitable for the analysis except that in no case shall the tempering temperature be less than 1,000 °F.
                (4) The steel may be normalized at a temperature of 1,650 °F instead of being quenched, and containers so normalized need not be tempered.
                (5) All cylinders, if water quenched or quenched with a liquid producing a cooling rate in excess of 80 percent of the cooling rate of water, must be inspected by the magnetic particle or dye penetrant method to detect the presence of quenching cracks. Any cylinder found to have a quench crack must be rejected and may not be requalified.
                (h) Openings in container. Openings in the container must comply with the following requirements:
                (1) Each opening in the container must be provided with a fitting, boss, or pad of weldable steel securely attached to the container by fusion welding.
                (2) Attachments to a fitting, boss, or pad must be adequate to prevent leakage. Threads must comply with the following:
                (i) Threads must be clean cut, even, without checks, and tapped to gauge.
                (ii) Taper threads to be of length not less than as specified for American Standard taper pipe threads.
                (iii) Straight threads, having at least 4 engaged threads, to have tight fit and calculated shear strength at least 10 times the test pressure of the container; gaskets required, adequate to prevent leakage.
                (i) Hydrostatic test. Each cylinder must successfully withstand a hydrostatic test as follows:
                (1) The test must be by water-jacket, or other suitable method, operated so as to obtain accurate data. The pressure gauge must permit reading to an accuracy of 1 percent. The expansion gauge must permit reading of total expansion to accuracy either of 1 percent or 0.1 cubic centimeter.
                (2) Pressure must be maintained for at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure applied after heat-treatment and previous to the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure. If, due to failure of the test apparatus, the test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be repeated at a pressure increased by 10 percent or 100 psig, whichever is the lower.
                (3) Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of total volumetric expansion at test pressure.
                (4) Each container must be tested to at least 2 times service pressure.
                (j) Burst test. One container taken at random out of 200 or less must be hydrostatically tested to destruction. The rupture pressure must be included as part of the inspector's report.
                (k) Flattening test. Spheres and cylinders must be subjected to a flattening test as follows:
                (1) Flattening test for spheres. One sphere taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less must be subjected to a flattening test as follows:
                (i) The test must be performed after the hydrostatic test.
                (ii) The test must be at the weld between the parallel steel plates on a press with a welded seam, at right angles to the plates. Any projecting appurtenances may be cut off (by mechanical means only) prior to crushing.
                (2) Flattening test for cylinders. One cylinder taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less, must be subjected to a flattening test as follows:
                (i) The test must be performed after the hydrostatic test.
                (ii) The test cylinder must be placed between wedge-shaped knife edges having a 60° angle, rounded to a 1/2-inch radius.
                (l) Radiographic inspection. Radiographic examinations is required on all welded joints which are subjected to internal pressure, except that at the discretion of the disinterested inspector, openings less than 25 percent of the sphere diameter need not be subjected to radiographic inspection. Evidence of any defects likely to seriously weaken the container must be cause for rejection.
                (m) Physical test and specimens for spheres and cylinders. Spheres and cylinders must be subjected to a physical test as follows:
                (1) A physical test for a sphere is required on 2 specimens cut from a flat representative sample plate of the same heat taken at random from the steel used to produce the sphere. This flat steel from which the 2 specimens are to be cut must receive the same heat-treatment as the spheres themselves. Sample plates to be taken for each lot of 200 or less spheres.
                (2) Specimens for spheres have a gauge length of 2 inches with a width not over 11/2 inches, or a gauge length at least 24 times thickness with a width not over 6 times thickness is authorized when wall of sphere is not over 3/16 inch thick.
                (3) A physical test for cylinders is required on 2 specimens cut from 1 cylinder taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less.
                (4) Specimens for cylinder must conform to the following:
                (i) A gauge length of 8 inches with a width not over 11/2 inches, a gauge length of 2 inches with a width not over 11/2 inches, a gauge length at least 24 times thickness with a width not over 6 times thickness is authorized when a cylinder wall is not over 3/16 inch thick.
                (ii) The specimen, exclusive of grip ends, may not be flattened. Grip ends may be flattened to within 1 inch of each end of the reduced section.
                (iii) Heating of a specimen for any purpose is not authorized.
                (5) The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length. The following conditions apply:
                (i) The yield strength must be determined by either the “offset” method or the “extension under load” method as prescribed in ASTM E 8 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (ii) In using the “extension under load” method, the total strain (or “extension under load”) corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length. Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 30,000,000. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset.
                (iii) For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psi and the strain indicator reading being set at the calculated corresponding strain.
                (iv) Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed 1/8 inch per minute during yield strength determination.
                (n) Acceptable results for physical, flattening, and burst tests. The following are acceptable results of the physical, flattening and burst test:
                (1) Elongation must be at least 20 percent for a 2-inch gauge length or 10 percent in other cases.
                (2) Flattening is required to 50 percent of the original outside diameter without cracking.
                (3) Burst pressure must be at least 3 times service pressure.
                (o) Rejected containers. Reheat-treatment of rejected cylinders is authorized. Subsequent thereto, containers must pass all prescribed tests to be acceptable. Repair of welded seams by welding prior to reheat-treatment is authorized.
                (p) Marking. Markings on each container must be stamped plainly and permanently on a permanent attachment or on a metal nameplate permanently secured to the container by means other than soft solder.

                (d) Manufacture. Cylinders must be manufactured using equipment and processes adequate to ensure that each cylinder produced conforms to the requirements of this subpart. No defect is acceptable that is likely to weaken the finished cylinder appreciably. A reasonably smooth and uniform surface finish is required. Welding procedures and operators must be qualified in accordance with CGA Pamphlet C-3 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (e) Exposed bottom welds. Exposed bottom welds on cylinders over 18 inches long must be protected by footrings.
                (f) Heat treatment. Body and heads formed by drawing or pressing must be uniformly and properly heat treated prior to tests.
                (g) Openings. Openings in the cylinders must comply with the following:
                (1) Standard taper pipe threads are required;
                (2) Length may not be less than as specified for American Standard pipe threads; tapped to gauge; clean cut, even, and without checks.
                (h) Hydrostatic test. Each cylinder must successfully withstand a hydrostatic test as follows:
                (1) The test must be by water-jacket, or other suitable method, operated so as to obtain accurate data. The pressure gauge must permit reading to an accuracy of 1 percent. The expansion gauge must permit reading of total expansion to an accuracy of either 1 percent or 0.1 cubic centimeter.
                (2) Pressure must be maintained for at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure applied after heat-treatment and previous to the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure.

                (4) One cylinder out of each lot of 200 or less must be hydrostatically tested to at least 750 psig. Cylinders not so tested must be examined under pressure of between 500 and 600 psig and show no defect. If hydrostatically tested cylinder fails, each cylinder in the lot may be hydrostatically tested and those passing are acceptable.
                (i) Leakage test. Cylinders with bottoms closed in by spinning must be subjected to a leakage test by setting the interior air or gas pressure to not less than the service pressure. Cylinders which leak must be rejected.
                (j) Physical test. A physical test must be conducted as follows:
                (1) The test is required on 2 specimens cut longitudinally from 1 cylinder or part thereof taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less, after heat treatment.
                (2) Specimens must conform to a gauge length of 8 inches with a width not over 11/2 inches, a gauge length of 2 inches with width not over 11/2, or a gauge length at least 24 times thickness with a width not over 6 times thickness is authorized when a cylinder wall is not over 3/16 inch thick.
                (3) The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length. The following conditions apply:
                (i) The yield strength must be determined by either the “offset” method or the “extension under load” method as prescribed in ASTM E 8 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

                (ii) In using the “extension under load” method, the total strain (or “extension under load”) corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length. Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 30,000,000. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 offset.
                (iii) For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psi and the strain indicator reading being set at the calculated corresponding strain.

                (ii) The porous filling material must be uniform in quality and free of voids, except that a well drilled into the filling material beneath the valve is authorized if the well is filled with a material of such type that the functions of the filling material are not impaired;
                (iii) Overall shrinkage of the filling material is authorized if the total clearance between the cylinder shell and filling material, after solvent has been added, does not exceed 1/2 of 1 percent of the respective diameter or length, but not to exceed 1/8 inch, measured diametrically and longitudinally;
                (iv) The clearance may not impair the functions of the filling material;

                § 178.60
                Specification 8AL steel cylinders with porous fillings for acetylene.
                (a) Type and service pressure. A DOT 8AL cylinder is a seamless steel cylinder with a service pressure of 250 psig. However, the attachment of heads by welding or by brazing by dipping process and a welded circumferential body seam is authorized. Longitudinal seams are not authorized.
                (b) Authorized steel. The authorized steel is as specified in table I of appendix A to this part.
                (c) Identification of steel. Material must be identified by any suitable method except that plates and billets for hot-drawn cylinders must be marked with heat number.
                (d) Manufacture. Cylinders must be manufactured using equipment and processes adequate to ensure that each cylinder produced conforms to the requirements of this subpart. No defect is permitted that is likely to weaken the finished cylinder appreciably. A reasonably smooth and uniform surface finish is required. Welding procedures and operators must be qualified in accordance with CGA Pamphlet C-3 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (e) Footrings. Exposed bottom welds on cylinders over 18 inches long must be protected by footrings.
                (f) Welding or brazing. Welding or brazing for any purpose whatsoever is prohibited except as follows:
                (1) The attachment to the tops or bottoms of cylinders of neckrings, footrings, handlers, bosses, pads, and valve protecting rings is authorized provided that such attachments and the portion of the container to which they are attached are made of weldable steel, the carbon content of which may not exceed 0.25 percent.
                (2) Heat treatment is not required after welding or brazing weldable low carbon parts to attachments, specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, of similar material which have been previously welded or brazed to the top or bottom of cylinders and properly heat treated, provided such subsequent welding or brazing does not produce a temperature in excess of 400 °F in any part of the top or bottom material.
                (g) Wall thickness; wall stress. The wall thickness/wall stress of the cylinder must conform to the following:
                (1) The calculated wall stress at 750 psi may not exceed 35,000 psi, or one-half of the minimum ultimate strength of the steel as determined in paragraph (l) of this section, whichever value is the smaller. The measured wall thickness may not include galvanizing or other protective coating.

                (i) Calculation of wall stress must be made by the formula:
                
                S = [P(1.3D2 + 0.4d2)] / (D2 − d2)
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  S = wall stress in pounds psi;
                  P = 750 psig (minimum test pressure);
                  D = outside diameter in inches;
                  d = inside diameter in inches.
                
                
                
                (ii) Either D or d must be calculated from the relation D = d + 2t, where t = minimum wall thickness.
                (2) Cylinders with a wall thickness less than 0.100 inch, the ratio of straight side wall length to outside diameter may not exceed 3.5.
                (3) For cylinders having outside diameter over 5 inches, the minimum wall thickness must be 0.087 inch.
                (h) Heat treatment. Each cylinder must be uniformly and properly heat treated, prior to tests, by any suitable method in excess of 1100 °F. Heat treatment must be accomplished after all forming and welding operations, except that when brazed joints are used, heat treatment must follow any forming and welding operations but may be done before, during, or after the brazing operations. Liquid quenching is not authorized.
                (i) Openings. Standard taper pipe threads required in all openings. The length of the opening may not be less than as specified for American Standard pipe threads; tapped to gauge; clean cut, even, and without checks.
                (j) Hydrostatic test. Each cylinder must successfully withstand a hydrostatic test as follows:
                (1) The test must be by water-jacket, or other suitable method, operated so as to obtain accurate data. The pressure gauge must permit reading to an accuracy of 1 percent. The expansion gauge must permit reading of total expansion to an accuracy of either 1 percent or 0.1 cubic centimeter.
                (2) Pressure must be maintained for at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure applied after heat-treatment and previous to the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure.
                (3) Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of total volumetric expansion at test pressure.
                (4) One cylinder out of each lot of 200 or less must be hydrostatically tested to at least 750 psig. Cylinders not so tested must be examined under pressure of between 500 and 600 psig and show no defect. If a hydrostatically tested cylinder fails, each cylinder in the lot may be hydrostatically tested and those passing are acceptable.
                (k) Leakage test. Cylinders with bottoms closed in by spinning must be leakage tested by setting the interior air or gas pressure at not less than the service pressure. Any cylinder that leaks must be rejected.
                (l) Physical test. A physical test must be conducted as follows;
                (1) The test is required on 2 specimens cut longitudinally from 1 cylinder or part thereof taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less, after heat treatment.
                (2) Specimens must conform to a gauge length of 8 inches with a width not over 11/2 inches, a gauge length 2 inches with a width not over 11/2 inches, or a gauge length at least 24 times thickness with a width not over 6 times thickness is authorized when a cylinder wall is not over 3/16 inch thick.
                (3) The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length. The following conditions apply:
                (i) The yield strength must be determined by either the “offset” method or the “extension under load” method as prescribed in ASTM E 8 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (ii) In using the “extension under load” method, the total strain (or “extension under load”) corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length. Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 30,000,000. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 offset.
                (iii) For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psi, the strain indicator reading being set at the calculated corresponding strain.
                (iv) Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed 1/8 inch per minute during yield strength determination.
                (m) Elongation. Physical test specimens must show at least a 40 percent elongation for a 2 inch gauge length or at least a 20 percent elongation in other cases. Except that these elongation percentages may be reduced numerically by 2 for 2 inch specimens and 1 in other cases for each 7,500 psi increment of tensile strength above 50,000 psi to a maximum of four such increments.
                (n) Weld tests. Specimens taken across the circumferentially welded seam must be cut from one cylinder taken at random from each lot of 200 or less cylinders after heat treatment and must pass satisfactorily the following tests:
                (1) Tensile test. A specimen must be cut from one cylinder of each lot of 200 or less, or welded test plate. The specimen must be taken from across the major seam and must be prepared and tested in accordance with and must meet the requirements of CGA Pamphlet C-3. Should this specimen fail to meet the requirements, specimens may be taken from two additional cylinders or welded test plates from the same lot and tested. If either of the latter specimens fail to meet the requirements, the entire lot represented must be rejected.
                (2) Guided bend test. A root bend test specimen must be cut from the cylinder or welded test plate, used for the tensile test specified in paragraph (n)(1) of this section. Specimens must be prepared and tested in accordance with and must meet the requirements of CGA Pamphlet C-3.
                (3) Alternate guided-bend test. This test may be used and must be as required by CGA Pamphlet C-3. The specimen must be bent until the elongation at the outer surface, adjacent to the root of the weld, between the lightly scribed gage lines-a to b, must be at least 20 percent, except that this percentage may be reduced for steels having a tensile strength in excess of 50,000 psi, as provided in paragraph (m) of this section.
                (o) Rejected cylinders. Reheat treatment of rejected cylinders is authorized. Subsequent thereto, cylinders must pass all prescribed tests to be acceptable. Repair by welding is authorized.
                (p) Porous filling. (1) Cylinders must be filled with a porous material in accordance with the following:
                (i) The porous material may not disintegrate or sag when wet with solvent or when subjected to normal service;
                (ii) The filling material must be uniform in quality and free of voids, except that a well drilled into the filling material beneath the valve is authorized if the well is filled with a material of such type that the functions of the filling material are not impaired;

                (iv) The clearance may not impair the functions of the filling material;
                (v) The installed filling material must meet the requirements of CGA C-12 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter); and

                (2) When the porosity of each cylinder is not known, a cylinder taken at random from a lot of 200 or less must be tested for porosity. If the test cylinder fails, each cylinder in the lot may be tested individually and those cylinders that pass the test are acceptable.
                (3) For filling that is molded and dried before insertion in cylinders, porosity test may be made on sample block taken at random from material to be used.

                § 178.61
                Specification 4BW welded steel cylinders with electric-arc welded longitudinal seam.
                (a) Type, size and service pressure. A DOT 4BW cylinder is a welded type steel cylinder with a longitudinal electric-arc welded seam, a water capacity (nominal) not over 1,000 pounds and a service pressure at least 225 and not over 500 psig gauge. Cylinders closed in by spinning process are not authorized.
                (b) Authorized steel. Steel used in the construction of the cylinder must conform to the following:
                (1) The body of the cylinder must be constructed of steel conforming to the limits specified in table 1 of appendix A to this part.

                (2) Material for heads must meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section or be open hearth, electric or basic oxygen carbon steel of uniform quality. Content percent may not exceed the following: Carbon 0.25, Manganese 0.60, Phosphorus 0.045, Sulfur 0.050. Heads must be hemispherical or ellipsoidal in shape with a maximum ratio of 2.1. If low carbon steel is used, the thickness of such heads must be determined by using a maximum wall stress of 24,000 p.s.i. in the formula described in paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
                (c) Identification of material. Material must be identified by any suitable method.
                (d) Manufacture. Cylinders must be manufactured using equipment and processes adequate to ensure that each cylinder produced conforms to the requirements of this subpart and the following:
                (1) No defect is permitted that is likely to weaken the finished cylinder appreciably. A reasonably smooth and uniform surface is required. Exposed bottom welds on cylinders over 18 inches long must be protected by footrings. Minimum thickness of heads may not be less than 90 percent of the required thickness of the sidewall. Heads must be concave to pressure.
                (2) Circumferential seams must be by electric-arc welding. Joints must be butt with one member offset (joggle butt) or lap with minimum overlap of at least four times nominal sheet thickness.
                (3) Longitudinal seams in shells must conform to the following:
                (i) Longitudinal electric-arc welded seams must be of the butt welded type. Welds must be made by a machine process including automatic feed and welding guidance mechanisms. Longitudinal seams must have complete joint penetration, and must be free from undercuts, overlaps or abrupt ridges or valleys. Misalignment of mating butt edges may not exceed 1/6 of nominal sheet thickness or 1/32 inch whichever is less. All joints with nominal sheet thickness up to and including 1/8 inch must be tightly butted. When nominal sheet thickness is greater than 1/8 inch, the joint must be gapped with maximum distance equal to one-half the nominal sheet thickness or 1/32 inch whichever is less. Joint design, preparation and fit-up must be such that requirements of this paragraph (d) are satisfied.
                (ii) Maximum joint efficiency must be 1.0 when each seam is radiographed completely. Maximum joint efficiency must be 0.90 when one cylinder from each lot of 50 consecutively welded cylinders is spot radiographed. In addition, one out of the first five cylinders welded following a shut down of welding operations exceeding four hours must be spot radiographed. Spot radiographs, when required, must be made of a finished welded cylinder and must include the girth weld for 2 inches in both directions from the intersection of the longitudinal and girth welds and include at least 6 inches of the longitudinal weld. Maximum joint efficacy of 0.75 must be permissible without radiography.
                (4) Welding procedures and operators must be qualified in accordance with CGA Pamphlet C-3 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (e) Welding of attachments. The attachment to the tops and bottoms only of cylinders by welding of neckrings, footrings, handles, bosses, pads and valve protection rings is authorized provided that such attachments and the portion of the container to which they are attached are made of weldable steel, the carbon content of which may not exceed 0.25 percent.
                (f) Wall thickness. For outside diameters over 6 inches the minimum wall thickness must be 0.078 inch. For a cylinder with a wall thickness less than 0.100 inch, the ratio of tangential length to outside diameter may not exceed 4 to1 (4:1). In any case the minimum wall thickness must be such that the wall stress calculated by the formula listed in paragraph (f)(4) of this section may not exceed the lesser value of any of the following:
                (1) The value referenced in paragraph (b) of this section for the particular material under consideration.
                (2) One-half of the minimum tensile strength of the material determined as required in paragraph (j) of this section.
                (3) 35,000 psi.

                (4) Stress must be calculated by the following formula:
                
                S = [2P(1.3D2 + 0.4d2)] / [E(D2 − d2)]
                
                
                  where:
                  
                  S = wall stress, psi;
                  P = service pressure, psig;
                  D = outside diameter, inches;
                  d = inside diameter, inches;
                  E = joint efficiency of the longitudinal seam (from paragraph (d) of this section).
                
                
                
                (g) Heat treatment. Each cylinder must be uniformly and properly heat treated prior to test by the applicable method referenced in Table 1 of appendix A to this part. Heat treatment must be accomplished after all forming and welding operations. Heat treatment is not required after welding or brazing of weldable low carbon parts to attachments of similar material which have been previously welded to the top or bottom of cylinders and properly heat treated, provided such subsequent welding or brazing does not produce a temperature in excess of 400 °F in any part of the top or bottom material.
                (h) Openings in cylinders. Openings in the cylinder must conform to the following:
                (1) All openings must be in the heads or bases.
                (2) Openings in cylinders must be provided with adequate fittings, bosses, or pads, integral with or securely attached to the cylinder by welding.
                (3) Threads must comply with the following:
                (i) Threads must be clean cut and to gauge.
                (ii) Taper threads must be of length not less than as specified for American Standard Taper Pipe threads.
                (iii) Straight threads, having at least 4 engaged threads, to have tight fit and calculated shear strength at least 10 times the test pressure of the cylinder; gaskets required, adequate to prevent leakage.
                (4) Closure of fittings, boss or pads must be adequate to prevent leakage.
                (i) Hydrostatic test. Cylinders must withstand a hydrostatic test, as follows:
                (1) The test must be by water-jacket, or other suitable method, operated so as to obtain accurate data. The pressure gauge must permit readings to an accuracy of 1 percent. The expansion gauge must permit readings of total volumetric expansion to an accuracy either of 1 percent or 0.1 cubic centimeter.
                (2) Pressure must be maintained for at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure applied after heat treatment and previous to the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure.
                (3) Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of the total volumetric expansion at test pressure.
                (4) Cylinders must be tested as follows:
                (i) At least 1 cylinder selected at random out of each lot of 200 or less must be tested as outlined in paragraphs (i)(1), (i)(2), and (i)(3) of this section to at least two times service pressure.
                (ii) All cylinders not tested as outlined in paragraph (i)(4)(i) of this section must be examined under pressure of at least two times service pressure and show no defect.
                (5) One finished cylinder selected at random out of each lot of 500 or less successively produced must be hydrostatically tested to 4 times service pressure without bursting.
                (j) Physical tests. Cylinders must be subjected to a physical test as follows:
                (1) Specimens must be taken from one cylinder after heat treatment and chosen at random from each lot of 200 or less, as follows:
                (i) Body specimen. One specimen must be taken longitudinally from the body section at least 90 degrees away from the weld.
                (ii) Head specimen. One specimen must be taken from either head on a cylinder when both heads are made of the same material. However, if the two heads are made of differing materials, a specimen must be taken from each head.
                (iii) If due to welded attachments on the top head there is insufficient surface from which to take a specimen, it may be taken from a representative head of the same heat treatment as the test cylinder.
                (2) Specimens must conform to the following:
                (i) A gauge length of 8 inches with a width not over 11/2 inches, a gauge length of 2 inches with a width not over 11/2 inches, or a gauge length at least 24 times thickness with a width not over 6 times thickness is authorized when a cylinder wall is not over 3/16 inch thick.

                (ii) The specimen, exclusive of grip ends, may not be flattened. Grip ends may be flattened to within 1 inch of each end of the reduced section.
                
                (iii) When size of the cylinder does not permit securing straight specimens, the specimens may be taken in any location or direction and may be straightened or flattened cold, by pressure only, not by blows when specimens are so taken and prepared, the inspector's report must show in connection with record of physical tests detailed information in regard to such specimens.
                (iv) Heating of a specimen for any purpose is not authorized.
                (3) The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length. The following conditions apply:
                (i) The yield strength must be determined by either the “off-set” method or the “extension under load” method as prescribed in ASTM E 8 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (ii) In using the “extension under load” method, the total strain (or “extension under load”), corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2-percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length. Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 30,000,000. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2-percent offset.
                (iii) For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain reference must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psi and the strain indicator reading being set at the calculated corresponding strain.
                (iv) Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed 1/8 inch per minute during yield strength determination.
                (k) Elongation. Physical test specimens must show at least a 40 percent elongation for a 2-inch gauge length or at least a 20 percent elongation in other cases. Except that these elongation percentages may be reduced numerically by 2 for 2-inch specimens and by 1 in other cases for each 7,500 psi increment of tensile strength above 50,000 psi to a maximum of four increments.
                (l) Tests of welds. Welds must be subjected to the following tests:
                (1) Tensile test. A specimen must be cut from one cylinder of each lot of 200 or less. The specimen must be taken from across the longitudinal seam and must be prepared and tested in accordance with and must meet the requirements of CGA Pamphlet C-3.
                (2) Guided bend test. A root test specimen must be cut from the cylinder used for the tensile test specified in paragraph (l)(1) of this section. Specimens must be taken from across the longitudinal seam and must be prepared and tested in accordance with and must meet the requirements of CGA Pamphlet C-3.
                (3) Alternate guided bend test. This test may be used and must be as required by CGA Pamphlet C-3. The specimen must be bent until the elongation at the outer surface, adjacent to the root of the weld, between the lightly scribed gauge lines a to b, must be at least 20 percent, except that this percentage may be reduced for steels having a tensile strength in excess of 50,000 psi, as provided in paragraph (k) of this section.
                (m) Radiographic examination. Welds of the cylinders must be subjected to a radiographic examination as follows:
                (1) Radiographic inspection must conform to the techniques and acceptability criteria set forth in CGA Pamphlet C-3. When fluoroscopic inspection is used, permanent film records need not be retained.
                (2) Should spot radiographic examination fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (m)(1) of this section, two additional welds from the same lot of 50 cylinders or less must be examined, and if either of these fail to meet the requirements, each cylinder must be examined as previously outlined; only those passing are acceptable.
                (n) Rejected cylinders. (1) Unless otherwise stated, if a sample cylinder or specimen taken from a lot of cylinders fails the prescribed test, then two additional specimens must be selected from the same lot and subjected to the prescribed test. If either of these fails the test, then the entire lot must be rejected.
                
                (2) Reheat treatment of rejected cylinders is authorized. Subsequent thereto, cylinders must pass all prescribed tests to be acceptable. Repair of welded seams by welding is authorized provided that all defective metal is cut away and the joint is rewelded as prescribed for original welded joints.
                (o) Markings. Markings must be stamped plainly and permanently in any of the following locations on the cylinder:
                (1) On shoulders and top heads when they are not less than 0.087-inch thick.
                (2) On a metal plate attached to the top of the cylinder or permanent part thereof; sufficient space must be left on the plate to provide for stamping at least six retest dates; the plate must be at least 1/16-inch thick and must be attached by welding, or by brazing. The brazing rod is to melt at a temperature of 1100 °F Welding or brazing must be along all the edges of the plate.
                (3) On the neck, valve boss, valve protection sleeve, or similar part permanently attached to the top of the cylinder.
                (4) On the footring permanently attached to the cylinder, provided the water capacity of the cylinder does not exceed 25 pounds.
                (p) Inspector's report. In addition to the information required by § 178.35, the inspector's report must indicate the type and amount of radiography.

                (d) Wall thickness. The minimum wall thickness must be such that the wall stress at test pressure does not exceed the yield strength of the material of the finished cylinder wall. Calculations must be made by the following formulas:

                (1) Calculation of the stress for cylinders must be made by the following formula:
                
                S = [P(1.3D2 + 0.4d2)] / (D2 − d2)
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  S = Wall stress, in psi;
                  P = Test pressure in psig;
                  D = Outside diameter, in inches;
                  d = Inside diameter, in inches.
                
                

                (2) Calculation of the stress for spheres must be made by the following formula:
                
                S = PD / 4t
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  S = Wall stress, in psi;
                  P = Test pressure i psig;
                  D = Outside diameter, in inches;
                  t = Minimum wall thickness, in inches.
                
                
                (e) Openings and attachments. Openings and attachments must conform to the following:
                (1) Openings and attachments are permitted on heads only.
                (2) All openings and their reinforcements must be within an imaginary circle, concentric to the axis of the cylinder. The diameter of the circle may not exceed 80 percent of the outside diameter of the cylinder. The plane of the circle must be parallel to the plane of a circumferential weld and normal to the long axis of the cylinder.
                (3) Unless a head has adequate thickness, each opening must be reinforced by a securely attached fitting, boss, pad, collar, or other suitable means.
                (4) Material used for welded openings and attachments must be of weldable quality and compatible with the material of the cylinder.
                (f) Pressure tests. (1) Each cylinder must be tested at an internal pressure of at least the test pressure and must be held at that pressure for at least 30 seconds.
                (i) The leakage test must be conducted by submersion under water or by some other method that will be equally sensitive.
                (ii) If the cylinder leaks, evidences visible distortion, or any other defect, while under test, it must be rejected (see paragraph (h) of this section).
                (2) One cylinder taken from the beginning of each lot, and one from each 1,000 or less successively produced within the lot thereafter, must be hydrostatically tested to destruction. The entire lot must be rejected (see paragraph (h) of this section) if:
                (i) A failure occurs at a gage pressure less than 2.0 times the test pressure;
                (ii) A failure initiates in a braze or a weld or the heat affected zone thereof;
                (iii) A failure is other than in the sidewall of a cylinder longitudinal with its long axis; or
                (iv) In a sphere, a failure occurs in any opening, reinforcement, or at a point of attachment.

                (3) A “lot” is defined as the quantity of cylinders successively produced per production shift (not exceeding 10 hours) having identical size, design, construction, material, heat treatment, finish, and quality.
                (g) Flattening test. One cylinder must be taken from the beginning of production of each lot (as defined in paragraph (f)(3) of this section) and subjected to a flattening test as follows:
                (1) The flattening test must be made on a cylinder that has been tested at test pressure.
                (2) A ring taken from a cylinder may be flattened as an alternative to a test on a complete cylinder. The test ring may not include the heat affected zone or any weld. However, for a sphere, the test ring may include the circumferential weld if it is located at a 45 degree angle to the ring, ±5 degrees.
                (3) The flattening must be between 60 degrees included-angle, wedge shaped knife edges, rounded to a 0.5 inch radius.
                (4) Cylinders and test rings may not crack when flattened so that their outer surfaces are not more than six times wall thickness apart when made of steel or not more than ten times wall thickness apart when made of aluminum.
                (5) If any cylinder or ring cracks when subjected to the specified flattening test, the lot of cylinders represented by the test must be rejected (see paragraph (h) of this section).
                (h) Rejected cylinders. Rejected cylinders must conform to the following requirements:
                (1) If the cause for rejection of a lot is determinable, and if by test or inspection defective cylinders are eliminated from the lot, the remaining cylinders must be qualified as a new lot under paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section.
                (2) Repairs to welds are permitted. Following repair, a cylinder must pass the pressure test specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
                (3) If a cylinder made from seamless steel tubing fails the flattening test described in paragraph (g) of this section, suitable uniform heat treatment must be used on each cylinder in the lot. All prescribed tests must be performed subsequent to this heat treatment.
                (i) Markings. (1) The markings required by this section must be durable and waterproof. The requirements of § 178.35(h) do not apply to this section.
                (2) Required markings are as follows:

                    1 Analysis must regularly be made only for the elements specifically mentioned in this table. If, however, the presence of other elements is indicated in the course of routine analysis, further analysis should be made to determine conformance with the limits specified for other elements.
                
                (c) Identification. Material must be identified by any suitable method that will identify the alloy and manufacturer's lot number.
                (d) Manufacture. Cylinders must be manufactured using equipment and processes adequate to ensure that each cylinder produced conforms to the requirements of this subpart. No defect is permitted that is likely to weaken the finished cylinder appreciably. A reasonably smooth and uniform surface finish is required. All welding must be by the gas shielded arc process.
                (e) Welding. The attachment to the tops and bottoms only of cylinders by welding of neckrings or flanges, footrings, handles, bosses and pads and valve protection rings is authorized. However, such attachments and the portion of the cylinder to which it is attached must be made of weldable aluminum alloys.
                (f) Wall thickness. The wall thickness of the cylinder must conform to the following:
                (1) The minimum wall thickness of the cylinder must be 0.140 inch. In any case, the minimum wall thickness must be such that calculated wall stress at twice service pressure may not exceed the lesser value of either of the following:
                (i) 20,000 psi.
                (ii) One-half of the minimum tensile strength of the material as required in paragraph (j) of this section.

                (2) Calculation must be made by the following formula:
                
                S = [P(1.3D2 + 0.4d2)] / (D2 − d2)
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  S = wall stress in psi;
                  P = minimum test pressure prescribed for water jacket test;
                  D = outside diameter in inches;
                  d = inside diameter in inches.
                
                
                (3) Minimum thickness of heads and bottoms may not be less than the minimum required thickness of the side wall.
                (g) Opening in cylinder. Openings in cylinders must conform to the following:
                (1) All openings must be in the heads or bases.
                (2) Each opening in cylinders, except those for safety devices, must be provided with a fitting, boss, or pad, securely attached to cylinder by welding by inert gas shielded arc process or by threads. If threads are used, they must comply with the following:
                (i) Threads must be clean-cut, even, without checks and cut to gauge.
                (ii) Taper threads to be of length not less than as specified for American Standard taper pipe threads.
                (iii) Straight threads, having at least 4 engaged threads, to have tight fit and calculated shear strength at least 10 times the test pressure of the cylinder; gaskets required, adequate to prevent leakage.
                (3) Closure of a fitting, boss, or pad must be adequate to prevent leakage.
                (h) Hydrostatic test. Each cylinder must successfully withstand a hydrostatic test, as follows:
                (1) The test must be by water jacket, or other suitable method, operated so as to obtain accurate data. The pressure gauge must permit reading to an accuracy of 1 percent. The expansion gauge must permit a reading of the total expansion to an accuracy either of 1 percent or 0.1 cubic centimeter.

                (2) Pressure of 2 times service pressure must be maintained for at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to insure complete expansion. Any internal pressure applied previous to the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure. If, due to failure of the test apparatus, the test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be repeated at a pressure increased by 10 percent over the pressure otherwise specified.
                (3) Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 12 percent of total volumetric expansion at test pressure.
                (4) Cylinders having a calculated wall stress of 18,000 psi or less at test pressure may be tested as follows:
                (i) At least one cylinder selected at random out of each lot of 200 or less must be tested in accordance with paragraphs (h)(1), (h)(2), and (h)(3) of this section.
                (ii) All cylinders not tested as provided in paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section must be examined under pressure of at least 2 times service pressure and show no defect.
                (5) One finished cylinder selected at random out of each lot of 1,000 or less must be hydrostatically tested to 4 times the service pressure without bursting. Inability to meet this requirement must result in rejection of the lot.
                (i) Flattening test. After hydrostatic testing, a flattening test is required on one section of a cylinder, taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less as follows:
                (1) If the weld is not at midlength of the cylinder, the test section must be no less in width than 30 times the cylinder wall thickness. The weld must be in the center of the section. Weld reinforcement must be removed by machining or grinding so that the weld is flush with the exterior of the parent metal. There must be no evidence of cracking in the sample when it is flattened between flat plates to no more than 6 times the wall thickness.
                (2) If the weld is at midlength of the cylinder, the test may be made as specified in paragraph (i)(1) of this section or must be made between wedge shaped knife edges (60° angle) rounded to a 1/2 inch radius. There must be no evidence of cracking in the sample when it is flattened to no more than 6 times the wall thickness.
                (j) Physical test. A physical test must be conducted to determine yield strength, tensile strength, elongation, and reduction of area of material as follows:
                (1) The test is required on 2 specimens cut from one cylinder or part thereof taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less.
                (2) Specimens must conform to the following:
                (i) A gauge length of 8 inches with a width not over 11/2 inches, a gauge length of 2 inches with a width not over 11/2 inches.
                (ii) The specimen, exclusive of grip ends, may not be flattened. Grip ends may be flattened to within 1 inch of each end of the reduced section.
                (iii) When size of cylinder does not permit securing straight specimens, the specimens may be taken in any location or direction and may be straightened or flattened cold, by pressure only, not by blows; when specimens are so taken and prepared, the inspector's report must show in connection with record of physical test detailed information in regard to such specimens.
                (iv) Heating of a specimen for any purpose is not authorized.
                (3) The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length. The following conditions apply:
                (i) The yield strength must be determined by the “offset” method as prescribed in ASTM E 8 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (ii) Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed 1/8 inch per minute during yield strength determination.
                (k) Acceptable results for physical tests. An acceptable result of the physical test requires an elongation to at least 7 percent and yield strength not over 80 percent of tensile strength.
                (l) Weld tests. Welds of the cylinder are required to successfully pass the following tests:
                (1) Reduced section tensile test. A specimen must be cut from the cylinder used for the physical tests specified in paragraph (j) of this section. The specimen must be taken from across the seam, edges must be parallel for a distance of approximately 2 inches on either side of the weld. The specimen must be fractured in tension. The apparent breaking stress calculated on the minimum wall thickness must be at least equal to 2 times the stress calculated under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, and in addition must have an actual breaking stress of at least 30,000 psi. Should this specimen fail to meet the requirements, specimens may be taken from 2 additional cylinders from the same lot and tested. If either of the latter specimens fails to meet requirements, the entire lot represented must be rejected.
                (2) Guided bend test. A bend test specimen must be cut from the cylinder used for the physical test specified in paragraph (j) of this section. Specimen must be taken across the seam, must be a minimum of 11/2 inches wide, edges must be parallel and rounded with a file, and back-up strip, if used, must be removed by machining. The specimen shall be tested as follows:
                (i) The specimen must be bent to refusal in the guided bend test jig as illustrated in paragraph 6.10 of CGA C-3 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). The root of the weld (inside surface of the cylinder) must be located away from the ram of the jig. The specimen must not show a crack or other open defect exceeding 1/8 inch in any direction upon completion of the test. Should this specimen fail to meet the requirements, specimens may be taken from each of 2 additional cylinders from the same lot and tested. If either of the latter specimens fails to meet requirements, the entire lot represented must be rejected.
                (ii) Alternatively, the specimen may be tested in a guided bend test jig as illustrated in Figure 12.1 of The Aluminum Association's 2002 publication, “Welding Aluminum: Theory and Practice.” The root of the weld (inside surface of the cylinder) must be located away from the mandrel of the jig. No specimen must show a crack or other open defect exceeding 1/8 inch in any direction upon completion of the test. Should this specimen fail to meet the requirements, specimens may be taken from each of 2 additional cylinders from the same lot and tested. If either of the latter specimens fails to meet requirements, the entire lot represented must be rejected.
                (m) Rejected cylinders. Repair of welded seams is authorized. Acceptable cylinders must pass all prescribed tests.
                (n) Inspector's report. In addition to the information required by § 178.35, the record of chemical analyses must also include applicable information on iron, titanium, zinc, and magnesium used in the construction of the cylinder.

UN pressure receptacles and service equipment constructed according to the standards applicable at the date of manufacture may continue in use subject to the continuing qualification and maintenance provisions of part 180 of this subchapter. Requirements for approval, qualification, maintenance, and testing are contained in § 178.70, and subpart C of part 180 of this subchapter.
                (b) Definitions. The following definitions apply for the purposes of design and construction of UN pressure receptacles under this subpart:
                
                  Alternative arrangement means an approval granted by the Associate Administrator for a MEGC that has been designed, constructed or tested to the technical requirements or testing methods other than those specified for UN pressure receptacles in part 178 or part 180 of this subchapter.
                
                  Bundle of cylinders. See § 171.8 of this subchapter.
                
                  Design type means a pressure receptacle design as specified by a particular pressure receptacle standard.
                
                  Design type approval means an overall approval of the manufacturer's quality system and design type of each pressure receptacle to be produced within the manufacturer's facility.
                
                  UN tube. See § 171.8 of this subchapter.
                (c) Following the final heat treatment, all cylinders, except those selected for batch testing must be subjected to a proof pressure or a hydraulic volumetric expansion test.
                (d) Service equipment. (1) Except for pressure relief devices, UN pressure receptacle equipment, including valves, piping, fittings, and other equipment subjected to pressure must be designed and constructed to withstand at least 1.5 times the test pressure of the pressure receptacle.

                (2) Service equipment must be configured or designed to prevent damage that could result in the release of the pressure receptacle contents during normal conditions of handling and transport. Manifold piping leading to shut-off valves must be sufficiently flexible to protect the valves and the piping from shearing or releasing the pressure receptacle contents. The filling and discharge valves and any protective caps must be secured against unintended opening. The valves must conform to ISO 10297:2014(E) or ISO 13340:2001(E) (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter) for non-refillable pressure receptacles, and be protected as specified in § 173.301b(f) of this subchapter. Until December 31, 2020, the manufacture of a valve conforming to the requirements in ISO 10297:2006(E) (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter) is authorized. Until December 31, 2008, the manufacture of a valve conforming to the requirements in ISO 10297:1999(E) (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter) is authorized.
                (3) UN pressure receptacles that cannot be handled manually or rolled, must be equipped with devices (e.g., skids, rings, straps) ensuring that they can be safely handled by mechanical means and so arranged as not to impair the strength of, nor cause undue stresses, in the pressure receptacle.
                (4) Pressure receptacles filled by volume must be equipped with a level indicator.
                (e) Bundles of cylinders. UN pressure receptacles assembled in bundles must be structurally supported and held together as a unit and secured in a manner that prevents movement in relation to the structural assembly and movement that would result in the concentration of harmful local stresses. The frame design must ensure stability under normal operating conditions.
                (1) The frame must securely retain all the components of the bundle and must protect them from damage during conditions normally incident to transportation. The method of cylinder restraint must prevent any vertical or horizontal movement or rotation of the cylinder that could cause undue strain on the manifold. The total assembly must be able to withstand rough handling, including being dropped or overturned.

                (2) The frame must include features designed for the handling and transportation of the bundle. The lifting rings must be designed to withstand a design load of 2 times the maximum gross weight. Bundles with more than one lifting ring must be designed such that a minimum sling angle of 45 degrees to the horizontal can be achieved during lifting using the lifting rings. If four lifting rings are used, their design must be strong enough to allow the bundle to be lifted by two rings. Where two or four lifting rings are used, diametrically opposite lifting rings must be aligned with each other to allow for correct lifting using shackle pins. If the bundle is filled with forklift pockets, it must contain two forklift pockets on each side from which it is to be lifted. The forklift pockets must be positioned symmetrically consistent with the bundle center of gravity.
                (3) The frame structural members must be designed for a vertical load of 2 times the maximum gross weight of the bundle. Design stress levels may not exceed 0.9 times the yield strength of the material.
                (4) The frame must not contain any protrusions from the exterior frame structure that could cause a hazardous condition.
                (5) The frame design must prevent collection of water or other debris that would increase the tare weight of bundles filled by weight.
                (6) The floor of the bundle frame must not buckle during normal operating conditions and must allow for the drainage of water and debris from around the base of the cylinders.
                (7) If the frame design includes movable doors or covers, they must be capable of being secured with latches or other means that will not become dislodged by operational impact loads. Valves that need to be operated in normal service or in an emergency must be accessible.
                (8) For bundles of cylinders, pressure receptacle marking requirements only apply to the individual cylinders of a bundle and not to any assembly structure.

                § 178.74
                Approval of MEGCs.
                (a) Application for design type approval. (1) Each new MEGC design type must have a design approval certificate. An owner or manufacturer must apply to an approval agency that is approved by the Associate Administrator in accordance with subpart E of part 107 of this chapter + to obtain approval of a new design. When a series of MEGCs is manufactured without change in the design, the certificate is valid for the entire series. The design approval certificate must refer to the prototype test report, the materials of construction of the manifold, the standards to which the pressure receptacles are made and an approval number. The compliance requirements or test methods applicable to MEGCs as specified in this subpart may be varied when the level of safety is determined to be equivalent to or exceed the requirements of this subchapter and is approved in writing by the Associate Administrator. A design approval may serve for the approval of smaller MEGCs made of materials of the same type and thickness, by the same fabrication techniques and with identical supports, equivalent closures and other appurtenances.
                (2) Each application for design approval must be in English and contain the following information:
                (i) Two complete copies of all engineering drawings, calculations, and test data necessary to ensure that the design meets the relevant specification.
                (ii) The manufacturer's serial number that will be assigned to each MEGC.
                (iii) A statement as to whether the design type has been examined by any approval agency previously and judged unacceptable. Affirmative statements must be documented with the name of the approval agency, reason for non-acceptance, and the nature of modifications made to the design type.
                (b) Actions by the approval agency. The approval agency must review the application for design type approval, including all drawings and calculations, to ensure that the design of the MEGC meets all requirements of the relevant specification and to determine whether it is complete and conforms to the requirements of this section. An incomplete application will be returned to the applicant with the reasons why the application was returned. If the application is complete and all applicable requirements of this section are met, the approval agency must prepare a MEGC design approval certificate containing the manufacturer's name and address, results and conclusions of the examination and necessary data for identification of the design type. If the Associate Administrator approves the Design Type Approval Certificate application, the approval agency and the manufacturer must each maintain a copy of the approved drawings, calculations, and test data for at least 20 years.
                (c) Approval agency's responsibilities. The approval agency is responsible for ensuring that the MEGC conforms to the design type approval. The approval agency must:
                (1) Witness all tests required for the approval of the MEGC specified in this section and § 178.75.
                (2) Ensure, through appropriate inspection, that each MEGC is fabricated in all respects in conformance with the approved drawings, calculations, and test data.
                (3) Determine and ensure that the MEGC is suitable for its intended use and that it conforms to the requirements of this subchapter.
                (4) Apply its name, identifying mark or identifying number, and the date the approval was issued, to the metal identification marking plate attached to the MEGC upon successful completion of all requirements of this subpart. Any approvals by the Associate Administrator authorizing design or construction alternatives (Alternate Arrangements) of the MEGC (see paragraph (a) of this section) must be indicated on the metal identification plate as specified in § 178.75(j).
                (5) Prepare an approval certificate for each MEGC or, in the case of a series of identical MEGCs manufactured to a single design type, for each series of MEGCs. The approval certificate must include all of the following information:

                (i) The information displayed on the metal identification plate required by § 178.75(j);
                
                (ii) The results of the applicable framework test specified in ISO 1496-3 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter);
                (iii) The results of the initial inspection and test specified in paragraph (h) of this section;
                (iv) The results of the impact test specified in § 178.75(i)(4);
                (v) Certification documents verifying that the cylinders and tubes conform to the applicable standards; and
                (vi) A statement that the approval agency certifies the MEGC in accordance with the procedures in this section and that the MEGC is suitable for its intended purpose and meets the requirements of this subchapter. When a series of MEGCs is manufactured without change in the design type, the certificate may be valid for the entire series of MEGCs representing a single design type. The approval number must consist of the distinguishing sign or mark of the country (“USA” for the United States of America) where the approval was granted and a registration number.
                (6) Retain on file a copy of each approval certificate for at least 20 years.
                (d) Manufacturers' responsibilities. The manufacturer is responsible for compliance with the applicable specifications for the design and construction of MEGCs. The manufacturer of a MEGC must:
                (1) Comply with all the requirements of the applicable ISO standard specified in § 178.71;
                (2) Obtain and use an approval agency to review the design, construction and certification of the MEGC;
                (3) Provide a statement in the manufacturers' data report certifying that each MEGC manufactured complies with the relevant specification and all the applicable requirements of this subchapter; and
                (4) Retain records for the MEGCs for at least 20 years. When required by the specification, the manufacturer must provide copies of the records to the approval agency, the owner or lessee of the MEGC, and to a representative of DOT, upon request.
                (e) Denial of application for approval. If the Associate Administrator finds that the MEGC will not be approved for any reason, the Associate Administrator will notify the applicant in writing and provide the reason for the denial. The manufacturer may request that the Associate Administrator reconsider the decision. The application request must—
                (1) Be written in English and filed within 90 days of receipt of the decision;
                (2) State in detail any alleged errors of fact and law; and
                (3) Enclose any additional information needed to support the request to reconsider.
                (f) Appeal. (1) A manufacturer whose reconsideration request is denied may appeal to the PHMSA Administrator. The appeal must—
                (i) Be in writing and filed within 90 days of receipt of the Associate Administrator s decision on reconsideration;
                (ii) State in detail any alleged errors of fact and law;
                (iii) Enclose any additional information needed to support the appeal; and
                (iv) State in detail the modification of the final decision sought.
                (2) The Administrator will grant or deny the relief and inform the appellant in writing of the decision. The Administrator's decision is the final administrative action.
                (g) Modifications to approved MEGCs. (1) Prior to modification of any approved MEGC that may affect conformance and safe use, and that may involve a change to the design type or affect its ability to retain the hazardous material in transportation, the MEGC's owner must inform the approval agency that prepared the initial approval certificate for the MEGC or, if the initial approval agency is unavailable, another approval agency, of the nature of the modification and request certification of the modification. The owner must supply the approval agency with all revised drawings, calculations, and test data relative to the intended modification. The MEGC's owner must also provide a statement as to whether the intended modification has been examined and determined to be unacceptable by any approval agency. The written statement must include the name of the approval agency, the reason for non-acceptance, and the nature of changes made to the modification since its original rejection.
                
                (2) The approval agency must review the request for modification. If the approval agency determines that the proposed modification does not conform to the relevant specification, the approval agency must reject the request in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. If the approval agency determines that the proposed modification conforms fully with the relevant specification, the request is accepted. If modification to an approved MEGC alters any information on the approval certificate, the approval agency must prepare a new approval certificate for the modified MEGC and submit the certificate to the Associate Administrator for approval. After receiving approval from the Associate Administrator, the approval agency must ensure that any necessary changes are made to the metal identification plate. A copy of each newly issued approval certificate must be retained by the approval agency and the MEGC's owner for at least 20 years. The approval agency must perform the following activities:
                (i) Retain a set of the approved revised drawings, calculations, and data as specified in § 178.69(b)(4) for at least 20 years;
                (ii) Ensure through appropriate inspection that all modifications conform to the revised drawings, calculations, and test data; and
                (iii) Determine the extent to which retesting of the modified MEGC is necessary based on the nature of the proposed modification, and ensure that all required retests are satisfactorily performed.
                (h) Termination of Approval Certificate. (1) The Associate Administrator may terminate an approval issued under this section if he or she determines that—
                (i) Because of a change in circumstances, the approval no longer is needed or no longer would be granted if applied for;
                (ii) Information upon which the approval was based is fraudulent or substantially erroneous;
                (iii) Termination of the approval is necessary to adequately protect against risks to life and property; or
                (iv) The MEGC does not meet the specification.
                (2) Before an approval is terminated, the Associate Administrator will provide the person—
                (i) Written notice of the facts or conduct believed to warrant the termination;
                (ii) An opportunity to submit oral and written evidence; and
                (3) An opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with the applicable requirements.
                (i) Imminent Danger. If the Associate Administrator determines that a certificate of approval must be terminated to preclude a significant and imminent adverse effect on public safety, the Associate Administrator may terminate the certificate immediately. In such circumstances, the opportunities of paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section need not be provided prior to termination of the approval, but must be provided as soon as practicable thereafter.

                (4) Pressure receptacles of MEGCs, fittings, and pipework must be constructed of a material that is compatible with the hazardous materials intended to be transported, as specified in this subchapter.
                (5) Contact between dissimilar metals that could result in damage by galvanic action must be prevented by appropriate means.
                (6) The materials of the MEGC, including any devices, gaskets, and accessories, must have no adverse effect on the gases intended for transport in the MEGC.
                (7) MEGCs must be designed to withstand, without loss of contents, at least the internal pressure due to the contents, and the static, dynamic and thermal loads during normal conditions of handling and transport. The design must take into account the effects of fatigue, caused by repeated application of these loads through the expected life of the MEGC.

                (8) MEGCs and their fastenings must, under the maximum permissible load, be capable of withstanding the following separately applied static forces (for calculation purposes, acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.81 m/s2):
                (i) In the direction of travel: 2g (twice the MPGM multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity);
                (ii) Horizontally at right angles to the direction of travel: 1g (the MPGM multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity. When the direction of travel is not clearly determined, the forces must be equal to twice the MPGM);
                (iii) Vertically upwards: 1g (the MPGM multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity); and
                (iv) Vertically downwards: 2g (twice the MPGM (total loading including the effect of gravity) multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity.
                (9) Under each of the forces specified in paragraph (d)(8) of this section, the stress at the most severely stressed point of the pressure receptacles must not exceed the values given in the applicable design specifications (e.g., ISO 11120).
                (10) Under each of the forces specified in paragraph (d)(8) of this section, the safety factor for the framework and fastenings must be as follows:
                (i) For steels having a clearly defined yield point, a safety factor of 1.5 in relation to the guaranteed yield strength; or
                (ii) For steels with no clearly defined yield point, a safety factor of 1.5 in relation to the guaranteed 0.2 percent proof strength and, for austenitic steels, the 1 percent proof strength.
                (11) MEGCs must be capable of being electrically grounded to prevent electrostatic discharge when intended for flammable gases.
                (12) The pressure receptacles of a MEGC must be secured in a manner to prevent movement that could result in damage to the structure and concentration of harmful localized stresses.
                (e) Service equipment. (1) Service equipment must be arranged so that it is protected from mechanical damage by external forces during handling and transportation. When the connections between the frame and the pressure receptacles allow relative movement between the subassemblies, the equipment must be fastened to allow movement to prevent damage to any working part. The manifolds, discharge fittings (pipe sockets, shut-off devices), and shut-off valves must be protected from damage by external forces. Manifold piping leading to shut-off valves must be sufficiently flexible to protect the valves and the piping from shearing, or releasing the pressure receptacle contents. The filling and discharge devices, including flanges or threaded plugs, and any protective caps must be capable of being secured against unintended opening.
                (2) Each pressure receptacle intended for the transport of Division 2.3 gases must be equipped with an individual shut-off valve. The manifold for Division 2.3 liquefied gases must be designed so that each pressure receptacle can be filled separately and be kept isolated by a valve capable of being closed during transit. For Division 2.1 gases, the pressure receptacles must be isolated by an individual shut-off valve into assemblies of not more than 3,000 L.
                (3) For MEGC filling and discharge openings:
                (i) Two valves in series must be placed in an accessible position on each discharge and filling pipe. One of the valves may be a backflow prevention valve. (ii) The filling and discharge devices may be equipped to a manifold.
                (iii) For sections of piping which can be closed at both ends and where a liquid product can be trapped, a pressure-relief valve must be provided to prevent excessive pressure build-up.
                (iv) The main isolation valves on a MEGC must be clearly marked to indicate their directions of closure. All shutoff valves must close by a clockwise motion of the handwheel.
                (v) Each shut-off valve or other means of closure must be designed and constructed to withstand a pressure equal to or greater than 1.5 times the test pressure of the MEGC.
                (vi) All shut-off valves with screwed spindles must close by a clockwise motion of the handwheel. For other shut-off valves, the open and closed positions and the direction of closure must be clearly shown.

                (vii) All shut-off valves must be designed and positioned to prevent unintentional opening.
                
                (viii) Ductile metals must be used in the construction of valves or accessories.
                (4) The piping must be designed, constructed and installed to avoid damage due to expansion and contraction, mechanical shock and vibration. Joints in tubing must be brazed or have an equally strong metal union. The melting point of brazing materials must be no lower than 525 °C (977 °F). The rated pressure of the service equipment and of the manifold must be not less than two-thirds of the test pressure of the pressure receptacles.
                (f) Pressure relief devices. Each pressure receptacle must be equipped with one or more pressure relief devices as specified in § 173.301(f) of this subchapter. When pressure relief devices are installed, each pressure receptacle or group of pressure receptacles of a MEGC that can be isolated must be equipped with one or more pressure relief devices. Pressure relief devices must be of a type that will resist dynamic forces including liquid surge and must be designed to prevent the entry of foreign matter, the leakage of gas and the development of any dangerous excess pressure.
                (1) The size of the pressure relief devices: CGA S-1.1 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter) must be used to determine the relief capacity of individual pressure receptacles.
                (2) Connections to pressure-relief devices: Connections to pressure relief devices must be of sufficient size to enable the required discharge to pass unrestricted to the pressure relief device. A shut-off valve installed between the pressure receptacle and the pressure relief device is prohibited, except where duplicate devices are provided for maintenance or other reasons, and the shut-off valves serving the devices actually in use are locked open, or the shut-off valves are interlocked so that at least one of the duplicate devices is always operable and capable of meeting the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section. No obstruction is permitted in an opening leading to or leaving from a vent or pressure-relief device that might restrict or cut-off the flow from the pressure receptacle to that device. The opening through all piping and fittings must have at least the same flow area as the inlet of the pressure relief device to which it is connected. The nominal size of the discharge piping must be at least as large as that of the pressure relief device.
                (3) Location of pressure-relief devices: For liquefied gases, each pressure relief device must, under maximum filling conditions, be in communication with the vapor space of the pressure receptacles. The devices, when installed, must be arranged to ensure the escaping vapor is discharged upwards and unrestrictedly to prevent impingement of escaping gas or liquid upon the MEGC, its pressure receptacles or personnel. For flammable, pyrophoric and oxidizing gases, the escaping gas must be directed away from the pressure receptacle in such a manner that it cannot impinge upon the other pressure receptacles. Heat resistant protective devices that deflect the flow of gas are permissible provided the required pressure relief device capacity is not reduced. Arrangements must be made to prevent access to the pressure relief devices by unauthorized persons and to protect the devices from damage caused by rollover.
                (g) Gauging devices. When a MEGC is intended to be filled by mass, it must be equipped with one or more gauging devices. Glass level-gauges and gauges made of other fragile material are prohibited.
                (h) MEGC supports, frameworks, lifting and tie-down attachments. (1) MEGCs must be designed and constructed with a support structure to provide a secure base during transport. MEGCs must be protected against damage to the pressure receptacles and service equipment resulting from lateral and longitudinal impact and overturning. The forces specified in paragraph (d)(8) of this section, and the safety factor specified in paragraph (d)(10) of this section must be considered in this aspect of the design. Skids, frameworks, cradles or other similar structures are acceptable. If the pressure receptacles and service equipment are so constructed as to withstand impact and overturning, additional protective support structure is not required (see paragraph (h)(4) of this section).

                (2) The combined stresses caused by pressure receptacle mountings (e.g. cradles, frameworks, etc.) and MEGC lifting and tie-down attachments must not cause excessive stress in any pressure receptacle. Permanent lifting and tie-down attachments must be equipped to all MEGCs. Any welding of mountings or attachments onto the pressure receptacles is prohibited.
                (3) The effects of environmental corrosion must be taken into account in the design of supports and frameworks.
                (4) When MEGCs are not protected during transport as specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the pressure receptacles and service equipment must be protected against damage resulting from lateral or longitudinal impact or overturning. External fittings must be protected against release of the pressure receptacles' contents upon impact or overturning of the MEGC on its fittings. Particular attention must be paid to the protection of the manifold. Examples of protection include:
                (i) Protection against lateral impact, which may consist of longitudinal bars;
                (ii) Protection against overturning, which may consist of reinforcement rings or bars fixed across the frame;
                (iii) Protection against rear impact, which may consist of a bumper or frame;
                (iv) Protection of the pressure receptacles and service equipment against damage from impact or overturning by use of an ISO frame according to the relevant provisions of ISO 1496-3. (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (i) Initial inspection and test. The pressure receptacles and items of equipment of each MEGC must be inspected and tested before being put into service for the first time (initial inspection and test). This initial inspection and test of an MEGC must include the following:
                (1) A check of the design characteristics.
                (2) An external examination of the MEGC and its fittings, taking into account the hazardous materials to be transported.
                (3) A pressure test performed at the test pressures specified in § 173.304b(b)(1) and (2) of this subchapter. The pressure test of the manifold may be performed as a hydraulic test or by using another liquid or gas. A leakproofness test and a test of the satisfactory operation of all service equipment must also be performed before the MEGC is placed into service. When the pressure receptacles and their fittings have been pressure-tested separately, they must be subjected to a leakproof test after assembly.
                (4) An MEGC that meets the definition of “container” in the CSC (see 49 CFR 450.3(a)(2)) must be subjected to an impact test using a prototype representing each design type. The prototype MEGC must be shown to be capable of absorbing the forces resulting from an impact not less than 4 times (4 g) the MPGM of the fully loaded MEGC, at a duration typical of the mechanical shocks experienced in rail transport. A listing of acceptable methods for performing the impact test is provided in the UN Recommendations (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (j) Marking. (1) Each MEGC must be equipped with a corrosion resistant metal plate permanently attached to the MEGC in a conspicuous place readily accessible for inspection. The pressure receptacles must be marked according to this section. Affixing the metal plate to a pressure receptacle is prohibited. At a minimum, the following information must be marked on the plate by stamping or by any other equivalent method:

Non-metallic materials may be used for the attachments and supports between the shell and jacket, provided their material properties at the minimum and maximum design temperatures are proven to be sufficient. For welded shells, only a material whose weldability has been fully demonstrated may be used. Welds must be of high quality and conform to a level of integrity at least equivalent to the welding requirements specified in Section VIII of the ASME Code for the welding of pressure vessels. When the manufacturing process or the materials make it necessary, the shells must be suitably heat-treated to guarantee adequate toughness in the weld and in the heat-affected zones. In choosing the material, the design temperature range must be taken into account with respect to risk of brittle fracture, stress corrosion cracking, resistance to impact, and suitability for the hazardous materials intended for transportation in the portable tank. When fine grain steel is used, the guaranteed value of the yield strength must be not more than 460 N/mm2 and the guaranteed value of the upper limit of the tensile strength must be not more than 725 N/mm2 according to the material specification. Aluminum may not be used as a construction material for the shells of portable tanks intended for the transport of non-refrigerated liquefied gases. For portable tanks intended for the transport of liquid or solid hazardous materials, aluminum may only be used as a construction material for portable tank shells if approved by the Associate Administrator. Portable tank materials must be suitable for the external environment where they will be transported, taking into account the determined design temperature range. Portable tanks shall be designed to withstand, without loss of contents, at least the internal pressure due to the contents and the static, dynamic and thermal loads during normal conditions of handling and transportation. The design must take into account the effects of fatigue, caused by repeated application of these loads through the expected life of the portable tank.
                (2) Portable tank shells, fittings, and pipework shall be constructed from materials that are:
                (i) Compatible with the hazardous materials intended to be transported; or
                (ii) Properly passivated or neutralized by chemical reaction, if applicable; or
                (iii) For portable tanks used for liquid and solid materials, lined with corrosion-resistant material directly bonded to the shell or attached by equivalent means.
                (3) Gaskets and seals shall be made of materials that are compatible with the hazardous materials intended to be transported.
                (4) When shells are lined, the lining must be compatible with the hazardous materials intended to be transported, homogeneous, non-porous, free from perforations, sufficiently elastic and compatible with the thermal expansion characteristics of the shell. The lining of every shell, shell fittings and piping must be continuous and must extend around the face of any flange. Where external fittings are welded to the tank, the lining must be continuous through the fitting and around the face of external flanges. Joints and seams in the lining must be made by fusing the material together or by other equally effective means.
                (5) Contact between dissimilar metals which could result in damage by galvanic action must be prevented by appropriate measures.
                (6) The construction materials of the portable tank, including any devices, gaskets, linings and accessories, must not adversely affect or react with the hazardous materials intended to be transported in the portable tank.
                (7) Portable tanks must be designed and constructed with supports that provide a secure base during transportation and with suitable lifting and tie-down attachments.
                (c) Design criteria. (1) Portable tanks and their fastenings must, under the maximum permissible loads and maximum permissible working pressures, be capable of absorbing the following separately applied static forces (for calculation purposes, acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.81m/s2):
                (i) In the direction of travel: 2g (twice the MPGM multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity);
                (ii) Horizontally at right angles to the direction of travel: 1g (the MPGM multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity);
                (iii) Vertically upwards: 1g (the MPGM multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity); and
                (iv) Vertically downwards: 2g (twice the MPGM multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity).
                (2) Under each of the forces specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the safety factor must be as follows:
                (i) For metals having a clearly defined yield point, a design margin of 1.5 in relation to the guaranteed yield strength; or

                (ii) For metals with no clearly defined yield point, a design margin of 1.5 in relation to the guaranteed 0.2% proof strength and, for austenitic steels, the 1% proof strength.
                (3) The values of yield strength or proof strength must be the values according to recognized material standards. When austenitic steels are used, the specified minimum values of yield strength or proof strength according to the material standards may be increased by up to 15% for portable tanks used for liquid and solid hazardous materials, other than toxic by inhalation liquids meeting the criteria of Hazard Zone A or Hazard Zone B (see § 173.133 of this subchapter), when these greater values are attested in the material inspection certificate.
                (4) Portable tanks must be capable of being electrically grounded to prevent dangerous electrostatic discharge when they are used for Class 2 flammable gases or Class 3 flammable liquids, including elevated temperature materials transported at or above their flash point.
                (5) For shells of portable tanks used for liquefied compressed gases, the shell must consist of a circular cross section. Shells must be of a design capable of being stress-analyzed mathematically or experimentally by resistance strain gauges as specified in UG-101 of Section VIII of the ASME Code, or other methods approved by the Associate Administrator.
                (6) Shells must be designed and constructed to withstand a hydraulic test pressure of not less than 1.5 times the design pressure for portable tanks used for liquids and 1.3 times the design pressure for portable tanks used for liquefied compressed gases. Specific requirements are provided for each hazardous material in the applicable T Code or portable tank special provision specified in the § 172.101 Table of this subchapter. The minimum shell thickness requirements must also be taken into account.

                (7) For metals exhibiting a clearly defined yield point or characterized by a guaranteed proof strength (0.2% proof strength, generally, or 1% proof strength for austenitic steels), the primary membrane stress σ (sigma) in the shell must not exceed 0.75 Re or 0.50 Rm, whichever is lower, at the test pressure, where:
                
                Re = yield strength in N/mm2, or 0.2% proof strength or, for austenitic steels, 1% proof strength;
                Rm = minimum tensile strength in N/mm2.
                
                (8) The values of Re and Rm to be used must be the specified minimum values according to recognized material standards. When austenitic steels are used, the specified minimum values for Re and Rm according to the material standards may be increased by up to 15% when greater values are attested in the material inspection certificate.
                (9) Steels which have a Re/Rm ratio of more than 0.85 are not allowed for the construction of welded shells. The values of Re and Rm to be used in determining this ratio must be the values specified in the material inspection certificate.
                (10) Steels used in the construction of shells must have an elongation at fracture, in percentage, of not less than 10,000/Rm with an absolute minimum of 16% for fine grain steels and 20% for other steels.
                (11) For the purpose of determining actual values for materials for sheet metal, the axis of the tensile test specimen must be at right angles (transversely) to the direction of rolling. The permanent elongation at fracture must be measured on test specimens of rectangular cross sections in accordance with ISO 6892 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), using a 50 mm gauge length.
                (d) Minimum shell thickness. (1) The minimum shell thickness must be the greatest thickness of the following:
                (i) the minimum thickness determined in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2) through (d)(7) of this section;
                (ii) the minimum thickness determined in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME Code or other approved pressure vessel code; or
                (iii) the minimum thickness specified in the applicable T code or portable tank special provision indicated for each hazardous material in the § 172.101 Table of this subchapter.

                (2) Shells (cylindrical portions, heads and manhole covers) not more than 1.80 m in diameter may not be less than 5 mm thick in the reference steel or of equivalent thickness in the metal to be used. Shells more than 1.80 m in diameter may not be less than 6 mm (0.2 inches) thick in the reference steel or of equivalent thickness in the metal to be used. For portable tanks used only for the transportation of powdered or granular solid hazardous materials of Packing Group II or III, the minimum thickness requirement may be reduced to 5 mm in the reference steel or of equivalent thickness in the metal to be used regardless of the shell diameter. For vacuum-insulated tanks, the aggregate thickness of the jacket and the shell must correspond to the minimum thickness prescribed in this paragraph, with the thickness of the shell itself not less than the minimum thickness prescribed in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
                (3) When additional protection against shell damage is provided in the case of portable tanks used for liquid and solid hazardous materials requiring test pressures less than 2.65 bar (265.0 kPa), subject to certain limitations specified in the UN Recommendations (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), the Associate Administrator may approve a reduced minimum shell thickness.
                (4) The cylindrical portions, heads and manhole covers of all shells must not be less than 3 mm (0.1 inch) thick regardless of the material of construction, except for portable tanks used for liquefied compressed gases where the cylindrical portions, ends (heads) and manhole covers of all shells must not be less than 4 mm (0.2 inch) thick regardless of the material of construction.
                (5) When steel is used, that has characteristics other than that of reference steel, the equivalent thickness of the shell and heads must be determined according to the following formula:
                
                  EN21JN01.005
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  e1 = required equivalent thickness (in mm) of the metal to be used;
                  e0 = minimum thickness (in mm) of the reference steel specified in the applicable T code or portable tank special provision indicated for each material in the § 172.101 Table of this subchapter;
                  d1 = 1.8m, unless the formula is used to determine the equivalent minimum thickness for a portable tank shell that is required to have a minimum thickness of 8mm or 10mm according to the applicable T code indicated in the § 172.101 Table of this subchapter. When reference steel thicknesses of 8mm or 10mm are specified, d1 is equal to the actual diameter of the shell but not less than 1.8m;
                  Rm1 = guaranteed minimum tensile strength (in N/mm 2) of the metal to be used;
                  A1 = guaranteed minimum elongation at fracture (in %) of the metal to be used according to recognized material standards.
                
                
                (6) The wall and all parts of the shell may not have a thickness less than that prescribed in paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section. This thickness must be exclusive of any corrosion allowance.
                (7) There must be no sudden change of plate thickness at the attachment of the heads to the cylindrical portion of the shell.
                (e) Service equipment. (1) Service equipment must be arranged so that it is protected against the risk of mechanical damage by external forces during handling and transportation. When the connections between the frame and the shell allow relative movement between the sub-assemblies, the equipment must be fastened to allow such movement without risk of damage to any working part. The external discharge fittings (pipe sockets, shut-off devices) and the internal stop-valve and its seating must be protected against mechanical damage by external forces (for example, by using shear sections). Each internal self-closing stop-valve must be protected by a shear section or sacrificial device located outboard of the valve. The shear section or sacrificial device must break at no more than 70% of the load that would cause failure of the internal self-closing stop valve. The filling and discharge devices (including flanges or threaded plugs) and any protective caps must be capable of being secured against unintended opening.
                (2) Each filling or discharge opening of a portable tank must be clearly marked to indicate its function.

                (3) Each stop-valve or other means of closure must be designed and constructed to a rated pressure not less than the MAWP of the shell taking into account the temperatures expected during transport. All stop-valves with screwed spindles must close by a clockwise motion of the handwheel. For other stop-valves, the position (open and closed) and direction of closure must be clearly indicated. All stop-valves must be designed to prevent unintentional opening.
                (4) Piping must be designed, constructed and installed to avoid the risk of damage due to thermal expansion and contraction, mechanical shock and vibration. All piping must be of a suitable metallic material. Welded pipe joints must be used wherever possible.
                (5) Joints in copper tubing must be brazed or have an equally strong metal union. The melting point of brazing materials must be no lower than 525 °C (977 °F). The joints must not decrease the strength of the tubing, such as may happen when cutting threads. Brazed joints are not authorized for portable tanks intended for refrigerated liquefied gases.
                (6) The burst pressure of all piping and pipe fittings must be greater than the highest of four times the MAWP of the shell or four times the pressure to which it may be subjected in service by the action of a pump or other device (except pressure relief devices).
                (7) Ductile metals must be used in the construction of valves and accessories.
                (f) Pressure relief devices—(1) Marking of pressure relief devices. Every pressure relief device must be clearly and permanently marked with the following:
                (i) the pressure (in bar or kPa) or temperature for fusible elements (in °C) at which it is set to discharge;
                (ii) the allowable tolerance at the discharge pressure for reclosing devices;
                (iii) the reference temperature corresponding to the rated pressure for frangible discs;
                (iv) the allowable temperature tolerance for fusible elements;
                (v) The rated flow capacity of the spring loaded pressure relief devices, frangible disc or fusible elements in standard cubic meters of air per second (m3/s). For spring loaded pressure relief devices, the rated flow capacity must be determined according to ISO 4126-1 (including Technical Corrigendum 1) and ISO 4126-7 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter); and
                (vi) The cross sectional flow areas of the spring loaded pressure relief devices, frangible discs, and fusible elements in mm2; and
                (vii) When practicable, the device must show the manufacturer's name and product number.
                (2) Connections to pressure relief devices. Connections to pressure relief devices must be of sufficient size to enable the required discharge to pass unrestricted to the safety device. No stop-valve may be installed between the shell and the pressure relief devices except where duplicate devices are provided for maintenance or other reasons and the stop-valves serving the devices actually in use are locked open or the stop-valves are interlocked so that at least one of the devices is always in use. There must be no obstruction in an opening leading to a vent or pressure relief device which might restrict or cut-off the flow from the shell to that device. Vents or pipes from the pressure relief device outlets, when used, must deliver the relieved vapor or liquid to the atmosphere in conditions of minimum back-pressure on the relieving devices.
                (3) Location of pressure relief devices. (i) Each pressure relief device inlet must be situated on top of the shell in a position as near the longitudinal and transverse center of the shell as reasonably practicable. All pressure relief device inlets must, under maximum filling conditions, be situated in the vapor space of the shell and the devices must be so arranged as to ensure that any escaping vapor is not restricted in any manner. For flammable hazardous materials, the escaping vapor must be directed away from the shell in such a manner that it cannot impinge upon the shell. For refrigerated liquefied gases, the escaping vapor must be directed away from the tank and in such a manner that it cannot impinge upon the tank. Protective devices which deflect the flow of vapor are permissible provided the required relief-device capacity is not reduced.

                (ii) Provisions must be implemented to prevent unauthorized persons from access to the pressure relief devices and to protect the devices from damage caused by the portable tank overturning.
                (g) Gauging devices. Unless a portable tank is intended to be filled by weight, it must be equipped with one or more gauging devices. Glass level-gauges and gauges made of other fragile material, which are in direct communication with the contents of the tank are prohibited. A connection for a vacuum gauge must be provided in the jacket of a vacuum-insulated portable tank.
                (h) Portable tank supports, frameworks, lifting and tie-down attachments. (1) Portable tanks must be designed and constructed with a support structure to provide a secure base during transport. The forces and safety factors specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, respectively, must be taken into account in this aspect of the design. Skids, frameworks, cradles or other similar structures are acceptable.
                (2) The combined stresses caused by portable tank mountings (for example, cradles, framework, etc.) and portable tank lifting and tie-down attachments must not cause stress that would damage the shell in a manner that would compromise its lading retention capability. Permanent lifting and tie-down attachments must be fitted to all portable tanks. Preferably they should be fitted to the portable tank supports but may be secured to reinforcing plates located on the shell at the points of support. Each portable tank must be designed so that the center of gravity of the filled tank is approximately centered within the points of attachment for lifting devices.
                (3) In the design of supports and frameworks, the effects of environmental corrosion must be taken into account.
                (4) Forklift pockets must be capable of being closed off. The means of closing forklift pockets must be a permanent part of the framework or permanently attached to the framework. Single compartment portable tanks with a length less than 3.65 m (12 ft.) need not have forklift pockets that are capable of being closed off provided that:
                (i) The shell, including all the fittings, are well protected from being hit by the forklift blades; and
                (ii) The distance between forklift pockets (measured from the center of each pocket) is at least half of the maximum length of the portable tank.
                (5) During transport, portable tanks must be adequately protected against damage to the shell, and service equipment resulting from lateral and longitudinal impact and overturning, or the shell and service equipment must be constructed to withstand the forces resulting from impact or overturning. External fittings must be protected so as to preclude the release of the shell contents upon impact or overturning of the portable tank on its fittings. Examples of protection include:
                (i) Protection against lateral impact which may consist of longitudinal bars protecting the shell on both sides at the level of the median line;
                (ii) Protection of the portable tank against overturning which may consist of reinforcement rings or bars fixed across the frame;
                (iii) Protection against rear impact which may consist of a bumper or frame;
                (iv) Protection of the shell against damage from impact or overturning by use of an ISO frame in accordance with ISO 1496-3 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter); and
                (v) Protection of the portable tank from impact or damage that may result from overturning by an insulation jacket.
                (i) Marking. (1) Every portable tank must be fitted with a corrosion resistant metal plate permanently attached to the portable tank in a conspicuous place and readily accessible for inspection. When the plate cannot be permanently attached to the shell, the shell must be marked with at least the information required by Section VIII of the ASME Code. At a minimum, the following information must be marked on the plate by stamping or by any other equivalent method:

                  Note to paragraph (i)(2):
                  For the identification of the hazardous materials being transported refer to part 172 of this subchapter.
                
                
                (3) If a portable tank is designed and approved for open seas operations, such as offshore oil exploration, in accordance with the IMDG Code, the words “OFFSHORE PORTABLE TANK” must be marked on the identification plate.
                (j) Initial inspection and test. The initial inspection and test of a portable tank must include the following:
                (1) A check of the design characteristics.
                (2) An internal and external examination of the portable tank and its fittings, taking into account the hazardous materials to be transported. For UN portable tanks used for refrigerated liquefied gases, a pressure test using an inert gas may be conducted instead of a hydrostatic test. An internal inspection is not required for a portable tank used for the dedicated transportation of refrigerated liquefied gases that are not filled with an inspection opening.
                (3) A pressure test as specified in paragraph (i) of this section.
                (4) A leakage test.
                (5) A test of the satisfactory operation of all service equipment including pressure relief devices must also be performed. When the shell and its fittings have been pressure-tested separately, they must be subjected to a leakage test after reassembly. All welds, subject to full stress level in the shell, must be inspected during the initial test by radiographic, ultrasonic, or another suitable non-destructive test method. This does not apply to the jacket.

                (6) Effective January 1, 2008, each new UN portable tank design type meeting the definition of “container” in the Convention for Safe Containers (CSC) (see 49 CFR 450.3(a)(2)) must be subjected to the dynamic longitudinal impact test prescribed in Part IV, Section 40 of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (see IBR, § 171.7 of this subchapter). A UN portable tank design type impact-tested prior to January 1, 2008, in accordance with the requirements of this section in effect on October 1, 2005, need not be retested. UN portable tanks used for the dedicated transportation of “Helium, refrigerated liquid,” UN1963, and “Hydrogen, refrigerated liquid,” UN1966, that are marked “NOT FOR RAIL TRANSPORT” in letters of a minimum height of 10 cm (4 inches) on at least two sides of the portable tank are excepted from the dynamic longitudinal impact test.
                
                (7) The following tests must be completed on a portable tank or a series of portable tanks designed and constructed to a single design type that is also a CSC container without leakage or deformation that would render the portable tank unsafe for transportation and use:
                (i) Longitudinal inertia. The portable tank loaded to its maximum gross weight must be positioned with its longitudinal axis vertical. It shall be held in this position for five minutes by support at the lower end of the base structure providing vertical and lateral restraint and by support at the upper end of the base structure providing lateral restraint only.
                (ii) Lateral inertia. The portable tank loaded to its maximum gross weight must be positioned for five minutes with its transverse axis vertical. It shall be held in this position for five minutes by support at the lower side of the base structure providing vertical and lateral restraint and by support at the upper side of the base structure providing lateral restraint only.

                § 178.275
                Specification for UN Portable Tanks intended for the transportation of liquid and solid hazardous materials.
                (a) In addition to the requirements of § 178.274, this section sets forth definitions and requirements that apply to UN portable tanks intended for the transportation of liquid and solid hazardous materials.
                (b) Definitions and requirements—(1) Design pressure means the pressure to be used in calculations required by the recognized pressure vessel code. The design pressure must not be less than the highest of the following pressures:
                (i) The maximum effective gauge pressure allowed in the shell during filling or discharge; or
                (ii) The sum of—
                (A) The absolute vapor pressure (in bar) of the hazardous material at 65 °C, minus 1 bar (149 °F, minus 100 kPa);
                (B) The partial pressure (in bar) of air or other gases in the ullage space, resulting from their compression during filling without pressure relief by a maximum ullage temperature of 65 °C (149 °F) and a liquid expansion due to an increase in mean bulk temperature of 35 °C (95 °F); and
                (C) A head pressure determined on the basis of the forces specified in § 178.274(c) of this subchapter, but not less than 0.35 bar (35 kPa).
                (2) Maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP) means a pressure that must not be less than the highest of the following pressures measured at the top of the shell while in operating position:
                (i) The maximum effective gauge pressure allowed in the shell during filling or discharge; or
                (ii) The maximum effective gauge pressure to which the shell is designed which must be not less than the design pressure.
                (c) Service equipment. (1) In addition to the requirements specified in § 178.274, for service equipment, all openings in the shell, intended for filling or discharging the portable tank must be fitted with a manually operated stop-valve located as close to the shell as reasonably practicable. Other openings, except for openings leading to venting or pressure relief devices, must be equipped with either a stop-valve or another suitable means of closure located as close to the shell as reasonably practicable.
                (2) All portable tanks must be fitted with a manhole or other inspection openings of a suitable size to allow for internal inspection and adequate access for maintenance and repair of the interior. Compartmented portable tanks must have a manhole or other inspection openings for each compartment.
                (3) For insulated portable tanks, top fittings must be surrounded by a spill collection reservoir with suitable drains.

                (4) Piping must be designed, constructed and installed to avoid the risk of damage due to thermal expansion and contraction, mechanical shock and vibration. All piping must be of a suitable metallic material. Welded pipe joints must be used wherever possible.
                (d) Bottom openings. (1) Certain hazardous materials may not be transported in portable tanks with bottom openings. When the applicable T code or portable tank special provision, as referenced for materials in the § 172.101 Table of this subchapter, specifies that bottom openings are prohibited, there must be no openings below the liquid level of the shell when it is filled to its maximum permissible filling limit. When an existing opening is closed, it must be accomplished by internally and externally welding one plate to the shell.
                (2) Bottom discharge outlets for portable tanks carrying certain solid, crystallizable or highly viscous hazardous materials must be equipped with at least two serially fitted and mutually independent shut-off devices. Use of only two shut-off devices is only authorized when this paragraph is referenced in the applicable T Code indicated for each hazardous material in the § 172.101 Table of this subchapter. The design of the equipment must be to the satisfaction of the approval agency and must include:
                (i) An external stop-valve fitted as close to the shell as reasonably practicable; and
                (ii) A liquid tight closure at the end of the discharge pipe, which may be a bolted blank flange or a screw cap.
                (3) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, every bottom discharge outlet must be equipped with three serially fitted and mutually independent shut-off devices. The design of the equipment must include:
                (i) A self-closing internal stop-valve, which is a stop-valve within the shell or within a welded flange or its companion flange, such that:
                (A) The control devices for the operation of the valve are designed to prevent any unintended opening through impact or other inadvertent act;
                (B) The valve is operable from above or below;
                (C) If possible, the setting of the valve (open or closed) must be capable of being verified from the ground;
                (D) Except for portable tanks having a capacity less than 1,000 liters (264.2 gallons), it must be possible to close the valve from an accessible position on the portable tank that is remote from the valve itself within 30 seconds of actuation; and
                (E) The valve must continue to be effective in the event of damage to the external device for controlling the operation of the valve;
                (ii) An external stop-valve fitted as close to the shell as reasonably practicable;
                (iii) A liquid tight closure at the end of the discharge pipe, which may be a bolted blank flange or a screw cap; and
                (iv) For UN portable tanks, with bottom outlets, used for the transportation of liquid hazardous materials that are Class 3, PG I or II, or PG III with a flash point of less than 100 °F (38 °C); Division 5.1, PG I or II; or Division 6.1, PG I or II, the remote means of closure must be capable of thermal activation. The thermal means of activation must activate at a temperature of not more than 250 °F (121 °C).
                (e) Pressure relief devices. All portable tanks must be fitted with at least one pressure relief device. All relief devices must be designed, constructed and marked in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter.
                (f) Vacuum-relief devices. (1) A shell which is to be equipped with a vacuum-relief device must be designed to withstand, without permanent deformation, an external pressure of not less than 0.21 bar (21.0 kPa). The vacuum-relief device must be set to relieve at a vacuum setting not greater than −0.21 bar (−21.0 kPa) unless the shell is designed for a higher external over pressure, in which case the vacuum-relief pressure of the device to be fitted must not be greater than the tank design vacuum pressure. A shell that is not fitted with a vacuum-relief device must be designed to withstand, without permanent deformation, an external pressure of not less than 0.4 bar (40.0 kPa).

                (2) Vacuum-relief devices used on portable tanks intended for the transportation of hazardous materials meeting the criteria of Class 3, including elevated temperature hazardous materials transported at or above their flash point, must prevent the immediate passage of flame into the shell or the portable tank must have a shell capable of withstanding, without leakage, an internal explosion resulting from the passage of flame into the shell.
                (g) Pressure relief devices. (1) Each portable tank with a capacity not less than 1,900 liters (501.9 gallons) and every independent compartment of a portable tank with a similar capacity, must be provided with one or more pressure relief devices of the reclosing type. Such portable tanks may, in addition, have a frangible disc or fusible element in parallel with the reclosing devices, except when the applicable T code assigned to a hazardous material requires that the frangible disc precede the pressure relief device, according to paragraph (g)(3) of this section, or when no bottom openings are allowed. The pressure relief devices must have sufficient capacity to prevent rupture of the shell due to over pressurization or vacuum resulting from filling, discharging, heating of the contents or fire.
                (2) Pressure relief devices must be designed to prevent the entry of foreign matter, the leakage of liquid and the development of any dangerous excess pressure.
                (3) When required for certain hazardous materials by the applicable T code or portable tank special provision specified for a hazardous material in the § 172.101 Table of this subchapter, portable tanks must have a pressure relief device consistent with the requirements of this subchapter. Except for a portable tank in dedicated service that is fitted with an approved relief device constructed of materials compatible with the hazardous material, the relief device system must include a frangible disc preceding (such as, between the lading and the reclosing pressure relief device) a reclosing pressure relief device. A pressure gauge or suitable tell-tale indicator for the detection of disc rupture, pin-holing or leakage must be provided in the space between the frangible disc and the pressure relief device to allow the portable tank operator to check to determine if the disc is leak free. The frangible disc must rupture at a nominal pressure 10% above the start-to-discharge pressure of the reclosable pressure relief device.
                (4) Every portable tank with a capacity less than 1,900 liters (501.9 gallons) must be fitted with a pressure relief device which, except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, may be a frangible disc when this disc is set to rupture at a nominal pressure equal to the test pressure at any temperature within the design temperature range.
                (5) When the shell is fitted for pressure discharge, a suitable pressure relief device must provide the inlet line to the portable tank and set to operate at a pressure not higher than the MAWP of the shell, and a stop-valve must be fitted as close to the shell as practicable to minimize the potential for damage.
                (6) Setting of pressure relief devices. (i) Pressure relief devices must operate only in conditions of excessive rise in temperature. The shell must not be subject to undue fluctuations of pressure during normal conditions of transportation.
                (ii) The required pressure relief device must be set to start to discharge at a nominal pressure of five-sixths of the test pressure for shells having a test pressure of not more than 4.5 bar (450 kPa) and 110% of two-thirds of the test pressure for shells having a test pressure of more than 4.5 bar (450 kPa). A self-closing relief device must close at a pressure not more than 10% below the pressure at which the discharge starts. The device must remain closed at all lower pressures. This requirement does not prevent the use of vacuum-relief or combination pressure relief and vacuum-relief devices.
                (h) Fusible elements. Fusible elements must operate at a temperature between 110 °C (230 °F) and 149 °C (300.2 °F), provided that the pressure in the shell at the fusing temperature will not exceed the test pressure. They must be placed at the top of the shell with their inlets in the vapor space and in no case may they be shielded from external heat. Fusible elements must not be utilized on portable tanks with a test pressure which exceeds 2.65 bar (265.0 kPa); however, fusible elements are authorized on portable tanks for the transportation of certain organometallic materials in accordance with § 172.102, special provision TP36 of this subchapter. Fusible elements used on portable tanks intended for the transport of elevated temperature hazardous materials must be designed to operate at a temperature higher than the maximum temperature that will be experienced during transport and must be designed to the satisfaction of the approval agency.
                (i) Capacity of pressure relief devices. (1) The reclosing pressure relief device required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section must have a minimum cross sectional flow area equivalent to an orifice of 31.75 mm (1.3 inches) diameter. Vacuum-relief devices, when used, must have a cross sectional flow area not less than 284 mm 2 (11.2 inches 2).
                (2) The combined delivery capacity of the pressure relief system (taking into account the reduction of the flow when the portable tank is fitted with frangible-discs preceding spring-loaded pressure-relief devices or when the spring-loaded pressure-relief devices are provided with a device to prevent the passage of the flame), in condition of complete fire engulfment of the portable tank must be sufficient to limit the pressure in the shell to 20% above the start to discharge pressure limiting device (pressure relief device). The total required capacity of the relief devices may be determined using the formula in paragraph (i)(2)(i)(A) of this section or the table in paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section.
                (i)(A) To determine the total required capacity of the relief devices, which must be regarded as being the sum of the individual capacities of all the contributing devices, the following formula must be used:

                § 178.276
                Requirements for the design, construction, inspection and testing of portable tanks intended for the transportation of non-refrigerated liquefied compressed gases.
                (a) In addition to the requirements of § 178.274 applicable to UN portable tanks, the following requirements apply to UN portable tanks used for non-refrigerated liquefied compressed gases. In addition to the definitions in § 178.274, the following definitions apply:
                (1) Design pressure means the pressure to be used in calculations required by the ASME Code, Section VIII (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). The design pressure must be not less than the highest of the following pressures:
                (i) The maximum effective gauge pressure allowed in the shell during filling or discharge; or
                (ii) The sum of:

                (A) The maximum effective gauge pressure to which the shell is designed as defined in this paragraph under “MAWP”; and
                (B) A head pressure determined on the basis of the dynamic forces specified in paragraph (h) of this section, but not less than 0.35 bar (35 kPa).
                (2) Design reference temperature means the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the contents is determined for the purpose of calculating the MAWP. The value for each portable tank type is as follows:
                (i) Shell with a diameter of 1.5 meters (4.9 ft.) or less: 65 °C (149 °F); or
                (ii) Shell with a diameter of more than 1.5 meters (4.9 ft.):
                (A) Without insulation or sun shield: 60 °C (140 °F);
                (B) With sun shield: 55 °C (131 °F); and
                (C) With insulation: 50 °C (122 °F).
                (3) Filling density means the average mass of liquefied compressed gas per liter of shell capacity (kg/l).
                (4) Maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP) means a pressure that must be not less than the highest of the following pressures measured at the top of the shell while in operating position, but in no case less than 7 bar (700 kPa):
                (i) The maximum effective gauge pressure allowed in the shell during filling or discharge; or
                (ii) The maximum effective gauge pressure to which the shell is designed, which must be:
                (A) Not less than the pressure specified for each liquefied compressed gas listed in the UN Portable Tank Table for Liquefied Compressed Gases in § 173.313; and
                (B) Not less than the sum of:
                (1) The absolute vapor pressure (in bar) of the liquefied compressed gas at the design reference temperature minus 1 bar; and
                (2) The partial pressure (in bar) of air or other gases in the ullage space which is determined by the design reference temperature and the liquid phase expansion due to the increase of the mean bulk temperature of tr−tf (tf = filling temperature, usually 15 °C, tr = 50 °C maximum mean bulk temperature).
                (b) General design and construction requirements. (1) Shells must be of seamless or welded steel construction, or combination of both, and have a water capacity greater than 450 liters (118.9 gallons). Shells must be designed, constructed, certified and stamped in accordance with the ASME Code, Section VIII.
                (2) Portable tanks must be postweld heat-treated and radiographed as prescribed in Section VIII of the ASME Code, except that each portable tank constructed in accordance with part UHT of the ASME Code must be postweld heat-treated. Where postweld heat treatment is required, the portable tank must be treated as a unit after completion of all the welds in and/or to the shell and heads. The method must be as prescribed in the ASME Code. Welded attachments to pads may be made after postweld heat treatment is made. A portable tank used for anhydrous ammonia must be postweld heat-treated. The postweld heat treatment must be as prescribed in the ASME Code, but in no event at less than 1050 °F tank metal temperature. Additionally, portable tanks constructed in accordance with part UHT of the ASME Code must conform to the following requirements:
                (i) Welding procedure and welder performance tests must be made annually in accordance with Section IX of the ASME Code. In addition to the essential variables named therein, the following must be considered to be essential variables: number of passes, thickness of plate, heat input per pass, and manufacturer's identification of rod and flux. The number of passes, thickness of plate and heat input per pass may not vary more than 25 percent from the qualified procedure. Records of the qualification must be retained for at least 5 years by the portable tank manufacturer or his designated agent and, upon request, made available to a representative of the Department of Transportation or the owner of the tank.

                (ii) Impact tests must be made on a lot basis. A lot is defined as 100 tons or less of the same heat and having a thickness variation no greater than plus or minus 25 percent. The minimum impact required for full-sized specimens shall be 20 foot-pounds (or 10 foot-pounds for half-sized specimens) at 0 °F (−17.8 °F) Charpy V-Notch in both the longitudinal and transverse direction. If the lot test does not pass this requirement, individual plates may be accepted if they individually meet this impact requirement.
                (3) When the shells intended for the transportation of non-refrigerated liquefied compressed gases are equipped with thermal insulation, a device must be provided to prevent any dangerous pressure from developing in the insulating layer in the event of a leak, when the protective covering is closed it must be gas tight. The thermal insulation must not inhibit access to the fittings and discharge devices. In addition, the thermal insulation systems must satisfy the following requirements:
                (i) consist of a shield covering not less than the upper third, but not more than the upper half of the surface of the shell, and separated from the shell by an air space of approximately 40 mm (1.7 inches) across; or

                (ii) consist of a complete cladding of insulating materials. The insulation must be of adequate thickness and constructed to prevent the ingress of moisture and damage to the insulation. The insulation and cladding must have a thermal conductance of not more than 0.67 (W·m−2·K−1) under normal conditions of transportation.
                (c) Service equipment. (1) Each opening with a diameter of more than 1.5 mm (0.1 inch) in the shell of a portable tank, except openings for pressure-relief devices, inspection openings and closed bleed holes, must be fitted with at least three mutually independent shut-off devices in series: the first being an internal stop-valve, excess flow valve, integral excess flow valve, or excess flow feature (see § 178.337-1(g)), the second being an external stop-valve and the third being a blank flange, thread cap, plug or equivalent tight liquid closure device.
                (2) When a portable tank is fitted with an excess flow valve, the excess flow valve must be so fitted that its seating is inside the shell or inside a welded flange or, when fitted externally, its mountings must be designed so that in the event of impact it maintains its effectiveness. The excess flow valves must be selected and fitted so as to close automatically when the rated flow, specified by the manufacturer, is reached. Connections and accessories leading to or from such a valve must have a capacity for a flow more than the excess flow valve's rated flow.
                (3) For filling and discharge openings that are located below the liquid level, the first shut-off device must be an internal stop-valve and the second must be a stop-valve placed in an accessible position on each discharge and filling pipe.
                (4) For filling and discharge openings located below the liquid level of portable tanks intended for the transportation of flammable and/or toxic liquefied compressed gases, the internal stop-valve must be a self-closing safety device that fully closes automatically during filling or discharge in the event of fire engulfment. The device shall fully close within 30 seconds of actuation and the thermal means of closure must actuate at a temperature of not more than 121 °C (250 °F). Except for portable tanks having a capacity less than 1,000 liters (264.2 gallons), this device must be operable by remote control.
                (5) In addition to filling, discharge and gas pressure equalizing orifices, shells may have openings in which gauges, thermometers and manometers can be fitted. Connections for such instruments must be made by suitable welded nozzles or pockets and may not be connected by screwed connections through the shell.
                (6) All portable tanks must be fitted with manholes or other inspection openings of suitable size to allow for internal inspection and adequate access for maintenance and repair of the interior.
                (7) Inlets and discharge outlets on chlorine portable tanks. The inlet and discharge outlets on portable tanks used to transport chlorine must meet the requirements of § 178.337-1(c)(2) and must be fitted with an internal excess flow valve. In addition to the internal excess flow valve, the inlet and discharge outlets must be equipped with an external stop valve (angle valve). Excess flow valves must conform to the standards of The Chlorine Institute, Inc. (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter) as follows:
                
                (i) A valve conforming to Drawing 101-7, dated July 1993, must be installed under each liquid angle valve.
                (ii) A valve conforming to Drawing 106-6, dated July 1993, must be installed under each gas angle valve. For portable tanks used to transport non-refrigerated liquefied gases.
                (8) External fittings must be grouped together as close as reasonably practicable. The following openings may be installed at locations other than on the top or end of the tank:
                (i) The openings for liquid level gauging devices, pressure gauges, or for safety devices, may be installed separately at the other location or in the side of the shell;
                (ii) One plugged opening of 2-inch National Pipe Thread or less provided for maintenance purposes may be located elsewhere;
                (iii) An opening of 3-inch National Pipe Size or less may be provided at another location, when necessary, to facilitate installation of condensing coils.
                (9) Filling and discharge connections are not required to be grouped and may be installed below the normal liquid level of the tank if:
                (i) The portable tank is permanently mounted in a full framework for containerized transport;
                (ii) For each portable tank design, a prototype portable tank, meets the requirements of parts 450 through 453 of this title for compliance with the requirements of Annex II of the International Convention for Safe Containers; and
                (iii) Each filling and discharge outlet meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
                (d) Bottom openings. Bottom openings are prohibited on portable tanks when the UN Portable Tank Table for Liquefied Compressed Gases in § 173.313 of this subchapter indicates that bottom openings are not allowed. In this case, there may be no openings located below the liquid level of the shell when it is filled to its maximum permissible filling limit.
                (e) Pressure relief devices. (1) Portable tanks must be provided with one or more reclosing pressure relief devices. The pressure relief devices must open automatically at a pressure not less than the MAWP and be fully open at a pressure equal to 110% of the MAWP. These devices must, after discharge, close at a pressure not less than 10% below the pressure at which discharge starts and must remain closed at all lower pressures. The pressure relief devices must be of a type that will resist dynamic forces including liquid surge. A frangible disc may only be used in series with a reclosing pressure relief device.
                (2) Pressure relief devices must be designed to prevent the entry of foreign matter, the leakage of gas and the development of any dangerous excess pressure.
                (3) A portable tank intended for the transportation of certain liquefied compressed gases identified in the UN Portable Tank Table for Liquefied Compressed Gases in § 173.313 of this subchapter must have a pressure relief device which conforms to the requirements of this subchapter. Unless a portable tank, in dedicated service, is fitted with a relief device constructed of materials compatible with the hazardous material, the relief device must be comprised of a frangible disc preceded by a reclosing device. The space between the frangible disc and the device must be provided with a pressure gauge or a suitable tell-tale indicator. This arrangement must facilitate the detection of disc rupture, pinholing or leakage which could cause a malfunction of the pressure relief device. The frangible disc must rupture at a nominal pressure 10% above the start-to-discharge pressure of the relief device.
                (4) In the case of portable tanks used for more than one gas, the pressure relief devices must open at a pressure indicated in paragraph (e)(1) of this section for the gas having the highest maximum allowable pressure of the gases allowed to be transported in the portable tank.
                (f) Capacity of relief devices. The combined delivery capacity of the relief devices must be sufficient so that, in the event of total fire engulfment, the pressure inside the shell cannot exceed 120% of the MAWP. Reclosing relief devices must be used to achieve the full relief capacity prescribed. In the case of portable tanks used for more than gas, the combined delivery capacity of the pressure relief devices must be taken for the liquefied compressed gas which requires the highest delivery capacity of the liquefied compressed gases allowed to be transported in the portable tank. The total required capacity of the relief devices must be determined according to the requirements in § 178.275(i). These requirements apply only to liquefied compressed gases which have critical temperatures well above the temperature at the accumulating condition. For gases that have critical temperatures near or below the temperature at the accumulating condition, the calculation of the pressure relief device delivery capacity must consider the additional thermodynamic properties of the gas, for example see CGA S-1.2 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

                § 178.277
                Requirements for the design, construction, inspection and testing of portable tanks intended for the transportation of refrigerated liquefied gases.
                (a) In addition to the requirements of § 178.274 applicable to UN portable tanks, the following requirements and definitions apply to UN portable tanks used for refrigerated liquefied gases:
                
                  Design pressure For the purpose of this section the term “design pressure” is consistent with the definition for design pressure in the ASME Code, Section VIII (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                
                  Holding time is the time, as determined by testing, that will elapse from loading until the pressure of the contents, under equilibrium conditions, reaches the lowest set pressure of the pressure limiting device(s) (for example, pressure control valve or pressure relief device). Holding time must be determined as specified in § 178.338-9.
                
                  Maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP) means the maximum effective gauge pressure permissible at the top of the shell of a loaded portable tank in its operating position including the highest effective pressure during filling and discharge;
                
                  Minimum design temperature means the temperature which is used for the design and construction of the shell not higher than the lowest (coldest) service temperature of the contents during normal conditions of filling, discharge and transportation.
                
                  Shell means the part of the portable tank which retains the refrigerated liquefied gas intended for transport, including openings and their closures, but does not include service equipment or external structural equipment.
                
                  Tank means a construction which normally consists of either:
                (1) A jacket and one or more inner shells where the space between the shell(s) and the jacket is exhausted of air (vacuum insulation) and may incorporate a thermal insulation system; or
                (2) A jacket and an inner shell with an intermediate layer of solid thermally insulating material (for example, solid foam).
                (b) General design and construction requirements. (1) Portable tanks must be of seamless or welded steel construction and have a water capacity of more than 450 liters (118.9 gallons). Portable tanks must be designed, constructed, certified and stamped in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME Code.
                (2) Portable tanks must be postweld heat treated and radiographed as prescribed in Sections V and VIII of the ASME Code except that each tank constructed in accordance with part UHT in Section VIII of the ASME Code must be postweld heat treated. Where postweld heat treatment is required, the tank must be treated as a unit after completion of all the welds to the shell and heads. The method must be as prescribed in the ASME Code. Welded attachments to pads may be made after postweld heat treatment is made. The postweld heat treatment must be as prescribed in Section VIII of the ASME Code, but in no event at less than 1,050 °F tank metal temperature.

                (3) Welding procedure and welder performance tests must be made annually in accordance with Section IX of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). In addition to the essential variables named in the ASME Code, the following must be considered as essential variables: number of passes, thickness of plate, heat input per pass, and the specified rod and flux. The number of passes, thickness of plate and heat input per pass may not vary more than 25% from the procedure qualification. Records of the qualification must be retained for at least 5 years by the portable tank manufacturer and made available to the approval agency and the owner of the portable tank as specified in § 178.273.
                (4) Shells and jackets must be made of metallic materials suitable for forming. Jackets must be made of steel. Non-metallic materials may be used for the attachments and supports between the shell and jacket, provided their material properties at the minimum design temperature are proven to be sufficient. In choosing the material, the minimum design temperature must be taken into account with respect to risk of brittle fracture, to hydrogen embrittlement, to stress corrosion cracking and to resistance to impact.
                (5) Any part of a portable tank, including fittings, gaskets and pipe-work, which can be expected normally to come into contact with the refrigerated liquefied gas transported must be compatible with that refrigerated liquefied gas.
                (6) The thermal insulation system must include a complete covering of the shell with effective insulating materials. External insulation must be protected by a jacket so as to prevent the ingress of moisture and other damage under normal transport conditions.
                (7) When a jacket is so closed as to be gas-tight, a device must be provided to prevent any dangerous pressure from developing in the insulation space.
                (8) Materials which may react with oxygen or oxygen enriched atmospheres in a dangerous manner may not be used in portable tanks intended for the transport of refrigerated liquefied gases having a boiling point below minus 182 °C at atmospheric pressure in locations with the thermal insulation where there is a risk of contact with oxygen or with oxygen enriched fluid.
                (9) Insulating materials must not deteriorate to an extent that the effectiveness of the insulation system, as determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(11) of this section, would be reduced in service.
                (10) A reference holding time must be determined for each refrigerated liquefied gas intended for transport in a portable tank. The reference holding time must be determined by testing in accordance with the requirements of § 178.338-9, considering the following factors:
                (i) The effectiveness of the insulation system, determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(11) of this section;
                (ii) The lowest set pressure of the pressure limiting device;
                (iii) The initial filling conditions;
                (iv) An assumed ambient temperature of 30 °C (86 °F);
                (v) The physical properties of the individual refrigerated liquefied gas intended to be transported.
                (11) The effectiveness of the insulation system (heat influx in watts) may be determined by type testing the portable tank in accordance with a procedure specified in § 178.338-9(c) or by using the holding time test in § 178.338-9(b). This test must consist of either:
                (i) A constant pressure test (for example, at atmospheric pressure) when the loss of refrigerated liquefied gas is measured over a period of time; or
                (ii) A closed system test when the rise in pressure in the shell is measured over a period of time.
                (12) When performing the constant pressure test, variations in atmospheric pressure must be taken into account. When performing either test, corrections must be made for any variation of the ambient temperature from the assumed ambient temperature reference value of 30 °C (86 °F).

                (13) The jacket of a vacuum-insulated double-wall tank must have either an external design pressure not less than 100 kPa (1 bar) gauge pressure calculated in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME Code or a calculated critical collapsing pressure of not less than 200 kPa (2 bar) gauge pressure. Internal and external reinforcements may be included in calculating the ability of the jacket to resist the external pressure.
                
                
                  Note to paragraph (b):
                  For the determination of the actual holding time, as indicated by paragraphs (b)(10), (11), (12), and (13), before each journey, refer to § 178.338-9(b).
                
                
                
                (c) Design criteria. For shells with vacuum insulation, the test pressure must not be less than 1.3 times the sum of the MAWP and 100 kPa (1 bar). In no case may the test pressure be less than 300 kPa (3 bar) gauge pressure.
                (d) Service equipment. (1) Each filling and discharge opening in portable tanks used for the transport of flammable refrigerated liquefied gases must be fitted with at least three mutually independent shut-off devices in series: the first being a stop-valve situated as close as reasonably practicable to the jacket, the second being a stop-valve and the third being a blank flange or equivalent device. The shut-off device closest to the jacket must be a self-closing device, which is capable of being closed from an accessible position on the portable tank that is remote from the valve within 30 seconds of actuation. This device must actuate at a temperature of not more than 121 °C (250 °F).
                (2) Each filling and discharge opening in portable tanks used for the transport of non-flammable refrigerated liquefied gases must be fitted with at least two mutually independent shut-off devices in series: the first being a stop-valve situated as close as reasonably practicable to the jacket and the second a blank flange or equivalent device.
                (3) For sections of piping which can be closed at both ends and where liquid product can be trapped, a method of automatic pressure relief must be provided to prevent excess pressure build-up within the piping.
                (4) Each filling and discharge opening on a portable tank must be clearly marked to indicate its function.
                (5) When pressure-building units are used, the liquid and vapor connections to that unit must be provided with a valve as close to the jacket as reasonably practicable to prevent the loss of contents in case of damage to the pressure-building unit. A check valve may be used for this purpose if it is located on the vapor side of the pressure build-up coil.
                (6) The materials of construction of valves and accessories must have satisfactory properties at the lowest operating temperature of the portable tank.
                (7) Vacuum insulated portable tanks are not required to have an inspection opening.
                (e) Pressure relief devices. (1) Every shell must be provided with not less than two independent reclosing pressure relief devices. The pressure relief devices must open automatically at a pressure not less than the MAWP and be fully open at a pressure equal to 110% of the MAWP. These devices must, after discharge, close at a pressure not lower than 10% below the pressure at which discharge starts and must remain closed at all lower pressures. The pressure relief devices must be of the type that will resist dynamic forces including surge.
                (2) Except for portable tanks used for oxygen, portable tanks for non-flammable refrigerated liquefied gases (except oxygen) and hydrogen may in addition have frangible discs in parallel with the reclosing devices as specified in paragraphs (e)(4)(ii) and (e)(4)(iii) of this section.
                (3) Pressure relief devices must be designed to prevent the entry of foreign matter, the leakage of gas and the development of any dangerous excess pressure.
                (4) Capacity and setting of pressure relief devices. (i) In the case of the loss of vacuum in a vacuum-insulated tank or of loss of 20% of the insulation of a portable tank insulated with solid materials, the combined capacity of all pressure relief devices installed must be sufficient so that the pressure (including accumulation) inside the shell does not exceed 120% of the MAWP.
                (ii) For non-flammable refrigerated liquefied gases (except oxygen) and hydrogen, this capacity may be achieved by the use of frangible discs in parallel with the required safety-relief devices. Frangible discs must rupture at nominal pressure equal to the test pressure of the shell.

                (iii) Under the circumstances described in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) and (e)(4)(ii) of this section, together with complete fire engulfment, the combined capacity of all pressure relief devices installed must be sufficient to limit the pressure in the shell to the test pressure.
                
                (iv) The required capacity of the relief devices must be calculated in accordance with CGA Pamphlet S-1.2 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

Means shall be provided to lock in place the cover for the cells provided for the carrying of detonators. The requirement that not more than one cell be exposed at one time need not apply in the case of detonators, although spaces for such caps and detonators shall be separate. Sufficient annular space shall be provided inside the cover for such detonators that, when the cover is closed, there will be sufficient space to accommodate the wires customarily attached to such caps. If the material is of such a nature as to require treatment to prevent the absorption of moisture, such treatment shall be applied as shall be necessary in order to provide against the penetration of water by permeation. A suitable carrying handle shall be provided, except for which handle no part of the container may project beyond the exterior of the body.
                (b) Exhibited in plates I and II are line drawings of a container for detonators and percussion caps, illustrative of the requirements set forth in § 178.318-2(a). These plates shall not be construed as a part of this specification.

Emergency discharge control can utilize passive or off-truck remote means to stop the unloading operation. A passive means of emergency discharge control automatically shuts off the flow of product without the need for human intervention within 20 seconds of an unintentional release caused by a complete separation of the liquid delivery hose. An off-truck remote means of emergency discharge control permits a qualified person attending the unloading operation to close the cargo tank's internal self-closing stop valve and shut off all motive and auxiliary power equipment at a distance from the cargo tank motor vehicle.
                
                  Excess flow valve, integral excess flow valve, or excess flow feature means a component that will close automatically if the flow rate of a gas or liquid through the component reaches or exceeds the rated flow of gas or liquid specified by the original valve manufacturer when piping mounted directly on the valve is sheared off before the first valve, pump, or fitting downstream from the valve.
                
                  Internal self-closing stop valve means a primary shut off valve installed in a product discharge outlet of a cargo tank and designed to be kept closed by self-stored energy.
                
                  Primary discharge control system means a primary shut-off installed at a product discharge outlet of a cargo tank consisting of an internal self-closing stop valve that may include an integral excess flow valve or an excess flow feature, together with linkages that must be installed between the valve and remote actuator to provide manual and thermal on-truck remote means of closure.

                (a) General requirements and acceptance criteria. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the maximum calculated design stress at any point in the cargo tank may not exceed the maximum allowable stress value prescribed in Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), or 25 percent of the tensile strength of the material used.
                (2) The relevant physical properties of the materials used in each cargo tank may be established either by a certified test report from the material manufacturer or by testing in conformance with a recognized national standard. In either case, the ultimate tensile strength of the material used in the design may not exceed 120 percent of the ultimate tensile strength specified in either the ASME Code or the ASTM standard to which the material is manufactured.
                (3) The maximum design stress at any point in the cargo tank must be calculated separately for the loading conditions described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.

                (B) The tensile or compressive stress resulting from extreme longitudinal acceleration or deceleration. In each case the forces applied must be 0.7 times the vertical reaction at the suspension assembly, applied at the road surface, and as transmitted to the cargo tank wall through the suspension assembly of a trailer during deceleration; or the horizontal pivot of the truck tractor or converter dolly fifth wheel, or the drawbar hinge on the fixed dolly during acceleration; or the anchoring and support members of a truck during acceleration and deceleration, as applicable. The vertical reaction must be calculated based on the static weight of the fully loaded cargo tank motor vehicle, all structural elements, equipment and appurtenances supported by the cargo tank wall. The following loadings must be included:
                (1) The axial load generated by a decelerative force;
                (2) The bending moment generated by a decelerative force;
                (3) The axial load generated by an accelerative force; and
                (4) The bending moment generated by an accelerative force; and
                (C) The tensile or compressive stress generated by the bending moment resulting from an extreme vertical accelerative force equal to 0.7 times the vertical reaction at the suspension assembly of a trailer, and the horizontal pivot of the upper coupler (fifth wheel) or turntable; or the anchoring and support members of a truck, as applicable. The vertical reaction must be calculated based on the static weight of the fully loaded cargo tank motor vehicle, all structural elements, equipment and appurtenances supported by the cargo tank wall.
                (iv) Ss = The following shear stresses generated by static and extreme dynamic loading conditions, in psi:

                (d) In order to account for stresses due to impact in an accident, the design calculations for the cargo tank shell and heads must include the load resulting from the design pressure in combination with the dynamic pressure resulting from a longitudinal deceleration of “2g”. For this loading condition the stress value used may not exceed the lesser of the yield strength or 75 percent of the ultimate tensile strength of the material of construction. For cargo tanks constructed of stainless steel the maximum design stress may not exceed 75 percent of the ultimate tensile strength of the type steel used.

                (e) The minimum metal thickness for the shell and heads on tanks with a design pressure of 100 psig or more must be 4.75 mm (0.187 inch) for steel and 6.86 mm (0.270 inch) for aluminum, except for chlorine and sulfur dioxide tanks. In all cases, the minimum thickness of the tank shell and head shall be determined using structural design requirements in Section VIII of the ASME Code or 25% of the tensile strength of the material used. For a cargo tank used in chlorine or sulfur dioxide service, the cargo tank must be made of steel. A corrosion allowance of 20 percent or 2.54 mm (0.10 inch), whichever is less, must be added to the thickness otherwise required for sulfur dioxide and chlorine tank material. In chlorine cargo tanks, the wall thickness must be at least 1.59 cm (0.625 inch), including corrosion allowance.
                (f) Where a cargo tank support is attached to any part of the cargo tank wall, the stresses imposed on the cargo tank wall must meet the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section.
                (g) The design, construction, and installation of an attachment, appurtenance to the cargo tank, structural support member between the cargo tank and the vehicle or suspension component, or accident protection device must conform to the following requirements:
                (1) Structural members, the suspension sub-frame, accident protection structures, and external circumferential reinforcement devices must be used as sites for attachment of appurtenances and other accessories to the cargo tank, when practicable.
                (2) A lightweight attachment to the cargo tank wall such as a conduit clip, brake line clip, skirting structure, lamp mounting bracket, or placard holder must be of a construction having lesser strength than the cargo tank wall materials and may not be more than 72 percent of the thickness of the material to which it is attached. The lightweight attachment may be secured directly to the cargo tank wall if the device is designed and installed in such a manner that, if damaged, it will not affect the lading retention integrity of the tank. A lightweight attachment must be secured to the cargo tank shell or head by a continuous weld or in such a manner as to preclude formation of pockets which may become sites for corrosion. Attachments meeting the requirements of this paragraph are not authorized for cargo tanks constructed under part UHT in Section VIII of the ASME Code.
                (3) Except as prescribed in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section, the welding of any appurtenance to the cargo tank wall must be made by attachment of a mounting pad so that there will be no adverse effect upon the lading retention integrity of the cargo tank if any force less than that prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is applied from any direction. The thickness of the mounting pad may not be less than that of the shell wall or head wall to which it is attached, and not more than 1.5 times the shell or head thickness. However, a pad with a minimum thickness of 0.25 inch may be used when the shell or head thickness is over 0.25 inch. If weep holes or tell-tale holes are used, the pad must be drilled or punched at the lowest point before it is welded to the tank. Each pad must—
                (i) Be fabricated from material determined to be suitable for welding to both the cargo tank material and the material of the appurtenance or structural support member; a Design Certifying Engineer must make this determination considering chemical and physical properties of the materials and must specify filler material conforming to the requirements in Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (ii) Be preformed to an inside radius no greater than the outside radius of the cargo tank at the attachment location.
                (iii) Extend at least 2 inches in each direction from any point of attachment of an appurtenance or structural support member. This dimension may be measured from the center of the attached structural member.
                (iv) Have rounded corners, or otherwise be shaped in a manner to minimize stress concentrations on the shell or head.
                (v) Be attached by continuous fillet welding. Any fillet weld discontinuity may only be for the purpose of preventing an intersection between the fillet weld and a tank or jacket seam weld.

Records of the qualifications must be retained for at least 5 years by the cargo tank manufacturer and must be made available to duly identified representatives of the Department and the owner of the cargo tank.
                (c) All longitudinal shell welds shall be located in the upper half of the cargo tank.
                (d) Edge preparation of shell and head components may be by machine heat processes, provided such surfaces are remelted in the subsequent welding process. Where there will be no subsequent remelting of the prepared surface as in a tapered section, the final 0.050 inch of material shall be removed by mechanical means.
                (e) The maximum tolerance for misalignment and butting up shall be in accordance with the requirement in Section VIII of the ASME Code.

                § 178.337-8
                Openings, inlets, and outlets.
                (a) General. The requirements in this paragraph (a) apply to MC 331 cargo tanks except for those used to transport chlorine. The requirements for inlets and outlets on chlorine cargo tanks are in paragraph (b) of this section.
                (1) An opening must be provided on each cargo tank used for the transportation of liquefied materials to permit complete drainage.

                (2) Except for gauging devices, thermometer wells, pressure relief valves, manhole openings, product inlet openings, and product discharge openings, each opening in a cargo tank must be closed with a plug, cap, or bolted flange.
                (3) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each product inlet opening, including vapor return lines, must be fitted with a back flow check valve or an internal self-closing stop valve located inside the cargo tank or inside a welded nozzle that is an integral part of the cargo tank. The valve seat must be located inside the cargo tank or within 2.54 cm (one inch) of the external face of the welded flange. Damage to parts exterior to the cargo tank or mating flange must not prevent effective seating of the valve. All parts of a valve inside a cargo tank or welded flange must be made of material that will not corrode or deteriorate in the presence of the lading.
                (4) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(5), (b), and (c) of this section, each liquid or vapor discharge outlet must be fitted with a primary discharge control system as defined in § 178.337-1(g). Thermal remote operators must activate at a temperature of 121.11 °C (250 °F) or less. Linkages between closures and remote operators must be corrosion resistant and effective in all types of environmental conditions incident to discharging of product.
                (i) On a cargo tank over 13,247.5 L (3,500 gallons) water capacity, thermal and mechanical means of remote closure must be installed at the ends of the cargo tank in at least two diagonally opposite locations. If the loading/unloading connection at the cargo tank is not in the general vicinity of one of the two locations specified in the first sentence of this paragraph (a)(4)(i), additional means of thermal remote closure must be installed so that heat from a fire in the loading/unloading connection area or the discharge pump will activate the primary discharge control system. The loading/unloading connection area is where hoses or hose reels are connected to the permanent metal piping.
                (ii) On a cargo tank of 13,247.5 L (3,500 gallons) water capacity or less, a thermal means of remote closure must be installed at or near the internal self-closing stop valve. A mechanical means of remote closure must be installed on the end of the cargo tank furthest away from the loading/unloading connection area. The loading/unloading connection area is where hoses or hose reels are connected to the permanent metal piping. Linkages between closures and remote operators must be corrosion resistant and effective in all types of environmental conditions incident to discharge of product.
                (iii) All parts of a valve inside a cargo tank or within a welded flange must be made of material that will not corrode or deteriorate in the presence of the lading.
                (iv) An excess flow valve, integral excess flow valve, or excess flow feature must close if the flow reaches the rated flow of a gas or liquid specified by the original valve manufacturer when piping mounted directly on the valve is sheared off before the first valve, pump, or fitting downstream from the excess flow valve, integral excess flow valve, or excess flow feature.
                (v) An integral excess flow valve or the excess flow feature of an internal self-closing stop valve may be designed with a bypass, not to exceed 0.1016 cm (0.040 inch) diameter opening, to allow equalization of pressure.
                (vi) The internal self-closing stop valve must be designed so that the self-stored energy source and the valve seat are located inside the cargo tank or within 2.54 cm (one inch) of the external face of the welded flange. Damage to parts exterior to the cargo tank or mating flange must not prevent effective seating of the valve.
                (5) A primary discharge control system is not required on the following:
                (i) A vapor or liquid discharge opening of less than 11/4 NPT equipped with an excess flow valve together with a manually operated external stop valve in place of an internal self-closing stop valve.
                (ii) An engine fuel line on a truck-mounted cargo tank of not more than 3/4 NPT equipped with a valve having an integral excess flow valve or excess flow feature.

                (iii) A cargo tank motor vehicle used to transport refrigerated liquids such as argon, carbon dioxide, helium, krypton, neon, nitrogen, and xenon, or mixtures thereof.
                
                (6) In addition to the internal self-closing stop valve, each filling and discharge line must be fitted with a stop valve located in the line between the internal self-closing stop valve and the hose connection. A back flow check valve or excess flow valve may not be used to satisfy this requirement.
                (7) An excess flow valve may be designed with a bypass, not to exceed a 0.1016 centimeter (0.040 inch) diameter opening, to allow equalization of pressure.
                (b) Inlets and discharge outlets on chlorine tanks. The inlet and discharge outlets on a cargo tank used to transport chlorine must meet the requirements of § 178.337-1(c)(2) and must be fitted with an internal excess flow valve. In addition to the internal excess flow valve, the inlet and discharge outlets must be equipped with an external stop valve (angle valve). Excess flow valves must conform to the standards of The Chlorine Institute, Inc., as follows:
                (1) A valve conforming to The Chlorine Institute, Inc., Dwg. 101-7 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), must be installed under each liquid angle valve.
                (2) A valve conforming to The Chlorine Institute, Inc., Dwg. 106-6 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), must be installed under each gas angle valve.
                (c) Discharge outlets on carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid, cargo tanks. A discharge outlet on a cargo tank used to transport carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid is not required to be fitted with an internal self-closing stop valve.

                (2) On cargo tanks for carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide see § 173.315 (i) (9) and (10) of this subchapter.
                (3) Each valve must be designed, constructed, and marked for a rated pressure not less than the cargo tank design pressure at the temperature expected to be encountered.
                (b) Piping, valves, hose, and fittings. (1) The burst pressure of all piping, pipe fittings, hose and other pressure parts, except for pump seals and pressure relief devices, must be at least 4 times the design pressure of the cargo tank. Additionally, the burst pressure may not be less than 4 times any higher pressure to which each pipe, pipe fitting, hose or other pressure part may be subjected to in service. For chlorine service, see paragraph (b)(7) of this section.
                (2) Pipe joints must be threaded, welded, or flanged. If threaded pipe is used, the pipe and fittings must be Schedule 80 weight or heavier, except for sacrificial devices. Malleable metal, stainless steel, or ductile iron must be used in the construction of primary valve body parts and fittings used in liquid filling or vapor equalization. Stainless steel may be used for internal components such as shutoff discs and springs except where incompatible with the lading to be transported. Where copper tubing is permitted, joints must be brazed or be of equally strong metal union type. The melting point of the brazing material may not be lower than 538 °C (1,000 °F). The method of joining tubing may not reduce the strength of the tubing.
                (3) Each hose coupling must be designed for a pressure of at least 120 percent of the hose design pressure and so that there will be no leakage when connected.
                (4) Piping must be protected from damage due to thermal expansion and contraction, jarring, and vibration. Slip joints are not authorized for this purpose.
                (5) [Reserved]
                (6) Cargo tank manufacturers and fabricators must demonstrate that all piping, valves, and fittings on a cargo tank are free from leaks. To meet this requirement, the piping, valves, and fittings must be tested after installation at not less than 80 percent of the design pressure marked on the cargo tank.
                (7) A hose assembler must:
                (i) Permanently mark each hose assembly with a unique identification number.

                (ii) Demonstrate that each hose assembly is free from leaks by performing the tests and inspections in § 180.416(f) of this subchapter.
                
                (iii) Mark each hose assembly with the month and year of its original pressure test.
                (8) Chlorine cargo tanks. Angle valves on cargo tanks intended for chlorine service must conform to the standards of the Chlorine Institute, Inc., Drawing; Dwg. 104-8; or “Section 3, Pamphlet 166, Angle Valve Guidelines for Chlorine Bulk Transportation;” or “Sections 4 through 6, Pamphlet 168, Guidelines for Dual Valve Systems for Bulk Chlorine Transport” (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). Before installation, each angle valve must be tested for leakage at not less than 225 psig using dry air or inert gas.
                (c) Marking inlets and outlets. Except for gauging devices, thermometer wells, and pressure relief valves, each cargo tank inlet and outlet must be marked “liquid” or “vapor” to designate whether it communicates with liquid or vapor when the cargo tank is filled to the maximum permitted filling density. A filling line that communicates with vapor may be marked “spray-fill” instead of “vapor.”
                (d) Refrigeration and heating coils. (1) Refrigeration and heating coils must be securely anchored with provisions for thermal expansion. The coils must be pressure tested externally to at least the cargo tank test pressure, and internally to either the tank test pressure or twice the working pressure of the heating/refrigeration system, whichever is higher. A cargo tank may not be placed in service if any leakage occurs or other evidence of damage is found. The refrigerant or heating medium to be circulated through the coils must not be capable of causing any adverse chemical reaction with the cargo tank lading in the event of leakage. The unit furnishing refrigeration may be mounted on the motor vehicle.
                (2) Where any liquid susceptible to freezing, or the vapor of any such liquid, is used for heating or refrigeration, the heating or refrigeration system shall be arranged to permit complete drainage.

All material used for tank pressure parts must conform to the requirements in Section II of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). All material used for evacuated jacket pressure parts must conform to the chemistry and steelmaking practices of one of the material specifications of Section II of the ASME Code or the following ASTM Specifications (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter): A 242, A 441, A 514, A 572, A 588, A 606, A 633, A 715, A 1008/A 1008M, A 1011/A 1011M.
                (b) All tie-rods, mountings, and other appurtenances within the jacket and all piping, fittings and valves must be of material suitable for use at the lowest temperature to be encountered.
                (c) Impact tests are required on all tank materials, except materials that are excepted from impact testing by the ASME Code, and must be performed using the procedure prescribed in Section VIII of the ASME Code.
                (d) The direction of final rolling of the shell material must be the circumferential orientation of the tank shell.

                (e) Each tank constructed in accordance with part UHT in Section VIII of the ASME Code must be postweld heat treated as a unit after completion of all welds to the shell and heads. Other tanks must be postweld heat treated as required in Section VIII of the ASME Code. For all tanks the method must be as prescribed in the ASME Code. Welded attachments to pads may be made after postweld heat treatment.
                
                (f) The fabricator shall record the heat and slab numbers and the certified Charpy impact values of each plate used in the tank on a sketch showing the location of each plate in the shell and heads of the tank.

                § 178.338-3
                Structural integrity.
                (a) General requirements and acceptance criteria. (1) Except as permitted in paragraph (d) of this section, the maximum calculated design stress at any point in the tank may not exceed the lesser of the maximum allowable stress value prescribed in Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), or 25 percent of the tensile strength of the material used.
                (2) The relevant physical properties of the materials used in each tank may be established either by a certified test report from the material manufacturer or by testing in conformance with a recognized national standard. In either case, the ultimate tensile strength of the material used in the design may not exceed 120 percent of the minimum ultimate tensile strength specified in either the ASME Code or the ASTM standard to which the material is manufactured.
                (3) The maximum design stress at any point in the tank must be calculated separately for the loading conditions described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. Alternate test or analytical methods, or a combination thereof, may be used in lieu of the procedures described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, if the methods are accurate and verifiable.
                (4) Corrosion allowance material may not be included to satisfy any of the design calculation requirements of this section.
                (b) Static design and construction. (1) The static design and construction of each tank must be in accordance with appendix G in Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). The tank design must include calculation of stress due to the design pressure, the weight of lading, the weight of structures supported by the tank wall, and the effect of temperature gradients resulting from lading and ambient temperature extremes. When dissimilar materials are used, their thermal coefficients must be used in calculation of the thermal stresses.
                (2) Stress concentrations in tension, bending, and torsion which occur at pads, cradles, or other supports must be considered in accordance with appendix G in Section VIII of the ASME Code.

                (c) Stresses resulting from static and dynamic loadings, or a combination thereof, are not uniform throughout the cargo tank motor vehicle. The following is a simplified procedure for calculating the effective stress in the tank resulting from static and dynamic loadings. The effective stress (the maximum principal stress at any point) must be determined by the following formula:
                
                S = 0.5 (Sy + Sx) ±(0.25(Sy − Sx)2 + Ss2) 0.5
                
                
                Where:
                
                (1) S = effective stress at any given point under the most severe combination of static and dynamic loadings that can occur at the same time, in psi.
                (2) Sy = circumferential stress generated by internal and external pressure when applicable, in psi.
                (3) Sx = the net longitudinal stress, in psi, generated by the following loading conditions:
                (i) The longitudinal tensile stress generated by internal pressure;
                (ii) The tensile or compressive stress generated by the axial load resulting from a decelerative force applied independently to each suspension assembly at the road surface using applicable static loadings specified in § 178.338-13 (b);

                (iii) The tensile or compressive stress generated by the bending moment resulting from a decelerative force applied independently to each suspension assembly at the road surface using applicable static loadings specified in § 178.338-13 (b);
                
                (iv) The tensile or compressive stress generated by the axial load resulting from an accelerative force applied to the horizontal pivot of the fifth wheel supporting the vehicle using applicable static loadings specified in § 178.338-13 (b);
                (v) The tensile or compressive stress generated by the bending moment resulting from an accelerative force applied to the horizontal pivot of the fifth wheel supporting the vehicle using applicable static loadings specified in § 178.338-13 (b); and
                (vi) The tensile or compressive stress generated by a bending moment produced by a vertical force using applicable static loadings specified in § 178.338-13 (b).
                (4) Ss = The following shear stresses that apply, in psi,: The vectorial sum of the applicable shear stresses in the plane under consideration, including direct shear generated by the static vertical loading; direct lateral and torsional shear generated by a lateral accelerative force applied at the road surface, using applicable static loads specified in § 178.338-13 (b)
                (d) In order to account for stresses due to impact in an accident, the design calculations for the tank shell and heads must include the load resulting from the design pressure in combination with the dynamic pressure resulting from a longitudinal deceleration of “2g”. For this loading condition the stress value used may not exceed the lesser of the yield strength or 75 percent of the ultimate tensile strength of the material of construction. For a cargo tank constructed of stainless steel, the maximum design stress may not exceed 75 percent of the ultimate tensile strength of the type steel used.
                (e) The minimum thickness of the shell or heads of the tank must be 0.187 inch for steel and 0.270 inch for aluminum. However, the minimum thickness for steel may be 0.110 inches provided the cargo tank is:
                (1) Vacuum insulated, or
                (2) Double walled with a load bearing jacket designed to carry a proportionate amount of structural loads prescribed in this section.
                (f) Where a tank support is attached to any part of the tank wall, the stresses imposed on the tank wall must meet the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section.
                (g) The design, construction and installation of an attachment, appurtenance to the cargo tank or structural support member between the cargo tank and the vehicle or suspension component or accident protection device must conform to the following requirements:
                (1) Structural members, the suspension subframe, accident protection structures and external circumferential reinforcement devices must be used as sites for attachment of appurtenances and other accessories to the cargo tank, when practicable.
                (2) A lightweight attachment to the cargo tank wall such as a conduit clip, brakeline clip, skirting structure, lamp mounting bracket, or placard holder must be of a construction having lesser strength than the cargo tank wall materials and may not be more than 72 percent of the thickness of the material to which it is attached. The lightweight attachment may be secured directly to the cargo tank wall if the device is designed and installed in such a manner that, if damaged, it will not affect the lading retention integrity of the tank. A lightweight attachment must be secured to the cargo tank shell or head by a continuous weld or in such a manner as to preclude formation of pockets that may become sites for corrosion. Attachments meeting the requirements of this paragraph are not authorized for cargo tanks constructed under part UHT in Section VIII of the ASME Code.

                (3) Except as prescribed in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section, the welding of any appurtenance the cargo tank wall must be made by attachment of a mounting pad so that there will be no adverse effect upon the lading retention integrity of the cargo tank if any force less than that prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is applied from any direction. The thickness of the mounting pad may not be less than that of the shell or head to which it is attached, and not more than 1.5 times the shell or head thickness. However, a pad with a minimum thickness of 0.187 inch may be used when the shell or head thickness is over 0.187 inch. If weep holes or tell-tale holes are used, the pad must be drilled or punched at the lowest point before it is welded to the tank. Each pad must:
                (i) Be fabricated from material determined to be suitable for welding to both the cargo tank material and the material of the appurtenance or structural support member; a Design Certifying Engineer must make this determination considering chemical and physical properties of the materials and must specify filler material conforming to the requirements in Section IX of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (ii) Be preformed to an inside radius no greater than the outside radius of the cargo tank at the attachment location.
                (iii) Extend at least 2 inches in each direction from any point of attachment of an appurtenance or structural support member. This dimension may be measured from the center of the attached structural member.
                (iv) Have rounded corners, or otherwise be shaped in a manner to minimize stress concentrations on the shell or head.
                (v) Be attached by continuous fillet welding. Any fillet weld discontinuity may only be for the purpose of preventing an intersection between the fillet weld and a tank or jacket seam weld.

                (a) All joints in the tank, and in the jacket if evacuated, must be as prescribed in Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), except that a butt weld with one plate edge offset is not authorized.
                (b) Welding procedure and welder performance tests must be made in accordance with Section IX of the ASME Code. Records of the qualification must be retained by the tank manufacturer for at least five years and must be made available, upon request, to any duly identified representative of the Department, or the owner of the cargo tank.
                (c) All longitudinal welds in tanks and load bearing jackets must be located so as not to intersect nozzles or supports other than load rings and stiffening rings.
                (d) Substructures must be properly fitted before attachment and the welding sequence must minimize stresses due to shrinkage of welds.
                (e) Filler material containing more than 0.05 percent vanadium may not be used with quenched and tempered steel.
                (f) All tank nozzle-to-shell and nozzle-to-head welds must be full penetration welds.

                (a) The inlet to the liquid product discharge opening of each tank intended for flammable ladings must be at the bottom centerline of the tank.
                (b) If the leakage of a single valve, except a pressure relief valve, pressure control valve, full trycock or gas phase manual vent valve, would permit loss of flammable material, an additional closure that is leak tight at the tank design pressure must be provided outboard of such valve.

                § 178.338-8
                Pressure relief devices, piping, valves, and fittings.
                (a) Pressure relief devices. Each tank pressure relief device must be designed, constructed, and marked in accordance with § 173.318(b) of this subchapter.
                (b) Piping, valves, and fittings. (1) The burst pressure of all piping, pipe fittings, hoses and other pressure parts, except for pump seals and pressure relief devices, must be at least 4 times the design pressure of the tank. Additionally, the burst pressure may not be less than 4 times any higher pressure to which each pipe, pipe fitting, hose or other pressure part may be subjected to in service.
                (2) Pipe joints must be threaded, welded or flanged. If threaded pipe is used, the pipe and fittings must be Schedule 80 weight or heavier. Malleable metals must be used in the construction of valves and fittings. Where copper tubing is permitted, joints shall be brazed or be of equally strong metal union type. The melting point of the brazing materials may not be lower than 1000 °F. The method of joining tubing may not reduce the strength of the tubing, such as by the cutting of threads.
                (3) Each hose coupling must be designed for a pressure of at least 120 percent of the hose design pressure and so that there will be no leakage when connected.
                (4) Piping must be protected from damage due to thermal expansion and contraction, jarring, and vibration. Slip joints are not authorized for this purpose.
                (5) All piping, valves and fittings on a cargo tank must be proved free from leaks. This requirement is met when such piping, valves, and fittings have been tested after installation with gas or air and proved leak tight at not less than the design pressure marked on the cargo tank. This requirement is applicable to all hoses used in a cargo tank, except that hose may be tested before or after installation on the tank.
                (6) Each valve must be suitable for the tank design pressure at the tank design service temperature.
                (7) All fittings must be rated for the maximum tank pressure and suitable for the coldest temperature to which they will be subjected in actual service.
                (8) All piping, valves, and fittings must be grouped in the smallest practicable space and protected from damage as required by § 178.338-10.
                (9) When a pressure-building coil is used on a tank designed to handle oxygen or flammable ladings, the vapor connection to that coil must be provided with a valve or check valve as close to the tank shell as practicable to prevent the loss of vapor from the tank in case of damage to the coil. The liquid connection to that coil must also be provided with a valve.

                § 178.338-9
                Holding time.
                (a) “Holding time” is the time, as determined by testing, that will elapse from loading until the pressure of the contents, under equilibrium conditions, reaches the level of the lowest pressure control valve or pressure relief valve setting.
                (b) Holding time test. (1) The test to determine holding time must be performed by charging the tank with a cryogenic liquid having a boiling point, at a pressure of one atmosphere, absolute, no lower than the design service temperature of the tank. The tank must be charged to its maximum permitted filling density with that liquid and stabilized to the lowest practical pressure, which must be equal to or less than the pressure to be used for loading. The cargo tank together with its contents must then be exposed to ambient temperature.
                
                (2) The tank pressure and ambient temperature must be recorded at 3-hour intervals until the pressure level of the contents reaches the set-to-discharge pressure of the pressure control valve or pressure relief valve with the lowest setting. This total time lapse in hours represents the measured holding time at the actual average ambient temperature. This measured holding time for the test cryogenic liquid must be adjusted to an equivalent holding time for each cryogenic liquid that is to be identified on or adjacent to the specification plate, at an average ambient temperature of 85 °F. This is the rated holding time (RHT). The marked rated holding time (MRHT) displayed on or adjacent to the specification plate (see § 178.338-18(c)(10)) may not exceed this RHT.
                (c) Optional test regimen. (1) If more than one cargo tank is made to the same design, only one cargo tank must be subjected to the full holding time test at the time of manufacture. However, each subsequent cargo tank made to the same design must be performance tested during its first trip. The holding time determined in this test may not be less than 90 percent of the marked rated holding time. This test must be performed in accordance with §§ 173.318(g)(3) and 177.840(h) of this subchapter, regardless of the classification of the cryogenic liquid.
                (2) Same design. The term “same design” as used in this section means cargo tanks made to the same design type. See § 178.320(a) for definition of “design type”.
                (3) For a cargo tank used in nonflammable cryogenic liquid service, in place of the holding time tests prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, the marked rated holding time (MRHT) may be determined as follows:

                (i) While the cargo tank is stationary, the heat transfer rate must be determined by measuring the normal evaporation rate (NER) of the test cryogenic liquid (preferably the lading, where feasible) maintained at approximately one atmosphere. The calculated heat transfer rate must be determined from:
                
                q = [n(Δ h)(85−t1)] / [ts − tf]
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  q = calculated heat transfer rate to cargo tank with lading, Btu/hr.
                  n = normal evaporation rate (NER), which is the rate of evaporation, determined by the test of a test cryogenic liquid in a cargo tank maintained at a pressure of approximately one atmosphere, absolute, lb/hr.
                  Δ h = latent heat of vaporization of test fluid at test pressure, Btu/lb.
                  ts = average temperature of outer shell during test, °F.
                  t1 = equilibrium temperature of lading at maximum loading pressure, °F.
                  tf = equilibrium temperature of test fluid at one atmosphere, °F.
                
                

                (ii) The rated holding time (RHT) must be calculated as follows:
                
                RHT = [(U2 − U1) W] / q
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  RHT = rated holding time, in hours
                  U1 and U2 = internal energy for the combined liquid and vapor lading at the pressure offered for transportation, and the set pressure of the applicable pressure control valve or pressure relief valve, respectively, Btu/lb.
                  W = total weight of the combined liquid and vapor lading in the cargo tank, pounds.
                  q = calculated heat transfer rate to cargo tank with lading, Btu/hr.
                
                
                (iii) The MRHT (see § 178.338-18(b)(9) of this subchapter) may not exceed the RHT.

                (a) All valves, fittings, pressure relief devices and other accessories to the tank proper, which are not isolated from the tank by closed intervening shut-off valves or check valves, must be installed within the motor vehicle framework or within a suitable collision resistant guard or housing, and appropriate ventilation must be provided. Each pressure relief device must be protected so that in the event of the upset of the vehicle onto a hard surface, the device's opening will not be prevented and its discharge will not be restricted.

                (b) Each protective device or housing, and its attachment to the vehicle structure, must be designed to withstand static loading in any direction that it may be loaded as a result of front, rear, side, or sideswipe collision, or the overturn of the vehicle. The static loading shall equal twice the loaded weight of the tank and attachments. A safety factor of four, based on the tensile strength of the material, shall be used. The protective device or the housing must be made of steel at least 3/16-inch thick, or other material of equivalent strength.

                (1) Consist of at least one rear bumper designed to protect the cargo tank and piping in the event of a rear-end collision. The rear-end tank protection device design must transmit the force of the collision directly to the chassis of the vehicle. The rear-end tank protection device and its attachments to the chassis must be designed to withstand a load equal to twice the weight of the loaded cargo tank and attachments, using a safety factor of four based on the tensile strength of the materials used, with such load being applied horizontally and parallel to the major axis of the cargo tank. The rear-end tank protection device dimensions must meet the requirements of § 393.86 of this title and extend vertically to a height adequate to protect all valves and fittings located at the rear of the cargo tank from damage that could result in loss of lading; or
                (2) Conform to the requirements of § 178.345-8(b).
                (d) Every part of the loaded cargo tank, and any associated valve, pipe, enclosure, or protective device or structure (exclusive of wheel assemblies), must be at least 14 inches above level ground.

                Discharge control devices.
                (a) Excess-flow valves are not required.
                (b) Each liquid filling and liquid discharge line must be provided with a shut-off valve located as close to the tank as practicable. Unless this valve is manually operable at the valve, the line must also have a manual shut-off valve.
                (c) Except for a cargo tank that is used to transport argon, carbon dioxide, helium, krypton, neon, nitrogen, xenon, or mixtures thereof, each liquid filling and liquid discharge line must be provided with an on-vehicle remotely controlled self-closing shutoff valve.
                (1) If pressure from a reservoir or from an engine-driven pump or compressor is used to open this valve, the control must be of fail-safe design and spring-biased to stop the admission of such pressure into the cargo tank. If the jacket is not evacuated, the seat of the valve must be inside the tank, in the opening nozzle or flange, or in a companion flange bolted to the nozzle. If the jacket is evacuated, the remotely controlled valve must be located as close to the tank as practicable.
                (2) Each remotely controlled shut off valve must be provided with on-vehicle remote means of automatic closure, both mechanical and thermal. One means may be used to close more than one remotely controlled valve. Cable linkage between closures and remote operators must be corrosion resistant and effective in all types of environment and weather. The thermal means must consist of fusible elements actuated at a temperature not exceeding 121 °C (250 °F), or equivalent devices. The loading/unloading connection area is where hoses are connected to the permanent metal piping. The number and location of remote operators and thermal devices shall be as follows:
                (i) On a cargo tank motor vehicle over 3,500 gallons water capacity, remote means of automatic closure must be installed at the ends of the cargo tank in at least two diagonally opposite locations. If the loading/unloading connection at the cargo tank is not in the general vicinity of one of these locations, at least one additional thermal device must be installed so that heat from a fire in the loading/unloading connection area will activate the emergency control system.

                (ii) On a cargo tank motor vehicle of 3,500 gallons water capacity or less, at least one remote means of automatic closure must be installed on the end of the cargo tank farthest away from the loading/unloading connection area. At least one thermal device must be installed so that heat from a fire in the loading/unloading connection area will activate the emergency control system.

                Unless the valve is located in a rear cabinet forward of and protected by the bumper (see § 178.338-10(c)), the design and installation of each valve, damage to which could result in loss of liquid or vapor, must incorporate a shear section or breakage groove adjacent to, and outboard of, the valve. The shear section or breakage groove must yield or break under strain without damage to the valve that would allow the loss of liquid or vapor. The protection specified in § 178.338-10 is not a substitute for a shear section or breakage groove.

                Supporting and anchoring.
                (a) On a cargo tank motor vehicle designed and constructed so that the cargo tank constitutes in whole or in part the structural member used in place of a motor vehicle frame, the cargo tank or the jacket must be supported by external cradles or by load rings. For a cargo tank mounted on a motor vehicle frame, the tank or jacket must be supported by external cradles, load rings, or longitudinal members. If cradles are used, they must subtend at least 120 degrees of the cargo tank circumference. The design calculations for the supports and load-bearing tank or jacket, and the support attachments must include beam stress, shear stress, torsion stress, bending moment, and acceleration stress for the loaded vehicle as a unit, using a safety factor of four, based on the tensile strength of the material, and static loading that uses the weight of the cargo tank and its attachments when filled to the design weight of the lading (see appendix G in Section VIII of the ASME Code) (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), multiplied by the following factors. The effects of fatigue must also be considered in the calculations. Minimum static loadings must be as follows:
                (1) For a vacuum-insulated cargo tank—
                (i) Vertically downward of 2;
                (ii) Vertically upward of 2;
                (iii) Longitudinally of 2; and
                (iv) Laterally of 2.
                (2) For any other insulated cargo tank—
                (i) Vertically downward of 3;
                (ii) Vertically upward of 2;
                (iii) Longitudinally of 2; and
                (iv) Laterally of 2.
                (b) When a loaded tank is supported within the vacuum jacket by structural members, the design calculations for the tank and its structural members must be based on a safety factor of four and the tensile strength of the material at ambient temperature. The enhanced tensile strength of the material at actual operating temperature may be substituted for the tensile strength at ambient temperature to the extent recognized in the ASME Code for static loadings. Static loadings must take into consideration the weight of the tank and the structural members when the tank is filled to the design weight of lading (see Appendix G of Section VIII, Division 1 of the ASME Code), multiplied by the following factors. Static loadings must take into consideration the weight of the tank and the structural members when the tank is filled to the design weight of lading (see appendix G in Section VIII of the ASME Code), multiplied by the following factors. When load rings in the jacket are used for supporting the tank, they must be designed to carry the fully loaded tank at the specified static loadings, plus external pressure. Minimum static loadings must be as follows:
                (1) Vertically downward of 2;
                (2) Vertically upward of 11/2;
                (3) Longitudinally of 11/2; and, (4) Laterally of 11/2.

                Gauging devices.
                (a) Liquid level gauging devices. (1) Unless a cargo tank is intended to be filled by weight, it must be equipped with one or more gauging devices, which accurately indicate the maximum permitted liquid level at the loading pressure, in order to provide a minimum of two percent outage below the inlet of the pressure control valve or pressure relief valve at the condition of incipient opening of that valve. A fixed-length dip tube, a fixed trycock line, or a differential pressure liquid level gauge must be used as the primary control for filling. Other gauging devices, except gauge glasses, may be used, but not as the primary control for filling.
                (2) The design pressure of each liquid level gauging device must be at least that of the tank.
                (3) If a fixed length dip tube or trycock line gauging device is used, it must consist of a pipe or tube of small diameter equipped with a valve at or near the jacket and extending into the cargo tank to a specified filling height. The fixed height at which the tube ends in the cargo tank must be such that the device will function when the liquid reaches the maximum level permitted in loading.
                (4) The liquid level gauging device used as a primary control for filling must be designed and installed to accurately indicate the maximum filling level at the point midway of the tank both longitudinally and laterally.
                (b) Pressure gauges. Each cargo tank must be provided with a suitable pressure gauge indicating the lading pressure and located on the front of the jacket so it can be read by the driver in the rear view mirror. Each gauge must have a reference mark at the cargo tank design pressure or the set pressure of the pressure relief valve or pressure control valve, whichever is lowest.
                (c) Orifices. All openings for dip tube gauging devices and pressure gauges in flammable cryogenic liquid service must be restricted at or inside the jacket by orifices no larger than 0.060-inch diameter. Trycock lines, if provided, may not be greater than 1/2-inch nominal pipe size.

                § 178.338-15
                Cleanliness.
                A cargo tank constructed for oxygen service must be thoroughly cleaned to remove all foreign material in accordance with CGA G-4.1 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). All loose particles from fabrication, such as weld beads, dirt, grinding wheel debris, and other loose materials, must be removed prior to the final closure of the manhole of the tank. Chemical or solvent cleaning with a material compatible with the intending lading must be performed to remove any contaminants likely to react with the lading.

                Inspection and testing.
                (a) General. The material of construction of a tank and its appurtenances must be inspected for conformance to Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). The tank must be subjected to either a hydrostatic or pneumatic test. The test pressure must be one and one-half times the sum of the design pressure, plus static head of lading, plus 101.3 kPa (14.7 psi) if subjected to external vacuum, except that for tanks constructed in accordance with Part UHT in Section VIII of the ASME Code the test pressure must be twice the design pressure.
                (b) Additional requirements for pneumatic test. A pneumatic test may be used in place of the hydrostatic test. Due regard for protection of all personnel should be taken because of the potential hazard involved in a pneumatic test. The pneumatic test pressure in the tank must be reached by gradually increasing the pressure to one-half of the test pressure. Thereafter, the test pressure must be increased in steps of approximately one-tenth of the test pressure until the required test pressure has been reached. Then the pressure must be reduced to a value equal to four-fifths of the test pressure and held for a sufficient time to permit inspection of the cargo tank for leaks.
                (c) Weld inspection. All tank shell or head welds subject to pressure shall be radiographed in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME Code. A tank which has been subjected to inspection by the magnetic particle method, the liquid penetrant method, or any method involving a material deposit on the interior tank surface, must be cleaned to remove any such residue by scrubbing or equally effective means, and all such residue and cleaning solution must be removed from the tank prior to final closure of the tank.
                (d) Defect repair. All cracks and other defects must be repaired as prescribed in Section VIII of the ASME Code. The welder and the welding procedure must be qualified in accordance with Section IX of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). After repair, the tank must again be postweld heat-treated, if such heat treatment was previously performed, and the repaired areas must be retested.
                (e) Verification must be made of the interior cleanliness of a tank constructed for oxygen service by means that assure that all contaminants that are likely to react with the lading have been removed as required by § 178.338-15.

They may be driven by motor vehicle power take-off or other mechanical, electrical, or hydraulic means. Unless they are of the centrifugal type, they shall be equipped with suitable pressure actuated by-pass valves permitting flow from discharge to suction to the tank.

                (a) General. Each cargo tank certified after October 1, 2004 must have a corrosion-resistant metal name plate (ASME Plate) and specification plate permanently attached to the cargo tank by brazing, welding, or other suitable means on the left side near the front, in a place accessible for inspection. If the specification plate is attached directly to the cargo tank wall by welding, it must be welded to the tank before the cargo tank is postweld heat treated.
                (1) The plates must be legibly marked by stamping, embossing, or other means of forming letters into the metal of the plate, with the information required in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, in addition to that required by Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), in characters at least 3/16 inch high (parenthetical abbreviations may be used). All plates must be maintained in a legible condition.
                (2) Each insulated cargo tank must have additional plates, as described, attached to the jacket in the location specified unless the specification plate is attached to the chassis and has the information required in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
                (3) The information required for both the name and specification plate may be displayed on a single plate. If the information required by this section is displayed on a plate required by Section VIII of the ASME Code, the information need not be repeated on the name and specification plates.
                (4) The specification plate may be attached to the cargo tank motor vehicle chassis rail by brazing, welding, or other suitable means on the left side near the front head, in a place accessible for inspection. If the specification plate is attached to the chassis rail, then the cargo tank serial number assigned by the cargo tank manufacturer must be included on the plate.

                Structural integrity.
                (a) General requirements and acceptance criteria. (1) The maximum calculated design stress at any point in the cargo tank wall may not exceed the maximum allowable stress value prescribed in Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), or 25 percent of the tensile strength of the material used at design conditions.
                (2) The relevant physical properties of the materials used in each cargo tank may be established either by a certified test report from the material manufacturer or by testing in conformance with a recognized national standard. In either case, the ultimate tensile strength of the material used in the design may not exceed 120 percent of the minimum ultimate tensile strength specified in either the ASME Code or the ASTM standard to which the material is manufactured.
                (3) The maximum design stress at any point in the cargo tank must be calculated separately for the loading conditions described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Alternate test or analytical methods, or a combination thereof, may be used in place of the procedures described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, if the methods are accurate and verifiable. TTMA RP 96-01, Structural Integrity of DOT 406, DOT 407, and DOT 412 Cylindrical Cargo Tanks, may be used as guidance in performing the calculations.

                (b) ASME Code design and construction. The static design and construction of each cargo tank must be in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME Code. The cargo tank design must include calculation of stresses generated by the MAWP, the weight of the lading, the weight of structures supported by the cargo tank wall and the effect of temperature gradients resulting from lading and ambient temperature extremes. When dissimilar materials are used, their thermal coefficients must be used in the calculation of thermal stresses.
                (1) Stress concentrations in tension, bending and torsion which occur at pads, cradles, or other supports must be considered in accordance with appendix G in Section VIII of the ASME Code.
                (2) Longitudinal compressive buckling stress for ASME certified vessels must be calculated using paragraph UG-23(b) in Section VIII of the ASME Code. For cargo tanks not required to be certified in accordance with the ASME Code, compressive buckling stress may be calculated using alternative analysis methods which are accurate and verifiable. When alternative methods are used, calculations must include both the static loads described in this paragraph and the dynamic loads described in paragraph (c) of this section.

                S = 0.5(Sy + Sx) ±[0.25(Sy − Sx)2 + SS
                  2]0.5
                
                
                Where:

In each case the forces applied must be 0.7 times the vertical reaction at the suspension assembly, applied at the road surface, and as transmitted to the cargo tank wall through the suspension assembly of a trailer during deceleration; or the horizontal pivot of the truck tractor or converter dolly fifth wheel, or the drawbar hinge on the fixed dolly during acceleration; or the anchoring and support members of a truck during acceleration and deceleration, as applicable. The vertical reaction must be calculated based on the static weight of the fully loaded cargo tank motor vehicle, all structural elements, equipment and appurtenances supported by the cargo tank wall. The following loadings must be included:
                (1) The axial load generated by a decelerative force;
                
                (2) The bending moment generated by a decelerative force;
                (3) The axial load generated by an accelerative force; and
                (4) The bending moment generated by an accelerative force; and
                (C) The tensile or compressive stress generated by the bending moment resulting from an extreme vertical accelerative force equal to 0.7 times the vertical reaction at the suspension assembly of a trailer, and the horizontal pivot of the upper coupler (fifth wheel) or turntable; or the anchoring and support members of a truck, as applicable. The vertical reaction must be calculated based on the static weight of the fully loaded cargo tank motor vehicle, all structural elements, equipment and appurtenances supported by the cargo tank wall.
                (iv) SS = The following shear stresses generated by static and extreme dynamic loading conditions, in psi:
                (A) The static shear stress resulting from the vertical reaction at the suspension assembly of a trailer, and the horizontal pivot of the upper coupler (fifth wheel) or turntable; or anchoring and support members of a truck, as applicable. The vertical reaction must be calculated based on the static weight of the fully loaded cargo tank motor vehicle, all structural elements, equipment and appurtenances supported by the cargo tank wall;
                (B) The vertical shear stress generated by an extreme vertical accelerative force equal to 0.7 times the vertical reaction at the suspension assembly of a trailer, and the horizontal pivot of the upper coupler (fifth wheel) or turntable; or anchoring and support members of a truck, as applicable. The vertical reaction must be calculated based on the static weight of the fully loaded cargo tank motor vehicle, all structural elements, equipment and appurtenances supported by the cargo tank wall;
                (C) The lateral shear stress generated by an extreme lateral accelerative force equal to 0.4 times the vertical reaction at the suspension assembly of a trailer, applied at the road surface, and as transmitted to the cargo tank wall through the suspension assembly of a trailer, and the horizontal pivot of the upper coupler (fifth wheel) or turntable; or anchoring and support members of a truck, as applicable. The vertical reaction must be calculated based on the static weight of the fully loaded cargo tank motor vehicle, all structural elements, equipment and appurtenances supported by the cargo tank wall; and
                (D) The torsional shear stress generated by the same lateral forces as described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(C) of this section.
                (d) In no case may the minimum thickness of the cargo tank shells and heads be less than that prescribed in § 178.346-2, § 178.347-2, or § 178.348-2, as applicable.
                (e) For a cargo tank mounted on a frame or built with integral structural supports, the calculation of effective stresses for the loading conditions in paragraph (c) of this section may include the structural contribution of the frame or the integral structural supports.
                (f) The design, construction, and installation of an attachment, appurtenance to a cargo tank, structural support member between the cargo tank and the vehicle or suspension component must conform to the following requirements:
                (1) Structural members, the suspension sub-frame, accident protection structures and external circumferential reinforcement devices must be used as sites for attachment of appurtenances and other accessories to the cargo tank, when practicable.

                (2) A lightweight attachment to a cargo tank wall such as a conduit clip, brake line clip, skirting structure, lamp mounting bracket, or placard holder must be of a construction having lesser strength than the cargo tank wall materials and may not be more than 72 percent of the thickness of the material to which it is attached. The lightweight attachment may be secured directly to the cargo tank wall if the device is designed and installed in such a manner that, if damaged, it will not affect the lading retention integrity of the tank. A lightweight attachment must be secured to the cargo tank shell or head by continuous weld or in such a manner as to preclude formation of pockets which may become sites for corrosion.
                
                (3) Except as prescribed in paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section, the welding of any appurtenance to the cargo tank wall must be made by attachment of a mounting pad so that there will be no adverse effect upon the lading retention integrity of the cargo tank if any force less than that prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is applied from any direction. The thickness of the mounting pad may not be less than that of the shell or head to which it is attached, and not more than 1.5 times the shell or head thickness. However, a pad with a minimum thickness of 0.187 inch may be used when the shell or head thickness is over 0.187 inch. If weep holes or tell-tale holes are used, the pad must be drilled or punched at the lowest point before it is welded to the tank. Each pad must:
                (i) Be fabricated from material determined to be suitable for welding to both the cargo tank material and the material of the appurtenance or structural support member; a Design Certifying Engineer must make this determination considering chemical and physical properties of the materials and must specify filler material conforming to the requirements of the ASME Code (incorporated by reference; see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (ii) Be preformed to an inside radius no greater than the outside radius of the cargo tank at the attachment location.
                (iii) Extend at least 2 inches in each direction from any point of attachment of an appurtenance or structural support member. This dimension may be measured from the center of the structural member attached.
                (iv) Have rounded corners, or otherwise be shaped in a manner to minimize stress concentrations on the shell or head.
                (v) Be attached by continuous fillet welding. Any fillet weld discontinuity may only be for the purpose of preventing an intersection between the fillet weld and the tank or jacket seam weld.

                (a) Each cargo tank with capacity greater than 400 gallons must be accessible through a manhole at least 15 inches in diameter.
                (b) Each manhole, fill opening and washout assembly must be structurally capable of withstanding, without leakage or permanent deformation that would affect its structural integrity, a static internal fluid pressure of at least 36 psig, or cargo tank test pressure, whichever is greater. The manhole assembly manufacturer shall verify compliance with this requirement by hydrostatically testing at least one percent (or one manhole closure, whichever is greater) of all manhole closures of each type produced each 3 months, as follows:
                (1) The manhole, fill opening, or washout assembly must be tested with the venting devices blocked. Any leakage or deformation that would affect the product retention capability of the assembly shall constitute a failure.

                (2) If the manhole, fill opening, or washout assembly tested fails, then five more covers from the same lot must be tested. If one of these five covers fails, then all covers in the lot from which the tested covers were selected are to be 100% tested or rejected for service.
                (c) Each manhole, filler and washout cover must be fitted with a safety device that prevents the cover from opening fully when internal pressure is present.
                (d) Each manhole and fill cover must be secured with fastenings that will prevent opening of the covers as a result of vibration under normal transportation conditions or shock impact due to a rollover accident on the roadway or shoulder where the fill cover is not struck by a substantial obstacle.
                (e) On cargo tank motor vehicles manufactured after October 1, 2004, each manhole assembly must be permanently marked on the outside by stamping or other means in a location visible without opening the manhole assembly or fill opening, with:
                (1) Manufacturer's name;
                (2) Test pressure __ psig;
                (3) A statement certifying that the manhole cover meets the requirements in § 178.345-5.
                (f) All components mounted on a manhole cover that form part of the lading retention structure of the cargo tank wall must withstand the same static internal fluid pressure as that required for the manhole cover. The component manufacturer shall verify compliance using the same test procedure and frequency of testing as specified in § 178.345-5(b).

The design calculations of the support elements must include the stresses indicated in § 178.345-3(b) and as generated by the loads described in § 178.345-3(c). Such restraining devices must be readily accessible for inspection and maintenance, except that insulation and jacketing are permitted to cover the restraining devices.
                (b) A cargo tank designed and constructed so that it constitutes, in whole or in part, the structural member used in lieu of a frame must be supported in such a manner that the resulting stress levels in the cargo tank do not exceed those specified in § 178.345-3(a).

                § 178.345-7
                Circumferential reinforcements.
                (a) A cargo tank with a shell thickness of less than 3/8 inch must be circumferentially reinforced with bulkheads, baffles, ring stiffeners, or any combination thereof, in addition to the cargo tank heads.
                (1) Circumferential reinforcement must be located so that the thickness and tensile strength of the shell material in combination with the frame and reinforcement produces structural integrity at least equal to that prescribed in § 178.345-3 and in such a manner that the maximum unreinforced portion of the shell does not exceed 60 inches. For cargo tanks designed to be loaded by vacuum, spacing of circumferential reinforcement may exceed 60 inches provided the maximum unreinforced portion of the shell conforms with the requirements in Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

                (2) Where circumferential joints are made between conical shell sections, or between conical and cylindrical shell sections, and the angle between adjacent sections is less than 160 degrees, circumferential reinforcement must be located within one inch of the shell joint, unless otherwise reinforced with structural members capable of maintaining shell stress levels authorized in § 178.345-3. When the joint is formed by the large ends of adjacent conical shell sections, or by the large end of a conical shell and a cylindrical shell section, this angle is measured inside the shell; when the joint is formed by the small end of a conical shell section and a cylindrical shell section, it is measured outside the shell.
                (b) Except for doubler plates and knuckle pads, no reinforcement may cover any circumferential joint.
                (c) When a baffle or baffle attachment ring is used as a circumferential reinforcement member, it must produce structural integrity at least equal to that prescribed in § 178.345-3 and must be circumferentially welded to the cargo tank shell. The welded portion may not be less than 50 percent of the total circumference of the cargo tank and the length of any unwelded space on the joint may not exceed 40 times the shell thickness unless reinforced external to the cargo tank.
                (d) When a ring stiffener is used as a circumferential reinforcement member, whether internal or external, reinforcement must be continuous around the circumference of the cargo tank shell and must be in accordance with the following:

                (1) The section modulus about the neutral axis of the ring section parallel to the shell must be at least equal to that derived from the applicable formula:
                
                I/C = 0.00027WL, for MS, HSLA and SS; or
                I/C = 0.000467WL, for aluminum alloys;
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  I/C = Section modulus in inches 3
                  
                  W = Tank width, or diameter, inches
                  L = Spacing of ring stiffener, inches; i.e., the maximum longitudinal distance from the midpoint of the unsupported shell on one side of the ring stiffener to the midpoint of the unsupported shell on the opposite side of the ring stiffener.
                
                
                (2) If a ring stiffener is welded to the cargo tank shell, a portion of the shell may be considered as part of the ring section for purposes of computing the ring section modulus. This portion of the shell may be used provided at least 50 percent of the total circumference of the cargo tank is welded and the length of any unwelded space on the joint does not exceed 40 times the shell thickness. The maximum portion of the shell to be used in these calculations is as follows:

                § 178.345-8
                Accident damage protection.
                (a) General. Each cargo tank motor vehicle must be designed and constructed in accordance with the requirements of this section and the applicable individual specification to minimize the potential for the loss of lading due to an accident.

                (1) Any dome, sump, or washout cover plate projecting from the cargo tank wall that retains lading in any tank orientation, must be as strong and tough as the cargo tank wall and have a thickness at least equal to that specified by the appropriate cargo tank specification. Any such projection located in the lower 1/3 of the tank circumference (or cross section perimeter for non-circular cargo tanks) that extends more than half its diameter at the point of attachment to the tank or more than 4 inches from the cargo tank wall, or located in the upper 2/3 of the tank circumference (or cross section perimeter for non-circular cargo tanks) that extends more than 1/4 its diameter or more than 2 inches from the point of attachment to the tank must have accident damage protection devices that are:
                (i) As specified in this section;
                (ii) 125 percent as strong as the otherwise required accident damage protection device; or
                (iii) Attached to the cargo tank in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
                (2) Outlets, valves, closures, piping, or any devices that if damaged in an accident could result in a loss of lading from the cargo tank must be protected by accident damage protection devices as specified in this section.
                (3) Accident damage protection devices attached to the wall of a cargo tank must be able to withstand or deflect away from the cargo tank the loads specified in this section. They must be designed, constructed and installed so as to maximize the distribution of loads to the cargo tank wall and to minimize the possibility of adversely affecting the lading retention integrity of the cargo tank. Accident induced stresses resulting from the appropriate accident damage protection device requirements in combination with the stresses from the cargo tank operating at the MAWP may not result in a cargo tank wall stress greater than the ultimate strength of the material of construction using a safety factor of 1.3. Deformation of the protection device is acceptable provided the devices being protected are not damaged when loads specified in this section are applied.
                (4) Any piping that extends beyond an accident damage protection device must be equipped with a stop-valve and a sacrificial device such as a shear section. The sacrificial device must be located in the piping system outboard of the stop-valve and within the accident damage protection device to prevent any accidental loss of lading. The device must break at no more than 70 percent of the load that would be required to cause the failure of the protected lading retention device, part or cargo tank wall. The failure of the sacrificial device must leave the protected lading retention device and its attachment to the cargo tank wall intact and capable of retaining product.
                (5) Minimum road clearance. The minimum road clearance of any cargo tank motor vehicle component or protection device located between any two adjacent axles on a vehicle or vehicle combination must be at least one-half inch for each foot separating the component or device from the nearest axle of the adjacent pair, but in no case less than twelve (12) inches, except that the minimum road clearance for landing gear or other attachments within ten (10) feet of an axle must be no less than ten (10) inches. These measurements must be calculated at the gross vehicle weight rating of the cargo tank motor vehicle.
                (b) Each outlet, projection or piping located in the lower 1/3 of the cargo tank circumference (or cross section perimeter for non-circular cargo tanks) that could be damaged in an accident that may result in the loss of lading must be protected by a bottom damage protection device, except as provided by paragraph (a)(1) of this section and § 173.33(e) of this subchapter. Outlets, projections and piping may be grouped or clustered together and protected by a single protection device.
                (1) Any bottom damage protection device must be able to withstand a force of 155,000 pounds (based on the ultimate strength of the material) from the front, side, or rear, uniformly distributed over each surface of the device, over an area not to exceed 6 square feet, and a width not to exceed 6 feet. Suspension components and structural mounting members may be used to provide all, or part, of this protection. The device must extend no less than 6 inches beyond any component that may contain lading in transit.

                (2) A lading discharge opening equipped with an internal self-closing stop-valve need not conform to paragraph (b)(1) of this section provided it is protected so as to reasonably assure against the accidental loss of lading. This protection must be provided by a sacrificial device located outboard of each internal self-closing stop-valve and within 4 inches of the major radius of the cargo tank shell or within 4 inches of a sump, but in no case more than 8 inches from the major radius of the tank shell. The device must break at no more than 70 percent of the load that would be required to cause the failure of the protected lading retention device, part or cargo tank wall. The failure of the sacrificial device must leave the protected lading retention device or part and its attachment to the cargo tank wall intact and capable of retaining product.
                (c) Each closure for openings, including but not limited to the manhole, filling or inspection openings, and each valve, fitting, pressure relief device, vapor recovery stop valve or lading retaining fitting located in the upper 2/3 of a cargo tank circumference (or cross section perimeter for non-circular tanks) must be protected by being located within or between adjacent rollover damage protection devices, or by being 125 percent of the strength that would be provided by the otherwise required damage protection device.
                (1) A rollover damage protection device on a cargo tank motor vehicle must be designed and installed to withstand loads equal to twice the weight of the loaded cargo tank motor vehicle applied as follows: normal to the cargo tank shell (perpendicular to the cargo tank surface); and tangential (perpendicular to the normal load) from any direction. The stresses shall not exceed the ultimate strength of the material of construction. These design loads may be considered to be uniformly distributed and independently applied. If more than one rollover protection device is used, each device must be capable of carrying its proportionate share of the required loads and in each case at least one-fourth the total tangential load. The design must be proven capable of carrying the required loads by calculations, tests or a combination of tests and calculations.
                (2) A rollover damage protection device that would otherwise allow the accumulation of liquid on the top of the cargo tank, must be provided with a drain that directs the liquid to a safe point of discharge away from any structural component of the cargo tank motor vehicle.
                (d) Rear-end tank protection. Each cargo tank motor vehicle must be provided with a rear-end tank protection device to protect the cargo tank and piping in the event of a rear-end collision and reduce the likelihood of damage that could result in the loss of lading. Nothing in this paragraph relieves the manufacturer of responsibility for complying with the requirements of § 393.86 of this title and, if applicable, paragraph (b) of this section. The rear-end tank protection device must conform to the following requirements:
                (1) The rear-end cargo tank protection device must be designed so that it can deflect at least 6 inches horizontally forward with no contact between any part of the cargo tank motor vehicle which contains lading during transit and with any part of the rear-end protection device, or with a vertical plane passing through the outboard surface of the protection device.
                (2) The dimensions of the rear-end cargo tank protection device shall conform to the following:
                (i) The bottom surface of the rear-end protection device must be at least 4 inches below the lower surface of any part at the rear of the cargo tank motor vehicle which contains lading during transit and not more than 60 inches from the ground when the vehicle is empty.
                (ii) The maximum width of a notch, indentation, or separation between sections of a rear-end cargo tank protection device may not exceed 24 inches. A notched, indented, or separated rear-end protection device may be used only when the piping at the rear of the cargo tank is equipped with a sacrificial device outboard of a shut-off valve.
                (iii) The widest part of the motor vehicle at the rear may not extend more than 18 inches beyond the outermost ends of the device or (if separated) devices on either side of the vehicle.
                (3) The structure of the rear-end protection device and its attachment to the vehicle must be designed to satisfy the conditions specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section when subjected to an impact of the cargo tank motor vehicle at rated payload, at a deceleration of 2 “g”. Such impact must be considered as being uniformly applied in the horizontal plane at an angle of 10 degrees or less to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle.
                (e) Longitudinal deceleration protection. In order to account for stresses due to longitudinal impact in an accident, the cargo tank shell and heads must be able to withstand the load resulting from the design pressure in combination with the dynamic pressure resulting from a longitudinal deceleration of 2 “g”. For this loading condition, the allowable stress value used may not exceed the ultimate strength of the material of construction using a safety factor of 1.3. Performance testing, analytical methods, or a combination thereof, may be used to prove this capability provided the methods are accurate and verifiable. For cargo tanks with internal baffles, the decelerative force may be reduced by 0.25 “g” for each baffle assembly, but in no case may the total reduction in decelerative force exceed 1.0 “g”.

                Pumps, piping, hoses and connections.
                (a) Suitable means must be provided during loading or unloading operations to ensure that pressure within a cargo tank does not exceed test pressure.
                (b) Each hose, piping, stop-valve, lading retention fitting and closure must be designed for a bursting pressure of the greater of 100 psig or four times the MAWP.
                (c) Each hose coupling must be designed for a bursting pressure of the greater of 120 psig or 4.8 times the MAWP of the cargo tank, and must be designed so that there will be no leakage when connected.
                (d) Suitable provision must be made to allow for and prevent damage due to expansion, contraction, jarring, and vibration. Slip joints may not be used for this purpose in the lading retention system.
                (e) Any heating device, when installed, must be so constructed that the breaking of its external connections will not cause leakage of the cargo tank lading.
                (f) Any gauging, loading or charging device, including associated valves, must be provided with an adequate means of secure closure to prevent leakage.
                (g) The attachment and construction of each loading/unloading or charging line must be of sufficient strength, or be protected by a sacrificial device, such that any load applied by loading/unloading or charging lines connected to the cargo tank cannot cause damage resulting in loss of lading from the cargo tank.
                (h) Use of a nonmetallic pipe, valve or connection that is not as strong and heat resistant as the cargo tank material is authorized only if such attachment is located outboard of the lading retention system.

                § 178.345-10
                Pressure relief.
                (a) Each cargo tank must be equipped to relieve pressure and vacuum conditions in conformance with this section and the applicable individual specification. The pressure and vacuum relief system must be designed to operate and have sufficient capacity to prevent cargo tank rupture or collapse due to over-pressurization or vacuum resulting from loading, unloading, or from heating and cooling of lading. Pressure relief systems are not required to conform to the ASME Code.
                (b) Type and construction of relief systems and devices. (1) Each cargo tank must be provided with a primary pressure relief system consisting of one or more reclosing pressure relief valves. A secondary pressure relief system consisting of another pressure relief valve in parallel with the primary pressure relief system may be used to augment the total venting capacity of the cargo tank. Non-reclosing pressure relief devices are not authorized in any cargo tank except when in series with a reclosing pressure relief device. Gravity actuated reclosing valves are not authorized on any cargo tank.
                (2) When provided by § 173.33(c)(1)(iii) of this subchapter, cargo tanks may be equipped with a normal vent. Such vents must be set to open at not less than 1 psig and must be designed to prevent loss of lading through the device in case of vehicle overturn.

                (3) Each pressure relief system must be designed to withstand dynamic pressure surges in excess of the design set pressure as specified in paragraphs (b)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section. Set pressure is a function of MAWP as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.
                (i) Each pressure relief device must be able to withstand dynamic pressure surge reaching 30 psig above the design set pressure and sustained above the set pressure for at least 60 milliseconds with a total volume of liquid released not exceeding one gallon before the relief device recloses to a leak-tight condition. This requirement must be met regardless of vehicle orientation. This capability must be demonstrated by testing. An acceptable method is outlined in TTMA RP No. 81-97 “Performance of Spring Loaded Pressure Relief Valves on MC 306, MC 307, MC 312, DOT 406, DOT 407, and DOT 412 Tanks” (incorporated by reference; see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (ii) After August 31, 1995, each pressure relief device must be able to withstand a dynamic pressure surge reaching 30 psig above the design set pressure and sustained above the design set pressure for at least 60 milliseconds with a total volume of liquid released not exceeding 1 L before the relief valve recloses to a leak-tight condition. This requirement must be met regardless of vehicle orientation. This capability must be demonstrated by testing. TTMA RP No. 81, cited in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, is an acceptable test procedure.
                (4) Each reclosing pressure relief valve must be constructed and installed in such a manner as to prevent unauthorized adjustment of the relief valve setting.
                (5) No shut-off valve or other device that could prevent venting through the pressure relief system may be installed in a pressure relief system.
                (6) The pressure relief system must be mounted, shielded and drainable so as to minimize the accumulation of material that could impair the operation or discharge capability of the system by freezing, corrosion or blockage.
                (c) Location of relief devices. Each pressure relief device must communicate with the vapor space above the lading as near as practicable to the center of the vapor space. For example, on a cargo tank designed to operate in a level attitude, the device should be positioned at the horizontal and transverse center of the cargo tank; on cargo tanks sloped to the rear, the device should be located in the forward half of the cargo tank. The discharge from any device must be unrestricted. Protective devices which deflect the flow of vapor are permissible provided the required vent capacity is maintained.
                (d) Settings of pressure relief system. The set pressure of the pressure relief system is the pressure at which it starts to open, allowing discharge.
                (1) Primary pressure relief system. The set pressure of each primary relief valve must be no less than 120 percent of the MAWP, and no more than 132 percent of the MAWP. The valve must reclose at not less than 108 percent of the MAWP and remain closed at lower pressures.
                (2) Secondary pressure relief system. The set pressure of each pressure relief valve used as a secondary relief device must be not less than 120 percent of the MAWP.
                (e) Venting capacity of pressure relief systems. The pressure relief system (primary and secondary, including piping) must have sufficient venting capacity to limit the cargo tank internal pressure to not more than the cargo tank test pressure. The total venting capacity, rated at not more than the cargo tank test pressure, must be at least that specified in table I, except as provided in § 178.348-4.

                (2) Secondary pressure relief system. If the primary pressure relief system does not provide the required total venting capacity, additional capacity must be provided by a secondary pressure relief system.
                (f) Certification of pressure relief devices. The manufacturer of any pressure relief device, including valves, frangible (rupture) disks, vacuum vents and combination devices must certify that the device model was designed and tested in accordance with this section and the appropriate cargo tank specification. The certificate must contain sufficient information to describe the device and its performance. The certificate must be signed by a responsible official of the manufacturer who approved the flow capacity certification.
                (g) Rated flow capacity certification test. Each pressure relief device model must be successfully flow capacity certification tested prior to first use. Devices having one design, size and set pressure are considered to be one model. The testing requirements are as follows:
                (1) At least 3 devices of each specific model must be tested for flow capacity at a pressure not greater than the test pressure of the cargo tank. For a device model to be certified, the capacities of the devices tested must fall within a range of plus or minus 5 percent of the average for the devices tested.
                (2) The rated flow capacity of a device model may not be greater than 90 percent of the average value for the devices tested.
                (3) The rated flow capacity derived for each device model must be certified by a responsible official of the device manufacturer.
                (h) Marking of pressure relief devices. Each pressure relief device must be permanently marked with the following:
                (1) Manufacturer's name;
                (2) Model number;
                (3) Set pressure, in psig; and
                (4) Rated flow capacity, in SCFH at the rating pressure, in psig.

                Tank outlets.
                (a) General. As used in this section, “loading/unloading outlet” means any opening in the cargo tank wall used for loading or unloading of lading, as distinguished from outlets such as manhole covers, vents, vapor recovery devices, and similar closures. Cargo tank outlets, closures and associated piping must be protected in accordance with § 178.345-8.
                (b) Each cargo tank loading/unloading outlet must be equipped with an internal self-closing stop-valve, or alternatively, with an external stop-valve located as close as practicable to the cargo tank wall. Each cargo tank loading/unloading outlet must be in accordance with the following provisions:
                (1) Each loading/unloading outlet must be fitted with a self-closing system capable of closing all such outlets in an emergency within 30 seconds of actuation. During normal operations the outlets may be closed manually. The self-closing system must be designed according to the following:

                (i) Each self-closing system must include a remotely actuated means of closure located more than 10 feet from the loading/unloading outlet where vehicle length allows, or on the end of the cargo tank farthest away from the loading/unloading outlet. The actuating mechanism must be corrosion-resistant and effective in all types of environment and weather.
                (ii) If the actuating system is accidentally damaged or sheared off during transportation, each loading/unloading outlet must remain securely closed and capable of retaining lading.
                (iii) When required by part 173 of this subchapter for materials which are flammable, pyrophoric, oxidizing, or Division 6.1 (poisonous liquid) materials, the remote means of closure must be capable of thermal activation. The means by which the self-closing system is thermally activated must be located as close as practicable to the primary loading/unloading connection and must actuate the system at a temperature not over 250 °F. In addition, outlets on these cargo tanks must be capable of being remotely closed manually or mechanically.
                (2) Bottom loading outlets which discharge lading into the cargo tank through fixed internal piping above the maximum liquid level of the cargo tank need not be equipped with a self-closing system.
                (c) Any loading/unloading outlet extending beyond an internal self-closing stop-valve, or beyond the innermost external stop-valve which is part of a self-closing system, must be fitted with another stop-valve or other leak-tight closure at the end of such connection.
                (d) Each cargo tank outlet that is not a loading/unloading outlet must be equipped with a stop-valve or other leak-tight closure located as close as practicable to the cargo tank outlet. Any connection extending beyond this closure must be fitted with another stop-valve or other leak-tight closure at the end of such connection.

                Gauging devices.
                Each cargo tank, except a cargo tank intended to be filled by weight, must be equipped with a gauging device that indicates the maximum permitted liquid level to within 0.5 percent of the nominal capacity as measured by volume or liquid level. Gauge glasses are not permitted.

                § 178.345-13
                Pressure and leakage tests.
                (a) Each cargo tank must be pressure and leakage tested in accordance with this section and §§ 178.346-5, 178.347-5, or 178.348-5.
                (b) Pressure test. Each cargo tank or cargo tank compartment must be tested hydrostatically or pneumatically. Each cargo tank of a multi-cargo tank motor vehicle must be tested with the adjacent cargo tanks empty and at atmospheric pressure. Each closure, except pressure relief devices and loading/unloading venting devices rated at less than the prescribed test pressure, must be in place during the test. If the venting device is not removed during the test, such device must be rendered inoperative by a clamp, plug or other equally effective restraining device, which may not prevent the detection of leaks, or damage the device. Restraining devices must be removed immediately after the test is completed.
                (1) Hydrostatic method. Each cargo tank, including its domes, must be filled with water or other liquid having similar viscosity, the temperature of which may not exceed 100 °F. The cargo tank must then be pressurized as prescribed in the applicable specification. The pressure must be gauged at the top of the cargo tank. The prescribed test pressure must be maintained for at least 10 minutes during which time the cargo tank must be inspected for leakage, bulging, or other defect.
                (2) Pneumatic method. A pneumatic test may be used in place of the hydrostatic test. However, pneumatic pressure testing may involve higher risk than hydrostatic testing. Therefore, suitable safeguards must be provided to protect personnel and facilities should failure occur during the test. The cargo tank must be pressurized with air or an inert gas. Test pressure must be reached gradually by increasing the pressure to one half of test pressure. Thereafter, the pressure must be increased in steps of approximately one tenth of the test pressure until test pressure is reached. Test pressure must be held for at least 5 minutes. The pressure must then be reduced to the inspection pressure which must be maintained while the entire cargo tank surface is inspected for leakage and other sign of defects. The inspection method must consist of coating all joints and fittings with a solution of soap and water or other equally sensitive method.
                (c) Leakage test. The cargo tank with all its accessories in place and operable must be leak tested at not less than 80 percent of tank's MAWP with the pressure maintained for at least 5 minutes.
                (d) Any cargo tank that leaks, bulges or shows any other sign of defect must be rejected. Rejected cargo tanks must be suitably repaired and retested successfully prior to being returned to service. The retest after any repair must use the same method of test under which the cargo tank was originally rejected.

                (c) Vacuum loaded cargo tanks must not be constructed to this specification.
                (d) Each cargo tank must be “constructed in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME Code” (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter) except as modified herein:
                (1) The record-keeping requirements contained in the ASME Code Section VIII do not apply. Parts UG-90 through 94 in Section VIII do not apply. Inspection and certification must be made by an inspector registered in accordance with subpart F of part 107.
                (2) Loadings must be as prescribed in § 178.345-3.
                (3) The knuckle radius of flanged heads must be at least three times the material thickness, and in no case less than 0.5 inch. Stuffed (inserted) heads may be attached to the shell by a fillet weld. The knuckle radius and dish radius versus diameter limitations of UG-32 do not apply. Shell sections of cargo tanks designed with a non-circular cross section need not be given a preliminary curvature, as prescribed in UG-79(b).
                (4) Marking, certification, data reports, and nameplates must be as prescribed in §§ 178.345-14 and 178.345-15.
                (5) Manhole closure assemblies must conform to §§ 178.345-5 and 178.346-5.

                (9) Single full fillet lap joints without plug welds may be used for arc or gas welded longitudinal seams without radiographic examination under the following conditions:
                (i) For a truck-mounted cargo tank, no more than two such joints may be used on the top half of the tank and no more than two joints may be used on the bottom half. They may not be located farther from the top and bottom centerline than 16 percent of the shell's circumference.
                (ii) For a self-supporting cargo tank, no more than two such joints may be used on the top of the tank. They may not be located farther from the top centerline than 12.5 percent of the shell's circumference.
                (iii) Compliance test. Two test specimens of the material to be used in the manufacture of a cargo tank must be tested to failure in tension. The test specimens must be of the same thicknesses and joint configuration as the cargo tank, and joined by the same welding procedures. The test specimens may represent all the tanks that are made of the same materials and welding procedures, have the same joint configuration, and are made in the same facility within 6 months after the tests are completed. Before welding, the fit-up of the joints on the test specimens must represent production conditions that would result in the least joint strength. Evidence of joint fit-up and test results must be retained at the manufacturers' facility.
                (iv) Weld joint efficiency. The lower value of stress at failure attained in the two tensile test specimens shall be used to compute the efficiency of the joint as follows: Determine the failure ratio by dividing the stress at failure by the mechanical properties of the adjacent metal; this value, when multiplied by 0.75, is the design weld joint efficiency.
                (10) The requirements of paragraph UW-9(d) in Section VIII of the ASME Code do not apply.

                § 178.346-3
                Pressure relief.
                (a) Each cargo tank must be equipped with a pressure relief system in accordance with § 178.345-10 and this section.
                (b) Type and construction. In addition to the pressure relief devices required in § 178.345-10:
                (1) Each cargo tank must be equipped with one or more vacuum relief devices;
                (2) When intended for use only for lading meeting the requirements of § 173.33(c)(1)(iii) of this subchapter, the cargo tank may be equipped with a normal vent. Such vents must be set to open at not less than 1 psig and must be designed to prevent loss of lading through the device in case of vehicle upset; and
                (3) Notwithstanding the requirements in § 178.345-10(b), after August 31, 1996, each pressure relief valve must be able to withstand a dynamic pressure surge reaching 30 psig above the design set pressure and sustained above the set pressure for at least 60 milliseconds with a total volume of liquid released not exceeding 1 L before the relief valve recloses to a leak-tight condition. This requirement must be met regardless of vehicle orientation. This capability must be demonstrated by testing. TTMA RP No. 81 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), cited at § 178.345-10(b)(3)(i), is an acceptable test procedure.
                (c) Pressure settings of relief valves. (1) Notwithstanding the requirements in § 178.345-10(d), the set pressure of each primary relief valve must be not less than 110 percent of the MAWP or 3.3 psig, whichever is greater, and not more than 138 percent of the MAWP. The valve must close at not less than the MAWP and remain closed at lower pressures.
                (2) Each vacuum relief device must be set to open at no more than 6 ounces vacuum.
                (d) Venting capacities. (1) Notwithstanding the requirements in § 178.345-10 (e) and (g), the primary pressure relief valve must have a venting capacity of at least 6,000 SCFH, rated at not greater than 125 percent of the tank test pressure and not greater than 3 psig above the MAWP. The venting capacity required in § 178.345-10(e) may be rated at these same pressures.
                (2) Each vacuum relief system must have sufficient capacity to limit the vacuum to 1 psig.
                (3) If pressure loading or unloading devices are provided, the relief system must have adequate vapor and liquid capacity to limit the tank pressure to the cargo tank test pressure at maximum loading or unloading rate. The maximum loading and unloading rates must be included on the metal specification plate.

                Pressure and leakage tests.
                (a) Each cargo tank must be tested in accordance with § 178.345-13 and this section.
                (b) Pressure test. Test pressure must be as follows:
                (1) Using the hydrostatic test method, the test pressure must be the greater of 5.0 psig or 1.5 times the cargo tank MAWP.
                (2) Using the pneumatic test method, the test pressure must be the greater of 5.0 psig or 1.5 times the cargo tank MAWP, and the inspection pressure must be the cargo tank MAWP.
                (c) Leakage test. A cargo tank used to transport a petroleum distillate fuel that is equipped with vapor recovery equipment may be leakage tested in accordance with 40 CFR 63.425(e). To satisfy the leakage test requirements of this paragraph, the test specified in 40 CFR 63.425(e)(1) must be conducted using air. The hydrostatic test alternative permitted under Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 60 (“Method 27—Determination of Vapor Tightness of Gasoline Delivery Tank Using Pressure-Vacuum Test”) may not be used to satisfy the leakage test requirements of this paragraph. A cargo tank tested in accordance with 40 CFR 63.425(e) may be marked as specified in § 180.415 of this subchapter.

                § 178.503
                Marking of packagings.

                (a) A manufacturer must mark every packaging that is represented as manufactured to meet a UN standard with the marks specified in this section. The markings must be durable, legible and placed in a location and of such a size relative to the packaging as to be readily visible, as specified in § 178.3(a). Except as otherwise provided in this section, every reusable packaging liable to undergo a reconditioning process which might obliterate the packaging marks must bear the marks specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) and (a)(9) of this section in a permanent form (e.g. embossed) able to withstand the reconditioning process. A marking may be applied in a single line or in multiple lines provided the correct sequence is used. As illustrated by the examples in paragraph (e) of this section, the following information must be presented in the correct sequence. Slash marks should be used to separate this information. A packaging conforming to a UN standard must be marked as follows:
                (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, the United Nations symbol as illustrated in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section (for embossed metal receptacles, the letters “UN” may be applied in place of the symbol);
                (2) A packaging identification code designating the type of packaging, the material of construction and, when appropriate, the category of packaging under §§ 178.504 through 178.523 of this subpart within the type to which the packaging belongs. The letter “V” must follow the packaging identification code on packagings tested in accordance with § 178.601(g)(2); for example, “4GV”. The letter “W” must follow the packaging identification code on packagings when required by an approval under the provisions of § 178.601(h) of this part;
                (3) A letter identifying the performance standard under which the packaging design type has been successfully tested, as follows:
                (i) X—for packagings meeting Packing Group I, II and III tests;
                (ii) Y—for packagings meeting Packing Group II and III tests; or
                (iii) Z—for packagings only meeting Packing Group III tests;
                (4) A designation of the specific gravity or mass for which the packaging design type has been tested, as follows:
                (i) For packagings without inner packagings intended to contain liquids, the designation shall be the specific gravity rounded down to the first decimal but may be omitted when the specific gravity does not exceed 1.2; and
                (ii) For packagings intended to contain solids or inner packagings, the designation shall be the maximum gross mass in kilograms;
                (5)(i) For single and composite packagings intended to contain liquids, the test pressure in kilopascals rounded down to the nearest 10 kPa of the hydrostatic pressure test that the packaging design type has successfully passed;
                (ii) For packagings intended to contain solids or inner packagings, the letter “S”;
                (6) The last two digits of the year of manufacture. Packagings of types 1H and 3H shall also be marked with the month of manufacture in any appropriate manner; this may be marked on the packaging in a different place from the remainder of the markings;
                (7) The state authorizing allocation of the mark. The letters ‘USA’ indicate that the packaging is manufactured and marked in the United States in compliance with the provisions of this subchapter;
                (8) The name and address or symbol of the manufacturer or the approval agency certifying compliance with subpart L and subpart M of this part. Symbols, if used, must be registered with the Associate Administrator;
                (9) For metal or plastic drums or jerricans intended for reuse or reconditioning as single packagings or the outer packagings of a composite packaging, the thickness of the packaging material, expressed in mm (rounded to the nearest 0.1 mm), as follows:
                (i) Metal drums or jerricans must be marked with the nominal thickness of the metal used in the body. The marked nominal thickness must not exceed the minimum thickness of the steel used by more than the thickness tolerance stated in ISO 3574 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). (See appendix C of this part.) The unit of measure is not required to be marked. When the nominal thickness of either head of a metal drum is thinner than that of the body, the nominal thickness of the top head, body, and bottom head must be marked (e.g., “1.0-1.2-1.0” or “0.9-1.0-1.0”).

                (ii) Plastic drums or jerricans must be marked with the minimum thickness of the packaging material. Minimum thicknesses of plastic must be as determined in accordance with § 173.28(b)(4). The unit of measure is not required to be marked;
                (10) In addition to the markings prescribed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(9) of this section, every new metal drum having a capacity greater than 100 L must bear the marks described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6), and (a)(9)(i) of this section, in a permanent form, on the bottom. The markings on the top head or side of these packagings need not be permanent, and need not include the thickness mark described in paragraph (a)(9) of this section. This marking indicates a drum's characteristics at the time it was manufactured, and the information in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section that is marked on the top head or side must be the same as the information in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section permanently marked by the original manufacturer on the bottom of the drum; and
                (11) Rated capacity of the packaging expressed in liters may be marked.
                (b) For a packaging with a removable head, the markings may not be applied only to the removable head.
                (c) Marking of reconditioned packagings. (1) If a packaging is reconditioned, it shall be marked by the reconditioner near the marks required in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section with the following additional information:
                (i) The name of the country in which the reconditioning was performed (in the United States, use the letters “USA”);
                (ii) The name and address or symbol of the reconditioner. Symbols, if used, must be registered with the Associate Administrator;
                (iii) The last two digits of the year of reconditioning;
                (iv) The letter “R”; and
                (v) For every packaging successfully passing a leakproofness test, the additional letter “L”.
                (2) When, after reconditioning, the markings required by paragraph (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section no longer appear on the top head or the side of the metal drum, the reconditioner must apply them in a durable form followed by the markings in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. These markings may identify a different performance capability than that for which the original design type had been tested and marked, but may not identify a greater performance capability. The markings applied in accordance with this paragraph may be different from those which are permanently marked on the bottom of a drum in accordance with paragraph (a)(10) of this section.
                (d) Marking of remanufactured packagings. For remanufactured metal drums, if there is no change to the packaging type and no replacement or removal of integral structural components, the required markings need not be permanent (e.g., embossed). Every other remanufactured drum must bear the marks required in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section in a permanent form (e.g., embossed) on the top head or side. If the metal thickness marking required in paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section does not appear on the bottom of the drum, or if it is no longer valid, the remanufacturer also must mark this information in permanent form.
                (e) The following are examples of symbols and required markings.
                (1)(i) The United Nations symbol is:
                
                  ER05OC12.059
                
                
                (ii) The circle that surrounds the letters “u” and “n” may have small breaks provided the following provisions are met:
                (A) The total gap space does not exceed 15 percent of the circumference of the circle;
                (B) There are no more than four gaps in the circle;
                C) The spacing between gaps is separated by no less than 20 percent of the circumference of the circle (72 degrees); and
                D) The letters “u” and “n” appear exactly as depicted in § 178.503(e)(1)(i) with no gaps.

                (b) Construction requirements for plastic boxes are as follows:
                (1) The box must be manufactured from suitable plastic material and be of adequate strength in relation to its capacity and intended use. The box must be adequately resistant to aging and to degradation caused either by the substance contained or by ultra-violet radiation.
                (2) An expanded plastic box must consist of two parts made of a molded expanded plastic material: a bottom section containing cavities for the inner receptacles, and a top section covering and interlocking with the bottom section. The top and bottom sections must be so designed that the inner receptacles fit snugly. The closure cap for any inner receptacle may not be in contact with the inside of the top section of the box.
                (3) For transportation, an expanded plastic box must be closed with a self-adhesive tape having sufficient tensile strength to prevent the box from opening. The adhesive tape must be weather-resistant and its adhesive compatible with the expanded plastic material of the box. Other closing devices at least equally effective may be used.
                (4) For solid plastic boxes, protection against ultra-violet radiation, if required, must be provided by the addition of carbon black or other suitable pigments or inhibitors. These additives must be compatible with the contents and remain effective throughout the life of the box. Where use is made of carbon black pigment or inhibitors other than those used in the manufacture of the tested design type, retesting may be waived if the carbon black content does not exceed 2 percent by mass or if the pigment content does not exceed 3 percent by mass; the content of inhibitors of ultra-violet radiation is not limited.
                (5) Additives serving purposes other than protection against ultra-violet radiation may be included in the composition of the plastic material if they do not adversely affect the material of the box. Addition of these additives does not change the design type.
                (6) Solid plastic boxes must have closure devices made of a suitable material of adequate strength and so designed as to prevent the box from unintentionally opening.
                (7) Maximum net mass 4H1: 60 kg (132 pounds); 4H2: 400 kg (882 pounds).

Each packaging must be manufactured and assembled so as to be capable of successfully passing the prescribed tests and of conforming to the requirements of § 173.24 of this subchapter at all times while in transportation.
                (b) Responsibility. It is the responsibility of the packaging manufacturer to assure that each package is capable of passing the prescribed tests. To the extent that a package assembly function, including final closure, is performed by the person who offers a hazardous material for transportation, that person is responsible for performing the function in accordance with §§ 173.22 and 178.2 of this subchapter.
                (c) Definitions. For the purpose of this subpart:
                (1) Design qualification testing is the performance of the tests prescribed in § 178.603, § 178.604, § 178.605, § 178.606, § 178.607, § 178.608, or § 178.609, as applicable, for each new or different packaging, at the start of production of that packaging.
                (2) Periodic retesting is the performance of the drop, leakproofness, hydrostatic pressure, and stacking tests, as applicable, as prescribed in § 178.603, § 178.604, § 178.605, or § 178.606, respectively, at the frequency specified in paragraph (e) of this section. For infectious substances packagings required to meet the requirements of § 178.609, periodic retesting is the performance of the tests specified in § 178.609 at the frequency specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
                (3) Production testing is the performance of the leakproofness test prescribed in § 178.604 of this subpart on each single or composite packaging intended to contain a liquid.
                (4) A different packaging is one that differs (i.e., is not identical) from a previously produced packaging in structural design, size, material of construction, wall thickness or manner of construction but does not include:
                (i) A packaging which differs only in surface treatment;
                (ii) A combination packaging which differs only in that the outer packaging has been successfully tested with different inner packagings. A variety of such inner packagings may be assembled in this outer packaging without further testing;
                (iii) A plastic packaging which differs only with regard to additives which conform to § 178.509(b)(3) or § 178.517(b) (4) or (5) of this part;
                (iv) A combination packaging with inner packagings conforming to the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section;
                (v) Packagings which differ from the design type only in their lesser design height; or

                (vi) For a steel drum, variations in design elements which do not constitute a different design type under the provisions of paragraph (g)(8) of this section.
                (d) Design qualification testing. The packaging manufacturer shall achieve successful test results for the design qualification testing at the start of production of each new or different packaging.
                (e) Periodic retesting. The packaging manufacturer must achieve successful test results for the periodic retesting at intervals established by the manufacturer of sufficient frequency to ensure that each packaging produced by the manufacturer is capable of passing the design qualification tests. Changes in retest frequency are subject to the approval of the Associate Administrator for Hazardous Materials Safety. For single or composite packagings, the periodic retests must be conducted at least once every 12 months. For combination packagings, the periodic retests must be conducted at least once every 24 months. For infectious substances packagings, the periodic retests must be conducted at least once every 24 months.
                (f) Test samples. The manufacturer shall conduct the design qualification and periodic tests prescribed in this subpart using random samples of packagings, in the numbers specified in the appropriate test section. In addition, the leakproofness test, when required, shall be performed on each packaging produced by the manufacturer, and each packaging prior to reuse under § 173.28 of this subchapter, by the reconditioner.
                (g) Selective testing. The selective testing of packagings that differ only in minor respects from a tested type is permitted as described in this section. For air transport, packagings must comply with § 173.27(c)(1) and (c)(2) of this subchapter.
                (1) Selective testing of combination packagings. Variation 1. Variations are permitted in inner packagings of a tested combination package, without further testing of the package, provided an equivalent level of performance is maintained and, when a package is altered under Variation 1 after October 1, 2010, the methodology used to determine that the inner packaging, including closure, maintains an equivalent level of performance is documented in writing by the person certifying compliance with this paragraph and retained in accordance with paragraph (l) of this section. Permitted variations are as follows:
                (i) Inner packagings of equivalent or smaller size may be used provided—

                (A) The inner packagings are of similar design to the tested inner packagings (i.e., shape—round, rectangular, etc.);
                (B) The material of construction of the inner packagings (glass, plastic, metal, etc.) offers resistance to impact and stacking forces equal to or greater than that of the originally tested inner packaging;
                (C) The inner packagings have the same or smaller openings and the closure is of similar design (e.g., screw cap, friction lid, etc.);
                (D) Sufficient additional cushioning material is used to take up void spaces and to prevent significant moving of the inner packagings;
                (E) Inner packagings are oriented within the outer packaging in the same manner as in the tested package; and,
                (F) The gross mass of the package does not exceed that originally tested.
                (ii) A lesser number of the tested inner packagings, or of the alternative types of inner packagings identified in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, may be used provided sufficient cushioning is added to fill void space(s) and to prevent significant moving of the inner packagings.
                (2) Selective testing of combination packagings. Variation 2. Articles or inner packagings of any type, for solids or liquids, may be assembled and transported without testing in an outer packaging under the following conditions:
                (i) The outer packaging must have been successfully tested in accordance with § 178.603 with fragile (e.g. glass) inner packagings containing liquids at the Packing Group I drop height;
                (ii) The total combined gross mass of inner packagings may not exceed one-half the gross mass of inner packagings used for the drop test;

                (iii) The thickness of cushioning material between inner packagings and between inner packagings and the outside of the packaging may not be reduced below the corresponding thickness in the originally tested packaging; and when a single inner packaging was used in the original test, the thickness of cushioning between inner packagings may not be less than the thickness of cushioning between the outside of the packaging and the inner packaging in the original test. When either fewer or smaller inner packagings are used (as compared to the inner packagings used in the drop test), sufficient additional cushioning material must be used to take up void spaces.
                (iv) The outer packaging must have successfully passed the stacking test set forth in § 178.606 of this subpart when empty, i.e., without either inner packagings or cushioning materials. The total mass of identical packages must be based on the combined mass of inner packagings used for the drop test;
                (v) Inner packagings containing liquids must be completely surrounded with a sufficient quantity of absorbent material to absorb the entire liquid contents of the inner packagings;
                (vi) When the outer packaging is intended to contain inner packagings for liquids and is not leakproof, or is intended to contain inner packagings for solids and is not siftproof, a means of containing any liquid or solid contents in the event of leakage must be provided in the form of a leakproof liner, plastic bag, or other equally efficient means of containment. For packagings containing liquids, the absorbent material required in paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section must be placed inside the means of containing liquid contents; and
                (vii) Packagings must be marked in accordance with § 178.503 of this part as having been tested to Packing Group I performance for combination packagings. The marked maximum gross mass may not exceed the sum of the mass of the outer packaging plus one half the mass of the filled inner packagings of the tested combination packaging. In addition, the marking required by § 178.503(a)(2) of this part must include the letter “V”.
                (3) Variation 3. Packagings other than combination packagings which are produced with reductions in external dimensions (i.e., length, width or diameter) of up to 25 percent of the dimensions of a tested packaging may be used without further testing provided an equivalent level of performance is maintained. The packagings must, in all other respects (including wall thicknesses), be identical to the tested design-type. The marked gross mass (when required) must be reduced in proportion to the reduction in volume.
                (4) Variation 4. Variations are permitted in outer packagings of a tested design-type combination packaging, without further testing, provided an equivalent level of performance is maintained, as follows:
                (i) Each external dimension (length, width and height) is less than or equal to the corresponding dimension of the tested design-type;

                (ii) The structural design of the tested outer packaging (i.e., methods of construction, materials of construction, strength characteristics of materials of construction, method of closure and material thicknesses) is maintained;
                (iii) The inner packagings are identical to the inner packagings used in the tested design type except that their size and mass may be less; and they are oriented within the outer packaging in the same manner as in the tested packaging;
                (iv) The same type or design of absorbent materials, cushioning materials and any other components necessary to contain and protect inner packagings, as used in the tested design type, are maintained. The thickness of cushioning material between inner packagings and between inner packagings and the outside of the packaging may not be less than the thicknesses in the tested design type packaging; and
                (v) Sufficient additional cushioning material is used to take up void spaces and to prevent significant moving of the inner packagings.

                An outer packaging qualifying for use in transport in accordance with all of the above conditions may also be used without testing to transport inner packagings substituted for the originally tested inner packagings in accordance with the conditions set out in Variation 1 in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
                (5) Variation 5. Single packagings (i.e., non-bulk packagings other than combination packagings), that differ from a tested design type only to the extent that the closure device or gasketing differs from that used in the originally tested design type, may be used without further testing, provided an equivalent level of performance is maintained, subject to the following conditions (the qualifying tests):
                (i) A packaging with the replacement closure devices or gasketing must successfully pass the drop test specified in § 178.603 in the orientation which most severely tests the integrity of the closure or gasket;
                (ii) When intended to contain liquids, a packaging with the replacement closure devices or gasketing must successfully pass the leakproofness test specified in § 178.604, the hydrostatic pressure test specified in § 178.605, and the stacking test specified in § 178.606.
                Replacement closures and gasketings qualified under the above test requirements are authorized without additional testing for packagings described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section. Replacement closures and gasketings qualified under the above test requirements also are authorized without additional testing for different tested design types packagings of the same type as the originally tested packaging, provided the original design type tests are more severe or comparable to tests which would otherwise be conducted on the packaging with the replacement closures or gasketings. (For example: The packaging used in the qualifying tests has a lesser packaging wall thickness than the packaging with replacement closure devices or gasketing; the gross mass of the packaging used in the qualifying drop test equals or exceeds the mass for which the packaging with replacement closure devices or gasketing was tested; the packaging used in the qualifying drop test was dropped from the same or greater height than the height from which the packaging with replacement closure devices or gasketing was dropped in design type tests; and the specific gravity of the substance used in the qualifying drop test was the same or greater than the specific gravity of the liquid used in the design type tests of the packaging with replacement closure devices or gasketing.)
                (6) The provisions in Variations 1, 2, and 4 in paragraphs (g)(1), (2) and (4) of this section for combination packagings may be applied to packagings containing articles, where the provisions for inner packagings are applied analogously to the articles. In this case, inner packagings need not comply with § 173.27(c)(1) and (c)(2) of this subchapter.
                (7) Approval of selective testing. In addition to the provisions of § 178.601(g)(1) through (g)(6) of this subpart, the Associate Administrator may approve the selective testing of packagings that differ only in minor respects from a tested type.
                (8) For a steel drum with a capacity greater than 12 L (3 gallons) manufactured from low carbon, cold-rolled sheet steel meeting ASTM designations A 366/A 366M or A 568/A 568M, variations in elements other than the following design elements are considered minor and do not constitute a different drum design type, or “different packaging” as defined in paragraph (c) of this section for which design qualification testing and periodic retesting are required. Minor variations authorized without further testing include changes in the identity of the supplier of component material made to the same specifications, or the original manufacturer of a DOT specification or UN standard drum to be remanufactured. A change in any one or more of the following design elements constitutes a different drum design type:

                (i) The packaging type and category of the original drum and the remanufactured drum, i.e., 1A1 or 1A2;
                (ii) The style, (i.e., straight-sided or tapered);
                (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, the rated (marked) capacity and outside dimensions;
                (iv) The physical state for which the packaging was originally approved (e.g., tested for solids or liquids);

                (v) An increase in the marked level of performance of the original drum (i.e., to a higher packing group, hydrostatic test pressure, or specific gravity to which the packaging has been tested);
                (vi) Type of side seam welding;
                (vii) Type of steel;
                (viii) An increase greater than 10% or any decrease in the steel thickness of the head, body, or bottom;
                (ix) End seam type, (e.g., triple or double seam);
                (x) A reduction in the number of rolling hoops (beads) which equal or exceed the diameter over the chimes;
                (xi) The location, type or size, and material of closures (other than the cover of UN 1A2 drums);
                (xii) The location (e.g., from the head to the body), type (e.g., mechanically seamed or welded flange), and materials of closure (other than the cover of UN 1A2 drums); and
                (xiii) For UN 1A2 drums:
                (A) Gasket material (e.g., plastic), or properties affecting the performance of the gasket;
                (B) Configuration or dimensions of the gasket;
                (C) Closure ring style including bolt size (e.g., square or round back, 0.625 inches bolt); and
                (D) Closure ring thickness,
                (E) Width of lugs or extensions in crimp/lug cover.
                (h) Approval of equivalent packagings. A packaging having specifications different from those in §§ 178.504-178.523 of this part, or which is tested using methods or test intervals, other than those specified in subpart M of this part, may be used if approved by the Associate Administrator. Such packagings must be shown to be equally effective, and testing methods used must be equivalent.
                (i) Proof of compliance. Notwithstanding the periodic retest intervals specified in paragraph (e) of this section, the Associate Administrator may at any time require demonstration of compliance by a manufacturer, through testing in accordance with this subpart, that packagings meet the requirements of this subpart. As required by the Associate Administrator, the manufacturer shall either—
                (1) Conduct performance tests, or have tests conducted by an independent testing facility, in accordance with this subpart; or
                (2) Supply packagings, in quantities sufficient to conduct tests in accordance with this subpart, to the Associate Administrator or a designated representative of the Associate Administrator.
                (j) Coatings. If an inner treatment or coating of a packaging is required for safety reasons, the manufacturer shall design the packaging so that the treatment or coating retains its protective properties even after withstanding the tests prescribed by this subpart.
                (k) Number of test samples. Except as provided in this section, one test sample must be used for each test performed under this subpart.
                (1) Stainless steel drums. Provided the validity of the test results is not affected, a person may perform the design qualification testing of stainless steel drums using three (3) samples rather than the specified eighteen (18) samples under the following provisions:
                (i) The packaging must be tested in accordance with this subpart by subjecting each of the three containers to the following sequence of tests:
                (A) The stacking test in § 178.606,
                (B) The leakproofness test in § 178.604,
                (C) The hydrostatic pressure test in § 178.608, and
                (D) Diagonal top chime and flat on the side drop tests in § 178.603. Both drop tests may be conducted on the same sample.
                (ii) For periodic retesting of stainless steel drums, a reduced sample size of one container is authorized.
                (2) Packagings other than stainless steel drums. Provided the validity of the test results is not affected, several tests may be performed on one sample with the approval of the Associate Administrator.
                (l) Record retention. Following each design qualification test and each periodic retest on a packaging, a test report must be prepared.

                (1) The test report must be maintained at each location where the packaging is manufactured, certified, and a design qualification test or periodic retest is conducted as follows:

                § 178.602
                Preparation of packagings and packages for testing.
                (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, each packaging and package must be closed in preparation for testing and tests must be carried out in the same manner as if prepared for transportation, including inner packagings in the case of combination packagings.
                (b) For the drop and stacking test, inner and single-unit receptacles other than bags must be filled to not less than 95% of maximum capacity (see § 171.8 of this subchapter) in the case of solids and not less than 98% of maximum in the case of liquids. Bags containing solids shall be filled to the maximum mass at which they may be used. The material to be transported in the packagings may be replaced by a non-hazardous material, except for chemical compatibility testing or where this would invalidate the results of the tests.
                (c) If the material to be transported is replaced for test purposes by a non-hazardous material, the material used must be of the same or higher specific gravity as the material to be carried, and its other physical properties (grain, size, viscosity) which might influence the results of the required tests must correspond as closely as possible to those of the hazardous material to be transported. Water may also be used for the liquid drop test under the conditions specified in § 178.603(e) of this subpart. It is permissible to use additives, such as bags of lead shot, to achieve the requisite total package mass, so long as they are placed so that the test results are not affected.
                (d) Paper or fiberboard packagings must be conditioned for at least 24 hours immediately prior to testing in an atmosphere maintained—

                (1) At 50 percent ±2 percent relative humidity, and at a temperature of 23 °C±2 °C (73 °F±4 °F). Average values should fall within these limits. Short-term fluctuations and measurement limitations may cause individual measurements to vary by up to ±5 percent relative humidity without significant impairment of test reproducibility;
                (2) At 65 percent ±2 percent relative humidity, and at a temperature of 20 °C±2 °C (68 °F±4 °F), or 27 °C±2 °C (81 °F±4 °F). Average values should fall within these limits. Short-term fluctuations and measurement limitations may cause individual measurements to vary by up to ±5 percent relative humidity without significant impairment of test reproducibility; or
                (3) For testing at periodic intervals only (i.e., other than initial design qualification testing), at ambient conditions.
                (e) Except as otherwise provided, each packaging must be closed in preparation for testing in the same manner as if prepared for actual shipment. All closures must be installed using proper techniques and torques.
                (f) Bung-type barrels made of natural wood must be left filled with water for at least 24 hours before the tests.

                Drop test.
                (a) General. The drop test must be conducted for the qualification of all packaging design types and performed periodically as specified in § 178.601(e). For other than flat drops, the center of gravity of the test packaging must be vertically over the point of impact. Where more than one orientation is possible for a given drop test, the orientation most likely to result in failure of the packaging must be used. The number of drops required and the packages' orientations are as follows:

                    First drop: Flat on a wide face (using all three samples). Second drop: On an end of the bag (using all three samples).
                  
                
                (b) Exceptions. For testing of single or composite packagings constructed of stainless steel, nickel, or monel at periodic intervals only (i.e., other than design qualification testing), the drop test may be conducted with two samples, one sample each for the two drop orientations. These samples may have been previously used for the hydrostatic pressure or stacking test. Exceptions for the number of steel, aluminum and other metal packaging samples used for conducting the drop test are subject to the approval of the Associate Administrator.
                (c) Special preparation of test samples for the drop test. (1) Testing of plastic drums, plastic jerricans, plastic boxes other than expanded polystyrene boxes, composite packagings (plastic material), and combination packagings with plastic inner packagings other than plastic bags intended to contain solids or articles must be carried out when the temperature of the test sample and its contents has been reduced to −18 °C (0 °F) or lower. Test liquids must be kept in the liquid state, if necessary, by the addition of anti-freeze. Water/anti-freeze solutions with a minimum specific gravity of 0.95 for testing at −18 °C (0 °F) or lower are considered acceptable test liquids. Test samples prepared in this way are not required to be conditioned in accordance with § 178.602(d).
                
                (d) Target. The target must be a rigid, non-resilient, flat and horizontal surface.
                (e) Drop height. Drop heights, measured as the vertical distance from the target to the lowest point on the package, must be equal to or greater than the drop height determined as follows:
                (1) For solids and liquids, if the test is performed with the solid or liquid to be transported or with a non-hazardous material having essentially the same physical characteristic, the drop height must be determined according to packing group, as follows:
                (i) Packing Group I: 1.8 m (5.9 feet).
                (ii) Packing Group II: 1.2 m (3.9 feet).
                (iii) Packing Group III: 0.8 m (2.6 feet).
                (2) For liquids in single packagings and for inner packagings of combination packagings, if the test is performed with water:
                (i) Where the materials to be carried have a specific gravity not exceeding 1.2, drop height must be determined according to packing group, as follows:
                (A) Packing Group I: 1.8 m (5.9 feet).
                (B) Packing Group II: 1.2 m (3.9 feet).
                (C) Packing Group III: 0.8 m (2.6 feet).
                (ii) Where the materials to be transported have a specific gravity exceeding 1.2, the drop height must be calculated on the basis of the specific gravity (SG) of the material to be carried, rounded up to the first decimal, as follows:
                (A) Packing Group I: SG × 1.5 m (4.9 feet).
                (B) Packing Group II: SG × 1.0 m (3.3 feet).
                (C) Packing Group III: SG × 0.67 m (2.2 feet).
                (f) Criteria for passing the test. A package is considered to successfully pass the drop tests if for each sample tested—
                (1) For packagings containing liquid, each packaging does not leak when equilibrium has been reached between the internal and external pressures, except for inner packagings of combination packagings when it is not necessary that the pressures be equalized;
                (2) For removable head drums for solids, the entire contents are retained by an inner packaging (e.g., a plastic bag) even if the closure on the top head of the drum is no longer sift-proof;
                (3) For a bag, neither the outermost ply nor an outer packaging exhibits any damage likely to adversely affect safety during transport;
                (4) The packaging or outer packaging of a composite or combination packaging must not exhibit any damage likely to affect safety during transport. Inner receptacles, inner packagings, or articles must remain completely within the outer packaging and there must be no leakage of the filling substance from the inner receptacles or inner packagings;
                (5) Any discharge from a closure is slight and ceases immediately after impact with no further leakage; and
                (6) No rupture is permitted in packagings for materials in Class 1 which would permit spillage of loose explosive substances or articles from the outer packaging.

                § 178.604
                Leakproofness test.
                (a) General. The leakproofness test must be performed with compressed air or other suitable gases on all packagings intended to contain liquids, except that:
                (1) The inner receptacle of a composite packaging may be tested without the outer packaging provided the test results are not affected; and
                (2) This test is not required for inner packagings of combination packagings.
                (b) Number of packagings to be tested—(1) Production testing. All packagings subject to the provisions of this section must be tested and must pass the leakproofness test:
                (i) Before they are first used in transportation; and
                (ii) Prior to reuse, when authorized for reuse by § 173.28 of this subchapter.
                (2) Design qualification and periodic testing. Three samples of each different packaging must be tested and must pass the leakproofness test. Exceptions for the number of samples used in conducting the leakproofness test are subject to the approval of the Associate Administrator.
                
                (c) Special preparation—(1) For design qualification and periodic testing, packagings must be tested with closures in place. For production testing, packagings need not have their closures in place. Removable heads need not be installed during production testing.
                (2) For testing with closures in place, vented closures must either be replaced by similar non-vented closures or the vent must be sealed.
                (d) Test method. The packaging must be restrained under water while an internal air pressure is applied; the method of restraint must not affect the results of the test. The test must be conducted, for other than production testing, for a minimum time of five minutes. Other methods, at least equally effective, may be used in accordance with appendix B of this part.
                (e) Pressure applied. An internal air pressure (gauge) must be applied to the packaging as indicated for the following packing groups:
                (1) Packing Group I: Not less than 30 kPa (4 psi).
                (2) Packing Group II: Not less than 20 kPa (3 psi).
                (3) Packing Group III: Not less than 20 kPa (3 psi).
                (f) Criteria for passing the test. A packaging passes the test if there is no leakage of air from the packaging.

                § 178.605
                Hydrostatic pressure test.
                (a) General. The hydrostatic pressure test must be conducted for the qualification of all metal, plastic, and composite packaging design types intended to contain liquids and be performed periodically as specified in § 178.601(e). This test is not required for inner packagings of combination packagings. For internal pressure requirements for inner packagings of combination packagings intended for transportation by aircraft, see § 173.27(c) of this subchapter.
                (b) Number of test samples. Three test samples are required for each different packaging. For packagings constructed of stainless steel, monel, or nickel, only one sample is required for periodic retesting of packagings. Exceptions for the number of aluminum and steel sample packagings used in conducting the hydrostatic pressure test are subject to the approval of the Associate Administrator.
                (c) Special preparation of receptacles for testings. Vented closures must either be replaced by similar non-vented closures or the vent must be sealed.
                (d) Test method and pressure to be applied. Metal packagings and composite packagings other than plastic (e.g., glass, porcelain or stoneware), including their closures, must be subjected to the test pressure for 5 minutes. Plastic packagings and composite packagings (plastic material), including their closures, must be subjected to the test pressure for 30 minutes. This pressure is the one to be marked as required in § 178.503(a)(5). The receptacles must be supported in a manner that does not invalidate the test. The test pressure must be applied continuously and evenly, and it must be kept constant throughout the test period. In addition, packagings intended to contain hazardous materials of Packing Group I must be tested to a minimum test pressure of 250 kPa (36 psig). The hydraulic pressure (gauge) applied, taken at the top of the receptacle, and determined by any one of the following methods must be:

                (1) Not less than the total gauge pressure measured in the packaging (i.e., the vapor pressure of the filling material and the partial pressure of the air or other inert gas minus 100 kPa (15 psi)) at 55 °C (131 °F), multiplied by a safety factor of 1.5. This total gauge pressure must be determined on the basis of a maximum degree of filling in accordance with § 173.24a(d) of this subchapter and a filling temperature of 15 °C (59 °F);
                (2) Not less than 1.75 times the vapor pressure at 50 °C (122 °F) of the material to be transported minus 100 kPa (15 psi), but with a minimum test pressure of 100 kPa (15 psig); or
                (3) Not less than 1.5 times the vapor pressure at 55 °C (131 °F) of the material to be transported minus 100 kPa (15 psi), but with a minimum test pressure of 100 kPa (15 psig).

                Packagings intended to contain hazardous materials of Packing Group I must be tested to a minimum test pressure of 250 kPa (36 psig).
                (e) Criteria for passing the test. A package passes the hydrostatic test if, for each test sample, there is no leakage of liquid from the package.

                § 178.606
                Stacking test.
                (a) General. All packaging design types other than bags must be subjected to a stacking test.
                (b) Number of test samples. Three test samples are required for each different packaging. For periodic retesting of packagings constructed of stainless steel, monel, or nickel, only one test sample is required. Exceptions for the number of aluminum and steel sample packagings used in conducting the stacking test are subject to the approval of the Associate Administrator. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 178.602(a) of this subpart, combination packagings may be subjected to the stacking test without their inner packagings, except where this would invalidate the results of the test.
                (c) Test method—(1) Design qualification testing. The test sample must be subjected to a force applied to the top surface of the test sample equivalent to the total weight of identical packages which might be stacked on it during transport; where the contents of the test sample are non-hazardous liquids with specific gravities different from that of the liquid to be transported, the force must be calculated based on the specific gravity that will be marked on the packaging. The minimum height of the stack, including the test sample, must be 3.0 m (10 feet). The duration of the test must be 24 hours, except that plastic drums, jerricans, and composite packagings 6HH intended for liquids shall be subjected to the stacking test for a period of 28 days at a temperature of not less than 40 °C (104 °F). Alternative test methods which yield equivalent results may be used if approved by the Associate Administrator. In guided load tests, stacking stability must be assessed after completion of the test by placing two filled packagings of the same type on the test sample. The stacked packages must maintain their position for one hour. Plastic packagings must be cooled to ambient temperature before this stacking stability assessment.
                (2) Periodic retesting. The test sample must be tested in accordance with:
                (i) Section 178.606(c)(1) of this subpart; or

                (ii) The packaging may be tested using a dynamic compression testing machine. The test must be conducted at room temperature on an empty, unsealed packaging. The test sample must be centered on the bottom platen of the testing machine. The top platen must be lowered until it comes in contact with the test sample. Compression must be applied end to end. The speed of the compression tester must be one-half inch plus or minus one-fourth inch per minute. An initial preload of 50 pounds must be applied to ensure a definite contact between the test sample and the platens. The distance between the platens at this time must be recorded as zero deformation. The force A to then be applied must be calculated using the formula:
                
                Liquids: A = (n−1) [w + (s × v × 8.3 × .98)] × 1.5;
                Solids: A = (n−1) (m × 2.2 × 1.5)
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  A = applied load in pounds
                  m = the certified maximum gross mass for the container in kilograms.
                  n = minimum number of containers that, when stacked, reach a height of 3 meters.
                  s = specific gravity of lading.
                  w = maximum weight of one empty container in pounds.
                  v = actual capacity of container (rated capacity + outage) in gallons.
                  
                  And:
                  
                  8.3 corresponds to the weight in pounds of 1.0 gallon of water.
                  .98 corresponds to the minimum filling percentage of the maximum capacity for liquids.
                  1.5 is a compensation factor that converts the static load of the stacking test into a load suitable for dynamic compression testing.
                  2.2 is the conversion factor for kilograms to pounds.
                
                (d) Criteria for passing the test. No test sample may leak. In composite packagings or combination packagings, there must be no leakage of the filling substance from the inner receptacle, or inner packaging. No test sample may show any deterioration which could adversely affect transportation safety or any distortion likely to reduce its strength, cause instability in stacks of packages, or cause damage to inner packagings likely to reduce safety in transportation. For the dynamic compression test, a container passes the test if, after application of the required load, there is no buckling of the sidewalls sufficient to cause damage to its expected contents; in no case may the maximum deflection exceed one inch.

                Cooperage test for bung-type wooden barrels.
                (a) Number of samples. One barrel is required for each different packaging.
                (b) Method of testing. Remove all hoops above the bilge of an empty barrel at least two days old.
                (c) Criteria for passing the test. A packaging passes the cooperage test only if the diameter of the cross-section of the upper part of the barrel does not increase by more than 10 percent.
              
              
                § 178.608
                Vibration standard.
                (a) Each packaging must be capable of withstanding, without rupture or leakage, the vibration test procedure outlined in this section.
                (b) Test method. (1) Three sample packagings, selected at random, must be filled and closed as for shipment.
                (2) The three samples must be placed on a vibrating platform that has a vertical or rotary double-amplitude (peak-to-peak displacement) of one inch. The packages should be constrained horizontally to prevent them from falling off the platform, but must be left free to move vertically, bounce and rotate.
                (3) The test must be performed for one hour at a frequency that causes the package to be raised from the vibrating platform to such a degree that a piece of material of approximately 1.6 mm (0.063 inch) thickness (such as steel strapping or paperboard) can be passed between the bottom of any package and the platform.
                (4) Immediately following the period of vibration, each package must be removed from the platform, turned on its side and observed for any evidence of leakage.
                (5) Other methods, at least equally effective, may be used, if approved by the Associate Administrator.
                (c) Criteria for passing the test. A packaging passes the vibration test if there is no rupture or leakage from any of the packages. No test sample should show any deterioration which could adversely affect transportation safety or any distortion liable to reduce packaging strength.

                § 178.609
                Test requirements for packagings for infectious substances.
                (a) Samples of each packaging must be prepared for testing as described in paragraph (b) of this section and then subjected to the tests in paragraphs (d) through (i) of this section.
                (b) Samples of each packaging must be prepared as for transport except that a liquid or solid infectious substance should be replaced by water or, where conditioning at −18 °C (0 °F) is specified, by water/antifreeze. Each primary receptacle must be filled to 98 percent capacity. Packagings for live animals should be tested with the live animal being replaced by an appropriate dummy of similar mass.

                (c) Packagings prepared as for transport must be subjected to the tests in Table I of this paragraph (c), which, for test purposes, categorizes packagings according to their material characteristics. For outer packagings, the headings in Table I relate to fiberboard or similar materials whose performance may be rapidly affected by moisture; plastics that may embrittle at low temperature; and other materials, such as metal, for which performance is not significantly affected by moisture or temperature. Where a primary receptacle and a secondary packaging of an inner packaging are made of different materials, the material of the primary receptacle determines the appropriate test. In instances where a primary receptacle is made of more than one material, the material most likely to be damaged determines the appropriate test.

                (d) Samples must be subjected to free-fall drops onto a rigid, nonresilient, flat, horizontal surface from a height of 9 m (30 feet).
                The drops must be performed as follows:
                (1) Where the samples are in the shape of a box, five samples must be dropped, one in each of the following orientation:
                (i) Flat on the base;
                (ii) Flat on the top;
                (iii) Flat on the longest side;
                (iv) Flat on the shortest side; and
                (v) On a corner.
                (2) Where the samples are in the shape of a drum, three samples must be dropped, one in each of the following orientations:
                (i) Diagonally on the top chime, with the center of gravity directly above the point of impact;
                (ii) Diagonally on the base chime; and
                (iii) Flat on the side.
                (3) While the sample should be released in the required orientation, it is accepted that for aerodynamic reasons the impact may not take place in that orientation.
                (4) Following the appropriate drop sequence, there must be no leakage from the primary receptacle(s) which should remain protected by absorbent material in the secondary packaging.
                (e) The samples must be subjected to a water spray to simulate exposure to rainfall of approximately 50 mm (2 inches) per hour for at least one hour. They must then be subjected to the test described in paragraph (d) of this section.
                (f) The sample must be conditioned in an atmosphere of −18 °C (0 °F) or less for a period of at least 24 hours and within 15 minutes of removal from that atmosphere be subjected to the test described in paragraph (d) of this section. Where the sample contains dry ice, the conditioning period may be reduced to 4 hours.
                (g) Where packaging is intended to contain dry ice, a test additional to that specified in paragraph (d) or (e) or (f) of this section must be carried out. One sample must be stored so that all the dry ice dissipates and then be subjected to the test described in paragraph (d) of this section.
                (h) Packagings with a gross mass of 7 kg (15 pounds) or less should be subjected to the tests described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section and packagings with a gross mass exceeding 7 kg (15 pounds) to the tests in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.

                (1) Samples must be placed on a level, hard surface. A cylindrical steel rod with a mass of at least 7 kg (15 pounds), a diameter not exceeding 38 mm (1.5 inches), and, at the impact end edges, a radius not exceeding 6 mm (0.2 inches), must be dropped in a vertical free fall from a height of 1 m (3 feet), measured from the impact end of the sample's impact surface. One sample must be placed on its base. A second sample must be placed in an orientation perpendicular to that used for the first. In each instance, the steel rod must be aimed to impact the primary receptacle(s). For a successful test, there must be no leakage from the primary receptacle(s) following each impact.
                (2) Samples must be dropped onto the end of a cylindrical steel rod. The rod must be set vertically in a level, hard surface. It must have a diameter of 38 mm (1.5 inches) and a radius not exceeding 6 mm (0.2 inches) at the edges of the upper end. The rod must protrude from the surface a distance at least equal to that between the primary receptacle(s) and the outer surface of the outer packaging with a minimum of 200 mm (7.9 inches). One sample must be dropped in a vertical free fall from a height of 1 m (3 feet), measured from the top of the steel rod. A second sample must be dropped from the same height in an orientation perpendicular to that used for the first. In each instance, the packaging must be oriented so the steel rod will impact the primary receptacle(s). For a successful test, there must be no leakage from the primary receptacle(s) following each impact.
                (i) Variations. The following variations in the primary receptacles placed within the secondary packaging are allowed without additional testing of the completed package. An equivalent level of performance must be maintained.
                (1) Variation 1. Primary receptacles of equivalent or smaller size as compared to the tested primary receptacles may be used provided they meet all of the following conditions:
                (i) The primary receptacles are of similar design to the tested primary receptacle (e.g., shape: round, rectangular, etc.).
                (ii) The material of construction of the primary receptacle (glass, plastics, metal, etc.) offers resistance to impact and a stacking force equal to or greater than that of the originally tested primary receptacle.
                (iii) The primary receptacles have the same or smaller openings and the closure is of similar design (e.g., screw cap, friction lid, etc.).
                (iv) Sufficient additional cushioning material is used to fill void spaces and to prevent significant movement of the primary receptacles.
                (v) Primary receptacles are oriented within the intermediate packaging in the same manner as in the tested package.
                (2) Variation 2. A lesser number of the tested primary receptacles, or of the alternative types of primary receptacles identified in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, may be used provided sufficient cushioning is added to fill the void space(s) and to prevent significant movement of the primary receptacles.
                (3) Variation 3. Primary receptacles of any type may be placed within a secondary packaging and shipped without testing in the outer packaging provided all of the following conditions are met:
                (i) The secondary and outer packaging combination must be successfully tested in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section with fragile (e.g., glass) inner receptacles.
                (ii) The total combined gross weight of inner receptacles may not exceed one-half the gross weight of inner receptacles used for the drop test in paragraph (d) of this section.
                (iii) The thickness of cushioning material between inner receptacles and between inner receptacles and the outside of the secondary packaging may not be reduced below the corresponding thicknesses in the originally tested packaging. If a single inner receptacle was used in the original test, the thickness of cushioning between the inner receptacles must be no less than the thickness of cushioning between the outside of the secondary packaging and the inner receptacle in the original test. When either fewer or smaller inner receptacles are used (as compared to the inner receptacles used in the drop test), sufficient additional cushioning material must be used to fill the void.
                (iv) The outer packaging must pass the stacking test in § 178.606 while empty. The total weight of identical packages must be based on the combined mass of inner receptacles used in the drop test in paragraph (d) of this section.
                (v) For inner receptacles containing liquids, an adequate quantity of absorbent material must be present to absorb the entire liquid contents of the inner receptacles.

                (vi) If the outer packaging is intended to contain inner receptacles for liquids and is not leakproof, or is intended to contain inner receptacles for solids and is not sift proof, a means of containing any liquid or solid contents in the event of leakage must be provided. This can be a leakproof liner, plastic bag, or other equally effective means of containment.
                (vii) In addition, the marking required in § 178.503(f) of this subchapter must be followed by the letter “U”.

                § 178.704
                General IBC standards.
                (a) Each IBC must be resistant to, or protected from, deterioration due to exposure to the external environment. IBCs intended for solid hazardous materials must be sift-proof and water-resistant.
                (b) All service equipment must be so positioned or protected as to minimize potential loss of contents resulting from damage during IBC handling and transportation.
                (c) Each IBC, including attachments, and service and structural equipment, must be designed to withstand, without loss of hazardous materials, the internal pressure of the contents and the stresses of normal handling and transport. An IBC intended for stacking must be designed for stacking. Any lifting or securing features of an IBC must be of sufficient strength to withstand the normal conditions of handling and transportation without gross distortion or failure and must be positioned so as to cause no undue stress in any part of the IBC.

                (d) An IBC consisting of a packaging within a framework must be so constructed that:
                
                (1) The body is not damaged by the framework;
                (2) The body is retained within the framework at all times; and
                (3) The service and structural equipment are fixed in such a way that they cannot be damaged if the connections between body and frame allow relative expansion or motion.
                (e) Bottom discharge valves must be secured in the closed position and the discharge system suitably protected from damage. Valves having lever closures must be secured against accidental opening. The open or closed position of each valve must be readily apparent. For each IBC containing a liquid, a secondary means of sealing the discharge aperture must also be provided, e.g., by a blank flange or equivalent device.
                (f) IBC design types must be constructed in such a way as to be bottom-lifted or top-lifted as specified in §§ 178.811 and 178.812.

                § 178.705
                Standards for metal IBCs.
                (a) The provisions in this section apply to metal IBCs intended to contain liquids and solids. Metal IBC types are designated:
                (1) 11A, 11B, 11N for solids that are loaded or discharged by gravity.
                (2) 21A, 21B, 21N for solids that are loaded or discharged at a gauge pressure greater than 10 kPa (1.45 psig).
                (3) 31A, 31B, 31N for liquids.
                (b) Definitions for metal IBCs:
                (1) Metal IBC means an IBC with a metal body, together with appropriate service and structural equipment.
                (2) Protected means providing the IBC body with additional external protection against impact and abrasion. For example, a multi-layer (sandwich) or double wall construction or a frame with a metal lattice-work casing.
                (c) Construction requirements for metal IBCs are as follows:
                (1) Body. The body must be made of ductile metal materials. Welds must be made so as to maintain design type integrity of the receptacle under conditions normally incident to transportation.
                (i) The use of dissimilar metals must not result in deterioration that could affect the integrity of the body.
                (ii) Aluminum IBCs intended to contain flammable liquids must have no movable parts, such as covers and closures, made of unprotected steel liable to rust, which might cause a dangerous reaction from friction or percussive contact with the aluminum.
                (iii) Metals used in fabricating the body of a metal IBC must meet the following requirements:
                (A) For steel, the percentage elongation at fracture must not be less than 10,000/Rm with a minimum of 20 percent; where Rm = minimum tensile strength of the steel to be used, in N/mm2; if U.S. Standard units of psi are used for tensile strength then the ratio becomes 10,000 × (145/Rm).
                (B) For aluminum, the percentage elongation at fracture must not be less than 10,000/(6Rm) with an absolute minimum of eight percent; if U.S. Standard units of psi are used for tensile strength then the ratio becomes 10,000 × 145 / (6Rm).

                (C) Specimens used to determine the elongation at fracture must be taken transversely to the direction of rolling and be so secured that:
                
                Lo = 5d
                
                or
                
                Lo = 5.65 √A
                
                
                  where:
                  
                  Lo = gauge length of the specimen before the test
                  d = diameter
                  A = cross-sectional area of test specimen.
                
                
                (iv) Minimum wall thickness:

                (A) For a reference steel having a product of Rm × Ao = 10,000, where Ao is the minimum elongation (as a percentage) of the reference steel to be used on fracture under tensile stress (Rm × Ao = 10,000 × 145; if tensile strength is in U.S. Standard units of pounds per square inch), the wall thickness must not be less than:
                
                
                  
                    Capacity (C) in liters 1

                    T = C/2000 + 1.5
                    T = C/2000 + 1.0
                    T = C/2000 + 2.0

                    T = C/2000 + 1.0
                    T = C/1000 + 1.0

                (B) For metals other than the reference steel described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, the minimum wall thickness is the greater of 1.5 mm (0.059 inches) or as determined by use of the following equivalence formula:
                
                  
                    Formula for Metric Units

                    Formula for U.S. Standard Units
                  
                  EP26JN96.001
                
                
                  where:
                  
                  e1 = required equivalent wall thickness of the metal to be used (in mm or if eo is in inches, use formula for U.S. Standard units).
                  eo = required minimum wall thickness for the reference steel (in mm or if eo is in inches, use formula for U.S. Standard units).
                  Rm1 = guaranteed minimum tensile strength of the metal to be used (in N/mm2 or for U.S. Standard units, use psi).
                  A1 = minimum elongation (as a percentage) of the metal to be used on fracture under tensile stress (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section).
                
                

                (C) For purposes of the calculation described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(B) of this section, the guaranteed minimum tensile strength of the metal to be used (Rm1) must be the minimum value according to material standards. However, for austenitic (stainless) steels, the specified minimum value for Rm, according to the material standards, may be increased by up to 15% when a greater value is provided in the material inspection certificate. When no material standard exists for the material in question, the value of Rm must be the minimum value indicated in the material inspection certificate.
                (2) Pressure relief. The following pressure relief requirements apply to IBCs intended for liquids:
                (i) IBCs must be capable of releasing a sufficient amount of vapor in the event of fire engulfment to ensure that no rupture of the body will occur due to pressure build-up. This can be achieved by spring-loaded or non-reclosing pressure relief devices or by other means of construction.
                (ii) The start-to-discharge pressure may not be higher than 65 kPa (9 psig) and no lower than the vapor pressure of the hazardous material plus the partial pressure of the air or other inert gases, measured in the IBC at 55 °C (131 °F), determined on the basis of a maximum degree of filling as specified in § 173.35(d) of this subchapter. This does not apply to fusible devices unless such devices are the only source of pressure relief for the IBC. Pressure relief devices must be fitted in the vapor space.
                (d) Metal IBCs may not have a volumetric capacity greater than 3,000 L (793 gallons) or less than 450 L (119 gallons).

                Standards for rigid plastic IBCs.
                (a) The provisions in this section apply to rigid plastic IBCs intended to contain solids or liquids. Rigid plastic IBC types are designated:

                (1) 11H1 fitted with structural equipment designed to withstand the whole load when IBCs are stacked, for solids which are loaded or discharged by gravity.
                
                (2) 11H2 freestanding, for solids which are loaded or discharged by gravity.
                (3) 21H1 fitted with structural equipment designed to withstand the whole load when IBCs are stacked, for solids which are loaded or discharged under pressure.
                (4) 21H2 freestanding, for solids which are loaded or discharged under pressure.
                (5) 31H1 fitted with structural equipment designed to withstand the whole load when IBCs are stacked, for liquids.
                (6) 31H2 freestanding, for liquids.
                (b) Rigid plastic IBCs consist of a rigid plastic body, which may have structural equipment, together with appropriate service equipment.
                (c) Rigid plastic IBCs must be manufactured from plastic material of known specifications and be of a strength relative to its capacity and to the service it is required to perform. In addition to conformance to § 173.24 of this subchapter, plastic materials must be resistant to aging and to degradation caused by ultraviolet radiation.
                (1) If protection against ultraviolet radiation is necessary, it must be provided by the addition of a pigment or inhibiter such as carbon black. These additives must be compatible with the contents and remain effective throughout the life of the IBC body. Where use is made of carbon black, pigments or inhibitors, other than those used in the manufacture of the tested design type, retesting may be omitted if changes in the carbon black content, the pigment content or the inhibitor content do not adversely affect the physical properties of the material of construction.
                (2) Additives may be included in the composition of the plastic material to improve the resistance to aging or to serve other purposes, provided they do not adversely affect the physical or chemical properties of the material of construction.
                (3) No used material other than production residues or regrind from the same manufacturing process may be used in the manufacture of rigid plastic IBCs.
                (4) Rigid plastic IBCs intended for the transportation of liquids must be capable of releasing a sufficient amount of vapor to prevent the body of the IBC from rupturing if it is subjected to an internal pressure in excess of that for which it was hydraulically tested. This may be achieved by spring-loaded or non-reclosing pressure relief devices or by other means of construction.
                (d) Rigid plastic IBCs may not have a volumetric capacity greater than 3,000 L (793 gallons) or less than 450 L (119 gallons).

                § 178.707
                Standards for composite IBCs.
                (a) The provisions in this section apply to composite IBCs intended to contain solids and liquids. To complete the marking codes listed below, the letter “Z” must be replaced by a capital letter in accordance with § 178.702(a)(2) to indicate the material used for the outer packaging. Composite IBC types are designated:
                (1) 11HZ1 Composite IBCs with a rigid plastic inner receptacle for solids loaded or discharged by gravity.
                (2) 11HZ2 Composite IBCs with a flexible plastic inner receptacle for solids loaded or discharged by gravity.
                (3) 21HZ1 Composite IBCs with a rigid plastic inner receptacle for solids loaded or discharged under pressure.
                (4) 21HZ2 Composite IBCs with a flexible plastic inner receptacle for solids loaded or discharged under pressure.
                (5) 31HZ1 Composite IBCs with a rigid plastic inner receptacle for liquids.
                (6) 31HZ2 Composite IBCs with a flexible plastic inner receptacle for liquids.
                (b) Definitions for composite IBC types:
                (1) A composite IBC is an IBC which consists of a rigid outer packaging enclosing a plastic inner receptacle together with any service or other structural equipment. The outer packaging of a composite IBC is designed to bear the entire stacking load. The inner receptacle and outer packaging form an integral packaging and are filled, stored, transported, and emptied as a unit.
                (2) The term plastic means polymeric materials (i.e., plastic or rubber).
                
                (3) A “rigid” inner receptacle is an inner receptacle which retains its general shape when empty without closures in place and without benefit of the outer casing. Any inner receptacle that is not “rigid” is considered to be “flexible.”
                (c) Construction requirements for composite IBCs with plastic inner receptacles are as follows:
                (1) The outer packaging must consist of rigid material formed so as to protect the inner receptacle from physical damage during handling and transportation, but is not required to perform the secondary containment function. It includes the base pallet where appropriate. The inner receptacle is not intended to perform a containment function without the outer packaging.
                (2) A composite IBC with a fully enclosing outer packaging must be designed to permit assessment of the integrity of the inner container following the leakproofness and hydraulic tests. The outer packaging of 31HZ2 composite IBCs must enclose the inner receptacles on all sides.
                (3) The inner receptacle must be manufactured from plastic material of known specifications and be of a strength relative to its capacity and to the service it is required to perform. In addition to conformance with the requirements of § 173.24 of this subchapter, the material must be resistant to aging and to degradation caused by ultraviolet radiation. The inner receptacle of 31HZ2 composite IBCs must consist of at least three plies of film.
                (i) If necessary, protection against ultraviolet radiation must be provided by the addition of pigments or inhibitors such as carbon black. These additives must be compatible with the contents and remain effective throughout the life of the inner receptacle. Where use is made of carbon black, pigments, or inhibitors, other than those used in the manufacture of the tested design type, retesting may be omitted if the carbon black content, the pigment content, or the inhibitor content do not adversely affect the physical properties of the material of construction.
                (ii) Additives may be included in the composition of the plastic material of the inner receptacle to improve resistance to aging, provided they do not adversely affect the physical or chemical properties of the material.
                (iii) No used material other than production residues or regrind from the same manufacturing process may be used in the manufacture of inner receptacles.
                (iv) Composite IBCs intended for the transportation of liquids must be capable of releasing a sufficient amount of vapor to prevent the body of the IBC from rupturing if it is subjected to an internal pressure in excess of that for which it was hydraulically tested. This may be achieved by spring-loaded or non-reclosing pressure relief devices or by other means of construction.
                (4) The strength of the construction material comprising the outer packaging and the manner of construction must be appropriate to the capacity of the composite IBC and its intended use. The outer packaging must be free of any projection that might damage the inner receptacle.
                (i) Outer packagings of natural wood must be constructed of well seasoned wood that is commercially dry and free from defects that would materially lessen the strength of any part of the outer packaging. The tops and bottoms may be made of water-resistant reconstituted wood such as hardboard or particle board. Materials other than natural wood may be used for construction of structural equipment of the outer packaging.
                (ii) Outer packagings of plywood must be made of well-seasoned, rotary cut, sliced, or sawn veneer, commercially dry and free from defects that would materially lessen the strength of the casing. All adjacent plies must be glued with water-resistant adhesive. Materials other than plywood may be used for construction of structural equipment of the outer packaging. Outer packagings must be firmly nailed or secured to corner posts or ends or be assembled by equally suitable devices.

                (iii) Outer packagings of reconstituted wood must be constructed of water-resistant reconstituted wood such as hardboard or particle board. Materials other than reconstituted wood may be used for the construction of structural equipment of reconstituted wood outer packaging.
                
                (iv) Fiberboard outer packagings must be constructed of strong, solid, or double-faced corrugated fiberboard (single or multiwall).
                (A) Water resistance of the outer surface must be such that the increase in mass, as determined in a test carried out over a period of 30 minutes by the Cobb method of determining water absorption, is not greater than 155 grams per square meter (0.0316 pounds per square foot)—see ISO 535 (E) (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). Fiberboard must have proper bending qualities. Fiberboard must be cut, creased without cutting through any thickness of fiberboard, and slotted so as to permit assembly without cracking, surface breaks, or undue bending. The fluting of corrugated fiberboard must be firmly glued to the facings.
                (B) The ends of fiberboard outer packagings may have a wooden frame or be constructed entirely of wood. Wooden battens may be used for reinforcements.
                (C) Manufacturers' joints in the bodies of outer packagings must be taped, lapped and glued, or lapped and stitched with metal staples.
                (D) Lapped joints must have an appropriate overlap.
                (E) Where closing is effected by gluing or taping, a water-resistant adhesive must be used.

              Subpart O—Testing of IBCs
              
                § 178.800
                Purpose and scope.
                This subpart prescribes certain testing requirements for IBCs identified in subpart N of this part.
                [Amdt. 178-103, 59 FR 38074, July 26, 1994, as amended by 66 FR 45386, Aug. 28, 2001]
              
              
                § 178.801
                General requirements.
                (a) General. The test procedures prescribed in this subpart are intended to ensure that IBCs containing hazardous materials can withstand normal conditions of transportation and are considered minimum requirements. Each packaging must be manufactured and assembled so as to be capable of successfully passing the prescribed tests and of conforming to the requirements of § 173.24 of this subchapter at all times while in transportation.
                (b) Responsibility. It is the responsibility of the IBC manufacturer to assure that each IBC is capable of passing the prescribed tests. To the extent that an IBC assembly function, including final closure, is performed by the person who offers a hazardous material for transportation, that person is responsible for performing the function in accordance with §§ 173.22 and 178.2 of this subchapter.
                (c) Definitions. For the purpose of this subpart:
                (1) IBC design type refers to an IBC that does not differ in structural design, size, material of construction, wall thickness, manner of construction and representative service equipment.
                (2) Design qualification testing is the performance of the drop, leakproofness, hydrostatic pressure, stacking, bottom-lift or top-lift, tear, topple, righting and vibration tests, as applicable, prescribed in this subpart, for each different IBC design type, at the start of production of that packaging.
                (3) Periodic design requalification test is the performance of the applicable tests specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section on an IBC design type, in order to requalify the design for continued production at the frequency specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
                (4) Production inspection is the inspection that must initially be conducted on each newly manufactured IBC.
                (5) Production testing is the performance of the leakproofness test in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section on each IBC intended to contain solids discharged by pressure or intended to contain liquids.
                (6) Periodic retest and inspection is performance of the applicable test and inspections on each IBC at the frequency specified in § 180.352 of this subchapter.
                (7) Different IBC design type is one that differs from a previously qualified IBC design type in structural design, size, material of construction, wall thickness, or manner of construction, but does not include:

                (i) A packaging which differs in surface treatment;
                
                (ii) A rigid plastic IBC or composite IBC which differs with regard to additives used to comply with §§ 178.706(c), 178.707(c) or 178.710(c);

                (iii) A packaging which differs only in its lesser external dimensions (i.e., height, width, length) provided materials of construction and material thicknesses or fabric weight remain the same;
                (iv) A packaging which differs in service equipment.
                (d) Design qualification testing. The packaging manufacturer shall achieve successful test results for the design qualification testing at the start of production of each new or different IBC design type. The service equipment selected for this design qualification testing shall be representative of the type of service equipment that will be fitted to any finished IBC body under the design. Application of the certification mark by the manufacturer shall constitute certification that the IBC design type passed the prescribed tests in this subpart.
                (e) Periodic design requalification testing. (1) Periodic design requalification must be conducted on each qualified IBC design type if the manufacturer is to maintain authorization for continued production. The IBC manufacturer shall achieve successful test results for the periodic design requalification at sufficient frequency to ensure each packaging produced by the manufacturer is capable of passing the design qualification tests. Design requalification tests must be conducted at least once every 12 months.
                (2) Changes in the frequency of design requalification testing specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section are authorized if approved by the Associate Administrator. These requests must be based on:
                (i) Detailed quality assurance programs that assure that proposed decreases in test frequency maintain the integrity of originally tested IBC design types; and
                (ii) Demonstrations that each IBC produced is capable of withstanding higher standards (e.g., increased drop height, hydrostatic pressure, wall thickness, fabric weight).
                (f) Production testing and inspection. (1) Production testing consists of the leakproofness test prescribed in § 178.813 of this subpart and must be performed on each IBC intended to contain solids discharged by pressure or intended to contain liquids. For this test:
                (i) The IBC need not have its closures fitted, except that the IBC must be fitted with its primary bottom closure.
                (ii) The inner receptacle of a composite IBC may be tested without the outer IBC body, provided the test results are not affected.
                (2) Applicable inspection requirements in § 180.352 of this subchapter must be performed on each IBC initially after production.
                (g) Test samples. The IBC manufacturer shall conduct the design qualification and periodic design requalification tests prescribed in this subpart using random samples of IBCs, according to the appropriate test section.
                (h) Selective testing of IBCs. Variation of a tested IBC design type is permitted without further testing, provided selective testing demonstrates an equivalent or greater level of safety than the design type tested and which has been approved by the Associate Administrator.
                (i) Approval of equivalent packagings. An IBC differing from the standards in subpart N of this part, or tested using methods other than those specified in this subpart, may be used if approved by the Associate Administrator. Such IBCs must be shown to be equally effective, and testing methods used must be equivalent.
                (j) Proof of compliance. Notwithstanding the periodic design requalification testing intervals specified in paragraph (e) of this section, the Associate Administrator, or a designated representative, may at any time require demonstration of compliance by a manufacturer, through testing in accordance with this subpart, that packagings meet the requirements of this subpart. As required by the Associate Administrator, or a designated representative, the manufacturer shall either:

                (1) Conduct performance tests or have tests conducted by an independent testing facility, in accordance with this subpart; or
                
                (2) Make a sample IBC available to the Associate Administrator, or a designated representative, for testing in accordance with this subpart.
                (k) Coatings. If an inner treatment or coating of an IBC is required for safety reasons, the manufacturer shall design the IBC so that the treatment or coating retains its protective properties even after withstanding the tests prescribed by this subpart.
                (l) Record retention. Following each design qualification test and each periodic retest on an IBC, a test report must be prepared.
                (1) The test report must be maintained at each location where the packaging is manufactured, certified, and a design qualification test or periodic retest is conducted as follows:

                (2) At 65 percent ±2 percent relative humidity, and at a temperature of 20° ±2 °C (68 °F ±4 °F), or 27 °C ±2 °C (81 °F ±4 °F).
                (b) Average values for temperature and humidity must fall within the limits in paragraph (a) of this section. Short-term fluctuations and measurement limitations may cause individual measurements to vary by up to ±5 percent relative humidity without significant impairment of test reproducibility.
                (c) For purposes of periodic design requalification only, fiberboard IBCs or composite IBCs with fiberboard outer packagings may be at ambient conditions.

                § 178.810
                Drop test.
                (a) General. The drop test must be conducted for the qualification of all IBC design types and performed periodically as specified in § 178.801(e) of this subpart.
                (b) Special preparation for the drop test. (1) Metal, rigid plastic, and composite IBCs intended to contain solids must be filled to not less than 95 percent of their maximum capacity, or if intended to contain liquids, to not less than 98 percent of their maximum capacity. Pressure relief devices must be removed and their apertures plugged or rendered inoperative.
                (2) Fiberboard and wooden IBCs must be filled with a solid material to not less than 95 percent of their maximum capacity; the contents must be evenly distributed.
                (3) Flexible IBCs must be filled to the maximum permissible gross mass; the contents must be evenly distributed.
                (4) Rigid plastic IBCs and composite IBCs with plastic inner receptacles must be conditioned for testing by reducing the temperature of the packaging and its contents to −18 °C (0 °F) or lower. Test liquids must be kept in the liquid state, if necessary, by the addition of anti-freeze. Water/anti-freeze solutions with a minimum specific gravity of 0.95 for testing at −18 °C (0 °F) or lower are considered acceptable test liquids, and may be considered equivalent to water for test purposes. IBCs conditioned in this way are not required to be conditioned in accordance with § 178.802.
                (c) Test method. (1) Samples of all IBC design types must be dropped onto a rigid, non-resilient, smooth, flat and horizontal surface. The point of impact must be the most vulnerable part of the base of the IBC being tested. Following the drop, the IBC must be restored to the upright position for observation.
                (2) IBC design types with a capacity of 0.45 cubic meters (15.9 cubic feet) or less must be subject to an additional drop test.
                (d) Drop height. (1) For all IBCs, drop heights are specified as follows:
                (i) Packing Group I: 1.8 m (5.9 feet).
                (ii) Packing Group II: 1.2 m (3.9 feet).
                (iii) Packing Group III: 0.8 m (2.6 feet).

                (2) Drop tests are to be performed with the solid or liquid to be transported or with a non-hazardous material having essentially the same physical characteristics.
                
                (3) The specific gravity and viscosity of a substituted non-hazardous material used in the drop test for liquids must be similar to the hazardous material intended for transportation. Water also may be used for the liquid drop test under the following conditions:
                (i) Where the substances to be carried have a specific gravity not exceeding 1.2, the drop heights must be those specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section for each IBC design type; and
                (ii) Where the substances to be carried have a specific gravity exceeding 1.2, the drop heights must be as follows:
                (A) Packing Group I: SG × 1.5 m (4.9 feet).
                (B) Packing Group II: SG × 1.0 m (3.3 feet).
                (C) Packing Group III: SG × 0.67 m (2.2 feet).
                (e) Criteria for passing the test. For all IBC design types, there may be no damage which renders the IBC unsafe to be transported for salvage or for disposable, and no loss of contents. The IBC shall be capable of being lifted by an appropriate means until clear of the floor for five minutes. A slight discharge from a closure upon impact is not considered to be a failure of the IBC provided that no further leakage occurs. A slight discharge (e.g., from closures or stitch holes) upon impact is not considered a failure of the flexible IBC provided that no further leakage occurs after the IBC has been raised clear of the ground.

                Bottom lift test.
                (a) General. The bottom lift test must be conducted for the qualification of all IBC design types designed to be lifted from the base.
                (b) Special preparation for the bottom lift test. The IBC must be loaded to 1.25 times its maximum permissible gross mass, the load being evenly distributed.
                (c) Test method. All IBC design types must be raised and lowered twice by a lift truck with the forks centrally positioned and spaced at three quarters of the dimension of the side of entry (unless the points of entry are fixed). The forks must penetrate to three quarters of the direction of entry. The test must be repeated from each possible direction of entry.
                (d) Criteria for passing the test. For all IBC design types designed to be lifted from the base, there may be no permanent deformation which renders the IBC unsafe for transportation and no loss of contents.

                § 178.812
                Top lift test.
                (a) General. The top lift test must be conducted for the qualification of all IBC design types designed to be lifted from the top or, for flexible IBCs, from the side.
                (b) Special preparation for the top lift test. (1) Metal, rigid plastic, and composite IBC design types must be loaded to twice the maximum permissible gross mass with the load being evenly distributed.
                (2) Flexible IBC design types must be filled to six times the maximum net mass, the load being evenly distributed.
                (c) Test method. (1) A metal or flexible IBC must be lifted in the manner for which it is designed until clear of the floor and maintained in that position for a period of five minutes.
                (2) Rigid plastic and composite IBC design types must be:
                (i) Lifted by each pair of diagonally opposite lifting devices, so that the hoisting forces are applied vertically, for a period of five minutes; and
                (ii) Lifted by each pair of diagonally opposite lifting devices, so that the hoisting forces are applied towards the center at 45° to the vertical, for a period of five minutes.
                (3) If not tested as indicated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a flexible IBC design type must be tested as follows:
                (i) Fill the flexible IBC to 95% full with a material representative of the product to be shipped.
                (ii) Suspend the flexible IBC by its lifting devices.

                (iii) Apply a constant downward force through a specially designed platen. The platen will be a minimum of 60% and a maximum of 80% of the cross sectional surface area of the flexible IBC.
                (iv) The combination of the mass of the filled flexible IBC and the force applied through the platen must be a minimum of six times the maximum net mass of the flexible IBC. The test must be conducted for a period of five minutes.
                (v) Other equally effective methods of top lift testing and preparation may be used with approval of the Associate Administrator.
                (d) Criteria for passing the test. For all IBC design types designed to be lifted from the top, there may be no permanent deformation which renders the IBC, including the base pallets when applicable, unsafe for transportation, and no loss of contents.

                § 178.813
                Leakproofness test.
                (a) General. The leakproofness test must be conducted for the qualification of all IBC design types and on all production units intended to contain solids that are loaded or discharged under pressure or intended to contain liquids.
                (b) Special preparation for the leakproofness test. Vented closures must either be replaced by similar non-vented closures or the vent must be sealed. For metal IBC design types, the initial test must be carried out before the fitting of any thermal insulation equipment. The inner receptacle of a composite IBC may be tested without the outer packaging provided the test results are not affected.
                (c) Test method and pressure applied. The leakproofness test must be carried out for a suitable length of time using air at a gauge pressure of not less than 20 kPa (2.9 psig). Leakproofness of IBC design types must be determined by coating the seams and joints with a heavy oil, a soap solution and water, or other methods suitable for the purpose of detecting leaks. Other methods, if at least equally effective, may be used in accordance with appendix B of this part, or if approved by the Associate Administrator, as provided in § 178.801(i)).
                (d) Criterion for passing the test. For all IBC design types intended to contain solids that are loaded or discharged under pressure or intended to contain liquids, there may be no leakage of air from the IBC.

                Hydrostatic pressure test.
                (a) General. The hydrostatic pressure test must be conducted for the qualification of all metal, rigid plastic, and composite IBC design types intended to contain solids that are loaded or discharged under pressure or intended to contain liquids.
                (b) Special preparation for the hydrostatic pressure test. For metal IBCs, the test must be carried out before the fitting of any thermal insulation equipment. For all IBCs, pressure relief devices and vented closures must be removed and their apertures plugged or rendered inoperative.
                (c) Test method. Hydrostatic gauge pressure must be measured at the top of the IBC. The test must be carried out for a period of at least 10 minutes applying a hydrostatic gauge pressure not less than that indicated in paragraph (d) of this section. The IBCs may not be mechanically restrained during the test.
                (d) Hydrostatic gauge pressure applied. (1) For metal IBC design types, 31A, 31B, 31N: 65 kPa gauge pressure (9.4 psig).
                (2) For metal IBC design types 21A, 21B, 21N, 31A, 31B, 31N: 200 kPa (29 psig). For metal IBC design types 31A, 31B and 31N, the tests in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section must be conducted consecutively.
                (3) For metal IBCs design types 21A, 21B, and 21N, for Packing Group I solids: 250 kPa (36 psig) gauge pressure.
                (4) For rigid plastic IBC design types 21H1 and 21H2 and composite IBC design types 21HZ1 and 21HZ2: 75 kPa (11 psig).
                (5) For rigid plastic IBC design types 31H1 and 31H2 and composite IBC design types 31HZ1 and 31HZ2: whichever is the greater of:
                (i) The pressure determined by any one of the following methods:

                (A) The gauge pressure (pressure in the IBC above ambient atmospheric pressure) measured in the IBC at 55 °C (131 °F) multiplied by a safety factor of 1.5. This pressure must be determined on the basis of the IBC being filled and closed to no more than 98 percent capacity at 15 °C (60 °F);
                (B) If absolute pressure (vapor pressure of the hazardous material plus atmospheric pressure) is used, 1.5 multiplied by the vapor pressure of the hazardous material at 55 °C (131 °F) minus 100 kPa (14.5 psi). If this method is chosen, the hydrostatic test pressure applied must be at least 100 kPa gauge pressure (14.5 psig); or
                (C) If absolute pressure (vapor pressure of the hazardous material plus atmospheric pressure) is used, 1.75 multiplied by the vapor pressure of the hazardous material at 50 °C (122 °F) minus 100 kPa (14.5 psi). If this method is chosen, the hydrostatic test pressure applied must be at least 100 kPa gauge pressure (14.5 psig); or
                (ii) Twice the greater of: (A) The static pressure of the hazardous material on the bottom of the IBC filled to 98 percent capacity; or
                (B) The static pressure of water on the bottom of the IBC filled to 98 percent capacity.
                (e) Criteria for passing the test(s). (1) For metal IBCs, subjected to the 65 kPa (9.4 psig) test pressure specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, there may be no leakage or permanent deformation that would make the IBC unsafe for transportation.
                (2) For metal IBCs intended to contain liquids, when subjected to the 200 kPa (29 psig) and the 250 kPa (36 psig) test pressures specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, respectively, there may be no leakage.
                (3) For rigid plastic IBC types 21H1, 21H2, 31H1, and 31H2, and composite IBC types 21HZ1, 21HZ2, 31HZ1, and 31HZ2, there may be no leakage and no permanent deformation which renders the IBC unsafe for transportation.

                § 178.815
                Stacking test.
                (a) General. The stacking test must be conducted for the qualification of all IBC design types intended to be stacked.
                (b) Special preparation for the stacking test. (1) All IBCs except flexible IBC design types must be loaded to their maximum permissible gross mass.
                (2) The flexible IBC must be filled to not less than 95 percent of its capacity and to its maximum net mass, with the load being evenly distributed.
                (c) Test method. (1) Design Qualification Testing. All IBCs must be placed on their base on level, hard ground and subjected to a uniformly distributed superimposed test load for a period of at least five minutes (see paragraph (c)(5) of this section).
                (2) Fiberboard, wooden and composite IBCs with outer packagings constructed of other than plastic materials must be subject to the test for 24 hours.
                (3) Rigid plastic IBC types and composite IBC types with plastic outer packagings (11HH1, 11HH2, 21HH1, 21HH2, 31HH1 and 31HH2) which bear the stacking load must be subjected to the test for 28 days at 40 °C (104 °F).
                (4) For all IBCs, the load must be applied by one of the following methods:
                (i) One or more IBCs of the same type loaded to their maximum permissible gross mass and stacked on the test IBC;
                (ii) The calculated superimposed test load weight loaded on either a flat plate or a reproduction of the base of the IBC, which is stacked on the test IBC.
                (5) Calculation of superimposed test load. For all IBCs, the load to be placed on the IBC must be 1.8 times the combined maximum permissible gross mass of the number of similar IBCs that may be stacked on top of the IBC during transportation.
                (d) Periodic Retest. (1) The package must be tested in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section; or
                

                (2) The packaging may be tested using a dynamic compression testing machine. The test must be conducted at room temperature on an empty, unsealed packaging. The test sample must be centered on the bottom platen of the testing machine. The top platen must be lowered until it comes in contact with the test sample. Compression must be applied end to end. The speed of the compression tester must be one-half inch plus or minus one-fourth inch per minute. An initial preload of 50 pounds must be applied to ensure a definite contact between the test sample and the platens. The distance between the platens at this time must be recorded as zero deformation. The force “A” then to be applied must be calculated using the applicable formula:
                
                Liquids: A = (1.8)(n − 1) [w + (s × v × 8.3 × .98)] × 1.5;
                or
                
                Solids: A = (1.8)(n − 1) [w + (s × v × 8.3 × .95)] × 1.5
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  A = applied load in pounds.
                  n = maximum number of IBCs being stacked during transportation.
                  w = maximum weight of one empty container in pounds.
                  s = specific gravity (liquids) or density (solids) of the lading.
                  v = actual capacity of container (rated capacity + outage) in gallons.
                  and:
                  8.3 corresponds to the weight in pounds of 1.0 gallon of water.
                  1.5 is a compensation factor converting the static load of the stacking test into a load suitable for dynamic compression testing.
                
                
                (e) Criteria for passing the test. (1) For metal, rigid plastic, and composite IBCs, there may be no permanent deformation, which renders the IBC unsafe for transportation, and no loss of contents.
                (2) For fiberboard and wooden IBCs, there may be no loss of contents and no permanent deformation, which renders the whole IBC, including the base pallet, unsafe for transportation.
                (3) For flexible IBCs, there may be no deterioration, which renders the IBC unsafe for transportation, and no loss of contents.
                (4) For the dynamic compression test, a container passes the test if, after application of the required load, there is no permanent deformation to the IBC, which renders the whole IBC, including the base pallet, unsafe for transportation; in no case may the maximum deflection exceed one inch.

                Topple test.
                (a) General. The topple test must be conducted for the qualification of all flexible IBC design types.
                (b) Special preparation for the topple test. The flexible IBC must be filled to not less than 95 percent of its capacity and to its maximum net mass, with the load being evenly distributed.
                (c) Test method. A flexible IBC must be toppled onto any part of its top upon a rigid, non-resilient, smooth, flat, and horizontal surface.
                (d) Topple height. For all flexible IBCs, the topple height is specified as follows:
                (1) Packing Group I: 1.8 m (5.9 feet).
                (2) Packing Group II: 1.2 m (3.9 feet).
                (3) Packing Group III: 0.8 m (2.6 feet).
                (e) Criteria for passing the test. For all flexible IBCs, there may be no loss of contents. A slight discharge (e.g., from closures or stitch holes) upon impact is not considered to be a failure, provided no further leakage occurs.

                § 178.817
                Righting test.
                (a) General. The righting test must be conducted for the qualification of all flexible IBCs designed to be lifted from the top or side.
                (b) Special preparation for the righting test. The flexible IBC must be filled to not less than 95 percent of its capacity and to its maximum net mass, with the load being evenly distributed.
                (c) Test method. The flexible IBC, lying on its side, must be lifted at a speed of at least 0.1 m/second (0.33 ft/s) to an upright position, clear of the floor, by one lifting device, or by two lifting devices when four are provided.
                (d) Criterion for passing the test. For all flexible IBCs, there may be no damage to the IBC or its lifting devices which renders the IBC unsafe for transportation or handling.
                [Amdt. 178-103, 59 FR 38074, July 26, 1994, as amended at 66 FR 45386, Aug. 28, 2001]
              
              
                § 178.818
                Tear test.
                (a) General. The tear test must be conducted for the qualification of all flexible IBC design types.
                (b) Special preparation for the tear test. The flexible IBC must be filled to not less than 95 percent of its capacity and to its maximum net mass, the load being evenly distributed.
                (c) Test method. Once the IBC is placed on the ground, a 100-mm (4-inch) knife score, completely penetrating the wall of a wide face, is made at a 45° angle to the principal axis of the IBC, halfway between the bottom surface and the top level of the contents. The IBC must then be subjected to a uniformly distributed superimposed load equivalent to twice the maximum net mass. The load must be applied for at least five minutes. An IBC which is designed to be lifted from the top or the side must, after removal of the superimposed load, be lifted clear of the floor and maintained in that position for a period of five minutes.
                (d) Criterion for passing the test. The IBC passes the tear test if the cut does not propagate more than 25 percent of its original length.

                § 178.819
                Vibration test.
                (a) General. The vibration test must be conducted for the qualification of all rigid IBC design types. Flexible IBC design types must be capable of withstanding the vibration test.
                (b) Test method. (1) A sample IBC, selected at random, must be filled and closed as for shipment. IBCs intended for liquids may be tested using water as the filling material for the vibration test.
                (2) The sample IBC must be placed on a vibrating platform with a vertical or rotary double-amplitude (peak-to-peak displacement) of one inch. The IBC must be constrained horizontally to prevent it from falling off the platform, but must be left free to move vertically and bounce.
                (3) The test must be performed for one hour at a frequency that causes the package to be raised from the vibrating platform to such a degree that a piece of material of approximately 1.6-mm (0.063-inch) thickness (such as steel strapping or paperboard) can be passed between the bottom of the IBC and the platform. Other methods at least equally effective may be used (see § 178.801(i)).
                (c) Criteria for passing the test. An IBC passes the vibration test if there is no rupture or leakage.

                (b) A rigid plastic Large Packaging must be manufactured from plastic material of known specifications and be of a strength relative to its capacity and to the service it is required to perform. In addition to conformance to § 173.24 of this subchapter, plastic materials must be resistant to aging and to degradation caused by ultraviolet radiation.
                (1) If protection against ultraviolet radiation is necessary, it must be provided by the addition of a pigment or inhibiter such as carbon black to plastic materials. These additives must be compatible with the contents and remain effective throughout the life of the plastic Large Packaging body. Where use is made of carbon black, pigments or inhibitors, other than those used in the manufacture of the tested design type, retesting may be omitted if changes in the carbon black content, the pigment content or the inhibitor content do not adversely affect the physical properties of the material of construction.
                (2) Additives may be included in the composition of the plastic material to improve the resistance to aging or to serve other purposes, provided they do not adversely affect the physical or chemical properties of the material of construction.

                (3) No used material other than production residues or regrind from the same manufacturing process may be used in the manufacture of rigid plastic Large Packagings.
                
                (c) Rigid plastic Large Packagings:
                (1) May not have a volumetric capacity greater than 3,000 L (793 gallons); and
                (2) May not have a volumetric capacity less than 450 L (119 gallons).

              Subpart Q—Testing of Large Packagings
              
                Source:
                75 FR 5400, Feb. 2, 2010, unless otherwise noted.
              
              
                § 178.950
                Purpose and scope.
                This subpart prescribes certain testing requirements for Large Packagings identified in subpart P of this part.
              
              
                § 178.955
                General requirements.
                (a) General. The test procedures prescribed in this subpart are intended to ensure that Large Packagings containing hazardous materials can withstand normal conditions of transportation. These test procedures are considered minimum requirements. Each packaging must be manufactured and assembled so as to be capable of successfully passing the prescribed tests and to conform to the requirements of § 173.24 of this subchapter while in transportation.
                (b) Responsibility. The Large Packaging manufacturer is responsible for ensuring each Large Packaging is capable of passing the prescribed tests. To the extent a Large Packaging's assembly function, including final closure, is performed by the person who offers a hazardous material for transportation, that person is responsible for performing the function in accordance with §§ 173.22 and 178.2 of this subchapter.
                (c) Definitions. For the purpose of this subpart:
                (1) Large packaging design type refers to a Large Packaging which does not differ in structural design, size, material of construction and packing.
                (2) Design qualification testing is the performance of the drop, stacking, and bottom-lift or top-lift tests, as applicable, prescribed in this subpart, for each different Large Packaging design type, at the start of production of that packaging.
                (3) Periodic design requalification test is the performance of the applicable tests specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section on a Large Packaging design type, to requalify the design for continued production at the frequency specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
                (4) Production inspection is the inspection, which must initially be conducted on each newly manufactured Large Packaging.
                (5) Different Large Packaging design type is one which differs from a previously qualified Large Packaging design type in structural design, size, material of construction, wall thickness, or manner of construction, but does not include:
                (i) A packaging which differs in surface treatment;
                (ii) A rigid plastic Large Packaging, which differs with regard to additives used to comply with § 178.925(b) or § 178.940(b);

                (iii) A packaging which differs only in its lesser external dimensions (i.e., height, width, length) provided materials of construction and material thickness or fabric weight remain the same;
                (6) Remanufactured Large Packaging is a metal or rigid Large Packaging that is produced as a UN type from a non-UN type or is converted from one UN design type to another UN design type. Remanufactured Large Packagings are subject to the same requirements of this subchapter that apply to new Large Packagings of the same type.
                (7) Reused Large Packaging is a Large Packaging intended to be refilled and has been examined and found free of defects affecting its ability to withstand the performance tests. See also § 173.36(c) of this subchapter.
                (d) Design qualification testing. The packaging manufacturer must achieve successful test results for the design qualification testing at the start of production of each new or different Large Packaging design type. Application of the certification mark by the manufacturer constitutes certification that the Large Packaging design type passed the prescribed tests in this subpart.
                
                (e) Periodic design requalification testing. (1) Periodic design requalification must be conducted on each qualified Large Packaging design type if the manufacturer is to maintain authorization for continued production. The Large Packaging manufacturer must achieve successful test results for the periodic design requalification at sufficient frequency to ensure each packaging produced by the manufacturer is capable of passing the design qualification tests. Design requalification tests must be conducted at least once every 24 months.
                (2) Changes in the frequency of design requalification testing specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section are authorized if approved by the Associate Administrator.
                (f) Test samples. The manufacturer must conduct the design qualification and periodic tests prescribed in this subpart using random samples of packagings, in the numbers specified in the appropriate test section.
                (g) Selective testing. The selective testing of Large Packagings, which differ only in minor respects from a tested type is permitted as described in this section. For air transport, Large Packagings must comply with § 173.27(c)(1) and (c)(2) of this subchapter. Variations are permitted in inner packagings of a tested Large Packaging, without further testing of the package, provided an equivalent level of performance is maintained and the methodology used to determine that the inner packaging, including closure, maintains an equivalent level of performance is documented in writing by the person certifying compliance with this paragraph and retained in accordance with paragraph (l) of this section. Permitted variations are as follows:
                (1) Inner packagings of equivalent or smaller size may be used provided—

                (i) The inner packagings are of similar design to the tested inner packagings (i.e., shape—round, rectangular, etc.);
                (ii) The material of construction of the inner packagings (glass, plastic, metal, etc.) offers resistance to impact and stacking forces equal to or greater than that of the originally tested inner packaging;
                (iii) The inner packagings have the same or smaller openings and the closure is of similar design (e.g., screw cap, friction lid, etc.);
                (iv) Sufficient additional cushioning material is used to take up void spaces and to prevent significant movement of the inner packagings;
                (v) Inner packagings are oriented within the outer packaging in the same manner as in the tested package; and
                (vi) The gross mass of the package does not exceed that originally tested.
                (2) A lesser number of the tested inner packagings, or of the alternative types of inner packagings identified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, may be used provided sufficient cushioning is added to fill void space(s) and to prevent significant movement of the inner packagings.
                (h) Approval of equivalent packagings. A Large Packaging differing from standards in subpart P of this part, or tested using methods other than those specified in this subpart, may be used if approved by the Associate Administrator. The Large Packagings and testing methods must be shown to have an equivalent level of safety.
                (i) Proof of compliance. In addition to the periodic design requalification testing intervals specified in paragraph (e) of this section, the Associate Administrator, or a designated representative, may at any time require demonstration of compliance by a manufacturer, through testing in accordance with this subpart, to ensure packagings meet the requirements of this subpart. As required by the Associate Administrator, or a designated representative, the manufacturer must either:
                (1) Conduct performance tests or have tests conducted by an independent testing facility, in accordance with this subpart; or
                (2) Make a sample Large Packaging available to the Associate Administrator, or a designated representative, for testing in accordance with this subpart.
                (j) Record retention. Following each design qualification test and each periodic retest on a Large Packaging, a test report must be prepared.

                (1) The test report must be maintained at each location where the packaging is manufactured, certified, and a design qualification test or periodic retest is conducted as follows:
                
                  
                    Responsible party
                    Duration

                § 178.960
                Preparation of Large Packagings for testing.
                (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, each Large Packaging and package must be closed in preparation for testing and tests must be carried out in the same manner as if prepared for transportation, including inner packagings. All closures must be installed using proper techniques and torques.

                (b) For the drop and stacking test, inner receptacles must be filled to not less than 95 percent of maximum capacity (see § 171.8 of this subchapter) in the case of solids and not less than 98 percent of maximum in the case of liquids. Bags must be filled to the maximum mass at which they may be used. For Large Packagings where the inner packagings are designed to carry liquids and solids, separate testing is required for both liquid and solid contents. The material to be transported in the packagings may be replaced by a non-hazardous material, except for chemical compatibility testing or where this would invalidate the results of the tests.
                (c) If the material to be transported is replaced for test purposes by a non-hazardous material, the material used must be of the same or higher specific gravity as the material to be carried, and its other physical properties (grain, size, viscosity) which might influence the results of the required tests must correspond as closely as possible to those of the hazardous material to be transported. It is permissible to use additives, such as bags of lead shot, to achieve the requisite total package mass, so long as they do not affect the test results.
                (d) Paper or fiberboard Large Packagings must be conditioned for at least 24 hours immediately prior to testing in an atmosphere maintained—

                (1) At 50 percent ±2 percent relative humidity, and at a temperature of 23 °C ±2 °C (73 °F ±4 °F). Average values should fall within these limits. Short-term fluctuations and measurement limitations may cause individual measurements to vary by up to ±5 percent relative humidity without significant impairment of test reproducibility;
                (2) At 65 percent ±2 percent relative humidity, and at a temperature of 20 °C ±2 °C (68 °F ±4 °F), or 27 °C ±2 °C (81 °F ±4 °F). Average values should fall within these limits. Short-term fluctuations and measurement limitations may cause individual measurements to vary by up to ±5 percent relative humidity without significant impairment of test reproducibility; or
                (3) For testing at periodic intervals only (i.e., other than initial design qualification testing), at ambient conditions.
              
              
                § 178.965
                Drop test.
                (a) General. The drop test must be conducted for the qualification of all Large Packaging design types and performed periodically as specified in § 178.955(e) of this subpart.
                (b) Special preparation for the drop test. Large Packagings must be filled in accordance with § 178.960.
                (c) Conditioning. Rigid plastic Large Packagings and Large Packagings with plastic inner receptacles must be conditioned for testing by reducing the temperature of the packaging and its contents to −18 °C (0 °F) or lower. Test liquids must be kept in the liquid state, if necessary, by the addition of anti-freeze. Water/anti-freeze solutions with a minimum specific gravity of 0.95 for testing at −18 °C (0 °F) or lower are considered acceptable test liquids, and may be considered equivalent to water for test purposes. Large Packagings conditioned in this way are not required to be conditioned in accordance with § 178.960(d).
                (d) Test method. (1) Samples of all Large Packaging design types must be dropped onto a rigid, non-resilient, smooth, flat and horizontal surface. The point of impact must be the most vulnerable part of the base of the Large Packaging being tested. Following the drop, the Large Packaging must be restored to the upright position for observation.
                (2) Large Packaging design types with a capacity of 0.45 cubic meters (15.9 cubic feet) or less must be subject to an additional drop test.
                (e) Drop height. (1) For all Large Packagings, drop heights are specified as follows:
                (i) Packing group I: 1.8 m (5.9 feet)
                (ii) Packing group II: 1.2 m (3.9 feet)
                (iii) Packing group III: 0.8 m (2.6 feet)
                (2) Drop tests are to be performed with the solid or liquid to be transported or with a non-hazardous material having essentially the same physical characteristics.
                (3) The specific gravity and viscosity of a substituted non-hazardous material used in the drop test for liquids must be similar to the hazardous material intended for transportation. Water also may be used for the liquid drop test under the following conditions:
                (i) Where the substances to be carried have a specific gravity not exceeding 1.2, the drop heights must be those specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section for each Large Packaging design type; and
                (ii) Where the substances to be carried have a specific gravity exceeding 1.2, the drop heights must be as follows:
                (A) Packing Group I: SG × 1.5 m (4.9 feet).
                (B) Packing Group II: SG × 1.0 m (3.3 feet).
                (C) Packing Group III: SG × 0.67 m (2.2 feet).
                (f) Criteria for passing the test. For all Large Packaging design types there may be no loss of the filling substance from inner packaging(s) or article(s). Ruptures are not permitted in Large Packaging for articles of Class 1 which permit the spillage of loose explosive substances or articles from the Large Packaging. Where a Large Packaging undergoes a drop test, the sample passes the test if the entire contents are retained even if the closure is no longer sift-proof.

                Bottom lift test.
                (a) General. The bottom lift test must be conducted for the qualification of all Large Packagings design types designed to be lifted from the base.
                (b) Special preparation for the bottom lift test. The Large Packaging must be loaded to 1.25 times its maximum permissible gross mass, the load being evenly distributed.
                (c) Test method. All Large Packaging design types must be raised and lowered twice by a lift truck with the forks centrally positioned and spaced at three quarters of the dimension of the side of entry (unless the points of entry are fixed). The forks must penetrate to three quarters of the direction of entry.
                (d) Criteria for passing the test. For all Large Packagings design types designed to be lifted from the base, there may be no permanent deformation which renders the Large Packaging unsafe for transport and there must be no loss of contents.
              
              
                § 178.975
                Top lift test.
                (a) General. The top lift test must be conducted for the qualification of all of Large Packagings design types to be lifted from the top or, for flexible Large Packagings, from the side.
                (b) Special preparation for the top lift test. (1) Metal and rigid plastic Large Packagings design types must be loaded to twice its maximum permissible gross mass.
                (2) Flexible Large Packaging design types must be filled to six times the maximum permissible gross mass, the load being evenly distributed.
                (c) Test method. (1) A Large Packaging must be lifted in the manner for which it is designed until clear of the floor and maintained in that position for a period of five minutes.
                (2) Rigid plastic Large Packaging design types must be:
                (i) Lifted by each pair of diagonally opposite lifting devices, so that the hoisting forces are applied vertically for a period of five minutes; and
                (ii) Lifted by each pair of diagonally opposite lifting devices so that the hoisting forces are applied towards the center at 45° to the vertical, for a period of five minutes.
                (3) If not tested as indicated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a flexible Large Packaging design type must be tested as follows:
                (i) Fill the flexible Large Packaging to 95% full with a material representative of the product to be shipped.
                (ii) Suspend the flexible Large Packaging by its lifting devices.
                (iii) Apply a constant downward force through a specially designed platen. The platen will be a minimum of 60 percent and a maximum of 80 percent of the cross sectional surface area of the flexible Large Packaging.
                (iv) The combination of the mass of the filled flexible Large Packaging and the force applied through the platen must be a minimum of six times the maximum net mass of the flexible Large Packaging. The test must be conducted for a period of five minutes.
                (v) Other equally effective methods of top lift testing and preparation may be used with approval of the Associate Administrator.
                (d) Criterion for passing the test. For all Large Packagings design types designed to be lifted from the top, there may be no permanent deformation which renders the Large Packagings unsafe for transport and no loss of contents.
              
              
                § 178.980
                Stacking test.
                (a) General. The stacking test must be conducted for the qualification of all Large Packagings design types intended to be stacked.
                (b) Special preparation for the stacking test. (1) All Large Packagings except flexible Large Packaging design types must be loaded to their maximum permissible gross mass.
                (2) Flexible Large Packagings must be filled to not less than 95 percent of their capacity and to their maximum net mass, with the load being evenly distributed.
                (c) Test method. (1) All Large Packagings must be placed on their base on level, hard ground and subjected to a uniformly distributed superimposed test load for a period of at least five minutes (see paragraph (c)(5) of this section).
                (2) Fiberboard and wooden Large Packagings must be subjected to the test for 24 hours.
                (3) Rigid plastic Large Packagings which bear the stacking load must be subjected to the test for 28 days at 40 °C (104 °F).

                (4) For all Large Packagings, the load must be applied by one of the following methods:
                
                (i) One or more Large Packagings of the same type loaded to their maximum permissible gross mass and stacked on the test Large Packaging;
                (ii) The calculated superimposed test load weight loaded on either a flat plate or a reproduction of the base of the Large Packaging, which is stacked on the test Large Packaging; or
                (5) Calculation of superimposed test load. For all Large Packagings, the load to be placed on the Large Packaging must be 1.8 times the combined maximum permissible gross mass of the number of similar Large Packaging that may be stacked on top of the Large Packaging during transportation.
                (d) Periodic Retest. (1) The package must be tested in accordance with § 178.980(c) of this subpart; or

                (2) The packaging may be tested using a dynamic compression testing machine. The test must be conducted at room temperature on an empty, unsealed packaging. The test sample must be centered on the bottom platen of the testing machine. The top platen must be lowered until it comes in contact with the test sample. Compression must be applied end to end. The speed of the compression tester must be one-half inch plus or minus one-fourth inch per minute. An initial preload of 50 pounds must be applied to ensure a definite contact between the test sample and the platens. The distance between the platens at this time must be recorded as zero deformation. The force “A” to then be applied must be calculated using the applicable formula:
                
                Liquids: A = (1.8)(n−1) [w + (s × v × 8.3 × .98)] × 1.5;
                
                or
                
                Solids: A = (1.8)(n−1) [w + (s × v × 8.3 × .95)] × 1.5
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  A = applied load in pounds.
                  n = maximum number of Large Packagings that may be stacked during transportation.
                  w = maximum weight of one empty container in pounds.
                  s = specific gravity (liquids) or density (solids) of the lading.
                  v = actual capacity of container (rated capacity + outage) in gallons.
                  and:
                  8.3 corresponds to the weight in pounds of 1.0 gallon of water.
                  1.5 is a compensation factor that converts the static load of the stacking test into a load suitable for dynamic compression testing.
                
                
                (e) Criterion for passing the test. (1) For metal or rigid plastic Large Packagings, there may be no permanent deformation which renders the Large Packaging unsafe for transportation and no loss of contents.
                (2) For fiberboard or wooden Large Packagings, there may be no loss of contents and no permanent deformation that renders the whole Large Packaging, including the base pallet, unsafe for transportation.
                (3) For flexible Large Packagings, there may be no deterioration which renders the Large Packaging unsafe for transportation and no loss of contents.
                (4) For the dynamic compression test, a container passes the test if, after application of the required load, there is no permanent deformation to the Large Packaging which renders the whole Large Packaging; including the base pallet, unsafe for transportation; in no case may the maximum deflection exceed one inch.

                § 178.985
                Vibration test.
                (a) General. All rigid Large Packaging and flexible Large Packaging design types must be capable of withstanding the vibration test.
                (b) Test method. (1) A sample Large Packaging, selected at random, must be filled and closed as for shipment. Large Packagings intended for liquids may be tested using water as the filling material for the vibration test.
                (2) The sample Large Packaging must be placed on a vibrating platform that has a vertical or rotary double-amplitude (peak-to-peak displacement) of one inch. The Large Packaging must be constrained horizontally to prevent it from falling off the platform, but must be left free to move vertically and bounce.

                (3) The sample Large Packaging must be placed on a vibrating platform that has a vertical double-amplitude (peak-to-peak displacement) of one inch. The Large Packaging must be constrained horizontally to prevent it from falling off the platform, but must be left free to move vertically and bounce.

                (4) The test must be performed for one hour at a frequency that causes the package to be raised from the vibrating platform to such a degree that a piece of material of approximately 1.6-mm (0.063-inch) in thickness (such as steel strapping or paperboard) can be passed between the bottom of the Large Packaging and the platform. Other methods at least equally effective may be used (see § 178.801(i)).
                (c) Criterion for passing the test. A Large Packaging passes the vibration test if there is no rupture or leakage.

                § 178.1030
                Purpose and scope.
                This subpart prescribes certain testing requirements for Flexible Bulk Containers identified in subpart R of this part.
              
              
                § 178.1035
                General requirements.
                (a) General. The test procedures prescribed in this subpart are intended to ensure that Flexible Bulk Containers containing hazardous materials can withstand normal conditions of transportation. These test procedures are considered minimum requirements. Each packaging must be manufactured and assembled so as to be capable of successfully passing the prescribed tests and to conform to the requirements of § 173.24 of this subchapter while in transportation.
                (b) Responsibility. The Flexible Bulk Container manufacturer is responsible for ensuring each Flexible Bulk Containers is capable of passing the prescribed tests. To the extent a Flexible Bulk Container's assembly function, including final closure, is performed by the person who offers a hazardous material for transportation, that person is responsible for performing the function in accordance with §§ 173.22 and 178.2 of this subchapter.
                (c) Definitions. For the purpose of this subpart:
                (1) Flexible Bulk Container design type refers to a Flexible Bulk Container that does not differ in structural design, size, material of construction and packing.
                (2) Design qualification testing is the performance of the drop, topple, righting, tear, stacking, and top-lift tests prescribed in this subpart, for each different Flexible Bulk Container design type, at the start of production of that packaging.
                (3) Periodic design requalification test is the performance of the applicable tests specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section on a Flexible Bulk Container design type, to requalify the design for continued production at the frequency specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
                (4) Production inspection is the inspection that must initially be conducted on each newly manufactured Flexible Bulk Container.
                (5) Different Flexible Bulk Container design type is one that differs from a previously qualified Flexible Bulk Container design type in structural design, size, material of construction, wall thickness, or manner of construction, but does not include:
                (i) A packaging that differs in surface treatment;

                (ii) A packaging that differs only in its lesser external dimensions (i.e., height, width, length) provided materials of construction and material thickness or fabric weight remain the same;
                (d) Design qualification testing. The packaging manufacturer must achieve successful test results for the design qualification testing at the start of production of each new or different Flexible Bulk Container design type. Application of the certification mark by the manufacturer constitutes certification that the Flexible Bulk Container design type passed the prescribed tests in this subpart.
                (e) Periodic design requalification testing. (1) Periodic design requalification must be conducted on each qualified Flexible Bulk Container design type if the manufacturer is to maintain authorization for continued production. The Flexible Bulk Container manufacturer must achieve successful test results for the periodic design requalification at sufficient frequency to ensure each packaging produced by the manufacturer is capable of passing the design qualification tests. Design requalification tests must be conducted at least once every 24 months.
                (2) Changes in the frequency of design requalification testing specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section are authorized if approved by the Associate Administrator.
                (f) Test samples. The manufacturer must conduct the design qualification and periodic tests prescribed in this subpart using random samples of packagings, in the numbers specified in the appropriate test section.
                (g) Proof of compliance. In addition to the periodic design requalification testing intervals specified in paragraph (e) of this section, the Associate Administrator, or a designated representative, may at any time require demonstration of compliance by a manufacturer, through testing in accordance with this subpart, to ensure packagings meet the requirements of this subpart. As required by the Associate Administrator, or a designated representative, the manufacturer must either:
                (1) Conduct performance tests or have tests conducted by an independent testing facility, in accordance with this subpart; or
                (2) Make a sample Flexible Bulk Container available to the Associate Administrator, or a designated representative, for testing in accordance with this subpart.
                (h) Record retention. Following each design qualification test and each periodic retest on a Flexible Bulk Container, a test report must be prepared. The test report must be maintained at each location where the Flexible Bulk Container is manufactured and each location where the design qualification tests are conducted, for as long as the Flexible Bulk Container is produced and for at least two years thereafter, and at each location where the periodic retests are conducted until such tests are successfully performed again and a new test report produced. In addition, a copy of the test report must be maintained by a person certifying compliance with this part. The test report must be made available to a user of a Flexible Bulk Container or a representative of the Department upon request. The test report, at a minimum, must contain the following information:
                (1) Name and address of test facility;
                (2) Name and address of applicant (where appropriate);
                (3) A unique test report identification;
                (4) Date of the test report;
                (5) Manufacturer of the packaging;

                (6) Description of the flexible bulk container design type (e.g., dimensions materials, closures, thickness, etc.), including methods of manufacture (e.g., blow molding) and which may include drawing(s) and/or photograph(s);
                (7) Maximum capacity;
                (8) Characteristics of test contents (e.g., particle size for solids);
                (9) Mathematical calculations performed to conduct and document testing (e.g., drop height, test capacity, outage requirements, etc.);
                (10) Test descriptions and results; and
                (11) Signature with the name and title of signatory.
              
              
                § 178.1040
                Preparation of Flexible Bulk Containers for testing.
                (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, each Flexible Bulk Container must be closed in preparation for testing and tests must be carried out in the same manner as if prepared for transportation. All closures must be installed using proper techniques and torques.
                (b) If the material to be transported is replaced for test purposes by a non-hazardous material, the physical properties (grain, size, viscosity) of the replacement material used that might influence the results of the required tests must correspond as closely as possible to those of the hazardous material to be transported. It is permissible to use additives, such as bags of lead shot, to achieve the requisite total package mass, so long as they do not affect the test results.

                (a) General. The drop test must be conducted for the qualification of all Flexible Bulk Container design types and performed periodically as specified in § 178.1035(e) of this subpart.
                (b) Special preparation for the drop test. Flexible Bulk Containers must be filled to their maximum permissible gross mass.
                (c) Test method. (1) A sample of all Flexible Bulk Container design types must be dropped onto a rigid, non-resilient, smooth, flat and horizontal surface. This test surface must be large enough to be immovable during testing and sufficiently large enough to ensure that the test Flexible Bulk Container falls entirely upon the surface. The test surface must be kept free from local defects capable of influencing the test results.
                (2) Following the drop, the Flexible Bulk Container must be restored to the upright position for observation.
                (d) Drop height. (1) For all Flexible Bulk Containers, drop heights are specified as follows: Packing group III: 0.8 m (2.6 feet)
                (2) Drop tests are to be performed with the solid to be transported or with a non-hazardous material having essentially the same physical characteristics.
                (e) Criteria for passing the test. For all Flexible Bulk Container design types there may be no loss of the filling substance. However a slight discharge (e.g., from closures or stitch holes) upon impact is not considered a failure of the Flexible Bulk Container provided that no further leakage occurs after the container has been restored to the upright position.
              
              
                § 178.1050
                Top lift test.
                (a) General. The top lift test must be conducted for the qualification of all of Flexible Bulk Containers design types to be lifted from the top.
                (b) Special preparation for the top lift test. Flexible Bulk Container design types must be filled to six times the maximum permissible gross mass, the load being evenly distributed.
                (c) Test method. (1) A Flexible Bulk Container must be lifted in the manner for which it is designed until clear of the floor and maintained in that position for a period of five minutes.
                (2) If not tested as indicated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a Flexible Bulk Container design type must be tested as follows:
                (i) Fill the Flexible Bulk Container to 95% full with a material representative of the product to be shipped.
                (ii) Suspend the Flexible Bulk Container by its lifting devices.
                (iii) Apply a constant downward force through a specially designed platen. The platen will be a minimum of 60 percent and a maximum of 80 percent of the cross sectional surface area of the Flexible Bulk Container.

                (iv) The combination of the mass of the filled Flexible Bulk Container and the force applied through the platen must be a minimum of six times the maximum net mass of the Flexible Bulk Container. The test must be conducted for a period of five minutes.
                (v) Other equally effective methods of top lift testing and preparation may be used with approval of the Associate Administrator.
                (d) Criteria for passing the test. For all Flexible Bulk Containers design types designed to be lifted from the top, there may be no damage to the Flexible Bulk Container or its lifting devices that renders the Flexible Bulk Container unsafe for transport, and no loss of contents.
              
              
                § 178.1055
                Stacking test.
                (a) General. The stacking test must be conducted for the qualification of all Flexible Bulk Containers design types.
                (b) Special preparation for the stacking test. All Flexible Bulk Containers design types must be loaded to their maximum permissible gross mass.
                (c) Test method. (1) All Flexible Bulk Containers must be placed on their base on level, hard ground and subjected to a uniformly distributed superimposed test load that is four times the design type maximum gross weight for a period of at least twenty-four hours.
                (2) For all Flexible Bulk Containers, the load must be applied by one of the following methods:
                (i) Four Flexible Bulk Containers of the same type loaded to their maximum permissible gross mass and stacked on the test Flexible Bulk Container;
                (ii) The calculated superimposed test load weight loaded on either a flat plate or a reproduction of the base of the Flexible Bulk Container, which is stacked on the test Flexible Bulk Container.
                (d) Criteria for passing the test. There may be no deterioration that renders the Flexible Bulk Container unsafe for transportation and no loss of contents during the test or after removal of the test load.
              
              
                § 178.1060
                Topple test.
                (a) General. The topple test must be conducted for the qualification of all Flexible Bulk Containers design types.
                (b) Special preparation for the topple test. Flexible Bulk Container design types must be filled to their maximum permissible gross mass, the load being evenly distributed.
                (c) Test method. Samples of all Flexible Bulk Container design types must be toppled onto any part of its top by lifting the side furthest from the drop edge upon a rigid, non-resilient, smooth, flat and horizontal surface. This test surface must be large enough to be immovable during testing and sufficiently large enough to ensure that the test Flexible Bulk Container falls entirely upon the surface. The test surface must be kept free from local defects capable of influencing the test results.
                (d) Topple height. (1) For all Flexible Bulk Containers, topple heights are specified as follows: Packing group III: 0.8 m (2.6 feet).
                (e) Criterion for passing the test. For all Flexible Bulk Container design types there may be no loss of the filling substance. However a slight discharge (e.g., from closures or stitch holes) upon impact is not considered a failure of the Flexible Bulk Container.
              
              
                § 178.1065
                Righting test.
                (a) General. The righting test must be conducted for the qualification of all Flexible Bulk Containers design types designed to be lifted from the top or side.
                (b) Special preparation for the righting test. Flexible Bulk Container design types must be filled to not less than 95% of their capacity and to their maximum permissible gross mass, the load being evenly distributed.
                (c) Test method. A sample Flexible Bulk Container design type must be tested; the Flexible Bulk Container should start lying on its side and then must be lifted at a speed of at least 0.1m/s (0.328 ft/s) to an upright position clear of the floor, by no more than half of the lifting devices.
                (d) Criterion for passing the test. For all Flexible Bulk Container design types there must be no damage that renders the Flexible Bulk Container unsafe for transport or handling.
              
              
                § 178.1070
                Tear test.
                (a) General. The tear test must be conducted for the qualification of all of Flexible Bulk Containers design types.
                
                (b) Special preparation for the tear test. Flexible Bulk Container design types must be filled its maximum permissible gross mass, the load being evenly distributed.
                (c) Test method. (1) A Flexible Bulk Container design type must be placed on the ground and a 300 mm (11.9 in) cut shall be made. This 300 mm (11.9 in) cut must:
                (i) Completely penetrate all layers of the Flexible Bulk Container on a wall with a wide face.
                (ii) Be made at a 45° angle to the principal axis of the Flexible Bulk Container, halfway between the bottom surface and the top level of the contents.
                (2) The Flexible Bulk Container after being cut according to the provisions of § 178.1070(c)(1), must be subjected to a uniformly distributed superimposed load equivalent to twice the maximum gross mass of the package. This load must be applied for at least fifteen minutes. Flexible Bulk Containers that are designed to be lifted from the top or the side must, after removal of the superimposed load, be lifted clear of the floor and maintained in that position for a period of fifteen minutes.
                (d) Criterion for passing the test. For all Flexible Bulk Container design types, the cut must not spread more than an additional 25% of its original length.

                Appendix B to Part 178—Alternative Leakproofness Test Methods
                In addition to the method prescribed in § 178.604 of this subchapter, the following leakproofness test methods are authorized:
                (1) Helium test. The packaging must be filled with at least 1 L inert helium gas, air tight closed, and placed in a testing chamber. The testing chamber must be evacuated down to a pressure of 5 kPa which equals an over-pressure inside the packaging of 95 kPa. The air in the testing chamber must be analyzed for traces of helium gas by means of a mass spectrograph. The test must be conducted for a period of time sufficient to evacuate the chamber and to determine if there is leakage into or out of the packaging. If helium gas is detected, the leaking packaging must be automatically separated from non-leaking drums and the leaking area determined according to the method prescribed in § 178.604(d) of this subchapter. A packaging passes the test if there is no leakage of helium.
                (2) Pressure differential test. The packaging shall be restrained while either pressure or a vacuum is applied internally. The packaging must be pressurized to the pressure required by § 178.604(e) of this subchapter for the appropriate packing group. The method of restraint must not affect the results of the test. The test must be conducted for a period of time sufficient to appropriately pressurize or evacuate the interior of the packaging and to determine if there is leakage into or out of the packaging. A packaging passes the pressure differential test if there is no change in measured internal pressure.
                (3) Solution over seams. The packaging must be restrained while an internal air pressure is applied; the method of restraint may not affect the results of the test. The exterior surface of all seams and welds must be coated with a solution of soap suds or a water and oil mixture. The test must be conducted for a period of time sufficient to pressurize the interior of the packaging to the specified air pressure and to determine if there is leakage of air from the packaging. A packaging passes the test if there is no leakage of air from the packaging.
                (4) Solution over partial seams test. For other than design qualification testing, the following test may be used for metal drums: The packaging must be restrained while an internal air pressure of 48 kPa (7.0 psig) is applied; the method of restraint may not affect the results of the test. The packaging must be coated with a soap solution over the entire side seam and a distance of not less than eight inches on each side of the side seam along the chime seam(s). The test must be conducted for a period of time sufficient to pressurize the interior of the packaging to the specified air pressure and to determine if there is leakage of air from the packaging. A packaging passes the test if there is no leakage of air from the packaging. Chime cuts must be made on the initial drum at the beginning of each production run and on the initial drum after any adjustment to the chime seamer. Chime cuts must be maintained on file in date order for not less than six months and be made available to a representative of the Department of Transportation on request.

                Appendix D to Part 178—Thermal Resistance Test
                1. Scope. This test method evaluates the thermal resistance capabilities of a compressed oxygen generator and the outer packaging for a cylinder of compressed oxygen or other oxidizing gas and an oxygen generator. When exposed to a temperature of 205 °C (400 °F) for a period of not less than three hours, the outer surface of the cylinder may not exceed a temperature of 93 °C (199 °F) and the oxygen generator must not actuate.
                2. Apparatus.
                
                2.1 Test Oven. The oven must be large enough in size to fully house the test outer package without clearance problems. The test oven must be capable of maintaining a minimum steady state temperature of 205 °C (400 °F).
                2.2 Thermocouples. At least three thermocouples must be used to monitor the temperature inside the oven and an additional three thermocouples must be used to monitor the temperature of the cylinder. The thermocouples must be 1/16 inch, ceramic packed, metal sheathed, type K (Chromel-Alumel), grounded junction with a nominal 30 American wire gauge (AWG) size conductor. The thermocouples measuring the temperature inside the oven must be placed at varying heights to ensure even temperature and proper heat-soak conditions. For the thermocouples measuring the temperature of the cylinder: (1) Two of them must be placed on the outer cylinder side wall at approximately 2 inches (5 cm) from the top and bottom shoulders of the cylinder; and (2) one must be placed on the cylinder valve body near the pressure relief device. Alternatively, the thermocouples may be replaced with other devices such as a remote temperature sensor, metal fuse on the valve, or coated wax, provided the device is tested and the test report is retained for verification. Under this alternative, it is permissible to record the highest temperature to which the cylinder is subjected instead of temperature measurements in intervals of not more than five (5) minutes.
                2.3 Instrumentation. A calibrated recording device or a computerized data acquisition system with an appropriate range should be provided to measure and record the outputs of the thermocouples.
                3. Test Specimen.
                
                3.1 Specimen Configuration. Each outer package material type and design must be tested, including any features such as handles, latches, fastening systems, etc., that may compromise the ability of the outer package to provide thermal protection.
                3.2 Test Specimen Mounting. The tested outer package must be supported at the four corners using fire brick or other suitable means. The bottom surface of the outer package must be exposed to allow exposure to heat.
                4. Preparation for Testing.
                
                4.1 It is recommended that the cylinder be closed at ambient temperature and configured as when filled with a valve and pressure relief device. The oxygen generator must be filled with an oxidizing agent and may be tested with or without packaging.
                4.2 Place the package or generator onto supporting bricks or a stand inside the test oven in such a manner to ensure even temperature flow.
                5. Test Procedure.
                
                5.1 Close oven door and check for proper reading on thermocouples.
                5.2 Raise the temperature of the oven to a minimum temperature of 205 °C ±2 °C (400 °F ±5 °F). Maintain a minimum oven temperature of 205 °C ±2 °C (400 °F ±5 °F) for at least three hours. Exposure time begins when the oven steady state temperature reaches a minimum of 205 °C ±2 °C (400 °F ±5 °F).
                5.3 At the conclusion of the three-hour period, the outer package may be removed from the oven and allowed to cool naturally.
                6. Recordkeeping.
                
                6.1 Record a complete description of the material being tested, including the manufacturer, size of cylinder, etc.
                6.2 Record any observations regarding the behavior of the test specimen during exposure, such as smoke production, delamination, resin ignition, and time of occurrence of each event.

                6.3 Record the temperature and time history of the cylinder temperature during the entire test for each thermocouple location. Temperature measurements must be recorded at intervals of not more than five (5) minutes. Record the maximum temperatures achieved at all three thermocouple locations and the corresponding time.
                7. Requirements.
                
                7.1 For a cylinder, the outer package must provide adequate protection such that the outer surface of the cylinder and valve does not exceed a temperature of 93 °C (199 °F) at any of the three points where the thermocouples are located.
                7.2 For an oxygen generator, the generator must not actuate.

                Pt. 178, App. E
                Appendix E to Part 178—Flame Penetration Resistance Test
                (a) Criteria for Acceptance. (1) At least three specimens of the outer packaging materials must be tested;
                (2) Each test must be conducted on a flat 16 inch × 24 inch test specimen mounted in the horizontal ceiling position of the test apparatus to represent the outer packaging design;
                (3) Testing must be conducted on all design features (latches, seams, hinges, etc.) affecting the ability of the outer packaging to safely prevent the passage of fire in the horizontal ceiling position; and
                (4) There must be no flame penetration of any specimen within 5 minutes after application of the flame source and the maximum allowable temperature at a point 4 inches above the test specimen, centered over the burner cone, must not exceed 205 °C (400 °F).
                (b) Summary of Method. This method provides a laboratory test procedure for measuring the capability of cargo compartment lining materials to resist flame penetration with a 2 gallon per hour (GPH) #2 Grade kerosene or equivalent burner fire source. Ceiling and sidewall liner panels may be tested individually provided a baffle is used to simulate the missing panel. Any specimen that passes the test as a ceiling liner panel may be used as a sidewall liner panel.
                (c) Test Specimens. (1) The specimen to be tested must measure 16 ±1/8 inches (406 ±3 mm) by 24 + 1/8 inches (610 ±3 mm).
                (2) The specimens must be conditioned at 70 °F. ±5 °F. (21 °C. ±2 °C.) and 55% ±5% humidity for at least 24 hours before testing.
                (d) Test Apparatus. The arrangement of the test apparatus must include the components described in this section. Minor details of the apparatus may vary, depending on the model of the burner used.
                (1) Specimen Mounting Stand. The mounting stand for the test specimens consists of steel angles.
                (2) Test Burner. The burner to be used in tesing must—
                (i) Be a modified gun type.
                (ii) Use a suitable nozzle and maintain fuel pressure to yield a 2 GPH fuel flow. For example: An 80 degree nozzle nominally rated at 2.25 GPH and operated at 85 pounds per square inch (PSI) gauge to deliver 2.03 GPH.
                (iii) Have a 12 inch (305 mm) burner extension installed at the end of the draft tube with an opening 6 inches (152 mm) high and 11 inches (280 mm) wide.
                (iv) Have a burner fuel pressure regulator that is adjusted to deliver a nominal 2.0 GPH of #2 Grade kerosene or equivalent.
                Burner models which have been used successfully in testing are the Lenox Model OB-32, Carlin Model 200 CRD and Park Model DPL.
                (3) Calorimeter. (i) The calorimeter to be used in testing must be a total heat flux Foil Type Gardon Gage of an appropriate range (approximately 0 to 15.0 British thermal unit (BTU) per ft.2 sec., 0-17.0 watts/cm2). The calorimeter must be mounted in a 6 inch by 12 inch (152 by 305 mm) by 3/4 inch (19 mm) thick insulating block which is attached to a steel angle bracket for placement in the test stand during burner calibration as shown in Figure 2 of this part of this appendix.
                (ii) The insulating block must be monitored for deterioration and the mounting shimmed as necessary to ensure that the calorimeter face is parallel to the exit plane of the test burner cone.
                (4) Thermocouples. The seven thermocouples to be used for testing must be 1/16 inch ceramic sheathed, type K, grounded thermocouples with a nominal 30 American wire gage (AWG) size conductor. The seven thermocouples must be attached to a steel angle bracket to form a thermocouple rake for placement in the test stand during burner calibration.
                (5) Apparatus Arrangement. The test burner must be mounted on a suitable stand to position the exit of the burner cone a distance of 8 inches from the ceiling liner panel and 2 inches from the sidewall liner panel. The burner stand should have the capability of allowing the burner to be swung away from the test specimen during warm-up periods.
                (6) Instrumentation. A recording potentiometer or other suitable instrument with an appropriate range must be used to measure and record the outputs of the calorimeter and the thermocouples.
                (7) Timing Device. A stopwatch or other device must be used to measure the time of flame application and the time of flame penetration, if it occurs.
                (e) Preparation of Apparatus. Before calibration, all equipment must be turned on and allowed to stabilize, and the burner fuel flow must be adjusted as specified in paragraph (d)(2).
                (f) Calibration. To ensure the proper thermal output of the burner the following test must be made:

                (1) Remove the burner extension from the end of the draft tube. Turn on the blower portion of the burner without turning the fuel or igniters on. Measure the air velocity using a hot wire anemometer in the center of the draft tube across the face of the opening. Adjust the damper such that the air velocity is in the range of 1550 to 1800 ft./min. If tabs are being used at the exit of the draft tube, they must be removed prior to this measurement. Reinstall the draft tube extension cone.
                (2) Place the calorimeter on the test stand as shown in Figure 2 at a distance of 8 inches (203 mm) from the exit of the burner cone to simulate the position of the horizontal test specimen.
                (3) Turn on the burner, allow it to run for 2 minutes for warm-up, and adjust the damper to produce a calorimeter reading of 8.0 ±0.5 BTU per ft.2 sec. (9.1 ±0.6 Watts/cm2).
                (4) Replace the calorimeter with the thermocouple rake.
                (5) Turn on the burner and ensure that each of the seven thermocouples reads 1700 °F. ±100 °F. (927 °C. ±38 °C.) to ensure steady state conditions have been achieved. If the temperature is out of this range, repeat steps 2 through 5 until proper readings are obtained.
                (6) Turn off the burner and remove the thermocouple rake.
                (7) Repeat (1) to ensure that the burner is in the correct range.
                (g) Test Procedure. (1) Mount a thermocouple of the same type as that used for calibration at a distance of 4 inches (102 mm) above the horizontal (ceiling) test specimen. The thermocouple should be centered over the burner cone.
                (2) Mount the test specimen on the test stand shown in Figure 1 in either the horizontal or vertical position. Mount the insulating material in the other position.
                (3) Position the burner so that flames will not impinge on the specimen, turn the burner on, and allow it to run for 2 minutes. Rotate the burner to apply the flame to the specimen and simultaneously start the timing device.
                (4) Expose the test specimen to the flame for 5 minutes and then turn off the burner. The test may be terminated earlier if flame penetration is observed.
                (5) When testing ceiling liner panels, record the peak temperature measured 4 inches above the sample.
                (6) Record the time at which flame penetration occurs if applicable.
                (h) Test Report. The test report must include the following:
                (1) A complete description of the materials tested including type, manufacturer, thickness, and other appropriate data.
                (2) Observations of the behavior of the test specimens during flame exposure such as delamination, resin ignition, smoke, etc., including the time of such occurrence.
                (3) The time at which flame penetration occurs, if applicable, for each of the three specimens tested.

                Tank-head puncture-resistance systems.
                (a) Performance standard. When the regulations in this subchapter require a tank-head puncture-resistance system, the system shall be capable of sustaining, without any loss of lading, coupler-to-tank-head impacts at relative car speeds of 29 km/hour (18 mph) when:
                (1) The weight of the impact car is at least 119,295 kg (263,000 pounds);
                (2) The impacted tank car is coupled to one or more backup cars that have a total weight of at least 217,724 kg (480,000 pounds) and the hand brake is applied on the last “backup” car; and
                (3) The impacted tank car is pressurized to at least 6.9 Bar (100 psig).
                (b) Verification by testing. Compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall be verified by full-scale testing according to appendix A of this part.
                (c) Alternative compliance by other than testing. As an alternative to requirements prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section may be met by installing full-head protection (shields) or full tank-head jackets on each end of the tank car conforming to the following:
                (1) The full-head protection (shields) or full tank-head jackets must be at least 1.27 cm (0.5 inch) thick, shaped to the contour of the tank head and made from steel having a tensile strength greater than 379.21 N/mm2 (55,000 psi).
                (2) The design and test requirements of the full-head protection (shields) or full tank-head jackets must meet the impact test requirements in Section 5.3 of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (3) The workmanship must meet the requirements in Section C, Part II, Chapter 5, of the AAR Specifications for Design, Fabrication, and Construction of Freight Cars (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

                Thermal protection systems.
                (a) Performance standard. When the regulations in this subchapter require thermal protection on a tank car, the tank car must have sufficient thermal resistance so that there will be no release of any lading within the tank car, except release through the pressure release device, when subjected to:
                (1) A pool fire for 100 minutes; and
                (2) A torch fire for 30 minutes.
                (b) Thermal analysis. (1) Compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall be verified by analyzing the fire effects on the entire surface of the tank car. The analysis must consider the fire effects on and heat flux through tank discontinuities, protective housings, underframes, metal jackets, insulation, and thermal protection. A complete record of each analysis shall be made, retained, and upon request, made available for inspection and copying by an authorized representative of the Department. The procedures outlined in “Temperatures, Pressures, and Liquid Levels of Tank Cars Engulfed in Fires,” DOT/FRA/OR&D-84/08.11, (1984), Federal Railroad Administration, Washington, DC (available from the National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA) shall be deemed acceptable for analyzing the fire effects on the entire surface of the tank car.
                (2) When the analysis shows the thermal resistance of the tank car does not conform to paragraph (a) of this section, the thermal resistance of the tank car must be increased by using a system listed by the Department under paragraph (c) of this section or by testing a new or untried system and verifying it according to appendix B of this part.
                (c) Systems that no longer require test verification. The Department maintains a list of thermal protection systems that comply with the requirements of appendix B of this part and that no longer require test verification. Information necessary to equip tank cars with one of these systems is available in the PHMSA Records Center, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, East Building, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590-0001.

                (a) In addition to or in place of the venting, loading and unloading valves, measuring and sampling devices as prescribed in § 179.103-3, tanks may be equipped with approved bottom outlet valves. If applied, bottom outlet valves must meet the following requirements:
                (1) On cars with center sills, a ball valve may be welded to the outside bottom of the tank or mounted on a pad or nozzle with a tongue and groove or male and female flange attachment, but in no case shall the breakage groove or equivalent extend below the bottom flange of the center sill. On cars without continuous center sills, a ball valve may be welded to the outside bottom of the tank or mounted with a tongue and groove or male and female flange attachment on a pad attached to the outside bottom of the tank. The mounting pad must have a maximum thickness of 21/2 inches measured on the longitudinal centerline of the tank. The valve operating mechanism must be provided with a suitable locking arrangement to insure positive closure during transit.
                (2) When internal bottom outlet valve is used in liquefied flammable gas service, the outlet of the valve must be equipped with an excess flow valve of approved design, except when a quick-closing internal valve of approved design is used. Protective housing is not required.
                (3) Bottom outlet must be equipped with a liquid tight closure at its lower end.

                (b) Bottom outlet equipment must be of approved design and must meet the following requirements:
                
                (1) The extreme projection of the bottom outlet equipment may not be more than allowed by appendix E of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). All bottom outlet reducers and closures and their attachments shall be secured to the car by at least 3/8 inch chain, or its equivalent, except that bottom outlet closure plugs may be attached by 1/4 inch chain. When the bottom outlet closure is of the combination cap and valve type, the pipe connection to the valve shall be closed by a plug, cap, or approved quick coupling device. The bottom outlet equipment should include only the valve, reducers and closures that are necessary for the attachment of unloading fixtures. The permanent attachment of supplementary exterior fittings must be approved by the AAR Committee on Tank Cars.
                (2) To provide for the attachment of unloading connections, the discharge end of the bottom outlet nozzle or reducer, the valve body of the exterior valve, or some fixed attachment thereto, shall be provided with one of the following arrangements or an approved modification thereof. (See appendix E. Fig. E17 of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars for illustrations of some of the possible arrangements.)
                (i) A bolted flange closure arrangement including a minimum 1-inch NPT pipe plug (see Fig. E17.1) or including an auxiliary valve with a threaded closure.
                (ii) A threaded cap closure arrangement including a minimum 1-inch NPT pipe plug (see Fig. E17.2) or including an auxiliary valve with a threaded closure.
                (iii) A quick-coupling device using a threaded plug closure of at least 1-inch NPT or having a threaded cap closure with a minimum 1-inch NPT pipe plug (see Fig. E17.3 through E17.5). A minimum 1-inch auxiliary test valve with a threaded closure may be substituted for the 1-inch pipe plug (see Fig E17.6). If the threaded cap closure does not have a pipe plug or integral auxiliary test valve, a minimum 1-inch NPT pipe plug shall be installed in the outlet nozzle above the closure (see Fig. E17.7).
                (iv) A two-piece quick-coupling device using a clamped dust cap must include an in-line auxiliary valve, either integral with the quick-coupling device or located between the primary bottom outlet valve and the quick-coupling device. The quick-coupling device closure dust cap or outlet nozzle shall be fitted with a minimum 1-inch NPT closure (see Fig. E17.8 and E17.9).
                (3) The valve operating mechanism must be provided with a suitable locking arrangement to insure positive closure during transit.
                (4) If the outlet nozzle extends 6 inches or more from shell of tank, a V-shaped breakage groove shall be cut (not cast) in the upper part to the outlet nozzle at a point immediately below the lowest part of value closest to the tank. In no case may the nozzle wall thickness at the roof of the “V” be more than 1/4-inch. On cars without continuous center sills, the breakage groove or its equivalent may not be more than 15 inches below the tank shell. On cars with continuous center sills, the breakage groove or its equivalent must be above the bottom of the center sill construction.
                (5) The valve body must be of a thickness which will insure that accidental breakage of the outlet nozzle will occur at or below the “V” groove, or its equivalent, and will not cause distortion of the valve seat or valve.

In no case shall the breakage groove or equivalent extend below the bottom flange of the center sill. On cars without continuous center sills, a ball valve may be welded to the outside bottom of the tank or mounted with a tongue and groove or male and female flange attachment on a pad attached to the outside bottom of the tank. The mounting pad must have a maximum thickness of 21/2 inches measured on the longitudinal centerline of the tank. The valve operating mechanism must be provided with a suitable locking arrangement to insure positive closure during transit.
                (4) The valve operating mechanism for valves applied to the interior of the tank, and outlet nozzle construction, must insure against the unseating of the valve due to stresses or shocks incident to transportation.
                (5) Bottom outlet nozzle of interior valves and the valve body of exterior valves, must be of cast, fabricated, or forged metal. If welded to tank, they must be of good weldable quality in conjunction with metal of tank.
                (6) To provide for the attachment of unloading connections, the discharge end of the bottom outlet nozzle or reducer, the valve body of the exterior valve, or some fixed attachment thereto, shall be provided with one of the following arrangements or an approved modification thereof. (See appendix E. Fig. E17 of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars for illustrations of some of the possible arrangements.)

A minimum 1-inch auxiliary test valve with a threaded closure may be substituted for the 1-inch pipe plug (see Fig. E17.6). If the threaded cap closure does not have a pipe plug or integral auxiliary test valve, a minimum 1-inch NPT pipe plug shall be installed in the outlet nozzle above the closure (see Fig. E17.7).
                (iv) A two-piece quick-coupling device using a clamped dust cap must include an in-line auxiliary valve, either integral with the quick-coupling device or located between the primary bottom outlet valve and the quick-coupling device. The quick-coupling device closure dust cap or outlet nozzle shall be fitted with a minimum 1-inch NPT closure (see Fig. E17.8 and E17.9).

                (7) If the outlet nozzle extends 6 inches or more from the shell of the tank, a V-shaped breakage groove shall be cut (not cast) in the upper part of the outlet nozzle at a point immediately below the lowest part of valve closest to the tank. In no case may the nozzle wall thickness at the root of the “V” be more than 1/4 inch. The outlet nozzle on interior valves or the valve body on exterior valves may be steam jacketed, in which case the breakage groove or its equivalent must be below the steam chamber but above the bottom of center sill construction. If the outlet nozzle is not a single piece, or if exterior valves are applied, provisions shall be made for the equivalent of the breakage groove. On cars without continuous center sills, the breakage groove or its equivalent must be no more than 15 inches below the tank shell. On cars with continuous center sills, the breakage groove or its equivalent must be above the bottom of the center sill construction.
                (8) The flange on the outlet nozzle or the valve body of exterior valves must be of a thickness which will prevent distortion of the valve seat or valve by any change in contour of the shell resulting from expansion of lading, or other causes, and which will insure that accidental breakage of the outlet nozzle will occur at or below the “V” groove, or its equivalent.
                (9) The valve must have no wings or stem projecting below the “V” groove or its equivalent. The valve and seat must be readily accessible or removable for repairs, including grinding.
                (10) The valve operating mechanism on interior valves must have means for compensating for variation in the vertical diameter of the tank produced by expansion, weight of the liquid contents, or other causes, and may operate from the interior of the tank, but in the event the rod is carried through the dome, or tank shell, leakage must be prevented by packing in stuffing box or other suitable seals and a cap.
                (b) If indicated in § 179.201-1, tank may be equipped with bottom washout of approved construction. If applied, bottom washout shall be in accordance with the following requirements:
                (1) The extreme projection of the bottom washout equipment may not be more than that allowed by appendix E of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars.
                (2) Bottom washout shall be of cast, forged or fabricated metal. If welded to tank, they shall be of good weldable quality in conjunction with metal of tank.
                (3) If the washout nozzle extends 6 inches or more from the shell of the tank, a V-shaped breakage groove shall be cut (not cast) in the upper part of the nozzle at a point immediately below the lowest part of the inside closure seat or plug. In no case may the nozzle wall thickness at the root of the “V” be more than 1/4 inch. Where the nozzle is not a single piece, provisions shall be made for the equivalent of the breakage groove. The nozzle must be of a thickness to insure that accidental breakage will occur at or below the “V” groove or its equivalent. On cars without continuous center sills, the breakage groove or its equivalent may not be more than 15 inches below the outer shell. On cars with continuous center sills, the breakage groove or its equivalent must be above the bottom of the center sill construction.
                (4) The closure plug and seat must be readily accessible or removable for repairs, including grinding.

The rubber lining must overlap at least 11/2 inches at all edges which must be straight and be beveled to an angle of approximately 45°, or butted edges of lining must be sealed with a 3-inch minimum strip of lining having 45° beveled edges.
                (2) As an alternate method, the lining may be joined with a skived butt seam then capped with a separate strip of lining 3 inches wide having 45° beveled edges. An additional rubber reinforcing pad at least 41/2 feet square and at least 1/2-inch thick must be applied by vulcanizing to the lining on bottom of tank directly under the manway opening. The edges of the rubber pad must be beveled to an angle of approximately 45°. An opening in this pad for sump is permitted. No lining must be under tension when applied except due to conformation over rivet heads. Interior of tank must be free from scale, oxidation, moisture, and all foreign matter during the lining operation.
                (3) Other approved lining materials may be used provided the material is resistant to the corrosive or solvent action of the lading in the liquid or gas phase and is suitable for the service temperatures.
                (b) Before a tank car tank is lined with rubber, or other rubber compound, a report certifying that the tank and its equipment have been brought into compliance with spec. DOT-111A60W5 or 111A100W5 must be furnished by car owner to the party who is to apply the lining. A copy of this report in approved form, certifying that tank has been lined in compliance with all requirements of one of the above specifications, must be furnished by party lining tank to car owner. Reports of the latest lining application must be retained by the car owner until the next relining has been accomplished and recorded.

                (c) All rivet heads on inside of tank must be buttonhead, or similar shape, and of uniform size. The under surface of heads must be driven tight against the plate. All plates, castings and rivet heads on the inside of the tank must be calked. All projecting edges of plates, castings and rivet heads on the inside of the tank must be rounded and free from fins and other irregular projections. Castings must be free from porosity.
                (d) All surfaces of attachments or fittings and their closures exposed to the lading must be covered with at least 1/8-inch acid resistant material. Attachments made of metal not affected by the lading need not be covered with rubber or other acid resistant material.
                (e) Hard rubber or polyvinyl chloride may be used for pressure retaining parts of safety vents provided the material is resistant to the corrosive or solvent action of the lading in the liquid or gas phase and is suitable for the service temperatures.
                (f) Polyvinyl chloride lined tanks. Tank car tanks or each compartment thereof may be lined with elastomeric polyvinyl chloride having a minimum lining thickness of three thirty-seconds inch.
                (g) Polyurethane lined tanks. Tank car tanks or each compartment thereof may be lined with elastomeric polyurethane having a minimum lining thickness of one-sixteenth inch.

                (a) When installed, each device must be of approved design which will prevent interchange with any other fixture and must be tightly closed. Each unloading pipe must be securely anchored within the inner container. Each inner container or compartment thereof may be equipped with one separate air connection.
                (b) When the characteristics of the commodity for which the car is authorized require these devices to be equipped with valves or fittings to permit the loading and unloading of the contents, these devices including valves, shall be provided with a protective housing except when plug or ball-type valves with operating handles removed are used. Provision must be made for closing pipe connections of valves.
                (c) Inner container may be equipped with a vacuum relief valve of approved design. Protective housing is not required.
                (d) When a gauging device is required in § 179.221-1, an outage scale visible through the manway opening must be provided. If loading devices are applied to permit tank loading with cover closed, a telltale pipe may be provided. The telltail pipe must be capable of determining that required outage is provided. The pipe must be equipped with 1/4-inch maximum, NPT control valve mounted outside tank and enclosed within a protective housing. Other approved devices may be used in place of an outage scale or a telltale pipe.

                (e) The bottom of the tank shell may be equipped with a sump or siphon bowl, or both, welded or pressed into the shell. These sumps or siphon bowls, if applied, are not limited in size and must be made of cast, forged, or fabricated metal. Each sump or siphon bowl must be of good welding quality in conjunction with the metal of the tank shell. When the sump or siphon bowl is pressed in the bottom of the tank shell, the wall thickness of the pressed section must not be less than that specified for the shell. The section of a circular cross section tank to which a sump or siphon bowl is attached need not comply with the out-of-roundness requirement specified in appendix W, W14.06 of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars. Any portion of a sump or siphon bowl not forming a part of a cylinder of revolution must have walls of such thickness and must be so reinforced that the stresses in the walls caused by a given internal pressure are not greater than the circumferential stress which would exist under the same internal pressure in the wall of a tank of circular cross section designed in accordance with §§ 179.220-6(a) and 179.220-9. In no case shall the wall thickness be less than that specified in § 179.221-1.
                (f) Protective housing, when required, must be of approved material and must have cover and sidewalls not less than 0.119 inch in thickness.

                § 179.220-18
                Bottom outlets.
                (a) The inner container may be equipped with a bottom outlet of approved design and an opening provided in the outer shell of its access. If applied, the bottom outlet must comply with the following requirements:
                (1) The extreme projection of the bottom outlet equipment may not be more than that allowed by appendix E of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). All bottom outlet reducers and closures and their attachments shall be secured to car by at at least 3/8-inch chain, or its equivalent, except that bottom outlet closure plugs may be attached by 1/4-inch chain. When the bottom outlet closure is of the combination cap and valve type, the pipe connection to the valve shall be closed by a plug, or cap. The bottom outlet equipment should include only the valve, reducers and closures that are necessary for the attachment of unloading fixtures. The permanent attachment of supplementary exterior fittings shall be approved by the AAR Committee on Tank Cars.
                (2) Each bottom outlet must be provided with a liquid tight closure at its lower end.
                (3) The valve and its operating mechanism must be applied to the outside bottom of the inner container. The valve operating mechanism must be provided with a suitable locking arrangement to insure positive closure during transportation.
                (4) Valve outlet nozzle and valve body must be of cast, fabricated or forged metal. If welded to inner container, they must be of good weldable quality in conjunction with metal of tank.
                (5) To provide for the attachment of unloading connections, the bottom of the main portion of the outlet nozzle or valve body, or some fixed attachment thereto, must be provided with threaded cap closure arrangement or bolted flange closure arrangement having minimum 1-inch threaded pipe plug.
                (6) If outlet nozzle and its closure extends below the bottom of the outer shell, a V-shaped breakage groove shall be cut (not cast) in the upper part of the outlet nozzle at a point immediately below the lowest part of the valve closest to the tank. In no case may the nozzle wall thickness at the root of the “V” be more than 1/4-inch. The outlet nozzle or the valve body may be steam jacketed, in which case the breakage groove or its equivalent must be below the steam chamber but above the bottom of the center sill construction. If the outlet nozzle is not a single piece or its exterior valves are applied, provision shall be made for the equivalent of the breakage groove. On cars without continuous center sills, the breakage groove or its equivalent may not be more than 15 inches below the outer shell. On cars with continuous center sills, the breakage groove or its equivalent must be above the bottom of the center sill construction.
                (7) The valve body must be of a thickness which will prevent distortion of the valve seat or valve by any change in contour of the shell resulting from expansion of lading, or other causes, and which will insure that accidental breakage of the outlet nozzle will occur at or below the “V” groove, or its equivalent.

                (8) The valve must have no wings or stem projection below the “V” groove or its equivalent. The valve and seat must be readily accessible or removable for repairs, including grinding.
                (b) Inner container may be equipped with bottom washout of approved design. If applied, bottom washout must comply with the following requirements:

                (3) If washout nozzle extends below the bottom of the outer shell, a V-shaped breakage groove shall be cut (not cast) in the upper part of the nozzle at a point immediately below the lowest part of the inside closure seat or plug. In no case may the nozzle wall thickness at the root of the “V” be more than 1/4-inch. Where the nozzle is not a single piece, provisions shall be made for the equivalent of the breakage groove. The nozzle must be of a thickness to insure that accidental breakage will occur at or below the “V” groove or its equivalent. On cars without a continuous center sill, the breakage groove or its equivalent may not be more than 15 inches below the outer shell. On cars with continuous center sills, the breakage groove or its equivalent must be above the bottom of the center sill construction.
                (4) The closure plug and seat must be readily accessible or removable for repairs.
                (5) The closure of the washout nozzle must be equipped with a 3/4-inch solid screw plug. Plug must be attached by at least a 1/4-inch chain.
                (6) Joints between closures and their seats may be gasketed with suitable material.

                § 179.400-4
                Insulation system and performance standard.
                (a) For the purposes of this specification—
                (1) Standard Heat Transfer Rate (SHTR), expressed in Btu/day/lb of water capacity, means the rate of heat transfer used for determining the satisfactory performance of the insulation system of a cryogenic tank car tank in cryogenic liquid service (see § 179.401-1 table).
                (2) Test cryogenic liquid means the cryogenic liquid, which may be different from the lading intended to be shipped in the tank, being used during the performance tests of the insulation system.
                (3) Normal evaporation rate (NER), expressed in lbs. (of the cryogenic liquid)/day, means the rate of evaporation, determined by test of a test cryogenic liquid in a tank maintained at a pressure of approximately one atmosphere, absolute. This determination of the NER is the NER test.
                (4) Stabilization period means the elapsed time after a tank car tank is filled with the test cryogenic liquid until the NER has stabilized, or 24 hours has passed, whichever is greater.
                (5) Calculated heat transfer rate. The calculated heat transfer rate (CHTR) is determined by the use of test data obtained during the NER test in the formula:
                
                q = [N(Δ h)(90-tl)] / [V(8.32828)(ts-tf)]
                
                
                  
                  Where:
                  
                  q = CHTR, in Btu/day/lb., of water capacity;
                  N = NER, determined by NER test, in lbs./day;
                  Δh = latent heat of vaporization of the test cryogenic liquid at the NER test pressure of approximately one atmosphere, absolute, in Btu/lb.;
                  90 = ambient temperature at 90 °F.;
                  V = gross water volume at 60 °F. of the inner tank, in gallons;
                  tl = equilibrium temperature of intended lading at maximum shipping pressure, in °F.;
                  8.32828 = constant for converting gallons of water at 60 °F. to lbs. of water at 60 °F., in lbs./gallon;
                  ts = average temperature of outer jacket, determined by averaging jacket temperatures at various locations on the jacket at regular intervals during the NER test, in °F.;
                  tf = equilibrium temperature of the test cryogenic liquid at the NER test pressure of approximately, one atmosphere, absolute, in °F.
                
                
                (b) DOT-113A60W tank cars must—
                (1) Be filled with hydrogen, cryogenic liquid to the maximum permitted fill density specified in § 173.319(d)(2) table of this subchapter prior to performing the NER test; and
                (2) Have a CHTR equal to or less than the SHTR specified in § 179.401-1 table for a DOT-113A60W tank car.
                (c) DOT-113C120W tank cars must—
                (1) Be filled with ethylene, cryogenic liquid to the maximum permitted fill density specified in § 173.319(d)(2) table of this subchapter prior to performing the NER test, or be filled with nitrogen, cryogenic liquid to 90 percent of the volumetric capacity of the inner tank prior to performing the NER test; and
                (2) Have a CHTR equal to or less than 75 percent of the SHTR specified in § 179.401-1 table for a DOT-113C120W tank car.
                (d) Insulating materials must be approved.
                (e) If the insulation consists of a powder having a tendency to settle, the entire top of the cylindrical portion of the inner tank must be insulated with a layer of glass fiber insulation at least one-inch nominal thickness, or equivalent, suitably held in position and covering an area extending 25 degrees to each side of the top center line of the inner tank.
                (f) The outer jacket must be provided with fittings to permit effective evacuation of the annular space between the outer jacket and the inner tank.
                (g) A device to measure the absolute pressure in the annular space must be provided. The device must be portable with an easily accessible connection or permanently positioned where it is readily visible to the operator.

                § 179.400-9
                Stiffening rings.
                (a) If stiffening rings are used in designing the cylindrical portion of the outer jacket for external pressure, they must be attached to the jacket by means of fillet welds. Outside stiffening ring attachment welds must be continuous on each side of the ring. Inside stiffening ring attachment welds may be intermittent welds on each side of the ring with the total length of weld on each side not less than one-third of the circumference of the tank. The maximum space between welds may not exceed eight times the outer jacket wall thickness.

                (b) A portion of the outer jacket may be included when calculating the moment of inertia of the ring. The effective width of jacket plate on each side of the attachment of the stiffening ring is given by the following formula:
                
                W = 0.78(Rt)0.5
                
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  W = width of jacket effective on each side of the stiffening ring, in inches;
                  R = outside radius of the outer jacket, in inches;
                  t = plate thickness of the outer jacket, after forming, in inches.
                
                
                (c) Where a stiffening ring is used that consists of a closed section having two webs attached to the outer jacket, the jacket plate between the webs may be included up to the limit of twice the value of “W”, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. The outer flange of the closed section, if not a steel structural shape, is subject to the same limitations with “W” based on the “R” and “t” values of the flange. Where two separate members such as two angles, are located less than “2W” apart they may be treated as a single stiffening ring member. (The maximum length of plate which may be considered effective is 4W.) The closed section between an external ring and the outer jacket must be provided with a drain opening.

                (d) The stiffening ring must have a moment of inertia large enough to support the critical collapsing pressure, as determined by either of the following formulas:
                
                I = [0.035D3 LPc] / E,
                
                or
                
                I′ = [0.046D3 LPc] / E
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  I = required moment of inertia of stiffening ring about the centroidal axis parallel to the vessel axis, in inches to the fourth power;
                  I′ = required moment of inertia of combined section of stiffening ring and effective width of jacket plate about the centroidal axis parallel to the vessel axis, in inches to the fourth power;
                  D = outside diameter of the outer jacket, in inches;
                  L = one-half of the distance from the centerline of the stiffening ring to the next line of support on one side, plus one-half of the distance from the centerline to the next line of support on the other side of stiffening ring. Both distances are measured parallel to the axis of the vessel, in inches. (A line of support is:
                  
                  (1) A stiffening ring which meets the requirements of this paragraph, or
                  (2) A circumferential line of a head at one-third the depth of the head from the tangent line);
                  
                  Pc = critical collapsing pressure (37.5 psig minimum) in psig;
                  E = modulus of elasticity of stiffening ring material, in psi.
                
                
                (e) Where loads are applied to the outer jacket or to stiffening rings from the system used to support the inner tank within the outer jacket, additional stiffening rings, or an increased moment of inertia of the stiffening rings designed for the external pressure, must be provided to carry the support loads.

                § 179.400-13
                Support system for inner tank.
                (a) The inner tank must be supported within the outer jacket by a support system of approved design. The system and its areas of attachment to the outer jacket must have adequate strength and ductility at operating temperatures to support the inner tank when filled with the lading to any level incident to transportation.
                (b) The support system must be designed to support, without yielding, impact loads producing accelerations of the following magnitudes and directions when the inner tank is fully loaded and the car is equipped with a conventional draft gear:

                The longitudinal acceleration may be reduced to 3“g” where a cushioning device of approved design, which has been tested to demonstrate its ability to limit body forces to 400,000 pounds maximum at 10 miles per hour, is used between the coupler and the tank structure.
                (c) The inner tank and outer jacket must be permanently bonded to each other electrically, by either the support system, piping, or a separate electrical connection of approved design.

                Access to inner tank.
                (a) The inner tank must be provided with a means of access having a minimum inside diameter of 16 inches. Reinforcement of the access opening must be made of the same material used in the inner tank. The access closure must be of an approved material and design.
                (b) If a welded closure is used, it must be designed to allow it to be reopened by grinding or chipping and to be closed again by rewelding, preferably without a need for new parts. A cutting torch may not be used.
              
              
                § 179.400-17
                Inner tank piping.
                (a) Product lines. The piping system for vapor and liquid phase transfer and venting must be made for material compatible with the product and having satisfactory properties at the lading temperature. The outlets of all vapor phase and liquid phase lines must be located so that accidental discharge from these lines will not impinge on any metal of the outer jacket, car structures, trucks or safety appliances. Suitable provison must be made to allow for thermal expansion and contraction.
                (1) Loading and unloading line. A liquid phase transfer line must be provided and it must have a manually operated shut-off valve located as close as practicable to the outer jacket, plus a secondary closure that is liquid and gas tight. This secondary closure must permit any trapped pressure to bleed off before the closure can be removed completely. A vapor trap must be incorporated in the line and located as close as practicable to the inner tank. On a DOT-113A60W tank car, any loading and unloading line must be vacuum jacketed between the outer jacket and the shut-off valve and the shut-off valve must also be vacuum jacketed.
                (2) Vapor phase line. A vapor phase line must connect to the inner tank and must be of sufficient size to permit the pressure relief devices specified in § 179.400-20 and connected to this line to operate at their design capacity without excessive pressure build-up in the tank. The vapor phase line must have a manually operated shut-off valve located as close as practicable to the outer jacket, plus a secondary closure that is liquid and gas tight. This secondary closure must permit any trapped pressure to bleed off before the closure can be removed completely.
                (3) Vapor phase blowdown line. A blowdown line must be provided. It must be attached to the vapor phase line specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, upstream of the shut-off valve in that line. A by-pass line with a manually operated shut-off valve must be provided to permit reduction of the inner tank pressure when the vapor phase line is connected to a closed system. The discharge from this line must be outside the housing and must be directed upward and away from operating personnel.
                (b) Any pressure building system provided for the purpose of pressurizing the vapor space of the inner tank to facilitate unloading the liquid lading must be approved.

                Test of inner tank.
                (a) After all items to be welded to the inner tank have been welded in place, the inner tank must be pressure tested at the test pressure prescribed in § 179.401-1. The temperature of the pressurizing medium may not exceed 38 °C (100 °F) during the test. The inner tank must hold the prescribed pressure for a period of not less than ten minutes without leakage or distortion. In a pneumatic test, due regard for the protection of all personnel should be taken because of the potential hazard involved. After a hydrostatic test the container and piping must be emptied of all water and purged of all water vapor.
                (b) Caulking of welded joints to stop leaks developed during the test is prohibited. Repairs to welded joints must be made as prescribed in AAR Specifications for Tank Cars, appendix W (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

                (a) Valves. Manually operated shut-off valves and control valves must be provided wherever needed for control of vapor phase pressure, vapor phase venting, liquid transfer and liquid flow rates. All valves must be made from approved materials compatible with the lading and having satisfactory properties at the lading temperature.
                (1) Liquid control valves must be of extended stem design.
                (2) Packing, if used, must be satisfactory for use in contact with the lading and of approved materials that will effectively seal the valve stem without causing difficulty of operation.
                (3) Each control valve and shut-off valve must be readily operable. These valves must be mounted so that their operation will not transmit excessive forces to the piping system.
                (b) Gages. Gages, except portable units, must be securely mounted within suitable protective housings. A liquid level gage and a vapor phase pressure gage must be provided as follows:
                (1) Liquid level gage. (i) A gage of approved design to indicate the quantity of liquefied lading within the inner tank, mounted where it will be readily visible to an operator during transfer operations or storage, or a portable gage with a readily accessible connection, or
                (ii) A fixed length dip tube, with a manually operated shut-off valve located as close as practicable to the outer jacket. The dip tube must indicate the maximum liquid level for the allowable filling density. The inner end of the dip tube must be located on the longitudinal centerline of the inner tank and within four feet of the transverse centerline of the inner tank.
                (2) Vapor phase pressure gage. A vapor phase pressure gage of approved design, with a manually operated shut-off valve located as close as practicable to the outer jacket. The gage must indicate the vapor pressure within the inner tank and must be mounted where it will be readily visible to an operator. An additional fitting for use of a test gage must be provided.
              
              
                § 179.400-20
                Pressure relief devices.
                (a) The tank must be provided with pressure relief devices for the protection of the tank assembly and piping system. The discharge from these devices must be directed away from operating personnel, principal load bearing members of the outer jacket, car structure, trucks and safety appliances. Vent or weep holes in pressure relief devices are prohibited. All main pressure relief devices must discharge to the outside of the protective housings in which they are located, except that this requirement does not apply to pressure relief valves installed to protect isolated sections of lines between the final valve and end closure.
                (b) Materials. Materials used in pressure relief devices must be suitable for use at the temperature of the lading and otherwise compatible with the lading in both the liquid and vapor phases.
                (c) Inner tank. Pressure relief devices for the inner tank must be attached to vapor phase piping and mounted so as to remain at ambient temperature prior to operation. The inner tank must be equipped with one or more pressure relief valves and one or more safety vents (except as noted in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section), and installed without an intervening shut-off valve (except as noted in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section). Additional requirements are as follows:
                (1) Safety vent. The safety vent shall function at the pressure specified in § 179.401-1. The safety vent must be flow rated in accordance with the applicable provisions of AAR Specifications for Tank Cars, appendix A (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), and provide sufficient capacity to meet the requirements of AAR Specifications for Tank Cars, appendix A, A8.07(a).
                (2) Pressure relief valve. The pressure relief valve must:
                (i) be set to start-to-discharge at the pressure specified in § 179.401-1, and
                (ii) meet the requirements of AAR Specifications for Tank Cars, appendix A, A8.07(b).
                (3) Installation of safety vent and pressure relief valve—(i) Inlet piping. (A) The opening through all piping and fittings between the inner tank and its pressure relief devices must have a cross-sectional area at least equal to that of the pressure relief device inlet, and the flow characteristics of this upstream system must be such that the pressure drop will not adversely affect the relieving capacity or the proper operation of the pressure relief device.
                (B) When the required relief capacity is met by the use of multiple pressure relief device placed on one connection, the inlet internal cross-sectional area of this connection must be sufficient to provide the required flow capacity for the proper operation of the pressure relief device system.
                (ii) Outlet piping. (A) The opening through the discharge lines must have a cross-sectional area at least equal to that of the pressure relief device outlet and may not reduce the relieving capacity below that required to properly protect the inner tank.
                (B) When the required relieving capacity is met by use of multiple pressure relief devices placed on a common discharge manifold, the manifold outlet internal cross-sectional area must be at least equal to the combined outlet areas of the pressure relief devices.
                (iii) Duplicate pressure relief devices may be used when an approved 3-way selector valve is installed to provide for relief through either duplicate pressure relief device. The 3-way valve must be included in the mounting prescribed by AAR Specifications for Tank Cars, appendix A, A6.02(g), when conducting the flow capacity test on the safety vent prescribed by AAR Specifications for Tank Cars, appendix A, A6.01. Flow capacity tests must be performed with the 3-way valve at both of the extreme positions as well as at the mid-position and the flow capacity must be in accordance with AAR Specifications for Tank Cars, appendix A, A8.07(a).
                (iv) An alternate pressure relief valve, set as required in § 179.401-1, may be used in lieu of the safety vent, provided it meets the flow capacity prescribed in AAR Specifications for Tank Cars, appendix A at a flow rating pressure of 110 percent of its start-to-discharge pressure. Installation must—
                (A) Prevent moisture accumulation at the seat by providing drainage away from that area,
                (B) Permit periodic drainage of the vent piping, and
                (C) Prevent accumulation of foreign material in the vent system.
                (4) Evaporation control. The routine release of vaporized lading may be controlled with a pressure controlling and mixing device, except that a pressure controlling and mixing device is required on each DOT-113A60W car. Any pressure controlling and mixing device must—
                (i) Be set to start-to-discharge at a pressure not greater than that specified in § 179.401-1;
                (ii) Have sufficient capacity to limit the pressure within the inner tank to that pressure specified in § 179.401-1, when the discharge is equal to twice the normal venting rate during transportation, with normal vacuum and the outer shell at 130 °F; and
                (iii) Prevent the discharge of a gas mixture exceeding 50% of the lower flammability limit to the atmosphere under normal conditions of storage or transportation.
                (5) Safety interlock. If a safety interlock is provided for the purpose of allowing transfer of lading at a pressure higher than the pressure control valve setting but less than the pressure relief valve setting, the design must be such that the safety interlock will not affect the discharge path of the pressure relief value or safety vent at any time. The safety interlock must automatically provide an unrestricted discharge path for the pressure control device at all times when the tank car is in transport service.
                (d) Outer jacket. The outer jacket must be provided with a suitable system to prevent buildup of annular space pressure in excess of 16 psig or the external pressure for which the inner tank was designed, whichever is less. The total relief area provided by the system must be a minimum of 25 square inches, and means must be provided to prevent clogging of any system opening, as well as to ensure adequate communication to all areas of the insulation space. If a safety vent is a part of the system, it must be designed to prevent distortion of the rupture disc when the annular space is evacuated.
                (e) Piping system. Where a piping circuit can be isolated by closing a valve, means for pressure relief must be provided.

                Each valve, gage, closure and pressure relief device, with the exception of secondary relief valves for the protection of isolated piping, must be enclosed within a protective housing. The protective housing must be adequate to protect the enclosed components from direct solar radiation, mud, sand, adverse environmental exposure and mechanical damage incident to normal operation of the tank car. It must be designed to provide reasonable access to the enclosed components for operation, inspection and maintenance and so that vapor concentrations cannot build up to a dangerous level inside the housing in the event of valve leakage or pressure relief valve operation.

                Heat treatment.
                (a) Each necked-down tank shall be uniformly heat treated. Heat treatment shall consist of annealing or normalizing and tempering for Class I, Class II and Class III steel or oil quenching and tempering for Class III steel. Tempering temperatures shall not be less than 1000 °F. Heat treatment of alternate steels shall be approved. All scale shall be removed from outside of tank to an extent sufficient to allow proper inspection.

                (b) To check uniformity of heat treatment, Brinnel hardness tests shall be made at 18 inch intervals on the entire longitudinal axis. The hardness shall not vary more than 35 points in the length of the tank. No hardness tests need be taken within 12 inches from point of head to shell tangency.
                
                (c) A magnetic particle inspection shall be performed after heat treatment on all tanks subjected to a quench and temper treatment to detect the presence of quenching cracks. Cracks shall be removed to sound metal by grinding and the surface exposed shall be blended smoothly into the surrounding area. A wall thickness check shall then be made of the affected area by ultrasonic equipment or other suitable means acceptable to the inspector and if the remaining wall thickness is less than the minimum recorded thickness as determined by § 179.500-4(b) it shall be used for making the calculation prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section.
              
              
                § 179.500-7
                Physical tests.
                (a) Physical tests shall be made on two test specimens 0.505 inch in diameter within 2-inch gauge length, taken 180 degrees apart, one from each ring section cut from each end of each forged or drawn tube before necking-down, or one from each prolongation at each end of each necked-down tank. These test specimen ring sections or prolongations shall be heat treated, with the necked-down tank which they represent. The width of the test specimen ring section must be at least its wall thickness. Only when diameters and wall thickness will not permit removal of 0.505 by 2-inch tensile test bar, laid in the transverse direction, may test bar cut in the longitudinal direction be substituted. When the thickness will not permit obtaining a 0.505 specimen, then the largest diameter specimen obtainable in the longitudinal direction shall be used. Specimens shall have bright surface and a reduced section. When 0.505 specimen is not used the gauge length shall be a ratio of 4 to 1 length to diameter.
                (b) Elastic limit as determined by extensometer, shall not exceed 70 percent of tensile strength for class I steel or 85 percent of tensile strength for class II and class III steel. Determination shall be made at cross head speed of not more than 0.125 inch per minute with an extensometer reading to 0.0002 inch. The extensometer shall be read at increments of stress not exceeding 5,000 psi. The stress at which the strain first exceeds
                
                  stress (psi) /30,000,000 (psi) + 0.005 (inches per inch)
                
                shall be recorded as the elastic limit.

                (1) Elongation shall be at least 18 percent and reduction of area at least 35 percent.
                
                
                  Note 1:
                  Upon approval, the ratio of elastic limit to ultimate strength may be raised to permit use of special alloy steels of definite composition that will give equal or better physical properties than steels herein specified.

                Pt. 179, App. A
                Appendix A to Part 179—Procedures for Tank-Head Puncture-Resistance Test
                1. This test procedure is designed to verify the integrity of new or untried tank-head puncture-resistance systems and to test for system survivability after coupler-to-tank-head impacts at relative speeds of 29 km/hour (18 mph). Tank-head puncture-resistance is a function of one or more of the following: Head thickness, jacket thickness, insulation thickness, and material of construction.
                2. Tank-head puncture-resistance test. A tank-head puncture-resistance system must be tested under the following conditions:
                a. The ram car used must weigh at least 119,295 kg (263,000 pounds), be equipped with a coupler, and duplicate the condition of a conventional draft sill including the draft yoke and draft gear. The coupler must protrude from the end of the ram car so that it is the leading location of perpendicular contact with the impacted test car.
                b. The impacted test car must be loaded with water at six percent outage with internal pressure of at least 6.9 Bar (100 psig) and coupled to one or more “backup” cars which have a total weight of 217,724 kg (480,000 pounds) with hand brakes applied on the last “backup” car.
                c. At least two separate tests must be conducted with the coupler on the vertical centerline of the ram car. One test must be conducted with the coupler at a height of 53.3 cm (21 inches), plus-or-minus 2.5 cm (1 inch), above the top of the sill; the other test must be conducted with the coupler height at 79 cm (31 inches), plus-or-minus 2.5 cm (1 inch), above the top of the sill. If the combined thickness of the tank head and any additional shielding material is less than the combined thickness on the vertical centerline of the car, a third test must be conducted with the coupler positioned so as to strike the thinnest point of the tank head.
                3. One of the following test conditions must be applied:
                
                  
                    Minimum weight of attached ram cars in kg (pounds)
                    Minimum velocity of impact in km/hour (mph)
                    Restrictions
                  
                  
                    119,295 (263,000)
                    29 (18)
                    One ram car only.
                  
                  
                    155,582 (343,000)
                    25.5 (16)
                    One ram car or one car plus one rigidly attached car.
                  
                  
                    311,164 (686,000)
                    22.5 (14)
                    One ram car plus one or more rigidly attached cars.
                  
                
                4. A test is successful if there is no visible leak from the standing tank car for at least one hour after impact.

                Pt. 179, App. B
                Appendix B to Part 179—Procedures for Simulated Pool and Torch-Fire Testing
                1. This test procedure is designed to measure the thermal effects of new or untried thermal protection systems and to test for system survivability when exposed to a 100-minute pool fire and a 30-minute torch fire.
                2. Simulated pool fire test.
                
                a. A pool-fire environment must be simulated in the following manner:
                (1) The source of the simulated pool fire must be hydrocarbon fuel with a flame temperature of 871 °C plus or minus 55.6 °C (1600  °F plus-or-minus 100  °F) throughout the duration of the test.
                (2) A square bare plate with thermal properties equivalent to the material of construction of the tank car must be used. The plate dimensions must be not less than one foot by one foot by nominal 1.6 cm (0.625 inch) thick. The bare plate must be instrumented with not less than nine thermocouples to record the thermal response of the bare plate. The thermocouples must be attached to the surface not exposed to the simulated pool fire and must be divided into nine equal squares with a thermocouple placed in the center of each square.
                (3) The pool-fire simulator must be constructed in a manner that results in total flame engulfment of the front surface of the bare plate. The apex of the flame must be directed at the center of the plate.
                (4) The bare plate holder must be constructed in such a manner that the only heat transfer to the back side of the bare plate is by heat conduction through the plate and not by other heat paths.
                (5) Before the bare plate is exposed to the simulated pool fire, none of the temperature recording devices may indicate a plate temperature in excess of 37.8 °C (100 °F) nor less than 0 °C (32 °F).
                (6) A minimum of two thermocouple devices must indicate 427 °C (800 °F) after 13 minutes, plus-or-minus one minute, of simulated pool-fire exposure.
                b. A thermal protection system must be tested in the simulated pool-fire environment described in paragraph 2a of this appendix in the following manner:
                (1) The thermal protection system must cover one side of a bare plate as described in paragraph 2a(2) of this appendix.
                (2) The non-protected side of the bare plate must be instrumented with not less than nine thermocouples placed as described in paragraph 2a(2) of this appendix to record the thermal response of the plate.
                (3) Before exposure to the pool-fire simulation, none of the thermocouples on the thermal protection system configuration may indicate a plate temperature in excess of 37.8 °C (100 °F) nor less than 0 °C (32 °F).
                (4) The entire surface of the thermal protection system must be exposed to the simulated pool fire.
                (5) A pool-fire simulation test must run for a minimum of 100 minutes. The thermal protection system must retard the heat flow to the plate so that none of the thermocouples on the non-protected side of the plate indicate a plate temperature in excess of 427 °C (800 °F).
                (6) A minimum of three consecutive successful simulation fire tests must be performed for each thermal protection system.
                3. Simulated torch fire test.
                
                a. A torch-fire environment must be simulated in the following manner:
                (1) The source of the simulated torch must be a hydrocarbon fuel with a flame temperature of 1,204 °C plus-or-minus 55.6 °C (2,200 °F plus or minus 100 °F), throughout the duration of the test. Furthermore, torch velocities must be 64.4 km/h ±16 km/h (40 mph ±10 mph) throughout the duration of the test.
                (2) A square bare plate with thermal properties equivalent to the material of construction of the tank car must be used. The plate dimensions must be at least four feet by four feet by nominal 1.6 cm (0.625 inch) thick. The bare plate must be instrumented with not less than nine thermocouples to record the thermal response of the plate. The thermocouples must be attached to the surface not exposed to the simulated torch and must be divided into nine equal squares with a thermocouple placed in the center of each square.
                (3) The bare plate holder must be constructed in such a manner that the only heat transfer to the back side of the plate is by heat conduction through the plate and not by other heat paths. The apex of the flame must be directed at the center of the plate.
                (4) Before exposure to the simulated torch, none of the temperature recording devices may indicate a plate temperature in excess of 37.8 °C (100 °F) or less than 0 °C (32 °F).
                (5) A minimum of two thermocouples must indicate 427 °C (800 °F) in four minutes, plus-or-minus 30 seconds, of torch simulation exposure.
                b. A thermal protection system must be tested in the simulated torch-fire environment described in paragraph 3a of this appendix in the following manner:
                (1) The thermal protection system must cover one side of the bare plate identical to that used to simulate a torch fire under paragraph 3a(2) of this appendix.
                (2) The back of the bare plate must be instrumented with not less than nine thermocouples placed as described in paragraph 3a(2) of this appendix to record the thermal response of the material.

                (3) Before exposure to the simulated torch, none of the thermocouples on the back side of the thermal protection system configuration may indicate a plate temperature in excess of 37.8 °C (100 °F) nor less than 0 °C (32 °F).
                (4) The entire outside surface of the thermal protection system must be exposed to the simulated torch-fire environment.
                (5) A torch-simulation test must be run for a minimum of 30 minutes. The thermal protection system must retard the heat flow to the plate so that none of the thermocouples on the backside of the bare plate indicate a plate temperature in excess of 427 °C (800 °F).
                (6) A minimum of two consecutive successful torch-simulation tests must be performed for each thermal protection system.

                § 180.203
                Definitions.
                As used in this section, the word “cylinder” includes UN pressure receptacles. In addition to the definitions contained in § 171.8 of this subchapter, the following definitions apply to this subpart:
                
                  Commercially free of corrosive components means a hazardous material having a dew point at or below minus 46.7 °C (minus 52 °F) at 101kPa (1 atmosphere) and free of components that will adversely react with the cylinder (e.g. chemical stress corrosion).
                
                
                  Condemn means a determination that a cylinder is unserviceable for the continued transportation of hazardous materials in commerce and that the cylinder may not be restored by repair, rebuilding, requalification, or any other procedure.
                
                  Defect means an imperfection requiring removal of a cylinder from service.
                
                  Elastic expansion means a temporary increase in a cylinder's volume, due to application of pressure, that is lost when pressure is released (elastic expansion = total expansion minus permanent expansion).
                
                  Filled or charged means an introduction or presence of a hazardous material in a cylinder.
                
                  Non-corrosive service means a hazardous material that, in the presence of moisture, is not corrosive to the materials of construction of a cylinder (including valve, pressure relief device, etc.).
                
                  Over-heated means a condition in which the temperature of any portion of an aluminum cylinder has reached 176 °C (350 °F) or higher, or in which the temperature of any portion of a steel or nickel cylinder has reached 343 °C (650 °F) or higher.
                
                  Permanent expansion means a permanent increase in a cylinder's volume after the test pressure is released.
                
                  Proof pressure test means a pressure test by interior pressurization without the determination of a cylinder's expansion.
                
                  Rebuild means the replacement of a pressure part (e.g. a wall, head, or pressure fitting) by welding.
                
                  Rejected cylinder means a cylinder that cannot be used for the transportation of a hazardous material in commerce without repair, rebuilding, and requalification.
                
                  Repair means a procedure for correction of a rejected cylinder that may involve welding.
                
                  Requalification means the completion of a visual inspection and/or the test(s) required to be performed on a cylinder to determine its suitability for continued service.

                  Total expansion means the total increase in a cylinder's volume due to application of the test pressure.
                
                  Visual inspection means an internal or external visual examination, or both, performed as part of the cylinder requalification process.
                
                  Volumetric expansion test means a pressure test to determine the total and permanent expansion of a cylinder at a given pressure. The volumetric expansion test is conducted using the water jacket or direct expansion methods:
                (1) Water jacket method means a volumetric expansion test to determine a cylinder's total and permanent expansion by measuring the difference between the volume of water the cylinder externally displaces at test pressure and the volume of water the cylinder externally displaces at ambient pressure.
                (2) Direct expansion method means a volumetric expansion test to calculate a cylinder's total and permanent expansion by measuring the amount of water forced into a cylinder at test pressure, adjusted for the compressibility of water, as a means of determining the expansion.
                [67 FR 51660, Aug. 8, 2002, as amended at 71 FR 33894, June 12, 2006]
              
              
                § 180.205
                General requirements for requalification of specification cylinders.
                (a) General. Each cylinder used for the transportation of hazardous materials must be an authorized packaging. To qualify as an authorized packaging, each cylinder must conform to this subpart, the applicable requirements specified in part 173 of this subchapter, and the applicable requirements of subpart C of part 178 of this subchapter.
                (b) Persons performing requalification functions. No person may represent that a repair or requalification of a cylinder has been performed in accordance with the requirements in this subchapter unless that person holds a current approval issued under the procedural requirements prescribed in subpart I of part 107 of this chapter. No person may mark a cylinder with a RIN and a requalification date or otherwise represent that a DOT specification or special permit cylinder has been requalified unless all applicable requirements of this subpart have been met. A person who requalifies cylinders must maintain the records prescribed in § 180.215 at each location at which it inspects, tests, or marks cylinders.
                (c) Periodic requalification of cylinders. Each cylinder bearing a DOT, CRC, BTC, or CTC specification marking must be requalified and marked as specified in the Requalification Table in this subpart or requalified and marked by a facility registered by Transport Canada in accordance with the Transport Canada TDG Regulations (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). Each cylinder bearing both a TC specification marking and also marked with a corresponding DOT specification marking must be requalified and marked as specified in the Requalification Table in this subpart or requalified and marked by a facility registered by Transport Canada in accordance with the Transport Canada TDG Regulations (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). Each cylinder bearing a DOT special permit number must be requalified and marked in conformance with this section and the terms of the applicable special permit. Each cylinder bearing only a TC mark must be requalified and marked as specified in the Transport Canada TDG Regulations (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), except that registration with Transport Canada is not required and cylinders must be marked with the requalifiers DOT issued requalifier identification number. No cylinder may be filled with a hazardous material and offered for transportation in commerce unless that cylinder has been successfully requalified and marked in accordance with this subpart. A cylinder may be requalified at any time during or before the month and year that the requalification is due. However, a cylinder filled before the requalification becomes due may remain in service until it is emptied. A cylinder with a specified service life may not be refilled and offered for transportation after its authorized service life has expired.
                (1) Each cylinder that is requalified in accordance with the requirements specified in this section must be marked in accordance with § 180.213 or the requirements of the Transport Canada TDG Regulations, or in the case of a TC cylinder requalified in the United States by a DOT RIN holder, in accordance with the requirements of the Transport Canada TDG Regulations except that registration with Transport Canada is not required and cylinders must be marked with the requalifiers DOT issued requalifier identification number.
                (2) Each cylinder that fails requalification must be:
                (i) Rejected and may be repaired or rebuilt in accordance with § 180.211 or § 180.212, as appropriate; or
                (ii) Condemned in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section.
                (3) For DOT specification cylinders, the marked service pressure may be changed upon approval of the Associate Administrator and in accordance with written procedures specified in the approval.
                (4) For a specification 3, 3A, 3AA, 3AL, 3AX, 3AAX, 3B, 3BN, or 3T cylinder filled with gases in other than Division 2.2, from the first requalification due on or after December 31, 2003, the burst pressure of a CG-1, CG-4, or CG-5 pressure relief device must be at test pressure with a tolerance of plus zero to minus 10%. An additional 5% tolerance is allowed when a combined rupture disc is placed inside a holder. This requirement does not apply if a CG-2, CG-3 or CG-9 thermally activated relief device or a CG-7 reclosing pressure valve is used on the cylinder.
                (d) Conditions requiring test and inspection of cylinders. Without regard to any other periodic requalification requirements, a cylinder must be tested and inspected in accordance with this section prior to further use if—
                (1) The cylinder shows evidence of dents, corrosion, cracked or abraded areas, leakage, thermal damage, or any other condition that might render it unsafe for use in transportation;

                (2) The cylinder has been in an accident and has been damaged to an extent that may adversely affect its lading retention capability;
                
                (3) The cylinder shows evidence of or is known to have been over-heated; or
                (4) The Associate Administrator determines that the cylinder may be in an unsafe condition.
                (e) Cylinders containing Class 8 (corrosive) liquids. A cylinder previously containing a Class 8 (corrosive) liquid may not be used to transport a Class 2 material in commerce unless the cylinder is—
                (1) Visually inspected, internally and externally, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section and the inspection is recorded as prescribed in § 180.215;
                (2) Requalified in accordance with this section, regardless of the date of the previous requalification;
                (3) Marked in accordance with § 180.213; and
                (4) Decontaminated to remove all significant residue or impregnation of the Class 8 material.
                (f) Visual inspection. Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, each time a cylinder is pressure tested, it must be given an internal and external visual inspection.
                (1) The visual inspection must be performed in accordance with the following CGA Pamphlets: C-6 for steel and nickel cylinders (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter); C-6.1 for seamless aluminum cylinders (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter); C-6.2 for fiber reinforced composite special permit cylinders (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter); C-6.3 for low pressure aluminum cylinders (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter); C-8 for DOT 3HT cylinders (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter); and C-13 for DOT 8 series cylinders (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (2) For each cylinder with a coating or attachments that would inhibit inspection of the cylinder, the coating or attachments must be removed before performing the visual inspection.
                (3) Each cylinder subject to visual inspection must be approved, rejected, or condemned according to the criteria in the applicable CGA pamphlet.
                (4) In addition to other requirements prescribed in this paragraph (f), each specification cylinder manufactured of aluminum alloy 6351-T6 and used in self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA), self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), or oxygen service must be inspected for sustained load cracking in accordance with Appendix C of this part at the first scheduled 5-year requalification period after January 1, 2007, and every five years thereafter.
                (g) Pressure test. (1) Unless otherwise provided, each cylinder required to be retested under this subpart must be retested by means suitable for measuring the expansion of the cylinder under pressure. Bands and other removable attachments must be loosened or removed before testing so that the cylinder is free to expand in all directions.
                (2) The pressure indicating device of the testing apparatus must permit reading of pressures to within 1% of the minimum prescribed test pressure of each cylinder tested, except that for an analog device, interpolation to 1/2 of the marked gauge divisions is acceptable. The expansion-indicating device of the testing apparatus must also permit incremental reading of the cylinder expansion to 1% of the total expansion of each cylinder tested or 0.1 cc, whichever is larger. Midpoint visual interpolation is permitted.
                (3) Each day before retesting, the retester shall confirm, by using a calibrated cylinder or other method authorized in writing by the Associate Administrator, that:
                (i) The pressure-indicating device, as part of the retest apparatus, is accurate within ±1.0% of the prescribed test pressure of any cylinder tested that day. The pressure indicating device, itself, must be certified as having an accuracy of ±0.5%, or better, of its full range, and must permit readings of pressure from 90%-110% of the minimum prescribed test pressure of the cylinder to be tested. The accuracy of the pressure indicating device within the test system can be demonstrated at any point within 500 psig of the actual test pressure for test pressures at or above 3000 psig, or 10% of the actual test pressure for test pressures below 3000 psig.

                (ii) The expansion-indicating device, as part of the retest apparatus, gives a stable reading of expansion and is accurate to ±1.0% of the total expansion of any cylinder tested or 0.1 cc, whichever is larger. The expansion-indicating device itself must have an accuracy of ±0.5%, or better, of its full scale.
                (4) The test equipment must be verified to be accurate within ±1.0% of the calibrated cylinder's pressure and corresponding expansion values. This may be accomplished by bringing the pressure to a value shown on the calibration certificate for the calibrated cylinder used and verifying that the resulting total expansion is within ±1.0% of the total expansion shown on the calibration certificate. Alternatively, calibration may be demonstrated by bringing the total expansion to a known value on the calibration certificate for the calibrated cylinder used and verifying that the resulting pressure is within ±1.0% of the pressure shown on the calibration certificate. The calibrated cylinder must show no permanent expansion. The retester must demonstrate calibration in conformance with this paragraph (g) to an authorized inspector on any day that it retests cylinders. A retester must maintain calibrated cylinder certificates in conformance with § 180.215(b)(4).
                (5) Minimum test pressure must be maintained for at least 30 seconds, and as long as necessary for complete expansion of the cylinder. A system check may be performed at or below 90% of test pressure prior to the retest. In the case of a malfunction of the test equipment, the test may be repeated at a pressure increased by 10% or 100 psig, whichever is less. This paragraph (g) does not authorize retest of a cylinder otherwise required to be condemned under paragraph (i) of this section.
                (6) Training materials may be used for training persons who requalify cylinders using the volumetric expansion test method.
                (h) Cylinder rejection. A cylinder must be rejected when, after a visual inspection, it meets a condition for rejection under the visual inspection requirements of paragraph (f) of this section.
                (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (h)(3) and (h)(4) of this section, a cylinder that is rejected may not be marked as meeting the requirements of this section.
                (2) The requalifier must notify the cylinder owner, in writing, that the cylinder has been rejected.
                (3) Unless the cylinder is requalified in conformance with requirements in § 180.211, it may not be filled with a hazardous material and offered for transportation in commerce where use of a specification packaging is required.
                (4) A rejected cylinder with a service pressure of less than 900 psig may be requalified and marked if the cylinder is repaired or rebuilt and subsequently inspected and tested in conformance with—
                (i) The visual inspection requirements of paragraph (f) of this section;
                (ii) Part 178 of this subchapter and this part;
                (iii) Any special permit covering the manufacture, requalification, and/or use of that cylinder; and
                (iv) Any approval required under § 180.211.

                (i) The cylinder meets a condition for condemnation under the visual inspection requirements of paragraph (f) of this section.
                (ii) The cylinder leaks through its wall.
                (iii) Evidence of cracking exists to the extent that the cylinder is likely to be weakened appreciably.
                (iv) For a DOT specification cylinder, other than a DOT 4E aluminum cylinder or a special permit cylinder, permanent expansion exceeds 10 percent of total expansion.
                (v) For a DOT 3HT cylinder—
                (A) The pressure test yields an elastic expansion exceeding the marked rejection elastic expansion (REE) value.
                (B) The cylinder shows evidence of denting or bulging.
                (C) The cylinder bears a manufacture or an original test date older than twenty-four years or after 4380 pressurizations, whichever occurs first. If a cylinder is refilled, on average, more than once every other day, an accurate record of the number of rechargings must be maintained by the cylinder owner or the owner's agent.

                (vi) For a DOT 4E aluminum cylinder, permanent expansion exceeds 12 percent of total expansion.
                
                (vii) For a DOT special permit cylinder, permanent expansion exceeds the limit in the applicable special permit, or the cylinder meets another criterion for condemnation in the applicable special permit.

                (a) General. (1) Each UN pressure receptacle used for the transportation of hazardous materials must conform to the requirements prescribed in paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) in § 180.205.
                (2) No pressure receptacle due for requalification may be filled with a hazardous material and offered for transportation in commerce unless that pressure receptacle has been successfully requalified and marked in accordance with this subpart. A pressure receptacle may be requalified at any time during or before the month and year that the requalification is due. However, a pressure receptacle filled before the requalification becomes due may remain in service until it is emptied.
                (3) No person may requalify a UN composite pressure receptacle for continued use beyond its 15-years authorized service life. A pressure receptacle with a specified service life may not be refilled and offered for transportation after its authorized service life has expired unless approval has been obtained in writing from the Associate Administrator.
                (b) Periodic requalification of UN pressure receptacles. (1) Each pressure receptacle that is successfully requalified in accordance with the requirements specified in this section must be marked in accordance with § 180.213. The requalification results must be recorded in accordance § 180.215.
                (2) Each pressure receptacle that fails requalification must be rejected or condemned in accordance with the applicable ISO requalification standard.
                (c) Requalification interval. Each UN pressure receptacle that becomes due for periodic requalification must be requalified at the interval specified in the following table:

                (b) DOT 3A or 3AA cylinders. (1) A cylinder conforming to specification DOT 3A or 3AA with a water capacity of 56.7 kg (125 lb) or less that is removed from any cluster, bank, group, rack, or vehicle each time it is filled, may be requalified every ten years instead of every five years, provided the cylinder conforms to all of the following conditions:
                (i) The cylinder was manufactured after December 31, 1945.

                (ii) The cylinder is used exclusively for air; argon; cyclopropane; ethylene; helium; hydrogen; krypton; neon; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; oxygen; sulfur hexafluoride; xenon; chlorinated hydrocarbons, fluorinated hydrocarbons, liquefied hydrocarbons, and mixtures thereof that are commercially free from corroding components; permitted mixtures of these gases (see § 173.301(d) of this subchapter); and permitted mixtures of these gases with up to 30 percent by volume of carbon dioxide, provided the gas has a dew point at or below minus (52 °F) at 1 atmosphere.
                (iii) Before each refill, the cylinder is removed from any cluster, bank, group, rack or vehicle and passes the hammer test specified in CGA Pamphlet C-6 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (iv) The cylinder is dried immediately after hydrostatic testing to remove all traces of water.
                (v) The cylinder is not used for underwater breathing.
                (vi) Each cylinder is stamped with a five-pointed star at least one-fourth of an inch high immediately following the test date.
                (2) If, since the last required requalification, a cylinder has not been used exclusively for the gases specifically identified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, but currently conforms with all other provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, it may be requalified every 10 years instead of every five years, provided it is first requalified and examined as prescribed by § 173.302a(b) (2), (3) and (4) of this subchapter.
                (3) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if a cylinder, marked with a star, is filled with a compressed gas other than as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the star following the most recent test date must be obliterated. The cylinder must be requalified five years from the marked test date, or prior to the first filling with a compressed gas, if the required five-year requalification period has passed.
                (c) DOT 4-series cylinders. A DOT 4-series cylinder, except a 4L cylinder, that at any time shows evidence of a leak or of internal or external corrosion, denting, bulging or rough usage to the extent that it is likely to be weakened appreciably, or that has lost five percent or more of its official tare weight must be requalified before being refilled and offered for transportation. (Refer to CGA Pamphlet C-6 or C-6.3, as applicable, regarding cylinder weakening.) After testing, the actual tare weight must be recorded as the new tare weight.
                (d) Cylinders 5.44 kg (12 lb) or less with service pressures of 300 psig or less. A cylinder of 5.44 (12 lb) or less water capacity authorized for service pressure of 300 psig or less must be given a complete external visual inspection at the time periodic requalification becomes due. External visual inspection must be in accordance with CGA Pamphlet C-6 or C-6.1 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). The cylinder may be proof pressure tested. The test is successful if the cylinder, when examined under test pressure, does not display a defect described in § 180.205(i)(1) (ii) or (iii). Upon successful completion of the test and inspection, the cylinder must be marked in accordance with § 180.213.
                (e) Proof pressure test. A cylinder made in conformance with DOT Specifications 4B, 4BA, 4BW, or 4E protected externally by a suitable corrosion-resistant coating and used exclusively for non-corrosive gas that is commercially free from corroding components may be requalified by volumetric expansion testing or proof pressure testing every 10 years instead of every 5 years. When subjected to a proof pressure test, the cylinder must be carefully examined under test pressure and removed from service if a leak or defect is found.
                (f) Poisonous materials. A cylinder conforming to specification DOT 3A, 3AA, 3B, 4BA, or 4BW having a service pressure of 300 psig or less and used exclusively for methyl bromide, liquid; mixtures of methyl bromide and ethylene dibromide, liquid; mixtures of methyl bromide and chlorpicrin, liquid; mixtures of methyl bromide and petroleum solvents, liquid; or methyl bromide and nonflammable, nonliquefied compressed gas mixtures, liquid; commercially free of corroding components, and protected externally by a suitable corrosion resistant coating (such as galvanizing or painting) and internally by a suitable corrosion resistant lining (such as galvanizing) may be tested every 10 years instead of every five years, provided a visual internal and external examination of the cylinder is conducted every five years in accordance with CGA Pamphlet C-6. The cylinder must be examined at each filling, and rejected if a dent, corroded area, leak or other condition indicates possible weakness.
                (g) Visual inspections. A cylinder conforming to a specification listed in the table in this paragraph and used exclusively in the service indicated may, instead of a periodic hydrostatic test, be given a complete external visual inspection at the time periodic requalification becomes due. External visual inspection must be in accordance with CGA Pamphlet C-6 or C-6.3, as applicable (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). When this inspection is used instead of hydrostatic pressure testing, subsequent inspections are required at five-year intervals after the first inspection. After May 31, 2004, inspections must be made only by persons holding a current RIN and the results recorded and maintained in accordance with § 180.215.

                § 180.213
                Requalification markings.
                (a) General. Each cylinder or UN pressure receptacle requalified in accordance with this subpart with acceptable results must be marked as specified in this section. Required specification markings may not be altered or removed.
                (b) Placement of markings. Each cylinder must be plainly and permanently marked on the metal of the cylinder as permitted by the applicable specification. Unless authorized by the cylinder specification, marking on the cylinder sidewall is prohibited.
                (1) Requalification and required specification markings must be legible so as to be readily visible at all times. Illegible specification markings may be remarked on the cylinder as provided by the original specification. Requalification markings may be placed on any portion of the upper end of the cylinder excluding the sidewall, as provided in this section. Requalification and required specification markings that are illegible may be reproduced on a metal plate and attached as provided by the original specification.
                (2) Previous requalification markings may not be obliterated, except that, when the space originally provided for requalification dates becomes filled, additional dates may be added as follows:
                (i) All preceding requalification dates may be removed by peening provided that—

                (A) Permission is obtained from the cylinder owner;
                
                (B) The minimum wall thickness is maintained in accordance with manufacturing specifications for the cylinder; and
                (C) The original manufacturing test date is not removed.
                (ii) When the cylinder is fitted with a footring, additional dates may be marked on the external surface of the footring.
                (c) Requalification marking method. The depth of requalification markings may not be greater than specified in the applicable specification. The markings must be made by stamping, engraving, scribing, or applying a label embedded in epoxy that will remain legible and durable throughout the life of the cylinder, or by other methods that produce a legible, durable mark.
                (1) A cylinder used as a fire extinguisher (§ 180.209(j)) may be marked by using a pressure sensitive label.
                (2) For a DOT 3HT cylinder, the test date and RIN must be applied by low-stress steel stamps to a depth no greater than that prescribed at the time of manufacture. Stamping on the sidewall is not authorized.
                (3) For a composite cylinder, the requalification markings must be applied on a pressure sensitive label, securely affixed in a manner prescribed by the cylinder manufacturer, near the original manufacturer's label. Stamping of the composite surface is not authorized.
                (d) Requalification markings. Each cylinder successfully passing requalification must be marked with the RIN set in a square pattern, between the month and year of the requalification date. The first character of the RIN must appear in the upper left corner of the square pattern; the second in the upper right; the third in the lower right; and the fourth in the lower left. Example: A cylinder requalified in September 2006, and approved by a person who has been issued RIN “A123”, would be marked plainly and permanently into the metal of the cylinder in accordance with location requirements of the cylinder specification or on a metal plate permanently secured to the cylinder in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. An example of the markings prescribed in this paragraph (d) is as follows:
                        A1
                
                  9           06  X
                
                        32
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  “9” is the month of requalification
                  “A123” is the RIN
                  “06” is the year of requalification, and
                  “X” represents the symbols described in paragraphs (f)(2) through (f)(8) of this section.
                
                
                (1) Upon written request, variation from the marking requirement may be approved by the Associate Administrator.
                (2) Exception. A cylinder subject to the requirements of § 171.23(a)(4) of this subchapter may not be marked with a RIN.
                (e) Size of markings. The size of the markings must be at least 6.35 mm (1/4 in.) high, except RIN characters must be at least 3.18 mm (1/8 in.) high.
                (f) Marking illustrations. Examples of required requalification markings for DOT specification and special permit cylinders are illustrated as follows:
                (1) For designation of the 5-year volumetric expansion test, 10-year volumetric expansion test for UN cylinders and cylinders conforming to § 180.209(f) and (h), or 12-year volumetric expansion test for fire extinguishers conforming to § 173.309(a) of this subchapter and cylinders conforming to § 180.209(e) and (g), the marking is as illustrated in paragraph (d) of this section.

                § 180.217
                Requalification requirements for MEGCs.
                (a) Periodic inspections. Each MEGC must be given an initial visual inspection and test in accordance with § 178.75(i) of this subchapter before being put into service for the first time. After the initial inspection, a MEGC must be inspected at least once every five years.
                (1) The 5-year periodic inspection must include an external examination of the structure, the pressure receptacles and the service equipment, as follows:
                (i) The pressure receptacles are inspected externally for pitting, corrosion, abrasions, dents, distortions, defects in welds or any other conditions, including leakage, that might render the MEGC unsafe for transport.
                (ii) The piping, valves, and gaskets are inspected for corroded areas, defects, and other conditions, including leakage, that might render the MEGC unsafe for filling, discharge or transport.
                (iii) Missing or loose bolts or nuts on any flanged connection or blank flange are replaced or tightened.

                (iv) All emergency devices and valves are free from corrosion, distortion and any damage or defect that could prevent their normal operation. Remote closure devices and self-closing stop valves must be operated to demonstrate proper operation.
                (v) Required markings on the MEGC are legible in accordance with the applicable requirements.
                (vi) The framework, the supports and the arrangements for lifting the MEGC are in satisfactory condition.
                (2) The MEGC's pressure receptacles and piping must be periodically requalified as prescribed in § 180.207(c), at the interval specified in Table 1 in § 180.207.
                (b) Exceptional inspection and test. If a MEGC shows evidence of damaged or corroded areas, leakage, or other conditions that indicate a deficiency that could affect the integrity of the MEGC, an exceptional inspection and test must be performed, regardless of the last periodic inspection and test. The extent of the exceptional inspection and test will depend on the amount of damage or deterioration of the MEGC. As a minimum, an exceptional inspection of a MEGC must include inspection as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
                (c) Correction of unsafe condition. When evidence of any unsafe condition is discovered, the MEGC may not be returned to service until the unsafe condition has been corrected and the MEGC has been requalified in accordance with the applicable tests and inspection.
                (d) Repairs and modifications to MEGCs. No person may perform a modification to an approved MEGC that may affect conformance to the applicable ISO standard or safe use, and that involve a change to the design type or affect its ability to retain the hazardous material in transportation. Before making any modification changes to an approved MEGC, the owner must obtain approval from the Associate Administrator as prescribed in § 178.74 of this subchapter. The repair of a MEGC's structural equipment is authorized provided such repairs are made in accordance with the requirements prescribed for its approved design and construction. Any repair to the pressure receptacles of a MEGC must meet the requirements of § 180.212.
                (e) Requalification markings. Each MEGC must be durably and legibly marked in English, with the year and month, and the type of the most recent periodic requalification performed (e.g., 2004-05 AE/UE, where “AE” represents acoustic emission and “UE” represents ultrasonic examination) followed by the stamp of the approval agency who performed or witnessed the most recent test.
                (f) Records. The owner of each MEGC or the owner's authorized agent must retain a written record of the date and results of all repairs and required inspections and tests. The report must contain the name and address of the person performing the inspection or test. The periodic test and inspection records must be retained until the next inspection or test is completed. Repair records and the initial exceptional inspection and test records must be retained during the period the MEGC is in service and for one year thereafter. These records must be made available for inspection by a representative of the Department on request.

              Subpart D—Qualification and Maintenance of IBCs
              
                § 180.350
                Applicability and definitions.
                This subpart prescribes requirements, in addition to those contained in parts 107, 171, 172, 173 and 178 of this subchapter, applicable to any person responsible for the continuing qualification, maintenance, or periodic retesting of an IBC. The following definitions apply:
                (a) Remanufactured IBCs are metal, rigid plastic or composite IBCs produced as a UN type from a non-UN type, or are converted from one UN design type to another UN design type. Remanufactured IBCs are subject to the same requirements of this subchapter that apply to new IBCs of the same type (also see § 178.801(c)(1) of this subchapter for design type definition).
                (b) Repaired IBCs are metal, rigid plastic or composite IBCs that, as a result of impact or for any other cause (such as corrosion, embrittlement or other evidence of reduced strength as compared to the design type), are restored so as to conform to the design type and to be able to withstand the design type tests. For the purposes of this subchapter, the replacement of the rigid inner receptacle of a composite IBC with one from the original manufacturer is considered a repair. Routine maintenance of IBCs (see definition in paragraph (c) of this section) is not considered repair. The bodies of rigid plastic IBCs and the inner receptacles of composite IBCs are not repairable.
                (c) Routine maintenance of IBCs is the routine performance on:
                (1) Metal, rigid plastic or composite IBCs of operations such as:
                (i) Cleaning;
                (ii) Removal and reinstallation or replacement of body closures (including associated gaskets), or of service equipment conforming to the original manufacturer's specifications provided that the leaktightness of the IBC is verified; or
                (iii) Restoration of structural equipment not directly performing a hazardous material containment or discharge pressure retention function so as to conform to the design type (for example, the straightening of legs or lifting attachments), provided the containment function of the IBC is not affected.
                (2) Plastics or textile flexible IBCs of operations, such as:
                (i) Cleaning; or
                (ii) Replacement of non-integral components, such as non-integral liners and closure ties, with components conforming to the original manufacturer's specification; provided that these operations do not adversely affect the containment function of the flexible IBC or alter the design type.

                § 180.352
                Requirements for retest and inspection of IBCs.
                (a) General. Each IBC constructed in accordance with a UN standard for which a test or inspection specified in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section is required may not be filled and offered for transportation or transported until the test or inspection has been successfully completed. This paragraph does not apply to any IBC filled prior to the test or inspection due date. The requirements in this section do not apply to DOT 56 and 57 portable tanks.
                (b) Test and inspections for metal, rigid plastic, and composite IBCs. Each IBC is subject to the following test and inspections:
                (1) Each IBC intended to contain solids that are loaded or discharged under pressure or intended to contain liquids must be tested in accordance with the leakproofness test prescribed in § 178.813 of this subchapter prior to its first use in transportation and every 2.5 years thereafter, starting from the date of manufacture or the date of a repair conforming to paragraph (d)(1) of this section. For this test, the IBC is not required to have its closures fitted.
                (2) An external visual inspection must be conducted initially after production and every 2.5 years starting from the date of manufacture or the date of a repair conforming to paragraph (d)(1) of this section to ensure that:
                (i) The IBC is marked in accordance with requirements in § 178.703 of this subchapter. Missing or damaged markings, or markings difficult to read must be restored or returned to original condition.
                (ii) Service equipment is fully functional and free from damage which may cause failure. Missing, broken, or damaged parts must be repaired or replaced.

                (iii) The IBC is capable of withstanding the applicable design qualification tests. The IBC must be externally inspected for cracks, warpage, corrosion or any other damage which might render the IBC unsafe for transportation. An IBC found with such defects must be removed from service or repaired in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. The inner receptacle of a composite IBC must be removed from the outer IBC body for inspection unless the inner receptacle is bonded to the outer body or unless the outer body is constructed in such a way (e.g., a welded or riveted cage) that removal of the inner receptacle is not possible without impairing the integrity of the outer body. Defective inner receptacles must be replaced in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section or the entire IBC must be removed from service. For metal IBCs, thermal insulation must be removed to the extent necessary for proper examination of the IBC body.
                (3) Each metal, rigid plastic and composite IBC must be internally inspected at least every five years to ensure that the IBC is free from damage and to ensure that the IBC is capable of withstanding the applicable design qualification tests.

                    Note 5: A 10-year inspection interval period also applies to cargo tanks constructed of NQT SA-202 or NQT SA-455 steel provided the materials have full-size equivalent (FSE) Charpy vee notch (CVN) energy test data that demonstrated 75% shear-area ductility at 32  °F with an average of 3 or more samples >15 ft-lb FSE with no sample <10 ft-lb FSE.
                
                (d) External visual inspection and testing. The following applies to the external visual inspection and testing of cargo tanks:
                (1) Where insulation precludes a complete external visual inspection as required by paragraphs (d)(2) through (d)(6) of this section, the cargo tank also must be given an internal visual inspection in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. If external visual inspection is precluded because any part of the cargo tank wall is externally lined, coated, or designed to prevent an external visual inspection, those areas of the cargo tank must be internally inspected. If internal visual inspection is precluded because the cargo tank is lined, coated, or designed so as to prevent access for internal inspection, the tank must be hydrostatically or pneumatically tested in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section. Those items able to be externally inspected must be externally inspected and noted in the inspection report.
                (2) The external visual inspection and testing must include as a minimum the following:
                (i) The tank shell and heads must be inspected for corroded or abraded areas, dents, distortions, defects in welds and any other conditions, including leakage, that might render the tank unsafe for transportation service;

                (ii) The piping, valves, and gaskets must be carefully inspected for corroded areas, defects in welds, and other conditions, including leakage, that might render the tank unsafe for transportation service;
                
                (iii) All devices for tightening manhole covers must be operative and there must be no evidence of leakage at manhole covers or gaskets;
                (iv) All emergency devices and valves including self-closing stop valves, excess flow valves and remote closure devices must be free from corrosion, distortion, erosion and any external damage that will prevent safe operation. Remote closure devices and self-closing stop valves must be functioned to demonstrate proper operation;
                (v) Missing bolts, nuts and fusible links or elements must be replaced, and loose bolts and nuts must be tightened;
                (vi) All markings on the cargo tank required by parts 172, 178 and 180 of this subchapter must be legible;
                (vii) [Reserved]
                (viii) All major appurtenances and structural attachments on the cargo tank including, but not limited to, suspension system attachments, connecting structures, and those elements of the upper coupler (fifth wheel) assembly that can be inspected without dismantling the upper coupler (fifth wheel) assembly must be inspected for any corrosion or damage which might prevent safe operation;
                (ix) For cargo tanks transporting lading corrosive to the tank, areas covered by the upper coupler (fifth wheel) assembly must be inspected at least once in each two year period for corroded and abraded areas, dents, distortions, defects in welds, and any other condition that might render the tank unsafe for transportation service. The upper coupler (fifth wheel) assembly must be removed from the cargo tank for this inspection.
                (3) All reclosing pressure relief valves must be externally inspected for any corrosion or damage which might prevent safe operation. All reclosing pressure relief valves on cargo tanks carrying lading corrosive to the valve must be removed from the cargo tank for inspection and testing. Each reclosing pressure relief valve required to be removed and tested must be tested according to the requirements set forth in paragraph (j) of this section.
                (4) Ring stiffeners or other appurtenances, installed on cargo tanks constructed of mild steel or high-strength, low-alloy steel, that create air cavities adjacent to the tank shell that do not allow for external visual inspection must be thickness tested in accordance with paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section, at least once every 2 years. At least four symmetrically distributed readings must be taken to establish an average thickness for the ring stiffener or appurtenance. If any thickness reading is less than the average thickness by more than 10%, thickness testing in accordance with paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section must be conducted from the inside of the cargo tank on the area of the tank wall covered by the appurtenance or ring stiffener.
                (5) Corroded or abraded areas of the cargo tank wall must be thickness tested in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (i)(2), (i)(3), (i)(5) and (i)(6) of this section.
                (6) The gaskets on any full opening rear head must be:
                (i) Visually inspected for cracks or splits caused by weather or wear; and
                (ii) Replaced if cuts or cracks which are likely to cause leakage, or are of a depth one-half inch or more, are found.
                (7) The inspector must record the results of the external visual examination as specified in § 180.417(b).
                (e) Internal visual inspection. (1) When the cargo tank is not equipped with a manhole or inspection opening, or the cargo tank design precludes an internal inspection, the tank shall be hydrostatically or pneumatically tested in accordance with 180.407(c) and (g).
                (2) The internal visual inspection must include as a minimum the following:
                (i) The tank shell and heads must be inspected for corroded and abraded areas, dents, distortions, defects in welds, and any other condition that might render the tank unsafe for transportation service.
                (ii) Tank liners must be inspected as specified in § 180.407(f).
                (3) Corroded or abraded areas of the cargo tank wall must be thickness tested in accordance with paragraphs (i)(2), (i)(3), (i)(5) and (i)(6) of this section.

                (4) The inspector must record the results of the internal visual inspection as specified in § 180.417(b).
                
                (f) Lining inspection. The integrity of the lining on all lined cargo tanks, when lining is required by this subchapter, must be verified at least once each year as follows:
                (1) Rubber (elastomeric) lining must be tested for holes as follows:
                (i) Equipment must consist of:
                (A) A high frequency spark tester capable of producing sufficient voltage to ensure proper calibration;
                (B) A probe with an “L” shaped 2.4 mm (0.09 inch) diameter wire with up to a 30.5 cm (12-inch) bottom leg (end bent to a 12.7 mm (0.5 inch) radius), or equally sensitive probe; and
                (C) A steel calibration coupon 30.5 cm × 30.5 cm (12 inches × 12 inches) covered with the same material and thickness as that to be tested. The material on the coupon shall have a test hole to the metal substrate made by puncturing the material with a 22 gauge hypodermic needle or comparable piercing tool.
                (ii) The probe must be passed over the surface of the calibration coupon in a constant uninterrupted manner until the hole is found. The hole is detected by the white or light blue spark formed. (A sound lining causes a dark blue or purple spark.) The voltage must be adjusted to the lowest setting that will produce a minimum 12.7 mm (0.5 inch) spark measured from the top of the lining to the probe. To assure that the setting on the probe has not changed, the spark tester must be calibrated periodically using the test calibration coupon, and the same power source, probe, and cable length.
                (iii) After calibration, the probe must be passed over the lining in an uninterrupted stroke.
                (iv) Holes that are found must be repaired using equipment and procedures prescribed by the lining manufacturer or lining installer.
                (2) Linings made of other than rubber (elastomeric material) must be tested using equipment and procedures prescribed by the lining manufacturer or lining installer.
                (3) Degraded or defective areas of the cargo tank liner must be removed and the cargo tank wall below the defect must be inspected. Corroded areas of the tank wall must be thickness tested in accordance with paragraphs (i)(2), (i)(3), (i)(5) and (i)(6) of this section.
                (4) The inspector must record the results of the lining inspection as specified in § 180.417(b).
                (g) Pressure test. All components of the cargo tank wall, as defined in § 178.320(a) of this subchapter, must be pressure tested as prescribed by this paragraph.
                (1) Test Procedure—(i) As part of the pressure test, the inspector must perform an external and internal visual inspection, except that on an MC 338 cargo tank, or a cargo tank not equipped with a manhole or inspection opening, an internal inspection is not required.
                (ii) All self-closing pressure relief valves, including emergency relief vents and normal vents, must be removed from the cargo tank for inspection and testing according to the requirements in paragraph (j) of this section.
                (iii) Except for cargo tanks carrying lading corrosive to the tank, areas covered by the upper coupler (fifth wheel) assembly must be inspected for corroded and abraded areas, dents, distortions, defects in welds, and any other condition that might render the tank unsafe for transportation service. The upper coupler (fifth wheel) assembly must be removed from the cargo tank for this inspection.
                (iv) Each cargo tank must be tested hydrostatically or pneumatically to the internal pressure specified in the following table. At no time during the pressure test may a cargo tank be subject to pressures that exceed those identified in Table 1 to paragraph (g)(1)(iv):
                
                  Table 1 to Paragraph (g)(1)(iv)

                (v) [Reserved]
                (vi) Each cargo tank of a multi-tank cargo tank motor vehicle must be tested with the adjacent cargo tanks empty and at atmospheric pressure.
                (vii) All closures except pressure relief devices must be in place during the test. All prescribed loading and unloading venting devices rated at less than test pressure may be removed during the test. If retained, the devices must be rendered inoperative by clamps, plugs, or other equally effective restraining devices. Restraining devices may not prevent detection of leaks or damage the venting devices and must be removed immediately after the test is completed.
                (viii) Hydrostatic test method. Each cargo tank, including its domes, must be filled with water or other liquid having similar viscosity, at a temperature not exceeding 100 °F. The cargo tank must then be pressurized to not less than the pressure specified in paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section. The cargo tank, including its closures, must hold the prescribed test pressure for at least 10 minutes during which time it shall be inspected for leakage, bulging or any other defect.
                (ix) Pneumatic test method. Pneumatic testing may involve higher risk than hydrostatic testing. Therefore, suitable safeguards must be provided to protect personnel and facilities should failure occur during the test. The cargo tank must be pressurized with air or an inert gas. The pneumatic test pressure in the cargo tank must be reached by gradually increasing the pressure to one-half of the test pressure. Thereafter, the pressure must be increased in steps of approximately one-tenth of the test pressure until the required test pressure has been reached. The test pressure must be held for at least 5 minutes. The pressure must then be reduced to the MAWP, which must be maintained during the time the entire cargo tank surface is inspected. During the inspection, a suitable method must be used for detecting the existence of leaks. This method must consist either of coating the entire surface of all joints under pressure with a solution of soap and water, or using other equally sensitive methods.
                (2) When testing an insulated cargo tank, the insulation and jacketing need not be removed unless it is otherwise impossible to reach test pressure and maintain a condition of pressure equilibrium after test pressure is reached, or the vacuum integrity cannot be maintained in the insulation space. If an MC 338 cargo tank used for the transportation of a flammable gas or oxygen, refrigerated liquid is opened for any reason, the cleanliness must be verified prior to closure using the procedures contained in § 178.338-15 of this subchapter.

                (3) Each MC 330 and MC 331 cargo tank constructed of quenched and tempered steel in accordance with Part UHT in Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), or constructed of other than quenched and tempered steel but without postweld heat treatment, used for the transportation of anhydrous ammonia or any other hazardous materials that may cause corrosion stress cracking, must be internally inspected by the wet fluorescent magnetic particle method immediately prior to and in conjunction with the performance of the pressure test prescribed in this section. Each MC 330 and MC 331 cargo tank constructed of quenched and tempered steel in accordance with Part UHT in Section VIII of the ASME Code and used for the transportation of liquefied petroleum gas must be internally inspected by the wet fluorescent magnetic particle method immediately prior to and in conjunction with the performance of the pressure test prescribed in this section. The wet fluorescent magnetic particle inspection must be in accordance with Section V of the ASME Code and CGA Technical Bulletin TB-2 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). This paragraph does not apply to cargo tanks that do not have manholes. (See § 180.417(c) for reporting requirements.)
                (4) All pressure bearing portions of a cargo tank heating system employing a medium such as, but not limited to, steam or hot water for heating the lading must be hydrostatically pressure tested at least once every 5 years. The test pressure must be at least the maximum system design operating pressure and must be maintained for five minutes. A heating system employing flues for heating the lading must be tested to ensure against lading leakage into the flues or into the atmosphere.
                (5) Exceptions. (i) Pressure testing is not required for MC 330 and MC 331 cargo tanks in dedicated sodium metal service.
                (ii) Pressure testing is not required for uninsulated lined cargo tanks, with a design pressure or MAWP of 15 psig or less, which receive an external visual inspection and a lining inspection at least once each year.
                (6) Acceptance criteria. A cargo tank that leaks, fails to retain test pressure or pneumatic inspection pressure, shows distortion, excessive permanent expansion, or other evidence of weakness that might render the cargo tank unsafe for transportation service, may not be returned to service, except as follows: A cargo tank with a heating system which does not hold pressure may remain in service as an unheated cargo tank if:
                (i) The heating system remains in place and is structurally sound and no lading may leak into the heating system, and
                (ii) The specification plate heating system information is changed to indicate that the cargo tank has no working heating system.
                (7) The inspector must record the results of the pressure test as specified in § 180.417(b).
                (h) Leakage test. The following requirements apply to cargo tanks requiring a leakage test:
                (1) Each cargo tank must be tested for leaks in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The leakage test must include testing product piping with all valves and accessories in place and operative, except that any venting devices set to discharge at less than the leakage test pressure must be removed or rendered inoperative during the test. All internal or external self-closing stop valves must be tested for leak tightness. Each cargo tank of a multi-cargo tank motor vehicle must be tested with adjacent cargo tanks empty and at atmospheric pressure. Test pressure must be maintained for at least 5 minutes. Cargo tanks in liquefied compressed gas service must be externally inspected for leaks during the leakage test. Suitable safeguards must be provided to protect personnel should a failure occur. Cargo tanks may be leakage tested with hazardous materials contained in the cargo tank during the test. Leakage test pressure must be no less than 80% of MAWP marked on the specification plate except as follows:
                (i) A cargo tank with an MAWP of 690 kPa (100 psig) or more may be leakage tested at its maximum normal operating pressure provided it is in dedicated service or services; or
                (ii) An MC 330 or MC 331 cargo tank in dedicated liquified petroleum gas service may be leakage tested at not less than 414 kPa (60 psig).
                (iii) An operator of a specification MC 330 or MC 331 cargo tank, and a nonspecification cargo tank authorized under § 173.315(k) of this subchapter, equipped with a meter may check leak tightness of the internal self-closing stop valve by conducting a meter creep test. (See appendix B to this part.)
                (iv) An MC 330 or MC 331 cargo tank in dedicated service for anhydrous ammonia may be leakage tested at not less than 414 kPa (60 psig).
                (v) A non-specification cargo tank required by § 173.8(d) of this subchapter to be leakage tested, must be leakage tested at not less than 16.6 kPa (2.4 psig), or as specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.

                (2) Cargo tanks used to transport petroleum distillate fuels that are equipped with vapor collection equipment may be leak tested in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency's “Method 27—Determination of Vapor Tightness of Gasoline Delivery Tank Using Pressure-Vacuum Test,” as set forth in Appendix A to 40 CFR part 60. Test methods and procedures and maximum allowable pressure and vacuum changes are in 40 CFR 63.425(e). The hydrostatic test alternative, using liquid in Environmental Protection Agency's “Method 27—Determination of Vapor Tightness of Gasoline Delivery Tank Using Pressure-Vacuum Test,” may not be used to satisfy the leak testing requirements of this paragraph. The test must be conducted using air.
                (3) A cargo tank that fails to retain leakage test pressure may not be returned to service as a specification cargo tank, except under conditions specified in § 180.411(d).
                (4) After July 1, 2000, Registered Inspectors of specification MC 330 and MC 331 cargo tanks, and nonspecification cargo tanks authorized under § 173.315(k) of this subchapter must visually inspect the delivery hose assembly and piping system while the assembly is under leakage test pressure utilizing the rejection criteria listed in § 180.416(g). Delivery hose assemblies not permanently attached to the cargo tank motor vehicle may be inspected separately from the cargo tank motor vehicle. In addition to a written record of the inspection prepared in accordance with § 180.417(b), the Registered Inspector conducting the test must note the hose identification number, the date of the test, and the condition of the hose assembly and piping system tested.
                (5) The inspector must record the results of the leakage test as specified in § 180.417(b).
                (i) Thickness testing. (1) The shell and head thickness of all unlined cargo tanks used for the transportation of materials corrosive to the tank must be measured at least once every 2 years, except that cargo tanks measuring less than the sum of the minimum prescribed thickness, plus one-fifth of the original corrosion allowance, must be tested annually.
                (2) Measurements must be made using a device capable of accurately measuring thickness to within ±0.002 of an inch.
                (3) Any person performing thickness testing must be trained in the proper use of the thickness testing device used in accordance with the manufacturer's instruction.
                (4) Thickness testing must be performed in the following areas of the cargo tank wall, as a minimum:
                (i) Areas of the tank shell and heads and shell and head area around any piping that retains lading;
                (ii) Areas of high shell stress such as the bottom center of the tank;
                (iii) Areas near openings;
                (iv) Areas around weld joints;
                (v) Areas around shell reinforcements;
                (vi) Areas around appurtenance attachments;
                (vii) Areas near upper coupler (fifth wheel) assembly attachments;
                (viii) Areas near suspension system attachments and connecting structures;
                (ix) Known thin areas in the tank shell and nominal liquid level lines; and
                (x) Connecting structures joining multiple cargo tanks of carbon steel in a self-supporting cargo tank motor vehicle.

                (5) Minimum thicknesses for MC 300, MC 301, MC 302, MC 303, MC 304, MC 305, MC 306, MC 307, MC 310, MC 311, and MC 312 cargo tanks are determined based on the definition of minimum thickness found in § 178.320(a) of this subchapter. The following Tables I and II identify the “In-Service Minimum Thickness” values to be used to determine the minimum thickness for the referenced cargo tanks. The column headed “Minimum Manufactured Thickness” indicates the minimum values required for new construction of DOT 400 series cargo tanks, found in Tables I and II of §§ 178.346-2, 178.347-2, and 178.348-2 of this subchapter. In-Service Minimum Thicknesses for MC 300, MC 301, MC 302, MC 303, MC 304, MC 305, MC 306, MC 307, MC 310, MC 311, and MC 312 cargo tanks are based on 90 percent of the manufactured thickness specified in the DOT specification, rounded to three places.

                § 180.501
                Applicability.
                (a) This subpart prescribes requirements, in addition to those contained in parts 107, 171, 172, 173, 174, and 179 of this subchapter, applicable to any person who manufactures, fabricates, marks, maintains, repairs, inspects, or services tank cars to ensure continuing qualification.

                (b) This subpart also establishes the minimum acceptable framework for an owner's qualification program for tank cars and components. Owners should follow this subpart in developing their written procedures (work instructions), as required under § 179.7(d), for use by tank car facility employees. The owner's qualification program for each tank car, or a fleet of tank cars, must identify where to inspect, how to inspect, and the acceptance criteria. Alternative inspection and test procedures or intervals based on a damage-tolerance analysis or service reliability assessment must be approved by the Associate Administrator for Railroad Safety in accordance with 180.509(l). Tank car facilities must incorporate the owner's qualification program in their quality assurance program, as required under § 179.7(a)(2), (b)(3), (b)(5), and (d).
                (c) Any person who performs a function prescribed in this part shall perform that function in accordance with this part.
                (d) Where, in this subpart, a person is required to make documents available to FRA upon request, such request means that credentialed FRA personnel or an authorized representative of the Department may view the documents and make copies of them. The document owner's may seek confidential treatment of the documents presented. See § 105.30.

                  Modification means any change to a tank car that affects the certificate of construction prescribed in § 179.5, including an alteration prescribed in § 179.6, or conversion.
                
                  Objectively reasonable and articulable belief means a belief based on particularized and identifiable facts that provide an objective basis to believe or suspect that a tank car or a class or design of tank cars may be in an unsafe operating condition.
                
                  Qualification, as relevant to a tank car, means the car and its components conforms to the specification to which it was designed, manufactured, or modified to the requirements of this subpart, to the applicable requirements of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), and to the owner's acceptance criteria. Qualification is accomplished by careful and critical examination that verifies conformance using inspections and tests based on a written program approved by the tank car owner followed by a written representation of that conformance. A tank car that passes the appropriate tests for its specification, has a signed test report, is marked to denote this passage, and is considered qualified for hazardous materials transportation under this subchapter.

                § 180.509
                Requirements for inspection and test of specification tank cars.
                (a) General. Each tank car owner must ensure that a tank car facility:
                (1) Inspects and tests each item according to the requirements specified in this section;
                (2) Evaluates each item according to the acceptable results of inspections and tests specified in § 180.511;
                (3) Marks each tank car as specified in § 180.515 that is qualified to transport hazardous materials;
                (4) Prepares the documentation as required by § 180.517 for each item qualified under this section. A copy of the documentation required by § 180.517 must be sent to the owner as appropriate and according to the owner's instructions.
                (b) Conditions requiring qualification of tank cars. Without regard to the qualification compliance date requirements of any paragraph of this section, an owner of a tank car or an internal coating or lining must ensure an appropriate inspection and test according to the type of defect and the type of maintenance or repair performed if:
                (1) The tank car shows evidence of abrasion, corrosion, cracks, dents, distortions, defects in welds, or any other condition that may make the tank car unsafe for transportation,
                (2) The tank car was in an accident and shows evidence of damage to an extent that may adversely affect its capability to retain its contents or to otherwise remain railworthy.
                (3) The tank bears evidence of damage caused by fire. (4) The Associate Administrator for Railroad Safety, FRA, requires it based on the existence of an objectively reasonable and articulable belief that a tank car or a class or design of tank cars may be in an unsafe operating condition.
                (c) Frequency of inspection and tests. Each tank car shall have an inspection and test according to the requirements of this paragraph.
                (1) For Class 107 tank cars and tank cars of riveted construction, the tank car must have a hydrostatic pressure test and visual inspection conforming to the requirements in effect prior to July 1, 1996, for the tank specification.
                (2) For Class DOT 113 tank cars, see § 173.319(e) of this subchapter.
                (3) Fusion welded tank cars must be inspected and tested to be qualified and maintained in accordance with the following table. All qualification requirements need not be done at the same time or at the same facility.

                (d) Visual inspection. At a minimum, each tank car facility must visually inspect the tank externally and internally as follows:

                (1) An internal inspection of the tank shell and heads for abrasion, corrosion, cracks, dents, distortions, defects in welds, or any other condition that makes the tank car unsafe for transportation, and except in the areas where insulation or a thermal protection system precludes it, an external inspection of the tank shell and heads for abrasion, corrosion, cracks, dents, distortions, defects in welds, or any other condition that makes the tank car unsafe for transportation, and for DOT 115 class tank cars, an internal inspection of the inner container and external inspection of the outer shell and heads for defects in welds, or any other condition that may make the tank car unsafe for transportation;
                (2) When an internal coating or lining, head protection, insulation, or thermal protection is removed in part or in whole, the internal and external exposed surface of the tank must be visually inspected for defects in welds or any other condition that may make the tank car unsafe for transportation, and this inspection must precede any application or reapplication of a coating or lining;
                (3) An inspection of the service equipment, including gaskets, for indications of corrosion and other conditions that may make the tank car unsafe for transportation;
                (4) An inspection for missing or loose bolts, nuts, or elements that may make the tank car unsafe for transportation;
                (5) An inspection of all closures on the tank car for conditions that may make the tank car unsafe for transportation, including an inspection of the protective housings for proper condition;
                (6) An inspection of excess flow valves with threaded seats for tightness; and
                (7) An inspection of the required markings on the tank car for legibility.
                (e) Structural integrity inspections and tests. (1) Each tank car owner must ensure the structural elements on the tank car qualify with the applicable requirements of this subchapter. At a minimum, the structural integrity inspection and test must include:
                (i) All transverse fillet welds greater than 0.64 cm (0.25 inch) within 121.92 cm (4 feet) of the bottom longitudinal centerline except body bolster pad attachment welds;
                (ii) The termination of longitudinal fillet welds greater than 0.64 cm (0.25 inch) within 121.92 cm (4 feet) of the bottom longitudinal centerline; and
                (iii) The tank shell butt welds within 60.96 cm (2 feet) of the bottom longitudinal centerline, unless the tank car owner can determine by analysis (e.g., finite element analysis, damage-tolerance analysis, or service reliability assessment) that the structure will not develop defects that reduce the design level of safety and reliability or fail within its operational life or prior to the next required inspection. The owner must maintain all documentation used to make such determination at its principal place of business and make the data available to FRA or an authorized representative of the Department upon request.
                (2) For DOT 115 class tanks, paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section apply only to the outer shell fillet welds and to the non-reinforced exposed outer shell butt welds.
                (3) The inspection requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section do not apply to reinforced tank shell butt welds until the time of lining removal or application for tank cars with an internal lead, glass, or rubber lining.
                (4) Each tank car facility must inspect and test the elements identified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section by one or more of the following methods:
                (i) Dye penetrant testing (PT);
                (ii) Radiographic examination (RT);
                (iii) Magnetic particle testing (MT);
                (iv) Ultrasonic testing (UT); and
                (v) Direct, remote, or enhanced visual inspection, using, for example, magnifiers, fiberscopes, borescopes, and/or machine vision technology (VT).
                (f) Thickness tests. (1) The tank car owner must ensure that each tank car facility measures the thickness of the tank car shell, heads, sumps, protective housing (i.e., domes), and nozzles on each tank car by using a device capable of accurately measuring the thickness to within ±0.05 mm (±0.002 inch).
                (2) The tank car owner must ensure that each tank car has a thickness test measurement:
                (i) At the time of an internal coating or lining application or replacement, or
                (ii) At least once every ten (10) years for a tank that does not have an internal coating or lining, or
                (iii) At least once every five (5) years for a tank that does not have an internal coating or lining when:
                (A) The tank is used to transport a material that is corrosive or reactive to the tank (see Appendix D of this part) or service equipment as defined § 180.503, and

                (B) The remaining shell and head thickness is tested and determined to be at or below line C in Figure A of this paragraph.

                  Where:
                  
                  A. As-built tank shell or head thickness with additional thickness.
                  B. Required minimum tank shell or head thickness after forming per part 179.
                  C. Inspection frequency adjustment point (design minimum shell or head thickness, minus 1/2 of the table value in paragraph (g) of this section).
                  D. Condemning limit for general corrosion (required minimum shell or head thickness, minus the value in paragraph (g) of this section).
                  E. Condemning limit for localized corrosion (required minimum shell or head thickness, minus the table value in paragraph (g) of this section, minus 1.58 mm (1/16 inch)). See Note 1 in paragraph (g) of this section for diameter limitations and minimum separation distances.
                  F. Allowable shell or head thickness reduction (table value in paragraph (g) of this section).
                  G. Additional thickness reduction for localized areas in paragraph (g) of this section.
                
                
                (3) For a localized repair of an internal coating or lining where a material corrosive to the tank or service equipment as defined § 180.503 has contacted the tank, a qualified individual must verify the coating or lining's conformance with paragraph (g) of this section by measuring the shell or head in the area of the repair. The thickness test applies only to the non-lined or coated repaired area, and is not a qualification event. Modification of the tank stencil is not required.
                (4) Operation of a tank car below the condemning limit for general corrosion or the condemning limit for localized corrosion (as shown in Figure A of this section) is prohibited.
                (5) For sumps, protective housing (i.e., domes), nozzles, and nozzle reinforcing pads, the tank car owner must determine if any reduction in wall thickness affects the design levels of reliability and safety built into sump, protective housing, nozzle, or nozzle reinforcement. Each tank car owner must maintain at its principal place of business documentation describing the allowable thickness reductions for sumps, protective housings, and nozzles, and nozzle reinforcements. This documentation must be made available to FRA or an authorized representative of the Department upon request.
                (6) After repairs, alterations, conversions, modifications, or blasting of tank car that results in a reduction of the tank's thickness, and anytime a tank car coating or lining is removed, a qualified individual must measure the thickness of the tank in the area of reduced thickness to ensure that the thickness of the tank conforms to paragraph (g) of this section.
                (g) Service life thickness allowance. (1) A tank car found with a thickness below the required minimum thickness after forming for its specification, as stated in part 179 of this subchapter, may continue in service if any reduction in the required minimum thickness is not more than that provided in the following table:

                  Note 1.
                  A tank car owner may add an extra 1.58 mm (1/16 inch) to the values in the table for local reductions. Local reductions are those that do not exceed 20.32 linear centimeters (8 linear inches) measured at the longest diameter, and are separated from the other local reductions by at least 40.64 cm (16 inches).
                
                
                  Note 2.
                  Any reduction in the tank car shell thickness may not affect the structural strength of the tank car to the extent that the tank car no longer conforms to the applicable provisions of Section 6.2 of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                
                
                  Note 3.
                  For DOT 115 class tank cars, shell thickness reductions apply only to the outer shell of the tank car. There is no shell or head thickness reduction authorized for the inner tank.
                
                
                (2) [Reserved]
                (h) Safety system inspections. Each tank car owner must ensure qualification of the tank car safety systems. However, inspections of foam or cork insulation systems are not required.
                (i) Internal coating and lining inspection and test. (1) At a minimum, the owner of an internal coating or lining applied to protect a tank used to transport a material that is corrosive or reactive to the tank must ensure an inspection adequate enough to detect defects or other conditions that could reduce the design level of reliability and safety of the tank is performed. In addition, the owner of a coating or lining of tank cars used to transport hazardous materials must ensure the lining complies with § 173.24(b)(2) and (b)(3) of this subchapter.
                (2) The owner of the internal coating or lining must establish and maintain a record of the service life of the coating or lining and commodity combination, that is, the specific hazardous materials that were loaded into a tank and the coating or lining in place at the time of loading. The owner of the internal coating or lining must use its knowledge of the service life of each coating or lining and commodity combination to establish an appropriate inspection interval for that coating or lining and commodity combination. This interval must not exceed eight (8) years, unless the coating or lining owner can establish, document, and show that the service history or scientific analysis of the coating or lining and commodity pairing supports a longer inspection interval. The owner must maintain at its principal place of business a written procedure for collecting and documenting the performance of the coating or lining applied within the tank car for its service life. The internal coating or lining owner must provide this documentation, including inspection and test, repair, removal, and application procedures, to the FRA or car owner upon request. Further, the offeror must provide commodity information to the car owner and the owner of the internal coating or lining upon request.

                (3) The owner of the internal coating or lining must provide the test method and acceptance criteria to the tank car owner and to the person responsible for qualifying the coating or lining. The tank car facility inspecting and testing the internal coating or lining must follow the inspection and test procedure, including the acceptance requirements, established by the internal coating or lining owner.
                
                (j) Leakage pressure test. Unless the design of the service equipment arrangement precludes it (e.g., there is no fitting to pressurize the tank), each owner of a tank car must ensure that the tank, service equipment, and closures installed, replaced, or reinstalled on the tank car are leak tested. The test may be conducted with the lading in the tank. When the test pressure exceeds the start-to-discharge or burst pressure of a pressure relief device, the device must be rendered inoperative. The written procedures and test method for leak testing must ensure the sensitivity and reliability of the test method to prevent premature failure. This section does not apply to facilities that remove closures for the sole purpose of loading or unloading the lading (e.g., blind flanges, pipe plugs, etc.).
                (k) Service equipment inspection and test. (1) Each tank car owner must ensure the qualification of tank car service equipment at least once every ten (10) years. The tank car owner must analyze the service equipment inspection and test results for any given lading and, based on the analysis, adjust the inspection and test frequency to ensure that the design level of reliability and safety of the equipment is met. The owner must maintain at its principal place of business all supporting documentation used to make such analyses and inspection and test frequency adjustments. The supporting documentation must be made available to FRA or an authorized representative of the Department upon request.
                (2) Each tank car facility must qualify service equipment, including reclosing pressure relief devices and interior heater systems in accordance with the applicable provisions of Appendix D of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (l) Alternative inspection and test procedures. When approved by the Associate Administrator for Railroad Safety, FRA, a tank car owner, or a coating or lining owner may use an alternative inspection and test procedure or interval based on a damage-tolerance analysis (that must include a determination of the probable locations and modes of damage due to fatigue, corrosion, and accidental damage), or based on a service reliability assessment (that must be supported by analysis of systematically collected data) in lieu of the other requirements of this section.
                (m) Inspection and test compliance date for tank cars. (1) After July 1, 2000, each tank car with a metal jacket or with a thermal protection system shall have an inspection and test conforming to this section no later than the date the tank car requires a periodic hydrostatic pressure test (i.e., the marked due date on the tank car for the hydrostatic test).

                (2) After July 1, 1998, each tank car without a metal jacket shall have an inspection and test conforming to this section no later than the date the tank car requires a periodic hydrostatic pressure test (i.e., the marked due date on the tank car for the hydrostatic test).

                (3) For tank cars on a 20-year periodic hydrostatic pressure test interval (i.e., Class DOT 103W, 104W, 111A60W1, 111A100W1, and 111A100W3 tank cars), the next inspection and test date is the midpoint between the compliance date in paragraph (l)(1) or (2) of this section and the remaining years until the tank would have had a hydrostatic pressure test.

                Acceptable results of inspections and tests.
                Provided it conforms to other applicable requirements of this subchapter, a tank car is qualified for use if it successfully passes the inspections and tests set forth below conducted in accordance with this subpart. A representation of that qualification must consist of marking the tank in accordance with § 180.515.
                (a) Visual inspection. A tank car successfully passes the visual inspection when the inspection shows no structural defect that may cause leakage from or failure of the tank before the next inspection and test interval.
                (b) Structural integrity inspection and test. A tank car successfully passes the structural integrity inspection and test when it shows no structural defect that may initiate cracks or propagate cracks and cause failure of the tank before the next inspection and test interval.
                (c) Service life shell thickness. A tank car successfully passes the service life shell thickness inspection when the tank shell and heads show no thickness reduction below that allowed in § 180.509(g).
                (d) Safety system inspection. A tank car successfully passes the safety system inspection when each thermal protection system, tank head puncture resistance system, coupler vertical restraint system, and system used to protect discontinuities (e.g., breakage grooves on bottom outlets and protective housings) on the tank car conform to this subchapter and show no indication of a defect that may reduce reliability before the next inspection and test interval.
                (e) Lining and coating inspection. A tank car successfully passes the lining and coating inspection and test when the lining or coating conforms to the owner's acceptance criteria.
                (f) Leakage pressure test. A tank car successfully passes the leakage pressure test when all product piping, fittings and closures show no indication of leakage.
                (g) Hydrostatic test. A Class 107 tank car, the inner tank of a Class 115 tank car, or a riveted tank car successfully passes the hydrostatic test when it shows no leakage, distortion, excessive permanent expansion, or other evidence of weakness that might render the tank car unsafe for transportation service.
                (h) Service equipment. A tank car successfully passes the service equipment inspection and test when this equipment conforms to this subchapter and applicable provisions of Appendix D of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), and shows no indication of a defect that may reduce reliability during the qualification interval.

                § 180.513
                Repairs, alterations, conversions, and modifications.
                (a) To work on tank cars, a tank car facility must comply with the applicable requirements of this subpart, the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), and the owner's requirements.
                (b) Responsibilities of Tank Car Facility. A tank car facility must obtain the permission of the equipment owner before performing work affecting alteration, conversion, repair, or qualification of the owner's equipment. For the purposes of qualification and maintenance, the tank car facility must use the written instructions furnished by the owner or have written confirmation from the owner allowing the use of written instructions furnished by the owner or have written confirmation from the owner allowing the use of written instructions furnished by another. A tank car facility must not use, copy distribute, forward or provide to another person the owner's confidential and proprietary written instructions, procedures, manuals, and records without the owner's permission. A tank car facility must report all work performed to the owner. The tank car facility must also report observed damage, deterioration, failed components, or non-compliant parts to the owner. A tank car facility must incorporate the owner's Quality Assurance Program into their own Quality Assurance Program.
                (c) Unless the exterior tank car shell or interior tank car jacket has a protective coating, after a repair that requires the complete removal of the tank car jacket, the exterior tank car shell and the interior tank car jacket must have a protective coating applied to prevent the deterioration of the tank shell and tank jacket. Previously applied coatings that still provide effective protection need not be covered over.
                (d) After repair, replacement, or qualification of tank car service equipment, the tank service equipment must successfully pass the leak test prescribed in § 180.509(j).

                § 180.515
                Markings.
                (a) When a tank car passes the required inspection and test with acceptable results, the tank car facility must mark the date of the inspection and test and due date of the next inspection and test qualified on the tank car in accordance with the applicable provisions of Appendix C of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). When a tank car facility performs multiple inspections and tests at the same time, one date may be used to satisfy the requirements of this section. One date also may be shown when multiple inspections and tests have the same due date. Dates displayed on the “consolidated stencil” (see the applicable provisions of Appendix C of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars) take precedence over dates modified, and not stenciled, pursuant to interval adjustments for service equipment, linings, and granted alternative inspection intervals.
                (b) Converted DOT 105, 109, 112, 114, or 120 class tank cars must have the new specification and conversion date permanently marked in letters and figures at least 0.95 cm (0.375 inch) high on the outside of the manway nozzle or the edge of the manway nozzle flange on the left side of the car. The marking may have the last numeral of the specification number omitted (e.g., “DOT 111A100W” instead of “DOT 111A100W1”).
                (c) When qualified within six months of installation and protected from deterioration, the test date marking of a reclosing pressure relief device is the installation date on the tank car.

                § 180.517
                Reporting and record retention requirements.
                (a) Certification and representation. Each owner of a specification tank car must retain the certificate of construction (AAR Form 4-2) and related papers certifying that the manufacture of the specification tank car identified in the documents is in accordance with the applicable specification. The builder's signature on the certificate of construction and the marking of the tank car with the tank specification is the representation that all of the appropriate inspections and tests were successfully performed to qualify the tank for use. The owner must retain the documents throughout the period of ownership of the specification tank car and for one year thereafter. Upon a change of ownership, the applicable provisions prescribed in Section 1.3.15 of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter) apply. The builder of the car or a facility performing work on the car may retain copies of relevant records.
                (b) Inspection and test reporting. Each tank car that is inspected and tested as specified in § 180.509 must have a written report, in English, prepared according to this paragraph. Marking the tank car with the specification (or retaining the specification marking on the tank) is the representation that all of the appropriate inspections and tests were performed and the results meet the tank car owner's acceptance criteria to qualify the car for continued use. The report may be created and retained electronically, but, upon request by FRA for a copy of the report, it must be made available in common readable form. The owner must retain a copy of the inspection and test reports until successfully completing the next inspection and test of the same type. The inspection and test report must include the following:
                (1) Type of inspection and test performed (a checklist is acceptable);
                (2) The results of each inspection and test performed;
                (3) Tank car reporting mark and number;
                (4) Tank car specification;
                (5) Inspection and test date (month and year);
                (6) Location and description of defects found and method used to repair each defect;
                (7) The name and address of the tank car facility and the name and signature of inspector; and
                (8) The unique code (station stencil) identifying the facility.

                Periodic retest and inspection of tank cars other than single-unit tank car tanks.
                (a) General. Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, tanks designed to be removed from cars for filling and emptying and tanks built to a Class DOT 107A specification and their safety relief devices must be retested periodically as specified in Retest Table 1 of paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Retests may be made at any time during the calendar year the retest falls due.
                (b) Pressure test. (1) Each tank must be subjected to the specified hydrostatic pressure and its permanent expansion determined. Pressure must be maintained for 30 seconds and for as long as necessary to secure complete expansion of the tank. Before testing, the pressure gauge must be shown to be accurate within 1 percent at test measure. The expansion gauge must be shown to be accurate, at test pressure, to within 1 percent. Expansion must be recorded in cubic cm. Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of total volumetric expansion at test pressure and the tank must not leak or show evidence of distress.
                (2) Each tank, except tanks built to specification DOT 107A, must also be subjected to interior air pressure test of at least 100 psig under conditions favorable to detection of any leakage. No leaks may appear.
                (3) Safety relief valves must be retested by air or gas, must start-to-discharge at or below the prescribed pressure and must be vapor tight at or above the prescribed pressure.
                (4) Rupture discs and fusible plugs must be removed from the tank and visually inspected.
                (5) Tanks must be retested as specified in Retest Table 1 of this paragraph (b)(5), and before returning to service after repairs involving welding or heat treatment:

                    a If DOT 107A * * * * tanks are used for transportation of flammable gases, one rupture disc from each car must be burst at the interval prescribed. The sample disc must burst at a pressure not exceeding the marked test pressure of the tank and not less than 70 percent of the marked test pressure. If the sample disc does not burst within the prescribed limits, all discs on the car must be replaced.
                  
                    b The hydrostatic expansion test pressure must at least equal the marked test pressure.
                  
                    c See § 180.519(b)(1).
                  
                    d Safety relief valves of the spring-loaded type on tanks used exclusively for fluorinated hydrocarbons and mixtures thereof which are free from corroding components may be retested every 5 years.
                

                (6) The month and year of test, followed by a “V” if visually inspected as described in paragraph (c) of this section, must be plainly and permanently stamped into the metal of one head or chime of each tank with successful test results; for example, 01-90 for January 1990. On DOT 107A**** tanks, the date must be stamped into the metal of the marked end, except that if all tanks mounted on a car have been tested, the date may be stamped into the metal of a plate permanently applied to the bulkhead on the “A” end of the car. Dates of previous tests and all prescribed markings must be kept legible.
                
                (c) Visual inspection. Tanks of Class DOT 106A and DOT 110A-W specifications (§§ 179.300 and 179.301 of this subchapter) used exclusively for transporting fluorinated hydrocarbons and mixtures thereof, and that are free from corroding components, may be given a periodic complete internal and external visual inspection in place of the periodic hydrostatic retest. Visual inspections shall be made only by competent persons. The tank must be accepted or rejected in accordance with the criteria in CGA C-6 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                (d) Written records. The results of the pressure test and visual inspection must be recorded on a suitable data sheet. Completed copies of these reports must be retained by the owner and by the person performing the pressure test and visual inspection as long as the tank is in service. The information to be recorded and checked on these data sheets are: Date of test and inspection; DOT specification number; tank identification (registered symbol and serial number, date of manufacture and ownership symbol); type of protective coating (painted, etc., and statement as to need for refinishing or recoating); conditions checked (leakage, corrosion, gouges, dents or digs, broken or damaged chime or protective ring, fire, fire damage, internal condition); test pressure; results of tests; and disposition of tank (returned to service, returned to manufacturer for repair, or scrapped); and identification of the person conducting the retest or inspection.

                § 180.601
                Applicability.
                This subpart prescribes requirements, in addition to those contained in parts 107, 171, 172, 173, and 178 of this subchapter, applicable to any person responsible for the continuing qualification, maintenance or periodic retesting of a portable tank.
              
              
                § 180.603
                Qualification of portable tanks.
                (a) Each portable tank used for the transportation of hazardous materials must be an authorized packaging.
                (b) To qualify as an authorized packaging, each portable tank must conform to the requirements of this subchapter and the applicable design specification to which the portable tank was constructed.
                (c) The following portable tanks are authorized for use provided they conform to all applicable safety requirements of this subchapter: 51, 56, 57, 60, IM 101, IM 102 and UN portable tanks.
                (d) A portable tank that also meets the definition of “container” in 49 CFR 450.3(a)(3) must conform to the requirements in parts 450 through 453 of this title for compliance with Annex II of the Convention for Safe Containers (CSC).
                (e) Exemption portable tanks based on DOT 51 portable tanks. The owner of a portable tank constructed in accordance with and used under an exemption issued prior to August 31, 1996, which was in conformance with the requirements for Specification DOT 51 portable tanks with the exception of the location of fill and discharge outlets, shall examine the portable tank and its design to determine if it meets the outlet requirements in effect on October 1, 1996. If the owner determines that the portable tank is in compliance with all requirements of the DOT 51 specification, the exemption number stenciled on the portable tank shall be removed and the specification plate (or a plate placed adjacent to the specification plate) shall be durably marked “DOT 51-E*****” (where ***** is to be replaced by the exemption number). During the period the portable tank is in service, and for one year thereafter, the owner of the portable tank must retain on file, at its principal place of business, a copy of the last exemption in effect.
              
              
                
                § 180.605
                Requirements for periodic testing, inspection and repair of portable tanks.
                (a) A portable tank constructed in accordance with a DOT specification for which a test or inspection specified in this subpart has become due, must be tested or inspected prior to being returned for transportation.
                (b) Conditions requiring test and inspection of portable tanks. Without regard to any other test or inspection requirements, a Specification or UN portable tank must be tested and inspected in accordance with this section prior to further use if any of the following conditions exist:
                (1) The portable tank shows evidence of dents, corroded or abraded areas, leakage, or any other condition that might render it unsafe for transportation service.
                (2) The portable tank has been in an accident and has been damaged to an extent that may adversely affect its ability to retain the hazardous material.
                (3) The portable tank has been out of hazardous materials transportation service for a period of one year or more.
                (4) The portable tank has been modified from its original design specification.
                (5) The portable tank is in an unsafe operating condition based on the existence of probable cause.
                (c) Schedule for periodic inspections and tests. Each Specification portable tank must be tested and inspected in accordance with the following schedule:
                (1) Each IM or UN portable tank must be given an initial inspection and test before being placed into service, a periodic inspection and test at least once every 5 years, and an intermediate periodic inspection and test at least every 2.5 years following the initial inspection and the last 5 year periodic inspection and test.
                (2) Each Specification 51 portable tank must be given a periodic inspection and test at least once every five years.
                (3) Each Specification 56 or 57 portable tank must be given a periodic inspection and test at least once every 2.5 years.
                (4) Each Specification 60 portable tank must be given a periodic inspection and test at the end of the first 4-year period after the original test; at least once every 2 years thereafter up to a total of 12 years of service; and at least once annually thereafter. Retesting is not required on a rubber-lined tank except before each relining.
                (d) Intermediate periodic inspection and test. For IM and UN portable tanks the intermediate 2.5 year periodic inspection and test must include at least an internal and external examination of the portable tank and its fittings taking into account the hazardous materials intended to be transported; a leakage test; and a test of the satisfactory operation of all service equipment. Sheathing, thermal insulation, etc. need only be removed to the extent required for reliable appraisal of the condition of the portable tank. For portable tanks intended for the transportation of a single hazardous material, the internal examination may be waived if it is leakage tested in accordance with the procedures in paragraph (h) of this section prior to each filling, or if approved by the Associate Administrator. Portable tanks used for dedicated transportation of refrigerated liquefied gases that are not fitted with inspection openings are excepted from the internal inspection requirement.
                (e) Periodic inspection and test. The 5 year periodic inspection and test must include an internal and external examination and, unless excepted, a pressure test as specified in this section. Sheathing, thermal insulation, etc. need only to be removed to the extent required for reliable appraisal of the condition of the portable tank. Except for DOT Specification 56 and 57 portable tanks, reclosing pressure relief devices must be removed from the tank and tested separately unless they can be tested while installed on the portable tank. For portable tanks where the shell and equipment have been pressure-tested separately, after assembly they must be subjected together to a leakage test and effectively tested and inspected for corrosion. Portable tanks used for the transportation of refrigerated, liquefied gases are excepted from the requirement for internal inspection and the hydraulic pressure test during the 5-year periodic inspection and test, if the portable tanks were pressure tested to a minimum test pressure of 1.3 times the design pressure using an inert gas as prescribed in § 178.338-16(a) and (b) of this subchapter before putting the portable tank into service initially and after any exceptional inspections and tests specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
                (f) Exceptional inspection and test. The exceptional inspection and test is necessary when a portable tank shows evidence of damaged or corroded areas, or leakage, or other conditions that indicate a deficiency that could affect the integrity of the portable tank. The extent of the exceptional inspection and test must depend on the amount of damage or deterioration of the portable tank. It must include at least the inspection and a pressure test according to paragraph (e) of this section. Pressure relief devices need not be tested or replaced unless there is reason to believe the relief devices have been affected by the damage or deterioration.
                (g) Internal and external examination. The internal and external examinations must ensure that:
                (1) The shell is inspected for pitting, corrosion, or abrasions, dents, distortions, defects in welds or any other conditions, including leakage, that might render the portable tank unsafe for transportation. The wall thickness must be verified by appropriate measurement if this inspection indicates a reduction of wall thickness;
                (2) The piping, valves, and gaskets are inspected for corroded areas, defects, and other conditions, including leakage, that might render the portable tank unsafe for filling, discharge or transportation;
                (3) Devices for tightening manhole covers are operative and there is no leakage at manhole covers or gaskets;
                (4) Missing or loose bolts or nuts on any flanged connection or blank flange are replaced or tightened;
                (5) All emergency devices and valves are free from corrosion, distortion and any damage or defect that could prevent their normal operation. Remote closure devices and self-closing stop-valves must be operated to demonstrate proper operation;
                (6) Required markings on the portable tank are legible and in accordance with the applicable requirements; and
                (7) The framework, the supports and the arrangements for lifting the portable tank are in satisfactory condition.
                (h) Pressure test procedures for specification 51, 56, 57, 60, IM or UN portable tanks. (1) Each Specification 57 portable tank must be leak tested by a minimum sustained air pressure of at least 3 psig applied to the entire tank. Each Specification 51 or 56 portable tank must be tested by a minimum pressure (air or hydrostatic) of at least 2 psig or at least one and one-half times the design pressure (maximum allowable working pressure, or re-rated pressure) of the tank, whichever is greater. The leakage test for portable tanks used for refrigerated liquefied gas must be performed at 90% of MAWP. Leakage tests for all other portable tanks must be at a pressure of at least 25% of MAWP. During each air pressure test, the entire surface of all joints under pressure must be coated with or immersed in a solution of soap and water, heavy oil, or other material suitable for the purpose of detecting leaks. The pressure must be held for a period of time sufficiently long to assure detection of leaks, but in no case less than five minutes. During the air or hydrostatic test, relief devices may be removed, but all the closure fittings must be in place and the relief device openings plugged. Lagging need not be removed from a lagged tank if it is possible to maintain the required test pressure at constant temperature with the tank disconnected from the source of pressure.

                (2) Each Specification 60 portable tank must be retested by completely filling the tank with water or other liquid having a similar viscosity, the temperature of the liquid must not exceed 37.7 °C (100 °F) during the test, and applying a pressure of 60 psig. The portable tank must be capable of holding the prescribed pressure for at least 10 minutes without leakage, evidence of impending failure, or failure. All closures shall be in place while the test is made and the pressure shall be gauged at the top of the tank. Safety devices and/or vents shall be plugged during this test.
                
                (3) Each Specification IM or UN portable tank, except for UN portable tanks used for non-refrigerated and refrigerated liquefied gases, and all piping, valves and accessories, except pressure relief devices, must be hydrostatically tested with water, or other liquid of similar density and viscosity, to a pressure not less than 150% of its maximum allowable working pressure. UN portable tanks used for the transportation of non-refrigerated liquefied gases must be hydrostatically tested with water, or other liquid of similar density and viscosity, to a pressure not less than 130% of its maximum allowable working pressure. UN portable tanks used for the transportation of refrigerated liquefied gases may be tested hydrostatically or pneumatically using an inert gas to a pressure not less than 1.3 times the design pressure. For pneumatic testing, due regard for protection of all personnel must be taken because of the potential hazard involved in such a test. The pneumatic test pressure in the portable tank must be reached by gradually increasing the pressure to one-half of the test pressure. Thereafter, the test pressure must be increased in steps of approximately one-tenth of the test pressure until the required test pressure has been reached. The pressure must then be reduced to a value equal to four-fifths of the test pressure and held for a sufficient time to permit inspection of the portable tank for leaks. The minimum test pressure for a portable tank is determined on the basis of the hazardous materials that are intended to be transported in the portable tanks. For liquid, solid and non-refrigerated liquefied gases, the minimum test pressure for specific hazardous materials are specified in the applicable T Codes assigned to a particular hazardous material in the § 172.101 Table of this subchapter. While under pressure the tank shall be inspected for leakage, distortion, or any other condition which might render the tank unsafe for service. A portable tank fails to meet the requirements of the pressure test if, during the test, there is permanent distortion of the tank exceeding that permitted by the applicable specification; if there is any leakage; or if there are any deficiencies that would render the portable tank unsafe for transportation. Any portable tank that fails must be rejected and may not be used again for the transportation of a hazardous material unless the tank is adequately repaired, and, thereafter, a successful test is conducted in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph. An approval agency shall witness the hydrostatic or pneumatic test. Any damage or deficiency that might render the portable tank unsafe for service shall be repaired to the satisfaction of the witnessing approval agency. The repaired tank must be retested to the original pressure test requirements. Upon successful completion of the hydrostatic or pneumatic test, as applicable, the witnessing approval agency shall apply its name, identifying mark or identifying number in accordance with paragraph (k) of this section.
                (i) Rejection criteria. When evidence of any unsafe condition is discovered, the portable tank may not be returned to service until it has been repaired and the pressure test is repeated and passed.
                (j) Repair. The repair of a portable tank is authorized, provided such repairs are made in accordance with the requirements prescribed in the specification for the tank's original design and construction. In addition to any other provisions of the specification, no portable tank may be repaired so as to cause leakage or cracks or so as to increase the likelihood of leakage or cracks near areas of stress concentration due to cooling metal shrinkage in welding operations, sharp fillets, reversal of stresses, or otherwise. No field welding may be done except to non-pressure parts. Any cutting, burning or welding operations on the shell of an IM or UN portable tank must be done with the approval of the approval agency and be done in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter, taking into account the pressure vessel code used for the construction of the shell. A pressure test to the original test pressure must be performed after the work is completed.
                (k) Inspection and test markings. (1) Each IM or UN portable tank must be durably and legibly marked, in English, with the date (month and year) of the last pressure test, the identification markings of the approval agency witnessing the test, when required, and the date of the last visual inspection.

                Appendix A to Part 180—Internal Self-closing Stop Valve Emergency Closure Test for Liquefied Compressed Gases
                1. In performing this test, all internal self-closing stop valves must be opened. Each emergency discharge control remote actuator (on-truck and off-truck) must be operated to ensure that each internal self-closing stop valve's lever, piston, or other valve indicator has moved to the closed position.
                2. On pump-actuated pressure differential internal valves, the three-way toggle valve handle or its cable attachment must be activated to verify that the toggle handle moves to the closed position.

                Appendix B to Part 180—Acceptable Internal Self-closing Stop Valve Leakage Tests for Cargo Tanks Transporting Liquefied Compressed Gases
                For internal self-closing stop valve leakage testing, leakage is defined as any leakage through the internal self-closing valve or to the atmosphere that is detectable when the valve is in the closed position. On some valves this will require the closure of the pressure by-pass port.
                (a) Meter Creep Test.

                1. An operator of a cargo tank equipped with a calibrated meter may check the internal self-closing stop valve for leakage through the valve seat using the meter as a flow measurement indicator. The test is initiated by starting the delivery process or returning product to the cargo tank through the delivery system. This may be performed at an idle. After the flow is established, the operator closes the internal self-closing stop valve and monitors the meter flow. The meter flow must stop within 30 seconds with no meter creep within 5 seconds after the meter stops.
                
                2. On pump-actuated pressure differential internal self-closing stop valves, the valve must be closed with the remote actuator to assure that it is functioning. On other types of internal self-closing stop valves, the valve(s) may be closed using either the normal valve control or the discharge control system (e.g., remote).
                3. Rejection criteria: Any detectable meter creep within the first five seconds after initial meter stoppage.
                (b) Internal Self-Closing Stop Valve Test.
                An operator of a cargo tank that is not equipped with a meter may check the internal self-closing stop valve(s) for leakage as follows:
                1. The internal self-closing stop valve must be in the closed position.
                2. All of the material in the downstream piping must be evacuated, and the piping must be returned to atmospheric temperature and pressure.
                3. The outlet must be monitored for 30 seconds for detectable leakage.
                4. Rejection criteria. Any detectable leakage is considered unacceptable.

                Appendix C to Part 180—Eddy Current Examination With Visual Inspection for DOT 3AL Cylinders Manufactured of Aluminum Alloy 6351-T6
                1. Examination Procedure. Each facility performing eddy current examination with visual inspection must develop, update, and maintain a written examination procedure applicable to the test equipment it uses to perform eddy current examinations.
                2. Visual examinations. Visual examinations of the neck and shoulder area of the cylinder must be conducted in accordance with CGA pamphlet C-6.1 (IBR; see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
                3. Eddy Current Equipment. A reference ring and probe for each DOT-3AL cylinder manufactured of aluminum alloy 6351-T6 to be inspected must be available at the examination facility. Eddy current equipment must be capable of accurately detecting the notches on the standard reference ring.
                4. Eddy Current Reference Ring. The reference ring must be produced to represent each cylinder to be tested. The reference ring must include artificial notches to simulate a neck crack. The size of the artificial notch (depth and length) must have a depth less than or equal to1/3 of the wall thickness of the neck and a length greater than or equal to two threads. The standard reference must have a drawing that includes the diameter of the ring, and depth and length of each notch.
                5. Condemnation Criteria. A cylinder must be condemned if the eddy current examination combined with visual examination reveals any crack in the neck or shoulder of 2 thread lengths or more.
                6. Examination equipment records. Records of eddy current inspection equipment shall contain the following information:
                (i) Equipment manufacturer, model number and serial number.
                (ii) Probe description and unique identification (e.g., serial number, part number, etc.).
                7. Eddy current examination reporting and record retention requirements. Daily records of eddy current examinations must be maintained by the person who performs the requalification until either the expiration of the requalification period or until the cylinder is again requalified, whichever occurs first. These records shall be made available for inspection by a representative of the Department on request. Eddy current examination records shall contain the following information:
                (i) Specification of each standard reference ring used to perform the eddy current examination.
                (ii) DOT specification or exemption number of the cylinder; manufacturer's name or symbol; owner's name or symbol, if present; serial number; and, date of manufacture.
                (iii) Name of test operator performing the eddy current examination.
                (iv) Date of eddy current examination.
                (vi) Acceptance/condemnation results (e.g., pass or fail).
                (vii) Retester identification number.
                8. Personnel Qualification Requirements. Each person who performs eddy current and visual examinations, and evaluates and certifies retest results must be certified by the employer that he/she has been properly trained and tested in the eddy current and visual examination procedures.
                9. Training Records. A record of current training must be maintained for each employee who performs eddy current and visual examinations in accordance with § 172.704(d).

                Appendix D to Part 180—Hazardous Materials Corrosive to Tanks or Service Equipment
                This list contains materials identified either by proper shipping name in 49 CFR 172.101 or shipped under an “n.o.s.” shipping description that, under certain conditions, can corrode carbon steel tanks or service equipment at a rate that may reduce the design level of reliability and safety of the tank or equipment to an unsafe level before the next qualification. Materials identified on this list are considered corrosive to the tank or service equipment.

                While every effort was made to identify materials deemed corrosive to the tank or service equipment, owners and operators are cautioned that this list may not be inclusive. Tank car owners and operators are reminded of their duty to ensure that no in-service tank will deteriorate below the specified minimum thickness requirements in this subchapter. See § 180.509(f)(3). In addition, FRA states a tank car owner must designate an internal coating or lining appropriately based on its knowledge of the chemical and not rely simply on this list. Regarding future thickness tests, this list may also be modified based on an analysis of the test results by the car owner, the Department of Transportation, or the Association of American Railroads' Tank Car Committee.

                § 190.7
                Subpoenas; witness fees.
                (a) The Administrator, Chief Counsel, or the official designated by the Administrator to preside over a hearing convened in accordance with this part, may sign and issue subpoenas individually on his or her own initiative at any time, including pursuant to an inspection or investigation, or upon request and adequate showing by a participant to an enforcement proceeding that the information sought will materially advance the proceeding.
                (b) A subpoena may require the attendance of a witness, or the production of documentary or other tangible evidence in the possession or under the control of person served, or both.
                (c) A subpoena may be served personally by any person who is not an interested person and is not less than 18 years of age, or by certified mail.
                (d) Service of a subpoena upon the person named in the subpoena is achieved by delivering a copy of the subpoena to the person and by paying the fees for one day's attendance and mileage, as specified by paragraph (g) of this section. When a subpoena is issued at the instance of any officer or agency of the United States, fees and mileage need not be tendered at the time of service. Delivery of a copy of a subpoena and tender of the fees to a natural person may be made by handing them to the person, leaving them at the person's office with a person in charge, leaving them at the person's residence with a person of suitable age and discretion residing there, by mailing them by certified mail to the person at the last known address, or by any method whereby actual notice is given to the person and the fees are made available prior to the return date.

                (e) When the person to be served is not a natural person, delivery of a copy of the subpoena and tender of the fees may be achieved by handing them to a designated agent or representative for service, or to any officer, director, or agent in charge of any office of the person, or by mailing them by certified mail to that agent or representative and the fees are made available prior to the return date.
                (f) The original subpoena bearing a certificate of service shall be filed with the official having responsibility for the proceeding in connection with which the subpoena was issued.
                (g) A subpoenaed witness shall be paid the same fees and mileage as would be paid to a witness in a proceeding in the district courts of the United States. The witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the person at whose instance the subpoena was issued.
                (h) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section, and upon request, the witness fees and mileage may be paid by the PHMSA if the official who issued the subpoena determines on the basis of good cause shown, that:
                (1) The presence of the subpoenaed witness will materially advance the proceeding; and
                (2) The person at whose instance the subpoena was issued would suffer a serious hardship if required to pay the witness fees and mileage.
                (i) Any person to whom a subpoena is directed may, prior to the time specified therein for compliance, but in no event more than 10 days after the date of service of such subpoena, apply to the official who issued the subpoena, or if the person is unavailable, to the Administrator to quash or modify the subpoena. The application shall contain a brief statement of the reasons relied upon in support of the action sought therein. The Administrator, or this issuing official, as the case may be, may:
                (1) Deny the application;
                (2) Quash or modify the subpoena; or
                (3) Condition a grant or denial of the application to quash or modify the subpoena upon the satisfaction of certain just and reasonable requirements. The denial may be summary.
                (j) Upon refusal to obey a subpoena served upon any person under the provisions of this section, the PHMSA may request the Attorney General to seek the aid of the U. S. District Court for any District in which the person is found to compel that person, after notice, to appear and give testimony, or to appear and produce the subpoenaed documents before the PHMSA, or both.

                (a) In circumstances where a rule contained in parts 192, 193 and 195 of this chapter authorizes the Administrator to make a finding or approval, an operator may petition the Administrator for such a finding or approval.
                (b) Each petition must refer to the rule authorizing the action sought and contain information or arguments that justify the action. Unless otherwise specified, no public proceeding is held on a petition before it is granted or denied. After a petition is received, the Administrator or participating state agency notifies the petitioner of the disposition of the petition or, if the request requires more extensive consideration or additional information or comments are requested and delay is expected, of the date by which action will be taken.
                (1) For operators seeking a finding or approval involving intrastate pipeline transportation, petitions must be sent to:

                (c) All petitions must be received at least 90 days prior to the date by which the operator requests the finding or approval to be made.

                (d) The Administrator will make all findings or approvals of petitions initiated under this section. A participating state agency receiving petitions initiated under this section shall provide the Administrator a written recommendation as to the disposition of any petition received by them. Where the Administrator does not reverse or modify a recommendation made by a state agency within 10 business days of its receipt, the recommended disposition shall constitute the Administrator's decision on the petition.

                § 190.203
                Inspections and investigations.

                (a) Officers, employees, or agents authorized by the Associate Administrator for Pipeline Safety, PHMSA, upon presenting appropriate credentials, are authorized to enter upon, inspect, and examine, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, the records and properties of persons to the extent such records and properties are relevant to determining the compliance of such persons with the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq., or regulations or orders issued thereunder.
                (b) Inspections are ordinarily conducted pursuant to one of the following:
                (1) Routine scheduling by the Regional Director of the Region in which the facility is located;
                (2) A complaint received from a member of the public;
                (3) Information obtained from a previous inspection;
                (4) Report from a State Agency participating in the Federal Program under 49 U.S.C. 60105;
                (5) Pipeline accident or incident; or
                (6) Whenever deemed appropriate by the Associate Administrator.

                (c) If the Associate Administrator or Regional Director believes that further information is needed to determine appropriate action, the Associate Administrator or Regional Director may notify the pipeline operator in writing that the operator is required to provide specific information within 30 days from the time the notification is received by the operator, unless otherwise specified in the notification. The notification must provide a reasonable description of the specific information required. An operator may request an extension of time to respond by providing a written justification as to why such an extension is necessary and proposing an alternative submission date. A request for an extension may ask for the deadline to be stayed while the extension is considered. General statements of hardship are not acceptable bases for requesting an extension.

                (d) To the extent necessary to carry out the responsibilities under 49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq., the Administrator, or the Associate Administrator, may require testing of portions of pipeline facilities that have been involved in, or affected by, an accident. However, before exercising this authority, the Administrator, or the Associate Administrator, shall make every effort to negotiate a mutually acceptable plan with the owner of those facilities and, where appropriate, the National Transportation Safety Board for performing the testing.
                (e) If a representative of the U.S. Department of Transportation inspects or investigates an accident or incident involving a pipeline facility, the operator must make available to the representative all records and information that pertain to the event in any way, including integrity management plans and test results. The operator must provide all reasonable assistance in the investigation. Any person who obstructs an inspection or investigation by taking actions that were known or reasonably should have been known to prevent, hinder, or impede an investigation without good cause will be subject to administrative civil penalties under this subpart.
                (f) When OPS determines that the information obtained from an inspection or from other appropriate sources warrants further action, OPS may initiate one or more of the enforcement proceedings prescribed in this subpart.

                (a) A Regional Director begins a proceeding to determine whether an operator's plans or procedures required under parts 192, 193, 195, and 199 of this subchapter are inadequate to assure safe operation of a pipeline facility by issuing a notice of amendment. The notice will specify the alleged inadequacies and the proposed revisions of the plans or procedures and provide an opportunity to respond. The notice will allow the operator 30 days following receipt of the notice to submit written comments, revised procedures, or a request for a hearing under § 190.211.
                (b) After considering all material presented in writing or at the hearing, if applicable, the Associate Administrator determines whether the plans or procedures are inadequate as alleged. The Associate Administrator issues an order directing amendment of the plans or procedures if they are inadequate, or withdraws the notice if they are not. In determining the adequacy of an operator's plans or procedures, the Associate Administrator may consider:
                (1) Relevant pipeline safety data;
                (2) Whether the plans or procedures are appropriate for the particular type of pipeline transportation or facility, and for the location of the facility;
                (3) The reasonableness of the plans or procedures; and
                (4) The extent to which the plans or procedures contribute to public safety.

                (c) An order directing amendment of an operator's plans or procedures prescribed in this section may be in addition to, or in conjunction with, other appropriate enforcement actions prescribed in this subpart.

                § 190.207
                Notice of probable violation.

                (a) Except as otherwise provided by this subpart, a Regional Director begins an enforcement proceeding by serving a notice of probable violation on a person charging that person with a probable violation of 49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq., 33 U.S.C. 1321(j), or any regulation or order issued thereunder.
                (b) A notice of probable violation issued under this section shall include:
                (1) Statement of the provisions of the laws, regulations or orders which the respondent is alleged to have violated and a statement of the evidence upon which the allegations are based;
                (2) Notice of response options available to the respondent under § 190.208;
                (3) If a civil penalty is proposed under § 190.221, the amount of the proposed civil penalty and the maximum civil penalty for which respondent is liable under law; and
                (4) If a compliance order is proposed under § 190.217, a statement of the remedial action being sought in the form of a proposed compliance order.
                (c) The Regional Director may amend a notice of probable violation at any time prior to issuance of a final order under § 190.213. If an amendment includes any new material allegations of fact, proposes an increased civil penalty amount, or proposes new or additional remedial action under § 190.217, the respondent will have the opportunity to respond under § 190.208.

                § 190.208
                Response options.
                Within 30 days of receipt of a notice of probable violation, the respondent must answer the Regional Director who issued the notice in the following manner:
                (a) When the notice contains a proposed civil penalty—
                (1) If the respondent is not contesting an allegation of probable violation, pay the proposed civil penalty as provided in § 190.227 and advise the Regional Director of the payment. The payment authorizes the Associate Administrator to make a finding of violation and to issue a final order under § 190.213;
                (2) If the respondent is not contesting an allegation of probable violation but wishes to submit a written explanation, information, or other materials the respondent believes may warrant mitigation or elimination of the proposed civil penalty, the respondent may submit such materials. This authorizes the Associate Administrator to make a finding of violation and to issue a final order under § 190.213;
                (3) If the respondent is contesting one or more allegations of probable violation but is not requesting a hearing under § 190.211, the respondent may submit a written response in answer to the allegations; or
                (4) The respondent may request a hearing under § 190.211.
                (b) When the notice contains a proposed compliance order—
                (1) If the respondent is not contesting an allegation of probable violation, agree to the proposed compliance order. This authorizes the Associate Administrator to make a finding of violation and to issue a final order under § 190.213;
                (2) Request the execution of a consent order under § 190.219;
                (3) If the respondent is contesting one or more of the allegations of probable violation or compliance terms, but is not requesting a hearing under § 190.211, the respondent may object to the proposed compliance order and submit written explanations, information, or other materials in answer to the allegations in the notice of probable violation; or
                (4) The respondent may request a hearing under § 190.211.
                (c) Before or after responding in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section or, when applicable paragraph (b) of this section, the respondent may request a copy of the violation report from the Regional Director as set forth in § 190.209. The Regional Director will provide the violation report to the respondent within five business days of receiving a request.

                (d) Failure to respond in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section or, when applicable paragraph (b) of this section, constitutes a waiver of the right to contest the allegations in the notice of probable violation and authorizes the Associate Administrator, without further notice to the respondent, to find the facts as alleged in the notice of probable violation and to issue a final order under § 190.213.
                (e) All materials submitted by operators in response to enforcement actions may be placed on publicly accessible Web sites. A respondent seeking confidential treatment under 5 U.S.C. 552(b) for any portion of its responsive materials must provide a second copy of such materials along with the complete original document. A respondent may redact the portions it believes qualify for confidential treatment in the second copy but must provide a written explanation for each redaction.

                (a) The case file, as defined in this section, is available to the respondent in all enforcement proceedings conducted under this subpart.
                (b) The case file of an enforcement proceeding consists of the following:

                (2) In cases commenced under § 190.207, the notice of probable violation and the violation report;

                (5) Any documents and other material submitted by the respondent in response to the enforcement action;
                (6) In cases involving a hearing, any material submitted during and after the hearing as set forth in § 190.211; and
                (7) The Regional Director's written evaluation of response material submitted by the respondent and recommendation for final action, if one is prepared.

                § 190.210
                Separation of functions.
                (a) General. An agency employee who assists in the investigation or prosecution of an enforcement case may not participate in the decision of that case or a factually related one, but may participate as a witness or counsel at a hearing as set forth in this subpart. Likewise, an agency employee who prepares a decision in an enforcement case may not have served in an investigative or prosecutorial capacity in that case or a factually related one.
                (b) Prohibition on ex parte communications. A party to an enforcement proceeding, including the respondent, its representative, or an agency employee having served in an investigative or prosecutorial capacity in the proceeding, may not communicate privately with the Associate Administrator, Presiding Official, or attorney drafting the recommended decision concerning information that is relevant to the questions to be decided in the proceeding. A party may communicate with the Presiding Official regarding administrative or procedural issues, such as for scheduling a hearing.

                § 190.211
                Hearing.
                (a) General. This section applies to hearings conducted under this part relating to civil penalty assessments, compliance orders, orders directing amendment, safety orders, and corrective action orders. The Presiding Official will convene hearings conducted under this section.
                (b) Hearing request and statement of issues. A request for a hearing must be accompanied by a statement of the issues that the respondent intends to raise at the hearing. The issues may relate to the allegations in the notice, the proposed corrective action, or the proposed civil penalty amount. A respondent's failure to specify an issue may result in waiver of the respondent's right to raise that issue at the hearing. The respondent's request must also indicate whether or not the respondent will be represented by counsel at the hearing. The respondent may withdraw a request for a hearing in writing and provide a written response.
                
                (c) Telephonic and in-person hearings. A telephone hearing will be held if the amount of the proposed civil penalty or the cost of the proposed corrective action is less than $25,000, unless the respondent or OPS submits a written request for an in-person hearing. In-person hearings will normally be held at the office of the appropriate OPS Region. Hearings may be held by video teleconference if the necessary equipment is available to all parties.
                (d) Pre-hearing submissions. If OPS or the respondent intends to introduce material, including records, documents, and other exhibits not already in the case file, the material must be submitted to the Presiding Official and the other party at least 10 days prior to the date of the hearing, unless the Presiding Official sets a different deadline or waives the deadline for good cause.
                (e) Conduct of the hearing. The hearing is conducted informally without strict adherence to rules of evidence. The Presiding Official regulates the course of the hearing and gives each party an opportunity to offer facts, statements, explanations, documents, testimony or other evidence that is relevant and material to the issues under consideration. The parties may call witnesses on their own behalf and examine the evidence and witnesses presented by the other party. After the evidence in the case has been presented, the Presiding Official will permit reasonable discussion of the issues under consideration.
                (f) Written transcripts. If a respondent elects to transcribe a hearing, the respondent must make arrangements with a court reporter at cost to the respondent and submit a complete copy of the transcript for the case file. The respondent must notify the Presiding Official in advance if it intends to transcribe a hearing.
                (g) Post-hearing submission. The respondent and OPS may request an opportunity to submit further written material after the hearing for inclusion in the record. The Presiding Official will allow a reasonable time for the submission of the material and will specify the submission date. If the material is not submitted within the time prescribed, the case will proceed to final action without the material.
                (h) Preparation of decision. After consideration of the case file, the Presiding Official prepares a recommended decision in the case, which is then forwarded to the Associate Administrator for issuance of a final order.

                (a) General. The Presiding Official for a hearing conducted under § 190.211 is an attorney on the staff of the Deputy Chief Counsel who is not engaged in any investigative or prosecutorial functions, such as the issuance of notices under this subpart. If the designated Presiding Official is unavailable, the Deputy Chief Counsel may delegate the powers and duties specified in this section to another attorney in the Office of Chief Counsel who is not engaged in any investigative or prosecutorial functions under this subpart.
                (b) Time and place of the hearing. The Presiding Official will set the date, time and location of the hearing. To the extent practicable, the Presiding Official will accommodate the parties' schedules when setting the hearing. Reasonable notice of the hearing will be provided to all parties.
                (c) Powers and duties of Presiding Official. The Presiding Official will conduct a fair and impartial hearing and take all action necessary to avoid delay in the disposition of the proceeding and maintain order. The Presiding Official has all powers necessary to achieve those ends, including, but not limited to the power to:
                (1) Regulate the course of the hearing and conduct of the parties and their counsel;
                (2) Receive evidence and inquire into the relevant and material facts;
                (3) Require the submission of documents and other information;
                (4) Direct that documents or briefs relate to issues raised during the course of the hearing;
                (5) Set the date for filing documents, briefs, and other items;
                (6) Prepare a recommended decision; and

If a hearing is held, the Presiding Official prepares the recommended decision as set forth in § 190.211. The recommended decision is forwarded to the Associate Administrator who considers the case file and issues a final order. The final order includes—
                (1) A statement of findings and determinations on all material issues, including a determination as to whether each alleged violation has been proved;
                (2) If a civil penalty is assessed, the amount of the penalty and the procedures for payment of the penalty, provided that the assessed civil penalty may not exceed the penalty proposed in the notice of probable violation; and

                  § 190.233
                  Corrective action orders.
                  (a) Generally. Except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section, if the Associate Administrator finds, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing in accord with paragraph (c) of this section, a particular pipeline facility is or would be hazardous to life, property, or the environment, the Associate Administrator may issue an order pursuant to this section requiring the operator of the facility to take corrective action. Corrective action may include suspended or restricted use of the facility, physical inspection, testing, repair, replacement, or other appropriate action.
                  (b) Waiver of notice and expedited review. The Associate Administrator may waive the requirement for notice and opportunity for hearing under paragraph (a) of this section before issuing an order whenever the Associate Administrator determines that the failure to do so would result in the likelihood of serious harm to life, property, or the environment. When an order is issued under this paragraph, a respondent that contests the order may obtain expedited review of the order either by answering in writing to the order within 10 days of receipt or requesting a hearing under § 190.211 to be held as soon as practicable in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. For purposes of this section, the term “expedited review” is defined as the process for making a prompt determination of whether the order should remain in effect or be amended or terminated. The expedited review of an order issued under this paragraph will be complete upon issuance of such determination.
                  (c) Notice and hearing:
                  
                  (1) Written notice that OPS intends to issue an order under this section will be served upon the owner or operator of an alleged hazardous facility in accordance with § 190.5. The notice must allege the existence of a hazardous facility and state the facts and circumstances supporting the issuance of a corrective action order. The notice must provide the owner or operator with an opportunity to respond within 10 days of receipt.
                  (2) An owner or operator that elects to exercise its opportunity for a hearing under this section must notify the Associate Administrator of that election in writing within 10 days of receipt of the notice provided under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or the order under paragraph (b) of this section when applicable. The absence of such written notification waives an owner or operator's opportunity for a hearing.
                  (3) At any time after issuance of a notice or order under this section, the respondent may request a copy of the case file as set forth in § 190.209.
                  (4) A hearing under this section is conducted pursuant to § 190.211. The hearing should be held within 15 days of receipt of the respondent's request for a hearing.
                  (5) After conclusion of a hearing under this section, the Presiding Official submits a recommended decision to the Associate Administrator as to whether or not the facility is or would be hazardous to life, property, or the environment, and if necessary, requiring expeditious corrective action. If a notice or order is contested in writing without a hearing, an attorney from the Office of Chief Counsel prepares the recommended decision. The recommended decision should be submitted to the Associate Administrator within five business days after conclusion of the hearing or after receipt of the respondent's written objection if no hearing is held. Upon receipt of the recommendation, the Associate Administrator will proceed in accordance with paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section. If the Associate Administrator finds the facility is or would be hazardous to life, property, or the environment, the Associate Administrator issues a corrective action order in accordance with this section, or confirms (or amends) the corrective action order issued under paragraph (b) of this section. If the Associate Administrator does not find the facility is or would be hazardous to life, property, or the environment, the Associate Administrator withdraws the notice or terminates the order issued under paragraph (b) of this section, and promptly notifies the operator in writing by service as prescribed in § 190.5.
                  (d) The Associate Administrator may find a pipeline facility to be hazardous under paragraph (a) of this section:
                  (1) If under the facts and circumstances the Associate Administrator determines the particular facility is hazardous to life, property, or the environment; or

                  (2) If the pipeline facility or a component thereof has been constructed or operated with any equipment, material, or technique which the Associate Administrator determines is hazardous to life, property, or the environment, unless the operator involved demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Associate Administrator that, under the particular facts and circumstances involved, such equipment, material, or technique is not hazardous.
                  (e) In making a determination under paragraph (d) of this section, the Associate Administrator shall consider, if relevant:
                  (1) The characteristics of the pipe and other equipment used in the pipeline facility involved, including its age, manufacturer, physical properties (including its resistance to corrosion and deterioration), and the method of its manufacture, construction or assembly;
                  (2) The nature of the materials transported by such facility (including their corrosive and deteriorative qualities), the sequence in which such materials are transported, and the pressure required for such transportation;
                  (3) The characteristics of the geographical areas in which the pipeline facility is located, in particular the climatic and geologic conditions (including soil characteristics) associated with such areas, and the population density and population and growth patterns of such areas;
                  (4) Any recommendation of the National Transportation Safety Board issued in connection with any investigation conducted by the Board; and
                  (5) Such other factors as the Associate Administrator may consider appropriate.
                  (f) A corrective action order shall contain the following information:
                  (1) A finding that the pipeline facility is or would be hazardous to life, property, or the environment.
                  (2) The relevant facts which form the basis of that finding.
                  (3) The legal basis for the order.
                  (4) The nature and description of any particular corrective action required of the respondent.
                  (5) The date by which the required corrective action must be taken or completed and, where appropriate, the duration of the order.
                  (6) If the opportunity for a hearing was waived pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, a statement that an opportunity for a hearing will be available at a particular time and location after issuance of the order.
                  (g) The Associate Administrator will terminate a corrective action order whenever the Associate Administrator determines that the facility is no longer hazardous to life, property, or the environment. If appropriate, however, a notice of probable violation may be issued under § 190.207.
                  (h) At any time after a corrective action order issued under this section has become effective, the Associate Administrator may request the Attorney General to bring an action for appropriate relief in accordance with § 190.235.
                  (i) Upon petition by the Attorney General, the District Courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to enforce orders issued under this section by appropriate means.

                  § 190.235
                  Civil actions generally.

                  Whenever it appears to the Associate Administrator that a person has engaged, is engaged, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of 49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq., or any regulations issued thereunder, the Administrator, or the person to whom the authority has been delegated, may request the Attorney General to bring an action in the appropriate U.S. District Court for such relief as is necessary or appropriate, including mandatory or prohibitive injunctive relief, interim equitable relief, civil penalties, and punitive damages as provided under 49 U.S.C. 60120 and 49 U.S.C. 5123.

                  Emergency orders.
                  (a) Determination of imminent hazard. When the Administrator determines that a violation of a provision of the Federal pipeline safety laws, or a regulation or order prescribed under those laws, an unsafe condition or practice, or a combination of unsafe conditions and practices, constitutes or is causing an imminent hazard, as defined in § 190.3, the Administrator may issue or impose an emergency order, without advance notice or an opportunity for a hearing. The basis for any action taken under this section will be set forth in writing that describes:
                  (1) The violation, condition, or practice that constitutes or is causing the imminent hazard;
                  (2) Those subject to the order;
                  (3) The restrictions, prohibitions, or safety measures imposed;
                  (4) The standards and procedures for obtaining relief from the order;
                  (5) How the order is tailored to abate the imminent hazard and the reasons the authorities under 49 U.S.C. 60112 and 60117(l) are insufficient to do so;
                  (6) How the considerations listed in paragraph (c) of this section were taken into account.
                  (b) Consultation requirement. In evaluating the considerations under paragraph (c), the Administrator shall consult as the Administrator determines appropriate, with appropriate Federal agencies, State agencies, and other entities knowledgeable in pipeline safety or operations.
                  (c) Considerations. Prior to issuing an emergency order, the Administrator must consider the following:
                  (1) The impact of the emergency order on public health and safety;
                  (2) The impact, if any, of the emergency order on the national or regional economy or national security;
                  (3) The impact of the emergency order on the ability of owners and operators of pipeline facilities to maintain reliability and continuity of service to customers; and
                  (4) The result of consultations with appropriate Federal agencies, State agencies, and other entities knowledgeable in pipeline safety or operations.
                  (d) Service. The Administrator will publish emergency orders in the Federal Register, as soon as practicable upon issuance. In addition, OPS will post emergency orders on its Web site. The emergency order will contain filing and service requirements, including the address of DOT Docket Operations and of all persons to be served with petitions for review.

                    At 84 FR 52027, Oct. 1, 2019, § 190.236 was revised, effective Dec. 2, 2019. For the convenience of the user, the revised text is set forth as follows:
                    
                      
                        § 190.236
                        Emergency orders: Procedures for issuance and rescision.
                        (a) Determination of imminent hazard. When the Administrator determines that an unsafe condition or practice, or a combination of unsafe conditions and practices, constitutes or is causing an imminent hazard, as defined in § 190.3, the Administrator may issue or impose an emergency order, without advance notice or an opportunity for a hearing, but only to the extent necessary to abate the imminent hazard. The order will contain a written description of:
                        (1) The violation, condition, or practice that constitutes or is causing the imminent hazard;
                        (2) Those entities subject to the order;
                        (3) The restrictions, prohibitions, or safety measures imposed;
                        (4) The standards and procedures for obtaining relief from the order;
                        (5) How the order is tailored to abate the imminent hazard and the reasons the authorities under 49 U.S.C. 60112 and 60117(l) are insufficient to do so; and
                        (6) How the considerations listed in paragraph (c) of this section were taken into
                        account.
                        (b) Consultation. In considering the factors under paragraph (c) of this section, the Administrator shall consult, as the Administrator determines appropriate, with appropriate Federal agencies, State agencies, and other entities knowledgeable in pipeline safety or operations.
                        (c) Considerations. Prior to issuing an emergency order, the Administrator shall consider the following, as appropriate:
                        (1) The impact of the emergency order on public health and safety;
                        (2) The impact, if any, of the emergency order on the national or regional economy or national security;
                        (3) The impact of the emergency order on the ability of owners and operators of pipeline facilities to maintain reliability and continuity of service to customers; and
                        (4) The results of any consultations with appropriate Federal agencies, State agencies, and other entities knowledgeable in pipeline safety or operations.
                        (d) Service. The Administrator will provide service of emergency orders in accordance with § 190.5 to all operators of gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities that the Administrator reasonably expects to be affected by the emergency order. In addition, the Administrator will publish emergency orders in the Federal Register and post them on the PHMSA website as soon as practicable upon issuance. Publication in the Federal Register will serve as general notice of an emergency order. Each emergency order must contain information specifying how pipeline operators and owners may respond to the emergency order, filing procedures, and service requirements, including the address of DOT Docket Operations and the names and addresses of all persons to be served if a petition for review is filed.
                        (e) Rescission. If an emergency order has been in effect for more than 365 days, the Administrator will make an assessment regarding whether the unsafe condition or practice, or combination of unsafe conditions and practices, constituting or causing an imminent hazard, as defined in § 190.3, continues to exist. If the imminent hazard does not continue to exist, the Administrator will rescind the emergency order and follow the service procedures set forth in § 190.236(d). If the imminent hazard underlying the emergency order continues to exist, PHMSA will initiate a rulemaking action as soon as practicable.
                      
                    
                  
                
                
                  § 190.237
                  Petitions for review.
                  (a) Requirements. An entity that is subject to and aggrieved by an emergency order may petition the Administrator for review to determine whether the order will remain in place, be modified, or terminated. A petition for review must:
                  (1) Be in writing;
                  (2) State with particularity each part of the emergency order that is sought to be amended or rescinded and include all information, evidence and arguments in support thereof;
                  (3) State whether a formal hearing in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554 is requested, and, if so, the material facts in dispute giving rise to the request for a hearing; and,
                  (4) Be filed and served in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
                  (b) Response to the petition for review. An attorney designated by the Office of Chief Counsel may file and serve, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, a response, including appropriate pleadings, within five days of receipt of the petition by the Chief Counsel.
                  (c) Associate Administrator for Pipeline Safety Responsibilities—(1) Hearing requested. Upon receipt of a petition for review of an emergency order that includes a formal hearing request and states material facts in dispute, the Associate Administrator for Pipeline Safety will immediately assign the petition to the Office of Hearings, DOT. Unless the Associate Administrator for Pipeline Safety issues an order stating that the petition fails to set forth material facts in dispute and will be decided under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a petition for review including a formal hearing request will be deemed assigned to the Office of Hearings three days after the Associate Administrator for Pipeline Safety receives it.
                  (2) No hearing requested. For a petition for review of an emergency order that does not include a formal hearing request or fails to state material facts in dispute, the Associate Administrator for Pipeline Safety must issue an administrative decision on the merits within 30 days of receipt of the petition. The Associate Administrator for Pipeline Safety's decision constitutes the agency's final decision.
                  (3) Consolidation. If the Associate Administrator for Pipeline Safety receives more than one petition for review of an emergency order, and those petitions share common issues of law or fact, the Associate Administrator for Pipeline Safety may consolidate those petitions for the purposes of complying with this section.
                  (4) Agency authority to request a formal hearing. In the event that a petitioner does not request a formal hearing, the Associate Administrator for Pipeline Safety may still reassign the petition to the Office of Hearings, DOT, when a reasonable basis exists for the reassignment.
                  (d) Hearings. Formal hearings must be conducted by an Administrative Law Judge assigned by the Chief Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Hearings. The Administrative Law Judge may:
                  (1) Administer oaths and affirmations;
                  (2) Issue subpoenas as provided by the appropriate agency regulations (49 CFR 190.7 and 49 U.S.C. 60117);
                  (3) Adopt the relevant Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for the United States District Courts for the procedures governing the hearings when appropriate;
                  (4) Adopt the relevant Federal Rules of Evidence for United States Courts and Magistrates for the submission of evidence when appropriate;
                  (5) Take or cause depositions to be taken;
                  (6) Examine witnesses at the hearing;

                  (7) Rule on offers of proof and receive relevant evidence;
                  
                  (8) Convene, recess, adjourn or otherwise regulate the course of the hearing;
                  (9) Hold conferences for settlement, simplification of the issues, or any other proper purpose; and,
                  (10) Take any other action authorized by or consistent with the provisions of this part and permitted by law that may expedite the hearing or aid in the disposition of an issue raised.
                  (e) Parties. The petitioner may appear and be heard in person or by an authorized representative. PHMSA will be represented by an attorney designated by the Office of Chief Counsel.

                  (4) If applicable, service upon a person's duly authorized representative, agent for service, or an organization's president constitutes service upon that person.
                  (g) Report and recommendation. The Administrative Law Judge must issue a report and recommendation at the close of the record. The report and recommendation must:
                  (1) Contain findings of fact and conclusions of law and the grounds for the decision based on the material issues of fact or law presented on the record;

                  (2) The Associate Administrator of Pipeline Safety must issue a final agency decision within three days of service of the final pleading outlined in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, but no later than 30 days after receipt of the original petition for review.
                  (3) The Associate Administrator of Pipeline Safety's decision on the merits of a petition for reconsideration constitutes the agency's final decision.
                  (i) Judicial review. After the issuance of a final agency decision pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) or (h)(3) of this section, or the issuance of a written determination by the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (j) of this section, a person subject to, and aggrieved by, an emergency order issued under section 190.236 may seek judicial review of the order in the appropriate District Court of the United States. The filing of an action seeking judicial review does not stay or modify the force and effect of the agency's final decision under paragraph (c)(2) or (h)(3) of this section, or the written determination under paragraph (j) of this section, unless stayed or modified by the Administrator.
                  (j) Expiration of order. If the Associate Administrator of Pipeline Safety, or the Administrative Law Judge, where appropriate, has not disposed of the petition for review within 30 days of receipt, the emergency order will cease to be effective unless the Administrator issuing the emergency order determines, in writing, that the imminent hazard providing a basis for the emergency order continues to exist.
                  (k) Time. In computing any period of time prescribed by this part or by an order issued by the Administrative Law Judge, the day of filing of the petition for review or of any other act, event, or default from which the designated period of time begins to run will not be included.

                        Emergency orders: Petitions for review.
                        (a) Requirements. A pipeline owner or operator that is subject to and aggrieved by an emergency order may petition the Administrator for review to determine whether the order will remain in place, be modified, or be terminated. A petition for review must:
                        (1) Be in writing;
                        (2) State with particularity each part of the emergency order that is sought to be modified or terminated and include all information, evidence and arguments in support thereof;
                        (3) State whether the petitioner requests a formal hearing in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554, and, if so, any material facts in dispute; and,
                        (4) Be filed and served in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
                        (b) Modification of petitions. A petitioner may modify its petition for review to provide new information that materially affects the review proceeding and that is timely submitted. Where the petitioner has not requested a formal hearing, the Associate Administrator will make the determination whether to accept the new information. Where a case has been assigned for a formal hearing, the presiding administrative law judge will determine whether to accept the new information.
                        (c) Response to the petition for review. An attorney designated by the Office of Chief Counsel may file and serve, in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section, a response to the petition, including appropriate pleadings, within five calendar days of receipt of the petition by the Chief Counsel.
                        (d) Associate Administrator's responsibilities.—(1) Formal hearing requested. Upon receipt of a petition for review that includes a formal hearing request under this section, the Associate Administrator will, within three days after receipt of the petition, assign the petition to the Office of Hearings, DOT, for a formal hearing.
                        (2) No formal hearing requested. Upon receipt of a petition for review that does not include a formal hearing request, the Associate Administrator will issue an administrative decision on the merits within 30 days of receipt of the petition for review. The Associate Administrator's decision constitutes the agency's final decision.
                        (3) Consolidation. If the Associate Administrator receives more than one petition for review and they share common issues of law or fact, the Associate Administrator may consolidate the petitions for the purpose of complying with this section, provided such consolidation occurs prior to the commencement of a formal hearing. The Associate Administrator may reassign a petition that does not request a formal hearing to the Office of Hearings, DOT, provided the petition otherwise meets the requirements for consolidation. If the Associate Administrator has consolidated multiple petitions that do not request a formal hearing, he may de-consolidate such petitions if there has been a change in circumstances that, in his discretion, warrant separation for the purpose of rendering a final decision.
                        (e) Formal Hearings. Formal hearings must be conducted by an administrative law judge assigned by the chief administrative law judge of the Office of Hearings, DOT. The administrative law judge may:
                        (1) Administer oaths and affirmations;

                        (2) Issue subpoenas as provided by the appropriate statutes and agency regulations (e.g., 49 U.S.C. 60117 and 49 CFR 190.7);
                        
                        (3) Adopt the relevant Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for the United States District Courts for the procedures governing the hearings, when appropriate;
                        (4) Adopt the relevant Federal Rules of Evidence for United States Courts and Magistrates for the submission of evidence, when appropriate;
                        (5) Take or cause depositions to be taken;
                        (6) Examine witnesses at the hearing;
                        (7) Rule on offers of proof and receive relevant evidence;
                        (8) Convene, recess, adjourn or otherwise regulate the course of the hearing;
                        (9) Hold conferences for settlement, simplification of the issues, or any other proper purpose; and
                        (10) Take any other action authorized by or consistent with the provisions of this part and permitted by law that may expedite the hearing or aid in the disposition of an issue raised.
                        (f) Parties. The petitioner may appear and be heard in person or by an authorized representative. PHMSA will be represented by an attorney designated by the Office of Chief Counsel.
                        (g) Burden of proof. Except in the case of an affirmative defense, PHMSA shall bear the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, the validity of an emergency order in a proceeding under this section by a preponderance of the evidence. A party asserting an affirmative defense shall bear the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, the affirmative defense in a proceeding under this section.
                        (h) Filing and service. (1) Each petition, pleading, motion, notice, order, or other document submitted in connection with an emergency order issued under this section must be filed (commercially delivered or submitted electronically) with: U.S. Department of Transportation, Docket Operations, M-30, West Building Ground Floor, Room W12-140, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE, Washington, DC 20590.

                        (3) Service must be made in accordance with § 190.5 of this part. The emergency order must state all relevant service requirements and list the persons to be served and may be updated as necessary.
                        (4) Certificate of service. Each order, pleading, motion, notice, or other document must be accompanied by a certificate of service specifying the manner in which and the date on which service was made.
                        (5) If applicable, service upon a person's duly authorized representative, agent for service, or an organization's president or chief executive officer constitutes service upon that person.
                        (i) Report and recommendation. The administrative law judge must issue a report and recommendation to the Associate Administrator at the close of the record. The report and recommendation must:
                        (1) Contain findings of fact and conclusions of law and the grounds for the decision, based on the material issues of fact or law presented on the record;
                        (2) Be served on the parties to the proceeding; and

                        (j) Petition for reconsideration. (1) A petitioner aggrieved by the administrative law judge's report and recommendation may file a petition for reconsideration with the Associate Administrator. The petition for reconsideration must be filed:
                        (i) Not more than five days after the administrative law judge has issued a report and recommendation under paragraph (i) of this section, provided such report and recommendation is issued 20 days or less after the petition for review was filed with PHMSA; or
                        (ii) Not more than two days after the administrative law judge has issued his or her report and recommendation under paragraph (h) of this section, where such report and recommendation are issued more than 20 days after the petition for review was filed with PHMSA.
                        (2) The Associate Administrator must issue a decision on a petition for reconsideration no later than 30 days after receipt of the petition for review. Such decision constitutes final agency action on a petition for review.
                        (k) Judicial review. (1) After the issuance of a final agency decision pursuant to paragraphs (d)(2) or (j)(2) of this section, or the issuance of a written determination by the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (l) of this section, a pipeline owner or operator subject to and aggrieved by an emergency order issued under § 190.236 may seek judicial review of the order in the appropriate district court of the United States. The filing of an action seeking judicial review does not stay or modify the force and effect of the agency's final decision under paragraphs (d)(2) or (j)(3) of this section, or the written determination under paragraph (l) of this section, unless stayed or modified by the Administrator.
                        (l) Expiration of order. (1) No petition for review filed: If no petition for review is filed challenging the emergency order, then the emergency order shall remain in effect until PHMSA determines, in writing, that the imminent hazard no longer exists or the order is terminated by a court of competent jurisdiction.
                        (2) Petition for review filed and decision rendered within 30 days. If the Associate Administrator renders a final decision upon a petition for review within 30 days of its receipt by PHMSA, any elements of the emergency order upheld or modified by the decision shall remain in effect until PHMSA determines, in writing, that the imminent hazard no longer exists or the order is terminated by a court of competent jurisdiction.
                        (3) Petition for review filed but no decision rendered within 30 days. If the Associate Administrator has not reached a decision on the petition for review within 30 days of receipt of the petition for review, the emergency order will cease to be effective unless the Administrator determines, in writing, that the imminent hazard providing a basis for the emergency order continues to exist.
                        (m) Time. In computing any period of time prescribed by this section or an order or report and recommendation issued by an administrative law judge under this section, the day of filing of a petition for review or of any other act, event or default from which the designated period of time begins to run will not be included. The last day of the period so computed will be included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, in which event the period runs until end of the next day which is not one of the aforementioned days.
                      
                    
                  
                
                
                  § 190.239
                  Safety orders.
                  (a) When may PHMSA issue a safety order? If the Associate Administrator finds, after notice and an opportunity for hearing under paragraph (b) of this section, that a particular pipeline facility has a condition or conditions that pose a pipeline integrity risk to public safety, property, or the environment, the Associate Administrator may issue an order requiring the operator of the facility to take necessary corrective action. Such action may include physical inspection, testing, repair or other appropriate action to remedy the identified risk condition.
                  (b) How is an operator notified of the proposed issuance of a safety order and what are its responses options? (1) Notice of proposed safety order. PHMSA will serve written notice of a proposed safety order under § 190.5 to an operator of the pipeline facility. The notice will allege the existence of a condition that poses a pipeline integrity risk to public safety, property, or the environment, and state the facts and circumstances that support issuing a safety order for the specified pipeline or portion thereof. The notice will also specify proposed testing, evaluations, integrity assessment, or other actions to be taken by the operator and may propose that the operator submit a work plan and schedule to address the conditions identified in the notice. The notice will also provide the operator with its response options, including procedures for requesting informal consultation and a hearing. An operator receiving a notice will have 30 days to respond to the PHMSA official who issued the notice.
                  (2) Informal consultation. Upon timely request by the operator, PHMSA will provide an opportunity for informal consultation concerning the proposed safety order. Such informal consultation shall commence within 30 days, provided that PHMSA may extend this time by request or otherwise for good cause. Informal consultation provides an opportunity for the respondent to explain the circumstances associated with the risk condition(s) identified in the notice and, where appropriate, to present a proposal for corrective action, without prejudice to the operator's position in any subsequent hearing. If the respondent and Regional Director agree within 30 days of the informal consultation on a plan for the operator to address each risk condition, they may enter into a written consent agreement and the Associate Administrator may issue a consent order incorporating the terms of the agreement. If a consent agreement is reached, no further hearing will be provided in the matter and any pending hearing request will be considered withdrawn. If a consent agreement is not reached within 30 days of the informal consultation (or if informal consultation is not requested), the Associate Administrator may proceed under paragraphs (b)(3) through (5) of this section. If PHMSA subsequently determines that an operator has failed to comply with the terms of a consent order, PHMSA may obtain any administrative or judicial remedies available under 49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq. and this part. If a consent agreement is not reached, any admissions made by the operator during the informal consultation shall be excluded from the record in any subsequent hearing. Nothing in this paragraph (b) precludes PHMSA from terminating the informal consultation process if it has reason to believe that the operator is not engaging in good faith discussions or otherwise concludes that further consultation would not be productive or in the public interest.
                  (3) Hearing. An operator receiving a notice of proposed safety order may contest the notice, or any portion thereof, by filing a written request for a hearing within 30 days following receipt of the notice or within 10 days following the conclusion of informal consultation that did not result in a consent agreement, as applicable. In the absence of a timely request for a hearing, the Associate Administrator may issue a safety order in the form of the proposed order in accordance with paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section.
                  (4) Conduct of hearing. An attorney from the Office of Chief Counsel, will serve as the Presiding Official in a hearing under this section. The hearing will be conducted informally, without strict adherence to formal rules of evidence in accordance with § 190.211. The respondent may submit any relevant information or materials, call witnesses, and present arguments on the issue of whether a safety order should be issued to address the alleged presence of a condition that poses a pipeline integrity risk to public safety, property, or the environment.
                  (5) Post-hearing action. Following a hearing under this section, the Presiding Official will submit a recommendation to the Associate Administrator concerning issuance of a final safety order. Upon receipt of the recommendation, the Associate Administrator may proceed under paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section. If the Associate Administrator finds the facility to have a condition that poses a pipeline integrity risk to public safety, property, or the environment, the Associate Administrator will issue a safety order under this section. If the Associate Administrator does not find that the facility has such a condition, or concludes that a safety order is otherwise not warranted, the Associate Administrator will withdraw the notice and promptly notify the operator in writing by service as prescribed in § 190.5. Nothing in this subsection precludes PHMSA and the operator from entering into a consent agreement at any time before a safety order is issued.
                  (6) Termination of safety order. Once all remedial actions set forth in the safety order and associated work plans are completed, as determined by PHMSA, the Associate Administrator will notify the operator that the safety order has been lifted. The Associate Administrator shall suspend or terminate a safety order whenever the Associate Administrator determines that the pipeline facility no longer has a condition or conditions that pose a pipeline integrity risk to public safety, property, or the environment.
                  (c) How is the determination made that a pipeline facility has a condition that poses an integrity risk? The Associate Administrator may find a pipeline facility to have a condition that poses a pipeline integrity risk to public safety, property, or the environment under paragraph (a) of this section:
                  (1) If under the facts and circumstances the Associate Administrator determines the particular facility has such a condition; or

                  (2) If the pipeline facility or a component thereof has been constructed or operated with any equipment, material, or technique with a history of being susceptible to failure when used in pipeline service, unless the operator involved demonstrates that such equipment, material, or technique is not susceptible to failure given the manner it is being used for a particular facility.
                  
                  (d) What factors must PHMSA consider in making a determination that a risk condition is present? In making a determination under paragraph (c) of this section, the Associate Administrator shall consider, if relevant:
                  (1) The characteristics of the pipe and other equipment used in the pipeline facility involved, including its age, manufacturer, physical properties (including its resistance to corrosion and deterioration), and the method of its manufacture, construction or assembly;
                  (2) The nature of the materials transported by such facility (including their corrosive and deteriorative qualities), the sequence in which such materials are transported, and the pressure required for such transportation;
                  (3) The characteristics of the geographical areas where the pipeline facility is located, in particular the climatic and geologic conditions (including soil characteristics) associated with such areas;
                  (4) For hazardous liquid pipelines, the proximity of the pipeline to an unusually sensitive area;
                  (5) The population density and growth patterns of the area in which the pipeline facility is located;
                  (6) Any relevant recommendation of the National Transportation Safety Board issued in connection with any investigation conducted by the Board;
                  (7) The likelihood that the condition will impair the serviceability of the pipeline;
                  (8) The likelihood that the condition will worsen over time; and
                  (9) The likelihood that the condition is present or could develop on other areas of the pipeline.
                  (e) What information will be included in a safety order? A safety order shall contain the following:
                  (1) A finding that the pipeline facility has a condition that poses a pipeline integrity risk to public safety, property, or the environment;
                  (2) The relevant facts which form the basis of that finding;
                  (3) The legal basis for the order;
                  (4) The nature and description of any particular corrective actions to be required of the operator; and
                  (5) The date(s) by which the required corrective actions must be taken or completed and, where appropriate, the duration of the order.
                  (f) Can PHMSA take other enforcement actions on the affected facilities? Nothing in this section precludes PHMSA from issuing a Notice of Probable Violation under § 190.207 or taking other enforcement action if noncompliance is identified at the facilities that are the subject of a safety order proceeding.
                  (g) May I petition for reconsideration of a safety order? Yes, a petition for reconsideration may be submitted in accordance with § 190.243.
                  [73 FR 16567, Mar. 28, 2008, as amended at 74 FR 2893, Jan. 16, 2009; Amdt. 190-16, 78 FR 58913, Sept. 25, 2013]
                
                
                  § 190.241
                  Finality.
                  Except as otherwise provided by § 190.243, an order directing amendment issued under § 190.206, a final order issued under § 190.213, a corrective action order issued under § 190.233, or a safety order issued under § 190.239 is considered final administrative action on that enforcement proceeding.

                  § 190.243
                  Petitions for reconsideration.

                  (a) A respondent may petition the Associate Administrator for reconsideration of an order directing amendment of plans or procedures issued under § 190.206, a final order issued under § 190.213, or a safety order issued under § 190.239. The written petition must be received no later than 20 days after receipt of the order by the respondent. A copy of the petition must be provided to the Chief Counsel of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, East Building, 2nd Floor, Mail Stop E26-105, 1200 New Jersey Ave. SE., Washington, DC 20590 or by email to phmsachiefcounsel@dot.gov. Petitions received after that time will not be considered. The petition must contain a brief statement of the complaint and an explanation as to why the order should be reconsidered.

                  (b) If the respondent requests the consideration of additional facts or arguments, the respondent must submit the reasons why they were not presented prior to issuance of the final order.
                  
                  (c) The filing of a petition under this section stays the payment of any civil penalty assessed. However, unless the Associate Administrator otherwise provides, the order, including any required corrective action, is not stayed.
                  (d) The Associate Administrator may grant or deny, in whole or in part, any petition for reconsideration without further proceedings. If the Associate Administrator reconsiders an order under this section, a final decision on reconsideration may be issued without further proceedings, or, in the alternative, additional information, data, and comment may be requested by the Associate Administrator, as deemed appropriate.
                  (e) It is the policy of the Associate Administrator to expeditiously issue notice of the action taken on a petition for reconsideration. In cases where a substantial delay is expected, notice of that fact and the date by which it is expected that action will be taken is provided to the respondent upon request and whenever practicable.
                  (f) If the Associate Administrator reconsiders an order under this section, the decision on reconsideration is the final administrative action on that enforcement proceeding.
                  (g) Any application for judicial review must be filed no later than 89 days after the issuance of the decision in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 60119(a).
                  (h) Judicial review of agency action under 49 U.S.C. 60119(a) will apply the standards of review established in 5 U.S.C. 706.

                (e) No person shall be subject to criminal penalties under paragraph (a) of this section for violation of any regulation and the violation of any order issued under §§ 190.217, 190.219 or 190.291 if both violations are based on the same act.
              
              
                
                § 190.293
                Referral for prosecution.
                If a PHMSA employee becomes aware of any actual or possible activity subject to criminal penalties under § 190.291, the employee reports it to the Office of Chief Counsel, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, and to his or her supervisor. The Chief Counsel may refer the report to OPS for investigation. If appropriate, the Chief Counsel refers the report to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution of the offender.

                § 190.311
                General.

                Unless the Administrator, for good cause, finds that notice is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, and incorporates that finding and a brief statement of the reasons for it in the rule, a notice of proposed rulemaking is issued and interested persons are invited to participate in the rulemaking proceedings with respect to each substantive rule.
              
              
                § 190.313
                Initiation of rulemaking.
                The Administrator initiates rulemaking on his or her own motion; however, in so doing, the Administrator may use discretion to consider the recommendations of other agencies of the United States or of other interested persons including those of any technical advisory body established by statute for that purpose.
              
              
                § 190.315
                Contents of notices of proposed rulemaking.

                (a) Each notice of proposed rulemaking is published in the Federal Register, unless all persons subject to it are named and are personally served with a copy of it.
                (b) Each notice, whether published in the Federal Register or personally served, includes:
                (1) A statement of the time, place, and nature of the proposed rulemaking proceeding;
                (2) A reference to the authority under which it is issued;
                (3) A description of the subjects and issues involved or the substance and terms of the proposed regulation;
                (4) A statement of the time within which written comments must be submitted; and
                (5) A statement of how and to what extent interested persons may participate in the proceeding.

                (a) Any interested person may participate in rulemaking proceedings by submitting comments in writing containing information, views or arguments in accordance with instructions for participation in the rulemaking document.
                (b) The Administrator may invite any interested person to participate in the rulemaking proceedings described in § 190.325.
                (c) For the purposes of this subpart, an interested person includes any Federal or State government agency or any political subdivision of a State.
              
              
                § 190.319
                Petitions for extension of time to comment.

                A petition for extension of the time to submit comments must be submitted to PHMSA in accordance with § 190.309 and received by PHMSA not later than 10 days before expiration of the time stated in the notice. The filing of the petition does not automatically extend the time for petitioner's comments. A petition is granted only if the petitioner shows good cause for the extension, and if the extension is consistent with the public interest. If an extension is granted, it is granted to all persons, and it is published in the Federal Register.

                § 190.321
                Contents of written comments.
                All written comments must be in English. Any interested person should submit as part of written comments all material considered relevant to any statement of fact. Incorporation of material by reference should be avoided; however, where necessary, such incorporated material must be identified by document title and page.

                § 190.323
                Consideration of comments received.
                All timely comments and the recommendations of any technical advisory body established by statute for the purpose of reviewing the proposed rule concerned are considered before final action is taken on a rulemaking proposal. Late filed comments are considered so far as practicable.
              
              
                § 190.325
                Additional rulemaking proceedings.

                The Administrator may initiate any further rulemaking proceedings that the Administrator finds necessary or desirable. For example, interested persons may be invited to make oral arguments, to participate in conferences between the Administrator or the Administrator's representative and interested persons, at which minutes of the conference are kept, to appear at informal hearings presided over by officials designated by the Administrator at which a transcript of minutes are kept, or participate in any other proceeding to assure informed administrative action and to protect the public interest.
              
              
                § 190.327
                Hearings.

                (a) If a notice of proposed rulemaking does not provide for a hearing, any interested person may petition the Administrator for an informal hearing. The petition must be received by the Administrator not later than 20 days before expiration of the time stated in the notice. The filing of the petition does not automatically result in the scheduling of a hearing. A petition is granted only if the petitioner shows good cause for a hearing. If a petition for a hearing is granted, notice of the hearing is published in the Federal Register.
                
                (b) Sections 556 and 557 of title 5, United States Code, do not apply to hearings held under this subpart. Unless otherwise specified, hearings held under this subpart are informal, non-adversarial fact-finding proceedings, at which there are no formal pleadings or adverse parties. Any regulation issued in a case in which an informal hearing is held is not necessarily based exclusively on the record of the hearing.
                (c) The Administrator designates a representative to conduct any hearing held under this subpart. The Chief Counsel designates a member of his or her staff to serve as legal officer at the hearing.

                § 190.329
                Adoption of final rules.

                Final rules are prepared by representatives of the Office of Pipeline Safety and the Office of the Chief Counsel. The regulation is then submitted to the Administrator for consideration. If the Administrator adopts the regulation, it is published in the Federal Register, unless all persons subject to it are named and are personally served with a copy of it.
              
              
                § 190.331
                Petitions for rulemaking.
                (a) Any interested person may petition the Associate Administrator for Pipeline Safety to establish, amend, or repeal a substantive regulation, or may petition the Chief Counsel to establish, amend, or repeal a procedural regulation.
                (b) Each petition filed under this section must—
                (1) Summarize the proposed action and explain its purpose;
                (2) State the text of the proposed rule or amendment, or specify the rule proposed to be repealed;
                (3) Explain the petitioner's interest in the proposed action and the interest of any party the petitioner represents; and
                (4) Provide information and arguments that support the proposed action, including relevant technical, scientific or other data as available to the petitioner, and any specific known cases that illustrate the need for the proposed action.
                (c) If the potential impact of the proposed action is substantial, and information and data related to that impact are available to the petitioner, the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel may request the petitioner to provide—
                (1) The costs and benefits to society and identifiable groups within society, quantifiable and otherwise;
                (2) The direct effects (including preemption effects) of the proposed action on States, on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, and on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government;
                (3) The regulatory burden on small businesses, small organizations and small governmental jurisdictions;
                (4) The recordkeeping and reporting requirements and to whom they would apply; and
                (5) Impacts on the quality of the natural and social environments.
                (d) The Associate Administrator or Chief Counsel may return a petition that does not comply with the requirements of this section, accompanied by a written statement indicating the deficiencies in the petition.
              
              
                
                § 190.333
                Processing of petition.
                (a) General. Unless the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel otherwise specifies, no public hearing, argument, or other proceeding is held directly on a petition before its disposition under this section.
                (b) Grants. If the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel determines that the petition contains adequate justification, he or she initiates rulemaking action under this subpart.
                (c) Denials. If the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel determines that the petition does not justify rulemaking, the petition is denied.
                (d) Notification. The Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel will notify a petitioner, in writing, of the decision to grant or deny a petition for rulemaking.
              
              
                § 190.335
                Petitions for reconsideration.

                (a) Except as provided in § 190.339(d), any interested person may petition the Associate Administrator for reconsideration of any regulation issued under this subpart, or may petition the Chief Counsel for reconsideration of any procedural regulation issued under this subpart and contained in this subpart. The petition must be received not later than 30 days after publication of the rule in the Federal Register. Petitions filed after that time will be considered as petitions filed under § 190.331. The petition must contain a brief statement of the complaint and an explanation as to why compliance with the rule is not practicable, is unreasonable, or is not in the public interest.
                (b) If the petitioner requests the consideration of additional facts, the petitioner must state the reason they were not presented to the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel within the prescribed time.
                (c) The Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel does not consider repetitious petitions.
                (d) Unless the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel otherwise provides, the filing of a petition under this section does not stay the effectiveness of the rule.

                § 190.337
                Proceedings on petitions for reconsideration.
                (a) The Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel may grant or deny, in whole or in part, any petition for reconsideration without further proceedings, except where a grant of the petition would result in issuance of a new final rule. In the event that the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel determines to reconsider any regulation, a final decision on reconsideration may be issued without further proceedings, or an opportunity to submit comment or information and data as deemed appropriate, may be provided. Whenever the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel determines that a petition should be granted or denied, the Office of the Chief Counsel prepares a notice of the grant or denial of a petition for reconsideration, for issuance to the petitioner, and the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel issues it to the petitioner. The Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel may consolidate petitions relating to the same rules.

                (b) It is the policy of the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel to issue notice of the action taken on a petition for reconsideration within 90 days after the date on which the regulation in question is published in the Federal Register, unless it is found impracticable to take action within that time. In cases where it is so found and the delay beyond that period is expected to be substantial, notice of that fact and the date by which it is expected that action will be taken is issued to the petitioner and published in the Federal Register.
                
              
              
                § 190.338
                Appeals.
                (a) Any interested person may appeal a denial of the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel, issued under § 190.333 or § 190.337, to the Administrator.

                (b) An appeal must be received within 20 days of service of written notice to petitioner of the Associate Administrator's or the Chief Counsel's decision, or within 20 days from the date of publication of the decision in the Federal Register, and should set forth the contested aspects of the decision as well as any new arguments or information.
                
                (c) Unless the Administrator otherwise provides, the filing of an appeal under this section does not stay the effectiveness of any rule.

                § 190.339
                Direct final rulemaking.
                (a) Where practicable, the Administrator will use direct final rulemaking to issue the following types of rules:
                (1) Minor, substantive changes to regulations;
                (2) Incorporation by reference of the latest edition of technical or industry standards;
                (3) Extensions of compliance dates; and
                (4) Other noncontroversial rules where the Administrator determines that use of direct final rulemaking is in the public interest, and that a regulation is unlikely to result in adverse comment.

                (b) The direct final rule will state an effective date. The direct final rule will also state that unless an adverse comment or notice of intent to file an adverse comment is received within the specified comment period, generally 60 days after publication of the direct final rule in the Federal Register, the Administrator will issue a confirmation document, generally within 15 days after the close of the comment period, advising the public that the direct final rule will either become effective on the date stated in the direct final rule or at least 30 days after the publication date of the confirmation document, whichever is later.
                (c) For purposes of this section, an adverse comment is one which explains why the rule would be inappropriate, including a challenge to the rule's underlying premise or approach, or would be ineffective or unacceptable without a change. Comments that are frivolous or insubstantial will not be considered adverse under this procedure. A comment recommending a rule change in addition to the rule will not be considered an adverse comment, unless the commenter states why the rule would be ineffective without the additional change.
                (d) Only parties who filed comments to a direct final rule issued under this section may petition under § 190.335 for reconsideration of that direct final rule.

                (e) If an adverse comment or notice of intent to file an adverse comment is received, a timely document will be published in the Federal Register advising the public and withdrawing the direct final rule in whole or in part. The Administrator may then incorporate the adverse comment into a subsequent direct final rule or may publish a notice of proposed rulemaking. A notice of proposed rulemaking will provide an opportunity for public comment, generally a minimum of 60 days, and will be processed in accordance with §§ 190.311-190.329.
              
              
                § 190.341
                Special permits.
                (a) What is a special permit? A special permit is an order by which PHMSA waives compliance with one or more of the Federal pipeline safety regulations under the standards set forth in 49 U.S.C. 60118(c) and subject to conditions set forth in the order. A special permit is issued to a pipeline operator (or prospective operator) for specified facilities that are or, absent waiver, would be subject to the regulation.
                (b) How do I apply for a special permit? Applications for special permits must be submitted at least 120 days before the requested effective date using any of the following methods:
                (1) Direct fax to PHMSA at: 202-366-4566; or
                (2) Mail, express mail, or overnight courier to the Associate Administrator for Pipeline Safety, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., East Building, Washington, DC 20590.
                (c) What information must be contained in the application? Applications must contain the following information:
                (1) The name, mailing address, and telephone number of the applicant and whether the applicant is an operator;
                (2) A detailed description of the pipeline facilities for which the special permit is sought, including:
                (i) The beginning and ending points of the pipeline mileage to be covered and the Counties and States in which it is located;

                (ii) Whether the pipeline is interstate or intrastate and a general description of the right-of-way including proximity of the affected segments to populated areas and unusually sensitive areas;
                (iii) Relevant pipeline design and construction information including the year of installation, the material, grade, diameter, wall thickness, and coating type; and
                (iv) Relevant operating information including operating pressure, leak history, and most recent testing or assessment results;
                (3) A list of the specific regulation(s) from which the applicant seeks relief;
                (4) An explanation of the unique circumstances that the applicant believes make the applicability of that regulation or standard (or portion thereof) unnecessary or inappropriate for its facility;
                (5) A description of any measures or activities the applicant proposes to undertake as an alternative to compliance with the relevant regulation, including an explanation of how such measures will mitigate any safety or environmental risks;
                (6) A description of any positive or negative impacts on affected stakeholders and a statement indicating how operating the pipeline pursuant to a special permit would be in the public interest;
                (7) A certification that operation of the applicant's pipeline under the requested special permit would not be inconsistent with pipeline safety;
                (8) Any other information PHMSA may need to process the application including environmental analysis where necessary.
                (d) How does PHMSA handle special permit applications?—(1) Public notice. Upon receipt of an application or renewal of a special permit, PHMSA will provide notice to the public of its intent to consider the application and invite comment. In addition, PHMSA may consult with other Federal agencies before granting or denying an application or renewal on matters that PHMSA believes may have significance for proceedings under their areas of responsibility.
                (2) Grants, renewals, and denials. If the Associate Administrator determines that the application complies with the requirements of this section and that the waiver of the relevant regulation or standard is not inconsistent with pipeline safety, the Associate Administrator may grant the application, in whole or in part, for a period of time from the date granted. Conditions may be imposed on the grant if the Associate Administrator concludes they are necessary to assure safety, environmental protection, or are otherwise in the public interest. If the Associate Administrator determines that the application does not comply with the requirements of this section or that a waiver is not justified, the application will be denied. Whenever the Associate Administrator grants or denies an application, notice of the decision will be provided to the applicant. PHMSA will post all special permits on its Web site at http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/.
                
                (e) How does PHMSA handle special permit renewals? (1) The grantee of the special permit must apply for a renewal of the permit 180 days prior to the permit expiration.
                (2) If, at least 180 days before an existing special permit expires the holder files an application for renewal that is complete and conforms to the requirements of this section, the special permit will not expire until final administrative action on the application for renewal has been taken:

                (g) Can a special permit be requested on an emergency basis? Yes. PHMSA may grant an application for an emergency special permit without notice and comment or hearing if the Associate Administrator determines that such action is in the public interest, is not inconsistent with pipeline safety, and is necessary to address an actual or impending emergency involving pipeline transportation. For purposes of this section, an emergency event may be local, regional, or national in scope and includes significant fuel supply disruptions and natural or manmade disasters such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, terrorist acts, biological outbreaks, releases of dangerous radiological, chemical, or biological materials, war-related activities, or other similar events. PHMSA will determine on a case-by-case basis what duration is necessary to address the emergency. However, as required by statute, no emergency special permit may be issued for a period of more than 60 days. Each emergency special permit will automatically expire on the date specified in the permit. Emergency special permits may be renewed upon application to PHMSA only after notice and opportunity for a hearing on the renewal.
                (h) How do I apply for an emergency special permit? Applications for emergency special permits may be submitted to PHMSA using any of the following methods:

                (i) What must be contained in an application for an emergency special permit? In addition to the information required under paragraph (c) of this section, applications for emergency special permits must include:
                (1) An explanation of the actual or impending emergency and how the applicant is affected;
                (2) A citation of the regulations that are implicated and the specific reasons the permit is necessary to address the emergency (e.g., lack of accessibility, damaged equipment, insufficient manpower);
                (3) A statement indicating how operating the pipeline pursuant to an emergency special permit is in the public interest (e.g., continuity of service, service restoration);
                (4) A description of any proposed alternatives to compliance with the regulation (e.g., additional inspections and tests, shortened reassessment intervals); and

                (5) A description of any measures to be taken after the emergency situation or permit expires—whichever comes first—to confirm long-term operational reliability of the pipeline facility.
                
                
                  Note to paragraph (g):
                  If PHMSA determines that handling of the application on an emergency basis is not warranted, PHMSA will notify the applicant and process the application under normal special permit procedures of this section.
                
                
                (j) In what circumstances will PHMSA revoke, suspend, or modify a special permit? (1) PHMSA may revoke, suspend, or modify a special permit on a finding that:
                (i) Intervening changes in Federal law mandate revocation, suspension, or modification of the special permit;
                (ii) Based on a material change in conditions or circumstances, continued adherence to the terms of the special permit would be inconsistent with safety;
                (iii) The application contained inaccurate or incomplete information, and the special permit would not have been granted had the application been accurate and complete;
                (iv) The application contained deliberately inaccurate or incomplete information; or
                (v) The holder has failed to comply with any material term or condition of the special permit.
                (2) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(3) of this section, before a special permit is modified, suspended or revoked, PHMSA will notify the holder in writing of the proposed action and the reasons for it, and provide an opportunity to show cause why the proposed action should not be taken.
                (i) The holder may file a written response that shows cause why the proposed action should not be taken within 30 days of receipt of notice of the proposed action.
                (ii) After considering the holder's written response, or after 30 days have passed without response since receipt of the notice, PHMSA will notify the holder in writing of the final decision with a brief statement of reasons.
                (3) If necessary to avoid a risk of significant harm to persons, property, or the environment, PHMSA may in the notification declare the proposed action immediately effective.
                (4) Unless otherwise specified, the terms and conditions of a corrective action order, compliance order, or other order applicable to a pipeline facility covered by a special permit will take precedence over the terms of the special permit.
                (5) A special permit holder may seek reconsideration of a decision under paragraph (h) of this section as provided in paragraph (i) of this section.
                (k) Can a denial of a request for a special permit or a revocation of an existing special permit be appealed? Reconsideration of the denial of an application for a special permit or a revocation of an existing special permit may be sought by petition to the Associate Administrator. Petitions for reconsideration must be received by PHMSA within 20 calendar days of the notice of the grant or denial and must contain a brief statement of the issue and an explanation of why the petitioner believes that the decision being appealed is not in the public interest. The Associate Administrator may grant or deny, in whole or in part, any petition for reconsideration without further proceedings. The Associate Administrator's decision is the final administrative action.
                
                (l) Are documents related to an application for a special permit available for public inspection? Documents related to an application, including the application itself, are available for public inspection on regulations.gov or the Docket Operations Facility to the extent such documents do not include information exempt from public disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b). Applicants may request confidential treatment under part 7 of this title.
                (m) Am I subject to enforcement action for non-compliance with the terms and conditions of a special permit? Yes. PHMSA inspects for compliance with the terms and conditions of special permits and if a probable violation is identified, PHMSA will initiate one or more of the enforcement actions under subpart B of this part.

              Subpart E—Cost Recovery for Design Reviews
              
                Source:
                Amdt. 190-19, 82 FR 7996, Jan. 23, 2017, unless otherwise noted.
              
              
                § 190.401
                Scope.
                If PHMSA conducts a facility design and/or construction safety review or inspection in connection with a proposal to construct, expand, or operate a gas, hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide pipeline facility, or a liquefied natural gas facility that meets the applicability requirements in § 190.403, PHMSA may require the applicant proposing the project to pay the costs incurred by PHMSA relating to such review, including the cost of design and construction safety reviews or inspections.
              
              
                § 190.403
                Applicability.
                The following paragraph specifies which projects will be subject to the cost recovery requirements of this section.
                (a) This section applies to any project that—
                (1) Has design and construction costs totaling at least $2,500,000,000, as periodically adjusted by PHMSA, to take into account increases in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers published by the Department of Labor, based on—
                (i) The cost estimate provided to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for a gas pipeline facility or an application for authorization for a liquefied natural gas pipeline facility; or

                (ii) A good faith estimate developed by the applicant proposing a hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide pipeline facility and submitted to the Associate Administrator. The good faith estimate for design and construction costs must include all of the applicable cost items contained in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission application referenced in § 190.403(a)(1)(i) for a gas or LNG facility. In addition, an applicant must take into account all survey, design, material, permitting, right-of way acquisition, construction, testing, commissioning, start-up, construction financing, environmental protection, inspection, material transportation, sales tax, project contingency, and all other applicable costs, including all segments, facilities, and multi-year phases of the project;
                (2) Uses new or novel technologies or design, as defined in § 190.3.
                (b) The Associate Administrator may not collect design safety review fees under this section and 49 U.S.C. 60301 for the same design safety review.
                (c) The Associate Administrator, after receipt of the design specifications, construction plans and procedures, and related materials, determines if cost recovery is necessary. The Associate Administrator's determination is based on the amount of PHMSA resources needed to ensure safety and environmental protection.
              
              
                § 190.405
                Notification.
                For any new pipeline facility construction project in which PHMSA will conduct a design review, the applicant proposing the project must notify PHMSA and provide the design specifications, construction plans and procedures, project schedule and related materials at least 120 days prior to the commencement of any of the following activities: Route surveys for construction, material manufacturing, offsite facility fabrications, construction equipment move-in activities, onsite or offsite fabrications, personnel support facility construction, and any offsite or onsite facility construction. To the maximum extent practicable, but not later than 90 days after receiving such design specifications, construction plans and procedures, and related materials, PHMSA will provide written comments, feedback, and guidance on the project.
              
              
                § 190.407
                Master Agreement.
                PHMSA and the applicant will enter into an agreement within 60 days after PHMSA received notification from the applicant provided in § 190.405, outlining PHMSA's recovery of the costs associated with the facility design safety review.
                (a) A Master Agreement, at a minimum, includes:
                (1) Itemized list of direct costs to be recovered by PHMSA;
                (2) Scope of work for conducting the facility design safety review and an estimated total cost;
                (3) Description of the method of periodic billing, payment, and auditing of cost recovery fees;
                (4) Minimum account balance which the applicant must maintain with PHMSA at all times;
                (5) Provisions for reconciling differences between total amount billed and the final cost of the design review, including provisions for returning any excess payments to the applicant at the conclusion of the project;
                (6) A principal point of contact for both PHMSA and the applicant; and
                (7) Provisions for terminating the agreement.
                (8) A project reimbursement cost schedule based upon the project timing and scope.
                (b) [Reserved]
              
              
                § 190.409
                Fee structure.
                The fee charged is based on the direct costs that PHMSA incurs in conducting the facility design safety review (including construction review and inspections), and will be based only on costs necessary for conducting the facility design safety review. “Necessary for” means that but for the facility design safety review, the costs would not have been incurred and that the costs cover only those activities and items without which the facility design safety review cannot be completed.
                (a) Costs qualifying for cost recovery include, but are not limited to—
                (1) Personnel costs based upon total cost to PHMSA;
                (2) Travel, lodging and subsistence;
                (3) Vehicle mileage;

                (4) Other direct services, materials and supplies;
                
                (5) Other direct costs as may be specified in the Master Agreement.
                (b) [Reserved]
              
              
                § 190.411
                Procedures for billing and payment of fee.
                All PHMSA cost calculations for billing purposes are determined from the best available PHMSA records.
                (a) PHMSA bills an applicant for cost recovery fees as specified in the Master Agreement, but the applicant will not be billed more frequently than quarterly.
                (1) PHMSA will itemize cost recovery bills in sufficient detail to allow independent verification of calculations.
                (2) [Reserved]
                (b) PHMSA will monitor the applicant's account balance. Should the account balance fall below the required minimum balance specified in the Master Agreement, PHMSA may request at any time the applicant submit payment within 30 days to maintain the minimum balance.
                (c) PHMSA will provide an updated estimate of costs to the applicant on or near October 1st of each calendar year.
                (d) Payment of cost recovery fees is due within 30 days of issuance of a bill for the fees. If payment is not made within 30 days, PHMSA may charge an annual rate of interest (as set by the Department of Treasury's Statutory Debt Collection Authorities) on any outstanding debt, as specified in the Master Agreement.
                (e) Payment of the cost recovery fee by the applicant does not obligate or prevent PHMSA from taking any particular action during safety inspections on the project.

              (2) In the case of an underground natural gas storage facility, including injection, withdrawal, monitoring, or observation well, general corrosion that has reduced the wall thickness to less than that required for the maximum well operating pressure, and localized corrosion pitting to a degree where leakage might result.
              (3) Unintended movement or abnormal loading by environmental causes, such as an earthquake, landslide, or flood, that impairs the serviceability of a pipeline or the structural integrity or reliability of an underground natural gas storage facility, including injection, withdrawal, monitoring, or observation well for an underground natural gas storage facility, or LNG facility that contains, controls, or processes gas or LNG.
              (4) Any crack or other material defect that impairs the structural integrity or reliability of an underground natural gas storage facility or LNG facility that contains, controls, or processes gas or LNG.
              (5) Any material defect or physical damage that impairs the serviceability of a pipeline that operates at a hoop stress of 20% or more of its specified minimum yield strength or underground natural gas storage facility, including injection, withdrawal, monitoring, or observations well for an underground natural gas storage facility.
              (6) Any malfunction or operating error that causes the pressure of a pipeline or underground natural gas storage facility or LNG facility that contains or processes gas or LNG to rise above its maximum well operating pressure (or working pressure for LNG facilities) plus the margin (build-up) allowed for operation of pressure limiting or control devices.
              (7) A leak in a pipeline or an underground natural gas storage facility, including injection, withdrawal, monitoring, or observation well for an underground natural gas storage facility, or LNG facility that contains or processes gas or LNG that constitutes an emergency.
              (8) Inner tank leakage, ineffective insulation, or frost heave that impairs the structural integrity of an LNG storage tank.
              (9) Any safety-related condition that could lead to an imminent hazard and causes (either directly or indirectly by remedial action of the operator), for purposes other than abandonment, a 20% or more reduction in operating pressure or shutdown of operation of a pipeline or an underground natural gas storage facility, including injection, withdrawal, monitoring, or observation well for an underground natural gas storage facility, or an LNG facility that contains or processes gas or LNG.
              (b) A report is not required for any safety-related condition that—
              (1) Exists on a master meter system or a customer-owned service line;
              (2) Is an incident or results in an incident before the deadline for filing the safety-related condition report;
              (3) Exists on a pipeline (other than an LNG facility or Underground Natural Gas Storage facility) that is more than 220 yards (200 meters) from any building intended for human occupancy or outdoor place of assembly, except that reports are required for conditions within the right-of-way of an active railroad, paved road, street, or highway; or
              (4) Is corrected by repair or replacement in accordance with applicable safety standards before the deadline for filing the safety-related condition report, except that reports are required for conditions under paragraph (a)(1) of this section other than localized corrosion pitting on an effectively coated and cathodically protected pipeline.

                Class locations.
                (a) This section classifies pipeline locations for purposes of this part. The following criteria apply to classifications under this section.
                (1) A “class location unit” is an onshore area that extends 220 yards (200 meters) on either side of the centerline of any continuous 1- mile (1.6 kilometers) length of pipeline.
                (2) Each separate dwelling unit in a multiple dwelling unit building is counted as a separate building intended for human occupancy.
                (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, pipeline locations are classified as follows:
                (1) A Class 1 location is:
                (i) An offshore area; or
                
                (ii) Any class location unit that has 10 or fewer buildings intended for human occupancy.
                (2) A Class 2 location is any class location unit that has more than 10 but fewer than 46 buildings intended for human occupancy.
                (3) A Class 3 location is:
                (i) Any class location unit that has 46 or more buildings intended for human occupancy; or
                (ii) An area where the pipeline lies within 100 yards (91 meters) of either a building or a small, well-defined outside area (such as a playground, recreation area, outdoor theater, or other place of public assembly) that is occupied by 20 or more persons on at least 5 days a week for 10 weeks in any 12-month period. (The days and weeks need not be consecutive.)
                (4) A Class 4 location is any class location unit where buildings with four or more stories above ground are prevalent.
                (c) The length of Class locations 2, 3, and 4 may be adjusted as follows:
                (1) A Class 4 location ends 220 yards (200 meters) from the nearest building with four or more stories above ground.
                (2) When a cluster of buildings intended for human occupancy requires a Class 2 or 3 location, the class location ends 220 yards (200 meters) from the nearest building in the cluster.

                § 192.8
                How are onshore gathering lines and regulated onshore gathering lines determined?
                (a) An operator must use API RP 80 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), to determine if an onshore pipeline (or part of a connected series of pipelines) is an onshore gathering line. The determination is subject to the limitations listed below. After making this determination, an operator must determine if the onshore gathering line is a regulated onshore gathering line under paragraph (b) of this section.

                (1) The beginning of gathering, under section 2.2(a)(1) of API RP 80, may not extend beyond the furthermost downstream point in a production operation as defined in section 2.3 of API RP 80. This furthermost downstream point does not include equipment that can be used in either production or transportation, such as separators or dehydrators, unless that equipment is involved in the processes of “production and preparation for transportation or delivery of hydrocarbon gas” within the meaning of “production operation.”
                (2) The endpoint of gathering, under section 2.2(a)(1)(A) of API RP 80, may not extend beyond the first downstream natural gas processing plant, unless the operator can demonstrate, using sound engineering principles, that gathering extends to a further downstream plant.
                (3) If the endpoint of gathering, under section 2.2(a)(1)(C) of API RP 80, is determined by the commingling of gas from separate production fields, the fields may not be more than 50 miles from each other, unless the Administrator finds a longer separation distance is justified in a particular case (see 49 CFR § 190.9).
                (4) The endpoint of gathering, under section 2.2(a)(1)(D) of API RP 80, may not extend beyond the furthermost downstream compressor used to increase gathering line pressure for delivery to another pipeline.
                (b) For purposes of § 192.9, “regulated onshore gathering line” means:
                (1) Each onshore gathering line (or segment of onshore gathering line) with a feature described in the second column that lies in an area described in the third column; and
                (2) As applicable, additional lengths of line described in the fourth column to provide a safety buffer:
                
                  
                    Type

                    B
                    —Metallic and the MAOP produces a hoop stress of less than 20 percent of SMYS. If the stress level is unknown, an operator must determine the stress level according to the applicable provisions in subpart C of this part—Non-metallic and the MAOP is 125 psig (862 kPa) or less
                    
                    
                      Area 1. Class 3 or 4 location
                        Area 2. An area within a Class 2 location the operator determines by using any of the following three methods:
                      (a) A Class 2 location.
                      (b) An area extending 150 feet (45.7 m) on each side of the centerline of any continuous 1 mile (1.6 km) of pipeline and including more than 10 but fewer than 46 dwellings
                      (c) An area extending 150 feet (45.7 m) on each side of the centerline of any continous 1000 feet (305 m) of pipeline and including 5 or more dwellings
                    
                    If the gathering line is in Area 2(b) or 2(c), the additional lengths of line extend upstream and downstream from the area to a point where the line is at least 150 feet (45.7 m) from the nearest dwelling in the area. However, if a cluster of dwellings in Area 2 (b) or 2(c) qualifies a line as Type B, the Type B classification ends 150 feet (45.7 m) from the nearest dwelling in the cluster.

                Customer notification.
                (a) This section applies to each operator of a service line who does not maintain the customer's buried piping up to entry of the first building downstream, or, if the customer's buried piping does not enter a building, up to the principal gas utilization equipment or the first fence (or wall) that surrounds that equipment. For the purpose of this section, “customer's buried piping” does not include branch lines that serve yard lanterns, pool heaters, or other types of secondary equipment. Also, “maintain” means monitor for corrosion according to § 192.465 if the customer's buried piping is metallic, survey for leaks according to § 192.723, and if an unsafe condition is found, shut off the flow of gas, advise the customer of the need to repair the unsafe condition, or repair the unsafe condition.
                (b) Each operator shall notify each customer once in writing of the following information:
                (1) The operator does not maintain the customer's buried piping.
                (2) If the customer's buried piping is not maintained, it may be subject to the potential hazards of corrosion and leakage.
                (3) Buried gas piping should be—
                (i) Periodically inspected for leaks;
                (ii) Periodically inspected for corrosion if the piping is metallic; and
                (iii) Repaired if any unsafe condition is discovered.
                (4) When excavating near buried gas piping, the piping should be located in advance, and the excavation done by hand.
                (5) The operator (if applicable), plumbing contractors, and heating contractors can assist in locating, inspecting, and repairing the customer's buried piping.
                (c) Each operator shall notify each customer not later than August 14, 1996, or 90 days after the customer first receives gas at a particular location, whichever is later. However, operators of master meter systems may continuously post a general notice in a prominent location frequented by customers.
                (d) Each operator must make the following records available for inspection by the Administrator or a State agency participating under 49 U.S.C. 60105 or 60106:
                (1) A copy of the notice currently in use; and

                § 192.109
                Nominal wall thickness (t) for steel pipe.
                (a) If the nominal wall thickness for steel pipe is not known, it is determined by measuring the thickness of each piece of pipe at quarter points on one end.
                (b) However, if the pipe is of uniform grade, size, and thickness and there are more than 10 lengths, only 10 percent of the individual lengths, but not less than 10 lengths, need be measured. The thickness of the lengths that are not measured must be verified by applying a gauge set to the minimum thickness found by the measurement. The nominal wall thickness to be used in the design formula in § 192.105 is the next wall thickness found in commercial specifications that is below the average of all the measurements taken. However, the nominal wall thickness used may not be more than 1.14 times the smallest measurement taken on pipe less than 20 inches (508 millimeters) in outside diameter, nor more than 1.11 times the smallest measurement taken on pipe 20 inches (508 millimeters) or more in outside diameter.

                (5) A regulator that, under normal operating conditions, is able to regulate the downstream pressure within the necessary limits of accuracy and to limit the build-up of pressure under no-flow conditions to prevent a pressure that would cause the unsafe operation of any connected and properly adjusted gas utilization equipment.
                (6) A self-contained service regulator with no external static or control lines.
                (b) If the maximum actual operating pressure of the distribution system is 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage, or less, and a service regulator that does not have all of the characteristics listed in paragraph (a) of this section is used, or if the gas contains materials that seriously interfere with the operation of service regulators, there must be suitable protective devices to prevent unsafe overpressuring of the customer's appliances if the service regulator fails.
                (c) If the maximum actual operating pressure of the distribution system exceeds 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage, one of the following methods must be used to regulate and limit, to the maximum safe value, the pressure of gas delivered to the customer:
                (1) A service regulator having the characteristics listed in paragraph (a) of this section, and another regulator located upstream from the service regulator. The upstream regulator may not be set to maintain a pressure higher than 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage. A device must be installed between the upstream regulator and the service regulator to limit the pressure on the inlet of the service regulator to 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage or less in case the upstream regulator fails to function properly. This device may be either a relief valve or an automatic shutoff that shuts, if the pressure on the inlet of the service regulator exceeds the set pressure (60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage or less), and remains closed until manually reset.
                (2) A service regulator and a monitoring regulator set to limit, to a maximum safe value, the pressure of the gas delivered to the customer.

                (3) A service regulator with a relief valve vented to the outside atmosphere, with the relief valve set to open so that the pressure of gas going to the customer does not exceed a maximum safe value. The relief valve may either be built into the service regulator or it may be a separate unit installed downstream from the service regulator. This combination may be used alone only in those cases where the inlet pressure on the service regulator does not exceed the manufacturer's safe working pressure rating of the service regulator, and may not be used where the inlet pressure on the service regulator exceeds 125 p.s.i. (862 kPa) gage. For higher inlet pressures, the methods in paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section must be used.
                (4) A service regulator and an automatic shutoff device that closes upon a rise in pressure downstream from the regulator and remains closed until manually reset.

                (c) Be designed and installed so that it can be readily operated to determine if the valve is free, can be tested to determine the pressure at which it will operate, and can be tested for leakage when in the closed position;
                (d) Have support made of noncombustible material;
                (e) Have discharge stacks, vents, or outlet ports designed to prevent accumulation of water, ice, or snow, located where gas can be discharged into the atmosphere without undue hazard;
                (f) Be designed and installed so that the size of the openings, pipe, and fittings located between the system to be protected and the pressure relieving device, and the size of the vent line, are adequate to prevent hammering of the valve and to prevent impairment of relief capacity;
                (g) Where installed at a district regulator station to protect a pipeline system from overpressuring, be designed and installed to prevent any single incident such as an explosion in a vault or damage by a vehicle from affecting the operation of both the overpressure protective device and the district regulator; and
                (h) Except for a valve that will isolate the system under protection from its source of pressure, be designed to prevent unauthorized operation of any stop valve that will make the pressure relief valve or pressure limiting device inoperative.

                Required capacity of pressure relieving and limiting stations.
                (a) Each pressure relief station or pressure limiting station or group of those stations installed to protect a pipeline must have enough capacity, and must be set to operate, to insure the following:
                (1) In a low pressure distribution system, the pressure may not cause the unsafe operation of any connected and properly adjusted gas utilization equipment.
                (2) In pipelines other than a low pressure distribution system:
                (i) If the maximum allowable operating pressure is 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage or more, the pressure may not exceed the maximum allowable operating pressure plus 10 percent, or the pressure that produces a hoop stress of 75 percent of SMYS, whichever is lower;
                (ii) If the maximum allowable operating pressure is 12 p.s.i. (83 kPa) gage or more, but less than 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage, the pressure may not exceed the maximum allowable operating pressure plus 6 p.s.i. (41 kPa) gage; or
                (iii) If the maximum allowable operating pressure is less than 12 p.s.i. (83 kPa) gage, the pressure may not exceed the maximum allowable operating pressure plus 50 percent.
                (b) When more than one pressure regulating or compressor station feeds into a pipeline, relief valves or other protective devices must be installed at each station to ensure that the complete failure of the largest capacity regulator or compressor, or any single run of lesser capacity regulators or compressors in that station, will not impose pressures on any part of the pipeline or distribution system in excess of those for which it was designed, or against which it was protected, whichever is lower.

                (c) Relief valves or other pressure limiting devices must be installed at or near each regulator station in a low-pressure distribution system, with a capacity to limit the maximum pressure in the main to a pressure that will not exceed the safe operating pressure for any connected and properly adjusted gas utilization equipment.

                Plastic pipe: Qualifying joining procedures.
                (a) Heat fusion, solvent cement, and adhesive joints. Before any written procedure established under § 192.273(b) is used for making plastic pipe joints by a heat fusion, solvent cement, or adhesive method, the procedure must be qualified by subjecting specimen joints that are made according to the procedure to the following tests, as applicable:
                (1) The test requirements of—
                (i) In the case of thermoplastic pipe, based on the pipe material, the Sustained Pressure Test or the Minimum Hydrostatic Burst Test per the listed specification requirements. Additionally, for electrofusion joints, based on the pipe material, the Tensile Strength Test or the Joint Integrity Test per the listed specification.

                (ii) In the case of thermosetting plastic pipe, paragraph 8.5 (Minimum Hydrostatic Burst Pressure) or paragraph 8.9 (Sustained Static Pressure Test) of ASTM D2517- 00 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7).

                (iii) In the case of electrofusion fittings for polyethylene (PE) pipe and tubing, paragraph 9.1 (Minimum Hydraulic Burst Pressure Test), paragraph 9.2 (Sustained Pressure Test), paragraph 9.3 (Tensile Strength Test), or paragraph 9.4 (Joint Integrity Tests) of ASTM F1055-98(2006) (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7).
                (2) For procedures intended for lateral pipe connections, subject a specimen joint made from pipe sections joined at right angles according to the procedure to a force on the lateral pipe until failure occurs in the specimen. If failure initiates outside the joint area, the procedure qualifies for use.
                (3) For procedures intended for non-lateral pipe connections, perform testing in accordance with a listed specification. If the test specimen elongates no more than 25% or failure initiates outside the joint area, the procedure qualifies for use.
                (b) Mechanical joints. Before any written procedure established under § 192.273(b) is used for making mechanical plastic pipe joints, the procedure must be qualified in accordance with a listed specification based upon the pipe material.
                (c) A copy of each written procedure being used for joining plastic pipe must be available to the persons making and inspecting joints.

                Repair of steel pipe.
                (a) Each imperfection or damage that impairs the serviceability of a length of steel pipe must be repaired or removed. If a repair is made by grinding, the remaining wall thickness must at least be equal to either:
                (1) The minimum thickness required by the tolerances in the specification to which the pipe was manufactured; or
                (2) The nominal wall thickness required for the design pressure of the pipeline.
                (b) Each of the following dents must be removed from steel pipe to be operated at a pressure that produces a hoop stress of 20 percent, or more, of SMYS, unless the dent is repaired by a method that reliable engineering tests and analyses show can permanently restore the serviceability of the pipe:
                (1) A dent that contains a stress concentrator such as a scratch, gouge, groove, or arc burn.
                (2) A dent that affects the longitudinal weld or a circumferential weld.
                (3) In pipe to be operated at a pressure that produces a hoop stress of 40 percent or more of SMYS, a dent that has a depth of:
                (i) More than 1/4 inch (6.4 millimeters) in pipe 123/4 inches (324 millimeters) or less in outer diameter; or
                (ii) More than 2 percent of the nominal pipe diameter in pipe over 123/4 inches (324 millimeters) in outer diameter.
                For the purpose of this section a “dent” is a depression that produces a gross disturbance in the curvature of the pipe wall without reducing the pipe-wall thickness. The depth of a dent is measured as the gap between the lowest point of the dent and a prolongation of the original contour of the pipe.
                (c) Each arc burn on steel pipe to be operated at a pressure that produces a hoop stress of 40 percent, or more, of SMYS must be repaired or removed. If a repair is made by grinding, the arc burn must be completely removed and the remaining wall thickness must be at least equal to either:
                (1) The minimum wall thickness required by the tolerances in the specification to which the pipe was manufactured; or
                (2) The nominal wall thickness required for the design pressure of the pipeline.
                (d) A gouge, groove, arc burn, or dent may not be repaired by insert patching or by pounding out.
                (e) Each gouge, groove, arc burn, or dent that is removed from a length of pipe must be removed by cutting out the damaged portion as a cylinder.

                Service lines: Installation.
                (a) Depth. Each buried service line must be installed with at least 12 inches (305 millimeters) of cover in private property and at least 18 inches (457 millimeters) of cover in streets and roads. However, where an underground structure prevents installation at those depths, the service line must be able to withstand any anticipated external load.
                (b) Support and backfill. Each service line must be properly supported on undisturbed or well-compacted soil, and material used for backfill must be free of materials that could damage the pipe or its coating.
                (c) Grading for drainage. Where condensate in the gas might cause interruption in the gas supply to the customer, the service line must be graded so as to drain into the main or into drips at the low points in the service line.
                (d) Protection against piping strain and external loading. Each service line must be installed so as to minimize anticipated piping strain and external loading.
                (e) Installation of service lines into buildings. Each underground service line installed below grade through the outer foundation wall of a building must:
                (1) In the case of a metal service line, be protected against corrosion;
                (2) In the case of a plastic service line, be protected from shearing action and backfill settlement; and
                (3) Be sealed at the foundation wall to prevent leakage into the building.
                (f) Installation of service lines under buildings. Where an underground service line is installed under a building:
                (1) It must be encased in a gas tight conduit;
                (2) The conduit and the service line must, if the service line supplies the building it underlies, extend into a normally usable and accessible part of the building; and

                (3) The space between the conduit and the service line must be sealed to prevent gas leakage into the building and, if the conduit is sealed at both ends, a vent line from the annular space must extend to a point where gas would not be a hazard, and extend above grade, terminating in a rain and insect resistant fitting.
                (g) Locating underground service lines. Each underground nonmetallic service line that is not encased must have a means of locating the pipe that complies with § 192.321(e).

                Service lines: Valve requirements.
                (a) Each service line must have a service-line valve that meets the applicable requirements of subparts B and D of this part. A valve incorporated in a meter bar, that allows the meter to be bypassed, may not be used as a service-line valve.
                (b) A soft seat service line valve may not be used if its ability to control the flow of gas could be adversely affected by exposure to anticipated heat.
                (c) Each service-line valve on a high-pressure service line, installed above ground or in an area where the blowing of gas would be hazardous, must be designed and constructed to minimize the possibility of the removal of the core of the valve with other than specialized tools.
              
              
                § 192.365
                Service lines: Location of valves.
                (a) Relation to regulator or meter. Each service-line valve must be installed upstream of the regulator or, if there is no regulator, upstream of the meter.
                (b) Outside valves. Each service line must have a shut-off valve in a readily accessible location that, if feasible, is outside of the building.
                (c) Underground valves. Each underground service-line valve must be located in a covered durable curb box or standpipe that allows ready operation of the valve and is supported independently of the service lines.
              
              
                § 192.367
                Service lines: General requirements for connections to main piping.
                (a) Location. Each service line connection to a main must be located at the top of the main or, if that is not practical, at the side of the main, unless a suitable protective device is installed to minimize the possibility of dust and moisture being carried from the main into the service line.
                (b) Compression-type connection to main. Each compression-type service line to main connection must:
                (1) Be designed and installed to effectively sustain the longitudinal pull-out or thrust forces caused by contraction or expansion of the piping, or by anticipated external or internal loading;
                (2) If gaskets are used in connecting the service line to the main connection fitting, have gaskets that are compatible with the kind of gas in the system; and
                (3) If used on pipelines comprised of plastic, be a Category 1 connection as defined by a listed specification for the applicable material, providing a seal plus resistance to a force on the pipe joint equal to or greater than that which will cause no less than 25% elongation of pipe, or the pipe fails outside the joint area if tested in accordance with the applicable standard.

                (a) Definitions. As used in this section:
                
                  Branched service line means a gas service line that begins at the existing service line or is installed concurrently with the primary service line but serves a separate residence.
                
                  Replaced service line means a gas service line where the fitting that connects the service line to the main is replaced or the piping connected to this fitting is replaced.
                
                  Service line serving single-family residence means a gas service line that begins at the fitting that connects the service line to the main and serves only one single-family residence (SFR).
                (b) Installation required. An EFV installation must comply with the performance standards in § 192.381. After April 14, 2017, each operator must install an EFV on any new or replaced service line serving the following types of services before the line is activated:
                (1) A single service line to one SFR;

                (2) A branched service line to a SFR installed concurrently with the primary SFR service line (i.e., a single EFV may be installed to protect both service lines);
                (3) A branched service line to a SFR installed off a previously installed SFR service line that does not contain an EFV;
                (4) Multifamily residences with known customer loads not exceeding 1,000 SCFH per service, at time of service installation based on installed meter capacity, and
                (5) A single, small commercial customer served by a single service line with a known customer load not exceeding 1,000 SCFH, at the time of meter installation, based on installed meter capacity.
                (c) Exceptions to excess flow valve installation requirement. An operator need not install an excess flow valve if one or more of the following conditions are present:
                (1) The service line does not operate at a pressure of 10 psig or greater throughout the year;
                (2) The operator has prior experience with contaminants in the gas stream that could interfere with the EFV's operation or cause loss of service to a customer;
                (3) An EFV could interfere with necessary operation or maintenance activities, such as blowing liquids from the line; or
                (4) An EFV meeting the performance standards in § 192.381 is not commercially available to the operator.
                (d) Customer's right to request an EFV. Existing service line customers who desire an EFV on service lines not exceeding 1,000 SCFH and who do not qualify for one of the exceptions in paragraph (c) of this section may request an EFV to be installed on their service lines. If an eligible service line customer requests an EFV installation, an operator must install the EFV at a mutually agreeable date. The operator's rate-setter determines how and to whom the costs of the requested EFVs are distributed.
                (e) Operator notification of customers concerning EFV installation. Operators must notify customers of their right to request an EFV in the following manner:
                (1) Except as specified in paragraphs (c) and (e)(5) of this section, each operator must provide written or electronic notification to customers of their right to request the installation of an EFV. Electronic notification can include emails, Web site postings, and e-billing notices.
                (2) The notification must include an explanation for the service line customer of the potential safety benefits that may be derived from installing an EFV. The explanation must include information that an EFV is designed to shut off the flow of natural gas automatically if the service line breaks.
                (3) The notification must include a description of EFV installation and replacement costs. The notice must alert the customer that the costs for maintaining and replacing an EFV may later be incurred, and what those costs will be to the extent known.
                (4) The notification must indicate that if a service line customer requests installation of an EFV and the load does not exceed 1,000 SCFH and the conditions of paragraph (c) are not present, the operator must install an EFV at a mutually agreeable date.
                (5) Operators of master-meter systems and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) operators with fewer than 100 customers may continuously post a general notification in a prominent location frequented by customers.
                (f) Operator evidence of customer notification. An operator must make a copy of the notice or notices currently in use available during PHMSA inspections or State inspections conducted under a pipeline safety program certified or approved by PHMSA under 49 U.S.C. 60105 or 60106.
                (g) Reporting. Except for operators of master-meter systems and LPG operators with fewer than 100 customers, each operator must report the EFV measures detailed in the annual report required by § 191.11.

                (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), (f), and (g) of this section, each buried or submerged pipeline installed after July 31, 1971, must be protected against external corrosion, including the following:
                (1) It must have an external protective coating meeting the requirements of § 192.461.
                (2) It must have a cathodic protection system designed to protect the pipeline in accordance with this subpart, installed and placed in operation within 1 year after completion of construction.
                (b) An operator need not comply with paragraph (a) of this section, if the operator can demonstrate by tests, investigation, or experience in the area of application, including, as a minimum, soil resistivity measurements and tests for corrosion accelerating bacteria, that a corrosive environment does not exist. However, within 6 months after an installation made pursuant to the preceding sentence, the operator shall conduct tests, including pipe-to-soil potential measurements with respect to either a continuous reference electrode or an electrode using close spacing, not to exceed 20 feet (6 meters), and soil resistivity measurements at potential profile peak locations, to adequately evaluate the potential profile along the entire pipeline. If the tests made indicate that a corrosive condition exists, the pipeline must be cathodically protected in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
                (c) An operator need not comply with paragraph (a) of this section, if the operator can demonstrate by tests, investigation, or experience that—
                (1) For a copper pipeline, a corrosive environment does not exist; or
                (2) For a temporary pipeline with an operating period of service not to exceed 5 years beyond installation, corrosion during the 5-year period of service of the pipeline will not be detrimental to public safety.

                (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, if a pipeline is externally coated, it must be cathodically protected in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
                (e) Aluminum may not be installed in a buried or submerged pipeline if that aluminum is exposed to an environment with a natural pH in excess of 8, unless tests or experience indicate its suitability in the particular environment involved.
                (f) This section does not apply to electrically isolated, metal alloy fittings in plastic pipelines, if:
                (1) For the size fitting to be used, an operator can show by test, investigation, or experience in the area of application that adequate corrosion control is provided by the alloy composition; and
                (2) The fitting is designed to prevent leakage caused by localized corrosion pitting.
                (g) Electrically isolated metal alloy fittings installed after January 22, 2019, that do not meet the requirements of paragraph (f) must be cathodically protected, and must be maintained in accordance with the operator's integrity management plan.

                (a) Each external protective coating, whether conductive or insulating, applied for the purpose of external corrosion control must—
                (1) Be applied on a properly prepared surface;
                (2) Have sufficient adhesion to the metal surface to effectively resist underfilm migration of moisture;

                (4) Have sufficient strength to resist damage due to handling and soil stress; and
                (5) Have properties compatible with any supplemental cathodic protection.

                (b) Each external protective coating which is an electrically insulating type must also have low moisture absorption and high electrical resistance.
                
                (c) Each external protective coating must be inspected just prior to lowering the pipe into the ditch and backfilling, and any damage detrimental to effective corrosion control must be repaired.
                (d) Each external protective coating must be protected from damage resulting from adverse ditch conditions or damage from supporting blocks.
                (e) If coated pipe is installed by boring, driving, or other similar method, precautions must be taken to minimize damage to the coating during installation.

                (1) The amphoteric metals must be electrically isolated from the remainder of the pipeline and cathodically protected; or
                (2) The entire buried or submerged pipeline must be cathodically protected at a cathodic potential that meets the requirements of appendix D of this part for amphoteric metals.
                (c) The amount of cathodic protection must be controlled so as not to damage the protective coating or the pipe.

                External corrosion control: Monitoring.
                (a) Each pipeline that is under cathodic protection must be tested at least once each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 15 months, to determine whether the cathodic protection meets the requirements of § 192.463. However, if tests at those intervals are impractical for separately protected short sections of mains or transmission lines, not in excess of 100 feet (30 meters), or separately protected service lines, these pipelines may be surveyed on a sampling basis. At least 10 percent of these protected structures, distributed over the entire system must be surveyed each calendar year, with a different 10 percent checked each subsequent year, so that the entire system is tested in each 10-year period.
                (b) Each cathodic protection rectifier or other impressed current power source must be inspected six times each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 21/2 months, to insure that it is operating.
                (c) Each reverse current switch, each diode, and each interference bond whose failure would jeopardize structure protection must be electrically checked for proper performance six times each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 21/2 months. Each other interference bond must be checked at least once each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 15 months.
                (d) Each operator shall take prompt remedial action to correct any deficiencies indicated by the monitoring.
                (e) After the initial evaluation required by §§ 192.455(b) and (c) and 192.457(b), each operator must, not less than every 3 years at intervals not exceeding 39 months, reevaluate its unprotected pipelines and cathodically protect them in accordance with this subpart in areas in which active corrosion is found. The operator must determine the areas of active corrosion by electrical survey. However, on distribution lines and where an electrical survey is impractical on transmission lines, areas of active corrosion may be determined by other means that include review and analysis of leak repair and inspection records, corrosion monitoring records, exposed pipe inspection records, and the pipeline environment.

However, if isolation is not achieved because it is impractical, other measures must be taken to minimize corrosion of the pipeline inside the casing.
                (d) Inspection and electrical tests must be made to assure that electrical isolation is adequate.
                (e) An insulating device may not be installed in an area where a combustible atmosphere is anticipated unless precautions are taken to prevent arcing.

                (a) Design and construction. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each new transmission line and each replacement of line pipe, valve, fitting, or other line component in a transmission line must have features incorporated into its design and construction to reduce the risk of internal corrosion. At a minimum, unless it is impracticable or unnecessary to do so, each new transmission line or replacement of line pipe, valve, fitting, or other line component in a transmission line must:
                (1) Be configured to reduce the risk that liquids will collect in the line;
                (2) Have effective liquid removal features whenever the configuration would allow liquids to collect; and
                (3) Allow use of devices for monitoring internal corrosion at locations with significant potential for internal corrosion.
                (b) Exceptions to applicability. The design and construction requirements of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to the following:
                (1) Offshore pipeline; and

                (c) Change to existing transmission line. When an operator changes the configuration of a transmission line, the operator must evaluate the impact of the change on internal corrosion risk to the downstream portion of an existing onshore transmission line and provide for removal of liquids and monitoring of internal corrosion as appropriate.
                (d) Records. An operator must maintain records demonstrating compliance with this section. Provided the records show why incorporating design features addressing paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section is impracticable or unnecessary, an operator may fulfill this requirement through written procedures supported by as-built drawings or other construction records.

                (a) General corrosion. Each segment of transmission line with general corrosion and with a remaining wall thickness less than that required for the MAOP of the pipeline must be replaced or the operating pressure reduced commensurate with the strength of the pipe based on actual remaining wall thickness. However, corroded pipe may be repaired by a method that reliable engineering tests and analyses show can permanently restore the serviceability of the pipe. Corrosion pitting so closely grouped as to affect the overall strength of the pipe is considered general corrosion for the purpose of this paragraph.
                (b) Localized corrosion pitting. Each segment of transmission line pipe with localized corrosion pitting to a degree where leakage might result must be replaced or repaired, or the operating pressure must be reduced commensurate with the strength of the pipe, based on the actual remaining wall thickness in the pits.

                (c) Under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the strength of pipe based on actual remaining wall thickness may be determined by the procedure in ASME/ANSI B31G (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) or the procedure in PRCI PR 3-805 (R-STRENG) (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7). Both procedures apply to corroded regions that do not penetrate the pipe wall, subject to the limitations prescribed in the procedures.

Except for cast iron or ductile iron pipe, each segment of generally corroded distribution line pipe with a remaining wall thickness less than that required for the MAOP of the pipeline, or a remaining wall thickness less than 30 percent of the nominal wall thickness, must be replaced. However, corroded pipe may be repaired by a method that reliable engineering tests and analyses show can permanently restore the serviceability of the pipe. Corrosion pitting so closely grouped as to affect the overall strength of the pipe is considered general corrosion for the purpose of this paragraph.

              Subpart K—Uprating
              
                § 192.551
                Scope.
                This subpart prescribes minimum requirements for increasing maximum allowable operating pressures (uprating) for pipelines.
              
              
                § 192.553
                General requirements.
                (a) Pressure increases. Whenever the requirements of this subpart require that an increase in operating pressure be made in increments, the pressure must be increased gradually, at a rate that can be controlled, and in accordance with the following:
                (1) At the end of each incremental increase, the pressure must be held constant while the entire segment of pipeline that is affected is checked for leaks.
                (2) Each leak detected must be repaired before a further pressure increase is made, except that a leak determined not to be potentially hazardous need not be repaired, if it is monitored during the pressure increase and it does not become potentially hazardous.
                (b) Records. Each operator who uprates a segment of pipeline shall retain for the life of the segment a record of each investigation required by this subpart, of all work performed, and of each pressure test conducted, in connection with the uprating.
                (c) Written plan. Each operator who uprates a segment of pipeline shall establish a written procedure that will ensure that each applicable requirement of this subpart is complied with.
                (d) Limitation on increase in maximum allowable operating pressure. Except as provided in § 192.555(c), a new maximum allowable operating pressure established under this subpart may not exceed the maximum that would be allowed under §§ 192.619 and 192.621 for a new segment of pipeline constructed of the same materials in the same location. However, when uprating a steel pipeline, if any variable necessary to determine the design pressure under the design formula (§ 192.105) is unknown, the MAOP may be increased as provided in § 192.619(a)(1).
                [35 FR 13257, Aug. 10, 1970, as amended by Amdt. 192-78, 61 FR 28785, June 6, 1996; Amdt. 192-93, 68 FR 53901, Sept. 15, 2003]
              
              
                § 192.555
                Uprating to a pressure that will produce a hoop stress of 30 percent or more of SMYS in steel pipelines.
                (a) Unless the requirements of this section have been met, no person may subject any segment of a steel pipeline to an operating pressure that will produce a hoop stress of 30 percent or more of SMYS and that is above the established maximum allowable operating pressure.
                (b) Before increasing operating pressure above the previously established maximum allowable operating pressure the operator shall:
                (1) Review the design, operating, and maintenance history and previous testing of the segment of pipeline and determine whether the proposed increase is safe and consistent with the requirements of this part; and
                (2) Make any repairs, replacements, or alterations in the segment of pipeline that are necessary for safe operation at the increased pressure.
                (c) After complying with paragraph (b) of this section, an operator may increase the maximum allowable operating pressure of a segment of pipeline constructed before September 12, 1970, to the highest pressure that is permitted under § 192.619, using as test pressure the highest pressure to which the segment of pipeline was previously subjected (either in a strength test or in actual operation).
                (d) After complying with paragraph (b) of this section, an operator that does not qualify under paragraph (c) of this section may increase the previously established maximum allowable operating pressure if at least one of the following requirements is met:
                (1) The segment of pipeline is successfully tested in accordance with the requirements of this part for a new line of the same material in the same location.
                (2) An increased maximum allowable operating pressure may be established for a segment of pipeline in a Class 1 location if the line has not previously been tested, and if:
                (i) It is impractical to test it in accordance with the requirements of this part;
                (ii) The new maximum operating pressure does not exceed 80 percent of that allowed for a new line of the same design in the same location; and
                (iii) The operator determines that the new maximum allowable operating pressure is consistent with the condition of the segment of pipeline and the design requirements of this part.

                (e) Where a segment of pipeline is uprated in accordance with paragraph (c) or (d)(2) of this section, the increase in pressure must be made in increments that are equal to:
                (1) 10 percent of the pressure before the uprating; or
                (2) 25 percent of the total pressure increase,
                whichever produces the fewer number of increments.
              
              
                § 192.557
                Uprating: Steel pipelines to a pressure that will produce a hoop stress less than 30 percent of SMYS: plastic, cast iron, and ductile iron pipelines.
                (a) Unless the requirements of this section have been met, no person may subject:
                (1) A segment of steel pipeline to an operating pressure that will produce a hoop stress less than 30 percent of SMYS and that is above the previously established maximum allowable operating pressure; or
                (2) A plastic, cast iron, or ductile iron pipeline segment to an operating pressure that is above the previously established maximum allowable operating pressure.
                (b) Before increasing operating pressure above the previously established maximum allowable operating pressure, the operator shall:
                (1) Review the design, operating, and maintenance history of the segment of pipeline;
                (2) Make a leakage survey (if it has been more than 1 year since the last survey) and repair any leaks that are found, except that a leak determined not to be potentially hazardous need not be repaired, if it is monitored during the pressure increase and it does not become potentially hazardous;
                (3) Make any repairs, replacements, or alterations in the segment of pipeline that are necessary for safe operation at the increased pressure;
                (4) Reinforce or anchor offsets, bends and dead ends in pipe joined by compression couplings or bell and spigot joints to prevent failure of the pipe joint, if the offset, bend, or dead end is exposed in an excavation;
                (5) Isolate the segment of pipeline in which the pressure is to be increased from any adjacent segment that will continue to be operated at a lower pressure; and
                (6) If the pressure in mains or service lines, or both, is to be higher than the pressure delivered to the customer, install a service regulator on each service line and test each regulator to determine that it is functioning. Pressure may be increased as necessary to test each regulator, after a regulator has been installed on each pipeline subject to the increased pressure.
                (c) After complying with paragraph (b) of this section, the increase in maximum allowable operating pressure must be made in increments that are equal to 10 p.s.i. (69 kPa) gage or 25 percent of the total pressure increase, whichever produces the fewer number of increments. Whenever the requirements of paragraph (b)(6) of this section apply, there must be at least two approximately equal incremental increases.
                (d) If records for cast iron or ductile iron pipeline facilities are not complete enough to determine stresses produced by internal pressure, trench loading, rolling loads, beam stresses, and other bending loads, in evaluating the level of safety of the pipeline when operating at the proposed increased pressure, the following procedures must be followed:
                (1) In estimating the stresses, if the original laying conditions cannot be ascertained, the operator shall assume that cast iron pipe was supported on blocks with tamped backfill and that ductile iron pipe was laid without blocks with tamped backfill.
                (2) Unless the actual maximum cover depth is known, the operator shall measure the actual cover in at least three places where the cover is most likely to be greatest and shall use the greatest cover measured.

                (3) Unless the actual nominal wall thickness is known, the operator shall determine the wall thickness by cutting and measuring coupons from at least three separate pipe lengths. The coupons must be cut from pipe lengths in areas where the cover depth is most likely to be the greatest. The average of all measurements taken must be increased by the allowance indicated in the following table:

                § 192.607
                Verification of Pipeline Material Properties and Attributes: Onshore steel transmission pipelines.
                (a) Applicability. Wherever required by this part, operators of onshore steel transmission pipelines must document and verify material properties and attributes in accordance with this section.
                (b) Documentation of material properties and attributes. Records established under this section documenting physical pipeline characteristics and attributes, including diameter, wall thickness, seam type, and grade (e.g., yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, or pressure rating for valves and flanges, etc.), must be maintained for the life of the pipeline and be traceable, verifiable, and complete. Charpy v-notch toughness values established under this section needed to meet the requirements of the ECA method at § 192.624(c)(3) or the fracture mechanics requirements at § 192.712 must be maintained for the life of the pipeline.
                (c) Verification of material properties and attributes. If an operator does not have traceable, verifiable, and complete records required by paragraph (b) of this section, the operator must develop and implement procedures for conducting nondestructive or destructive tests, examinations, and assessments in order to verify the material properties of aboveground line pipe and components, and of buried line pipe and components when excavations occur at the following opportunities: Anomaly direct examinations, in situ evaluations, repairs, remediations, maintenance, and excavations that are associated with replacements or relocations of pipeline segments that are removed from service. The procedures must also provide for the following:
                (1) For nondestructive tests, at each test location, material properties for minimum yield strength and ultimate tensile strength must be determined at a minimum of 5 places in at least 2 circumferential quadrants of the pipe for a minimum total of 10 test readings at each pipe cylinder location.
                (2) For destructive tests, at each test location, a set of material properties tests for minimum yield strength and ultimate tensile strength must be conducted on each test pipe cylinder removed from each location, in accordance with API Specification 5L.
                (3) Tests, examinations, and assessments must be appropriate for verifying the necessary material properties and attributes.
                (4) If toughness properties are not documented, the procedures must include accepted industry methods for verifying pipe material toughness.
                (5) Verification of material properties and attributes for non-line pipe components must comply with paragraph (f) of this section.
                (d) Special requirements for nondestructive Methods. Procedures developed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section for verification of material properties and attributes using nondestructive methods must:
                (1) Use methods, tools, procedures, and techniques that have been validated by a subject matter expert based on comparison with destructive test results on material of comparable grade and vintage;
                (2) Conservatively account for measurement inaccuracy and uncertainty using reliable engineering tests and analyses; and
                (3) Use test equipment that has been properly calibrated for comparable test materials prior to usage.
                (e) Sampling multiple segments of pipe. To verify material properties and attributes for a population of multiple, comparable segments of pipe without traceable, verifiable, and complete records, an operator may use a sampling program in accordance with the following requirements:
                (1) The operator must define separate populations of similar segments of pipe for each combination of the following material properties and attributes: Nominal wall thicknesses, grade, manufacturing process, pipe manufacturing dates, and construction dates. If the dates between the manufacture or construction of the pipeline segments exceeds 2 years, those segments cannot be considered as the same vintage for the purpose of defining a population under this section. The total population mileage is the cumulative mileage of pipeline segments in the population. The pipeline segments need not be continuous.

                (2) For each population defined according to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the operator must determine material properties at all excavations that expose the pipe associated with anomaly direct examinations, in situ evaluations, repairs, remediations, or maintenance, except for pipeline segments exposed during excavation activities pursuant to § 192.614, until completion of the lesser of the following:
                (i) One excavation per mile rounded up to the nearest whole number; or
                (ii) 150 excavations if the population is more than 150 miles.
                (3) Prior tests conducted for a single excavation according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section may be counted as one sample under the sampling requirements of this paragraph (e).
                (4) If the test results identify line pipe with properties that are not consistent with available information or existing expectations or assumed properties used for operations and maintenance in the past, the operator must establish an expanded sampling program. The expanded sampling program must use valid statistical bases designed to achieve at least a 95% confidence level that material properties used in the operation and maintenance of the pipeline are valid. The approach must address how the sampling plan will be expanded to address findings that reveal material properties that are not consistent with all available information or existing expectations or assumed material properties used for pipeline operations and maintenance in the past. Operators must notify PHMSA in advance of using an expanded sampling approach in accordance with § 192.18.
                (5) An operator may use an alternative statistical sampling approach that differs from the requirements specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. The alternative sampling program must use valid statistical bases designed to achieve at least a 95% confidence level that material properties used in the operation and maintenance of the pipeline are valid. The approach must address how the sampling plan will be expanded to address findings that reveal material properties that are not consistent with all available information or existing expectations or assumed material properties used for pipeline operations and maintenance in the past. Operators must notify PHMSA in advance of using an alternative sampling approach in accordance with § 192.18.
                (f) Components. For mainline pipeline components other than line pipe, an operator must develop and implement procedures in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section for establishing and documenting the ANSI rating or pressure rating (in accordance with ASME/ANSI B16.5 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7)),
                (1) Operators are not required to test for the chemical and mechanical properties of components in compressor stations, meter stations, regulator stations, separators, river crossing headers, mainline valve assemblies, valve operator piping, or cross-connections with isolation valves from the mainline pipeline.
                (2) Verification of material properties is required for non-line pipe components, including valves, flanges, fittings, fabricated assemblies, and other pressure retaining components and appurtenances that are:
                (i) Larger than 2 inches in nominal outside diameter,
                (ii) Material grades of 42,000 psi (Grade X-42) or greater, or
                (iii) Appurtenances of any size that are directly installed on the pipeline and cannot be isolated from mainline pipeline pressures.
                (3) Procedures for establishing material properties of non-line pipe components must be based on the documented manufacturing specification for the components. If specifications are not known, usage of manufacturer's stamped, marked, or tagged material pressure ratings and material type may be used to establish pressure rating. Operators must document the method used to determine the pressure rating and the findings of that determination.
                (g) Uprating. The material properties determined from the destructive or nondestructive tests required by this section cannot be used to raise the grade or specification of the material, unless the original grade or specification is unknown and MAOP is based on an assumed yield strength of 24,000 psi in accordance with § 192.107(b)(2).

                § 192.609
                Change in class location: Required study.
                Whenever an increase in population density indicates a change in class location for a segment of an existing steel pipeline operating at hoop stress that is more than 40 percent of SMYS, or indicates that the hoop stress corresponding to the established maximum allowable operating pressure for a segment of existing pipeline is not commensurate with the present class location, the operator shall immediately make a study to determine:
                (a) The present class location for the segment involved.
                (b) The design, construction, and testing procedures followed in the original construction, and a comparison of these procedures with those required for the present class location by the applicable provisions of this part.
                (c) The physical condition of the segment to the extent it can be ascertained from available records;
                (d) The operating and maintenance history of the segment;
                (e) The maximum actual operating pressure and the corresponding operating hoop stress, taking pressure gradient into account, for the segment of pipeline involved; and
                (f) The actual area affected by the population density increase, and physical barriers or other factors which may limit further expansion of the more densely populated area.
              
              
                § 192.611
                Change in class location: Confirmation or revision of maximum allowable operating pressure.
                (a) If the hoop stress corresponding to the established maximum allowable operating pressure of a segment of pipeline is not commensurate with the present class location, and the segment is in satisfactory physical condition, the maximum allowable operating pressure of that segment of pipeline must be confirmed or revised according to one of the following requirements:
                (1) If the segment involved has been previously tested in place for a period of not less than 8 hours:
                (i) The maximum allowable operating pressure is 0.8 times the test pressure in Class 2 locations, 0.667 times the test pressure in Class 3 locations, or 0.555 times the test pressure in Class 4 locations. The corresponding hoop stress may not exceed 72 percent of the SMYS of the pipe in Class 2 locations, 60 percent of SMYS in Class 3 locations, or 50 percent of SMYS in Class 4 locations.
                (ii) The alternative maximum allowable operating pressure is 0.8 times the test pressure in Class 2 locations and 0.667 times the test pressure in Class 3 locations. For pipelines operating at alternative maximum allowable pressure per § 192.620, the corresponding hoop stress may not exceed 80 percent of the SMYS of the pipe in Class 2 locations and 67 percent of SMYS in Class 3 locations.
                (2) The maximum allowable operating pressure of the segment involved must be reduced so that the corresponding hoop stress is not more than that allowed by this part for new segments of pipelines in the existing class location.
                (3) The segment involved must be tested in accordance with the applicable requirements of subpart J of this part, and its maximum allowable operating pressure must then be established according to the following criteria:
                (i) The maximum allowable operating pressure after the requalification test is 0.8 times the test pressure for Class 2 locations, 0.667 times the test pressure for Class 3 locations, and 0.555 times the test pressure for Class 4 locations.
                (ii) The corresponding hoop stress may not exceed 72 percent of the SMYS of the pipe in Class 2 locations, 60 percent of SMYS in Class 3 locations, or 50 percent of SMYS in Class 4 locations.
                (iii) For pipeline operating at an alternative maximum allowable operating pressure per § 192.620, the alternative maximum allowable operating pressure after the requalification test is 0.8 times the test pressure for Class 2 locations and 0.667 times the test pressure for Class 3 locations. The corresponding hoop stress may not exceed 80 percent of the SMYS of the pipe in Class 2 locations and 67 percent of SMYS in Class 3 locations.

                (b) The maximum allowable operating pressure confirmed or revised in accordance with this section, may not exceed the maximum allowable operating pressure established before the confirmation or revision.
                (c) Confirmation or revision of the maximum allowable operating pressure of a segment of pipeline in accordance with this section does not preclude the application of §§ 192.553 and 192.555.
                (d) Confirmation or revision of the maximum allowable operating pressure that is required as a result of a study under § 192.609 must be completed within 24 months of the change in class location. Pressure reduction under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section within the 24-month period does not preclude establishing a maximum allowable operating pressure under paragraph (a)(3) of this section at a later date.

                Underwater inspection and reburial of pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico and its inlets.
                (a) Each operator shall prepare and follow a procedure to identify its pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico and its inlets in waters less than 15 feet (4.6 meters) deep as measured from mean low water that are at risk of being an exposed underwater pipeline or a hazard to navigation. The procedures must be in effect August 10, 2005.
                (b) Each operator shall conduct appropriate periodic underwater inspections of its pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico and its inlets in waters less than 15 feet (4.6 meters) deep as measured from mean low water based on the identified risk.
                (c) If an operator discovers that its pipeline is an exposed underwater pipeline or poses a hazard to navigation, the operator shall—
                (1) Promptly, but not later than 24 hours after discovery, notify the National Response Center, telephone: 1-800-424-8802, of the location and, if available, the geographic coordinates of that pipeline.
                (2) Promptly, but not later than 7 days after discovery, mark the location of the pipeline in accordance with 33 CFR part 64 at the ends of the pipeline segment and at intervals of not over 500 yards (457 meters) long, except that a pipeline segment less than 200 yards (183 meters) long need only be marked at the center; and
                (3) Within 6 months after discovery, or not later than November 1 of the following year if the 6 month period is later than November 1 of the year of discovery, bury the pipeline so that the top of the pipe is 36 inches (914 millimeters) below the underwater natural bottom (as determined by recognized and generally accepted practices) for normal excavation or 18 inches (457 millimeters) for rock excavation.
                (i) An operator may employ engineered alternatives to burial that meet or exceed the level of protection provided by burial.
                (ii) If an operator cannot obtain required state or Federal permits in time to comply with this section, it must notify OPS; specify whether the required permit is State or Federal; and, justify the delay.

                Continuing surveillance.
                (a) Each operator shall have a procedure for continuing surveillance of its facilities to determine and take appropriate action concerning changes in class location, failures, leakage history, corrosion, substantial changes in cathodic protection requirements, and other unusual operating and maintenance conditions.
                (b) If a segment of pipeline is determined to be in unsatisfactory condition but no immediate hazard exists, the operator shall initiate a program to recondition or phase out the segment involved, or, if the segment cannot be reconditioned or phased out, reduce the maximum allowable operating pressure in accordance with § 192.619 (a) and (b).
              
              
                § 192.614
                Damage prevention program.

                (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, each operator of a buried pipeline must carry out, in accordance with this section, a written program to prevent damage to that pipeline from excavation activities. For the purposes of this section, the term “excavation activities” includes excavation, blasting, boring, tunneling, backfilling, the removal of aboveground structures by either explosive or mechanical means, and other earthmoving operations.
                (b) An operator may comply with any of the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section through participation in a public service program, such as a one-call system, but such participation does not relieve the operator of responsibility for compliance with this section. However, an operator must perform the duties of paragraph (c)(3) of this section through participation in a one-call system, if that one-call system is a qualified one-call system. In areas that are covered by more than one qualified one-call system, an operator need only join one of the qualified one-call systems if there is a central telephone number for excavators to call for excavation activities, or if the one-call systems in those areas communicate with one another. An operator's pipeline system must be covered by a qualified one-call system where there is one in place. For the purpose of this section, a one-call system is considered a “qualified one-call system” if it meets the requirements of section (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.
                (1) The state has adopted a one-call damage prevention program under § 198.37 of this chapter; or
                (2) The one-call system:
                (i) Is operated in accordance with § 198.39 of this chapter;
                (ii) Provides a pipeline operator an opportunity similar to a voluntary participant to have a part in management responsibilities; and
                (iii) Assesses a participating pipeline operator a fee that is proportionate to the costs of the one-call system's coverage of the operator's pipeline.
                (c) The damage prevention program required by paragraph (a) of this section must, at a minimum:
                (1) Include the identity, on a current basis, of persons who normally engage in excavation activities in the area in which the pipeline is located.
                (2) Provides for notification of the public in the vicinity of the pipeline and actual notification of the persons identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section of the following as often as needed to make them aware of the damage prevention program:
                (i) The program's existence and purpose; and
                (ii) How to learn the location of underground pipelines before excavation activities are begun.
                (3) Provide a means of receiving and recording notification of planned excavation activities.
                (4) If the operator has buried pipelines in the area of excavation activity, provide for actual notification of persons who give notice of their intent to excavate of the type of temporary marking to be provided and how to identify the markings.
                (5) Provide for temporary marking of buried pipelines in the area of excavation activity before, as far as practical, the activity begins.
                (6) Provide as follows for inspection of pipelines that an operator has reason to believe could be damaged by excavation activities:
                (i) The inspection must be done as frequently as necessary during and after the activities to verify the integrity of the pipeline; and
                (ii) In the case of blasting, any inspection must include leakage surveys.
                (d) A damage prevention program under this section is not required for the following pipelines:
                (1) Pipelines located offshore.
                (2) Pipelines, other than those located offshore, in Class 1 or 2 locations until September 20, 1995.
                (3) Pipelines to which access is physically controlled by the operator.
                (e) Pipelines operated by persons other than municipalities (including operators of master meters) whose primary activity does not include the transportation of gas need not comply with the following:
                (1) The requirement of paragraph (a) of this section that the damage prevention program be written; and
                (2) The requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.

                (6) Emergency shutdown and pressure reduction in any section of the operator's pipeline system necessary to minimize hazards to life or property.
                (7) Making safe any actual or potential hazard to life or property.
                (8) Notifying appropriate fire, police, and other public officials of gas pipeline emergencies and coordinating with them both planned responses and actual responses during an emergency.
                (9) Safely restoring any service outage.
                (10) Beginning action under § 192.617, if applicable, as soon after the end of the emergency as possible.
                (11) Actions required to be taken by a controller during an emergency in accordance with § 192.631.
                (b) Each operator shall:
                (1) Furnish its supervisors who are responsible for emergency action a copy of that portion of the latest edition of the emergency procedures established under paragraph (a) of this section as necessary for compliance with those procedures.
                (2) Train the appropriate operating personnel to assure that they are knowledgeable of the emergency procedures and verify that the training is effective.
                (3) Review employee activities to determine whether the procedures were effectively followed in each emergency.
                (c) Each operator shall establish and maintain liaison with appropriate fire, police, and other public officials to:
                (1) Learn the responsibility and resources of each government organization that may respond to a gas pipeline emergency;
                (2) Acquaint the officials with the operator's ability in responding to a gas pipeline emergency;
                (3) Identify the types of gas pipeline emergencies of which the operator notifies the officials; and

                (a) Except for an operator of a master meter or petroleum gas system covered under paragraph (j) of this section, each pipeline operator must develop and implement a written continuing public education program that follows the guidance provided in the American Petroleum Institute's (API) Recommended Practice (RP) 1162 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7).
                (b) The operator's program must follow the general program recommendations of API RP 1162 and assess the unique attributes and characteristics of the operator's pipeline and facilities.
                (c) The operator must follow the general program recommendations, including baseline and supplemental requirements of API RP 1162, unless the operator provides justification in its program or procedural manual as to why compliance with all or certain provisions of the recommended practice is not practicable and not necessary for safety.
                (d) The operator's program must specifically include provisions to educate the public, appropriate government organizations, and persons engaged in excavation related activities on:

                (1) Use of a one-call notification system prior to excavation and other damage prevention activities;
                
                (2) Possible hazards associated with unintended releases from a gas pipeline facility;
                (3) Physical indications that such a release may have occurred;
                (4) Steps that should be taken for public safety in the event of a gas pipeline release; and
                (5) Procedures for reporting such an event.
                (e) The program must include activities to advise affected municipalities, school districts, businesses, and residents of pipeline facility locations.
                (f) The program and the media used must be as comprehensive as necessary to reach all areas in which the operator transports gas.
                (g) The program must be conducted in English and in other languages commonly understood by a significant number and concentration of the non-English speaking population in the operator's area.
                (h) Operators in existence on June 20, 2005, must have completed their written programs no later than June 20, 2006. The operator of a master meter or petroleum gas system covered under paragraph (j) of this section must complete development of its written procedure by June 13, 2008. Upon request, operators must submit their completed programs to PHMSA or, in the case of an intrastate pipeline facility operator, the appropriate State agency.
                (i) The operator's program documentation and evaluation results must be available for periodic review by appropriate regulatory agencies.
                (j) Unless the operator transports gas as a primary activity, the operator of a master meter or petroleum gas system is not required to develop a public awareness program as prescribed in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section. Instead the operator must develop and implement a written procedure to provide its customers public awareness messages twice annually. If the master meter or petroleum gas system is located on property the operator does not control, the operator must provide similar messages twice annually to persons controlling the property. The public awareness message must include:

                § 192.617
                Investigation of failures.
                Each operator shall establish procedures for analyzing accidents and failures, including the selection of samples of the failed facility or equipment for laboratory examination, where appropriate, for the purpose of determining the causes of the failure and minimizing the possibility of a recurrence.
              
              
                § 192.619
                Maximum allowable operating pressure: Steel or plastic pipelines.
                (a) No person may operate a segment of steel or plastic pipeline at a pressure that exceeds a maximum allowable operating pressure determined under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, or the lowest of the following:
                (1) The design pressure of the weakest element in the segment, determined in accordance with subparts C and D of this part. However, for steel pipe in pipelines being converted under § 192.14 or uprated under subpart K of this part, if any variable necessary to determine the design pressure under the design formula (§ 192.105) is unknown, one of the following pressures is to be used as design pressure:

                (i) Eighty percent of the first test pressure that produces yield under section N5 of Appendix N of ASME B31.8 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), reduced by the appropriate factor in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section; or
                (ii) If the pipe is 123/4 inches (324 mm) or less in outside diameter and is not tested to yield under this paragraph, 200 p.s.i. (1379 kPa).
                (2) The pressure obtained by dividing the pressure to which the segment was tested after construction as follows:

                (i) For plastic pipe in all locations, the test pressure is divided by a factor of 1.5.
                
                (ii) For steel pipe operated at 100 p.s.i. (689 kPa) gage or more, the test pressure is divided by a factor determined in accordance with the following table:

                    (D) The alternative maximum allowable operating pressure was based on a design factor of 0.56 under paragraph (a) of this section and the failure pressure is less than or equal to 1.80 times the alternative maximum allowable operating pressure.
                  
                  
                     
                    (iv) Evaluate any defect not required to be repaired under paragraph (d)(11)(ii) or (iii) of this section to determine its growth rate, set the maximum interval for repair or re-inspection, and repair or re-inspect within that interval.
                  
                
                (e) Is there any change in overpressure protection associated with operating at the alternative maximum allowable operating pressure? Notwithstanding the required capacity of pressure relieving and limiting stations otherwise required by § 192.201, if an operator establishes a maximum allowable operating pressure for a pipeline segment in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, an operator must:
                (1) Provide overpressure protection that limits mainline pressure to a maximum of 104 percent of the maximum allowable operating pressure; and

                (2) Develop and follow a procedure for establishing and maintaining accurate set points for the supervisory control and data acquisition system.

                § 192.624
                Maximum allowable operating pressure reconfirmation: Onshore steel transmission pipelines.
                (a) Applicability. Operators of onshore steel transmission pipeline segments must reconfirm the maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) of all pipeline segments in accordance with the requirements of this section if either of the following conditions are met:
                (1) Records necessary to establish the MAOP in accordance with § 192.619(a), including records required by § 192.517(a), are not traceable, verifiable, and complete and the pipeline is located in one of the following locations:
                (i) A high consequence area as defined in § 192.903; or
                (ii) A Class 3 or Class 4 location.
                (2) The pipeline segment's MAOP was established in accordance with § 192.619(c), the pipeline segment's MAOP is greater than or equal to 30 percent of the specified minimum yield strength, and the pipeline segment is located in one of the following areas:
                (i) A high consequence area as defined in § 192.903;
                (ii) A Class 3 or Class 4 location; or
                (iii) A moderate consequence area as defined in § 192.3, if the pipeline segment can accommodate inspection by means of instrumented inline inspection tools.
                (b) Procedures and completion dates. Operators of a pipeline subject to this section must develop and document procedures for completing all actions required by this section by July 1, 2021. These procedures must include a process for reconfirming MAOP for any pipelines that meet a condition of § 192.624(a), and for performing a spike test or material verification in accordance with §§ 192.506 and 192.607, if applicable. All actions required by this section must be completed according to the following schedule:

                (1) Operators must complete all actions required by this section on at least 50% of the pipeline mileage by July 3, 2028.

                (2) Operators must complete all actions required by this section on 100% of the pipeline mileage by July 2, 2035 or as soon as practicable, but not to exceed 4 years after the pipeline segment first meets a condition of § 192.624(a) (e.g., due to a location becoming a high consequence area), whichever is later.
                (3) If operational and environmental constraints limit an operator from meeting the deadlines in § 192.624, the operator may petition for an extension of the completion deadlines by up to 1 year, upon submittal of a notification in accordance with § 192.18. The notification must include an up-to-date plan for completing all actions in accordance with this section, the reason for the requested extension, current status, proposed completion date, outstanding remediation activities, and any needed temporary measures needed to mitigate the impact on safety.
                (c) Maximum allowable operating pressure determination. Operators of a pipeline segment meeting a condition in paragraph (a) of this section must reconfirm its MAOP using one of the following methods:
                (1) Method 1: Pressure test. Perform a pressure test and verify material properties records in accordance with § 192.607 and the following requirements:
                (i) Pressure test. Perform a pressure test in accordance with subpart J of this part. The MAOP must be equal to the test pressure divided by the greater of either 1.25 or the applicable class location factor in § 192.619(a)(2)(ii).
                (ii) Material properties records. Determine if the following material properties records are documented in traceable, verifiable, and complete records: Diameter, wall thickness, seam type, and grade (minimum yield strength, ultimate tensile strength).
                (iii) Material properties verification. If any of the records required by paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section are not documented in traceable, verifiable, and complete records, the operator must obtain the missing records in accordance with § 192.607. An operator must test the pipe materials cut out from the test manifold sites at the time the pressure test is conducted. If there is a failure during the pressure test, the operator must test any removed pipe from the pressure test failure in accordance with § 192.607.
                (2) Method 2: Pressure Reduction. Reduce pressure, as necessary, and limit MAOP to no greater than the highest actual operating pressure sustained by the pipeline during the 5 years preceding October 1, 2019, divided by the greater of 1.25 or the applicable class location factor in § 192.619(a)(2)(ii). The highest actual sustained pressure must have been reached for a minimum cumulative duration of 8 hours during a continuous 30-day period. The value used as the highest actual sustained operating pressure must account for differences between upstream and downstream pressure on the pipeline by use of either the lowest maximum pressure value for the entire pipeline segment or using the operating pressure gradient along the entire pipeline segment (i.e., the location-specific operating pressure at each location).
                (i) Where the pipeline segment has had a class location change in accordance with § 192.611, and records documenting diameter, wall thickness, seam type, grade (minimum yield strength and ultimate tensile strength), and pressure tests are not documented in traceable, verifiable, and complete records, the operator must reduce the pipeline segment MAOP as follows:
                (A) For pipeline segments where a class location changed from Class 1 to Class 2, from Class 2 to Class 3, or from Class 3 to Class 4, reduce the pipeline MAOP to no greater than the highest actual operating pressure sustained by the pipeline during the 5 years preceding October 1, 2019, divided by 1.39 for Class 1 to Class 2, 1.67 for Class 2 to Class 3, and 2.00 for Class 3 to Class 4.
                (B) For pipeline segments where a class location changed from Class 1 to Class 3, reduce the pipeline MAOP to no greater than the highest actual operating pressure sustained by the pipeline during the 5 years preceding October 1, 2019, divided by 2.00.

                (ii) Future uprating of the pipeline segment in accordance with subpart K is allowed if the MAOP is established using Method 2.
                
                (iii) If an operator elects to use Method 2, but desires to use a less conservative pressure reduction factor or longer look-back period, the operator must notify PHMSA in accordance with § 192.18 no later than 7 calendar days after establishing the reduced MAOP. The notification must include the following details:
                (A) Descriptions of the operational constraints, special circumstances, or other factors that preclude, or make it impractical, to use the pressure reduction factor specified in § 192.624(c)(2);
                (B) The fracture mechanics modeling for failure stress pressures and cyclic fatigue crack growth analysis that complies with § 192.712;
                (C) Justification that establishing MAOP by another method allowed by this section is impractical;
                (D) Justification that the reduced MAOP determined by the operator is safe based on analysis of the condition of the pipeline segment, including material properties records, material properties verified in accordance § 192.607, and the history of the pipeline segment, particularly known corrosion and leakage, and the actual operating pressure, and additional compensatory preventive and mitigative measures taken or planned; and
                (E) Planned duration for operating at the requested MAOP, long-term remediation measures and justification of this operating time interval, including fracture mechanics modeling for failure stress pressures and cyclic fatigue growth analysis and other validated forms of engineering analysis that have been reviewed and confirmed by subject matter experts.
                (3) Method 3: Engineering Critical Assessment (ECA). Conduct an ECA in accordance with § 192.632.
                (4) Method 4: Pipe Replacement. Replace the pipeline segment in accordance with this part.
                (5) Method 5: Pressure Reduction for Pipeline Segments with Small Potential Impact Radius. Pipelines with a potential impact radius (PIR) less than or equal to 150 feet may establish the MAOP as follows:

                (i) Reduce the MAOP to no greater than the highest actual operating pressure sustained by the pipeline during 5 years preceding October 1, 2019, divided by 1.1. The highest actual sustained pressure must have been reached for a minimum cumulative duration of 8 hours during one continuous 30-day period. The reduced MAOP must account for differences between discharge and upstream pressure on the pipeline by use of either the lowest value for the entire pipeline segment or the operating pressure gradient (i.e., the location specific operating pressure at each location);
                (ii) Conduct patrols in accordance with § 192.705 paragraphs (a) and (c) and conduct instrumented leakage surveys in accordance with § 192.706 at intervals not to exceed those in the following table 1 to § 192.624(c)(5)(ii):

                    3 1/2 months, but at least four times each calendar year.
                  
                  
                    (B) Class 3 and Class 4
                    3 months, but at least six times each calendar year
                    3 months, but at least six times each calendar year.
                  
                
                (iii) Under Method 5, future uprating of the pipeline segment in accordance with subpart K is allowed.
                (6) Method 6: Alternative Technology. Operators may use an alternative technical evaluation process that provides a documented engineering analysis for establishing MAOP. If an operator elects to use alternative technology, the operator must notify PHMSA in advance in accordance with § 192.18. The notification must include descriptions of the following details:

                (i) The technology or technologies to be used for tests, examinations, and assessments; the method for establishing material properties; and analytical techniques with similar analysis from prior tool runs done to ensure the results are consistent with the required corresponding hydrostatic test pressure for the pipeline segment being evaluated;
                (ii) Procedures and processes to conduct tests, examinations, assessments and evaluations, analyze defects and flaws, and remediate defects discovered;
                (iii) Pipeline segment data, including original design, maintenance and operating history, anomaly or flaw characterization;
                (iv) Assessment techniques and acceptance criteria, including anomaly detection confidence level, probability of detection, and uncertainty of the predicted failure pressure quantified as a fraction of specified minimum yield strength;
                (v) If any pipeline segment contains cracking or may be susceptible to cracking or crack-like defects found through or identified by assessments, leaks, failures, manufacturing vintage histories, or any other available information about the pipeline, the operator must estimate the remaining life of the pipeline in accordance with paragraph § 192.712;
                (vi) Operational monitoring procedures;
                (vii) Methodology and criteria used to justify and establish the MAOP; and
                (vii) Documentation of the operator's process and procedures used to implement the use of the alternative technology, including any records generated through its use.
                (d) Records. An operator must retain records of investigations, tests, analyses, assessments, repairs, replacements, alterations, and other actions taken in accordance with the requirements of this section for the life of the pipeline.

                Odorization of gas.
                (a) A combustible gas in a distribution line must contain a natural odorant or be odorized so that at a concentration in air of one-fifth of the lower explosive limit, the gas is readily detectable by a person with a normal sense of smell.
                (b) After December 31, 1976, a combustible gas in a transmission line in a Class 3 or Class 4 location must comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section unless:
                (1) At least 50 percent of the length of the line downstream from that location is in a Class 1 or Class 2 location;
                (2) The line transports gas to any of the following facilities which received gas without an odorant from that line before May 5, 1975;
                (i) An underground storage field;
                (ii) A gas processing plant;
                (iii) A gas dehydration plant; or
                (iv) An industrial plant using gas in a process where the presence of an odorant:
                (A) Makes the end product unfit for the purpose for which it is intended;
                (B) Reduces the activity of a catalyst; or
                (C) Reduces the percentage completion of a chemical reaction;
                (3) In the case of a lateral line which transports gas to a distribution center, at least 50 percent of the length of that line is in a Class 1 or Class 2 location; or
                (4) The combustible gas is hydrogen intended for use as a feedstock in a manufacturing process.
                (c) In the concentrations in which it is used, the odorant in combustible gases must comply with the following:
                (1) The odorant may not be deleterious to persons, materials, or pipe.
                (2) The products of combustion from the odorant may not be toxic when breathed nor may they be corrosive or harmful to those materials to which the products of combustion will be exposed.
                (d) The odorant may not be soluble in water to an extent greater than 2.5 parts to 100 parts by weight.

                § 192.631
                Control room management.
                (a) General. (1) This section applies to each operator of a pipeline facility with a controller working in a control room who monitors and controls all or part of a pipeline facility through a SCADA system. Each operator must have and follow written control room management procedures that implement the requirements of this section, except that for each control room where an operator's activities are limited to either or both of:
                (i) Distribution with less than 250,000 services, or
                (ii) Transmission without a compressor station, the operator must have and follow written procedures that implement only paragraphs (d) (regarding fatigue), (i) (regarding compliance validation), and (j) (regarding compliance and deviations) of this section.
                (2) The procedures required by this section must be integrated, as appropriate, with operating and emergency procedures required by §§ 192.605 and 192.615. An operator must develop the procedures no later than August 1, 2011, and must implement the procedures according to the following schedule. The procedures required by paragraphs (b), (c)(5), (d)(2) and (d)(3), (f) and (g) of this section must be implemented no later than October 1, 2011. The procedures required by paragraphs (c)(1) through (4), (d)(1), (d)(4), and (e) must be implemented no later than August 1, 2012. The training procedures required by paragraph (h) must be implemented no later than August 1, 2012, except that any training required by another paragraph of this section must be implemented no later than the deadline for that paragraph.
                (b) Roles and responsibilities. Each operator must define the roles and responsibilities of a controller during normal, abnormal, and emergency operating conditions. To provide for a controller's prompt and appropriate response to operating conditions, an operator must define each of the following:
                (1) A controller's authority and responsibility to make decisions and take actions during normal operations;
                (2) A controller's role when an abnormal operating condition is detected, even if the controller is not the first to detect the condition, including the controller's responsibility to take specific actions and to communicate with others;
                (3) A controller's role during an emergency, even if the controller is not the first to detect the emergency, including the controller's responsibility to take specific actions and to communicate with others;
                (4) A method of recording controller shift-changes and any hand-over of responsibility between controllers; and
                (5) The roles, responsibilities and qualifications of others with the authority to direct or supersede the specific technical actions of a controller.
                (c) Provide adequate information. Each operator must provide its controllers with the information, tools, processes and procedures necessary for the controllers to carry out the roles and responsibilities the operator has defined by performing each of the following:
                (1) Implement sections 1, 4, 8, 9, 11.1, and 11.3 of API RP 1165 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) whenever a SCADA system is added, expanded or replaced, unless the operator demonstrates that certain provisions of sections 1, 4, 8, 9, 11.1, and 11.3 of API RP 1165 are not practical for the SCADA system used;
                (2) Conduct a point-to-point verification between SCADA displays and related field equipment when field equipment is added or moved and when other changes that affect pipeline safety are made to field equipment or SCADA displays;
                (3) Test and verify an internal communication plan to provide adequate means for manual operation of the pipeline safely, at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months;
                (4) Test any backup SCADA systems at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months; and
                (5) Establish and implement procedures for when a different controller assumes responsibility, including the content of information to be exchanged.
                (d) Fatigue mitigation. Each operator must implement the following methods to reduce the risk associated with controller fatigue that could inhibit a controller's ability to carry out the roles and responsibilities the operator has defined:
                (1) Establish shift lengths and schedule rotations that provide controllers off-duty time sufficient to achieve eight hours of continuous sleep;
                (2) Educate controllers and supervisors in fatigue mitigation strategies and how off-duty activities contribute to fatigue;
                (3) Train controllers and supervisors to recognize the effects of fatigue; and
                (4) Establish a maximum limit on controller hours-of-service, which may provide for an emergency deviation from the maximum limit if necessary for the safe operation of a pipeline facility.
                (e) Alarm management. Each operator using a SCADA system must have a written alarm management plan to provide for effective controller response to alarms. An operator's plan must include provisions to:
                (1) Review SCADA safety-related alarm operations using a process that ensures alarms are accurate and support safe pipeline operations;
                (2) Identify at least once each calendar month points affecting safety that have been taken off scan in the SCADA host, have had alarms inhibited, generated false alarms, or that have had forced or manual values for periods of time exceeding that required for associated maintenance or operating activities;
                (3) Verify the correct safety-related alarm set-point values and alarm descriptions at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months;
                (4) Review the alarm management plan required by this paragraph at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not exceeding 15 months, to determine the effectiveness of the plan;
                (5) Monitor the content and volume of general activity being directed to and required of each controller at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months, that will assure controllers have sufficient time to analyze and react to incoming alarms; and
                (6) Address deficiencies identified through the implementation of paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(5) of this section.
                (f) Change management. Each operator must assure that changes that could affect control room operations are coordinated with the control room personnel by performing each of the following:
                (1) Establish communications between control room representatives, operator's management, and associated field personnel when planning and implementing physical changes to pipeline equipment or configuration;

                (2) Require its field personnel to contact the control room when emergency conditions exist and when making field changes that affect control room operations; and
                
                (3) Seek control room or control room management participation in planning prior to implementation of significant pipeline hydraulic or configuration changes.
                (g) Operating experience. Each operator must assure that lessons learned from its operating experience are incorporated, as appropriate, into its control room management procedures by performing each of the following:
                (1) Review incidents that must be reported pursuant to 49 CFR part 191 to determine if control room actions contributed to the event and, if so, correct, where necessary, deficiencies related to:
                (i) Controller fatigue;
                (ii) Field equipment;
                (iii) The operation of any relief device;
                (iv) Procedures;
                (v) SCADA system configuration; and
                (vi) SCADA system performance.
                (2) Include lessons learned from the operator's experience in the training program required by this section.
                (h) Training. Each operator must establish a controller training program and review the training program content to identify potential improvements at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months. An operator's program must provide for training each controller to carry out the roles and responsibilities defined by the operator. In addition, the training program must include the following elements:
                (1) Responding to abnormal operating conditions likely to occur simultaneously or in sequence;
                (2) Use of a computerized simulator or non-computerized (tabletop) method for training controllers to recognize abnormal operating conditions;
                (3) Training controllers on their responsibilities for communication under the operator's emergency response procedures;
                (4) Training that will provide a controller a working knowledge of the pipeline system, especially during the development of abnormal operating conditions;
                (5) For pipeline operating setups that are periodically, but infrequently used, providing an opportunity for controllers to review relevant procedures in advance of their application; and
                (6) Control room team training and exercises that include both controllers and other individuals, defined by the operator, who would reasonably be expected to operationally collaborate with controllers (control room personnel) during normal, abnormal or emergency situations. Operators must comply with the team training requirements under this paragraph by no later than January 23, 2018.
                (i) Compliance validation. Upon request, operators must submit their procedures to PHMSA or, in the case of an intrastate pipeline facility regulated by a State, to the appropriate State agency.
                (j) Compliance and deviations. An operator must maintain for review during inspection:
                (1) Records that demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this section; and
                (2) Documentation to demonstrate that any deviation from the procedures required by this section was necessary for the safe operation of a pipeline facility.

                § 192.632
                Engineering Critical Assessment for Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure Reconfirmation: Onshore steel transmission pipelines.
                When an operator conducts an MAOP reconfirmation in accordance with § 192.624(c)(3) “Method 3” using an ECA to establish the material strength and MAOP of the pipeline segment, the ECA must comply with the requirements of this section. The ECA must assess: Threats; loadings and operational circumstances relevant to those threats, including along the pipeline right-of way; outcomes of the threat assessment; relevant mechanical and fracture properties; in-service degradation or failure processes; and initial and final defect size relevance. The ECA must quantify the interacting effects of threats on any defect in the pipeline.
                (a) ECA Analysis. (1) The material properties required to perform an ECA analysis in accordance with this paragraph are as follows: Diameter, wall thickness, seam type, grade (minimum yield strength and ultimate tensile strength), and Charpy v-notch toughness values based upon the lowest operational temperatures, if applicable. If any material properties required to perform an ECA for any pipeline segment in accordance with this paragraph are not documented in traceable, verifiable and complete records, an operator must use conservative assumptions and include the pipeline segment in its program to verify the undocumented information in accordance with § 192.607. The ECA must integrate, analyze, and account for the material properties, the results of all tests, direct examinations, destructive tests, and assessments performed in accordance with this section, along with other pertinent information related to pipeline integrity, including close interval surveys, coating surveys, interference surveys required by subpart I of this part, cause analyses of prior incidents, prior pressure test leaks and failures, other leaks, pipe inspections, and prior integrity assessments, including those required by §§ 192.617, 192.710, and subpart O of this part.
                (2) The ECA must analyze and determine the predicted failure pressure for the defect being assessed using procedures that implement the appropriate failure criteria and justification as follows:
                (i) The ECA must analyze any cracks or crack-like defects remaining in the pipe, or that could remain in the pipe, to determine the predicted failure pressure of each defect in accordance with § 192.712.

                (ii) The ECA must analyze any metal loss defects not associated with a dent, including corrosion, gouges, scrapes or other metal loss defects that could remain in the pipe, to determine the predicted failure pressure. ASME/ANSI B31G (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) or R-STRENG (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) must be used for corrosion defects. Both procedures and their analysis apply to corroded regions that do not penetrate the pipe wall over 80 percent of the wall thickness and are subject to the limitations prescribed in the equations' procedures. The ECA must use conservative assumptions for metal loss dimensions (length, width, and depth).
                (iii) When determining the predicted failure pressure for gouges, scrapes, selective seam weld corrosion, crack-related defects, or any defect within a dent, appropriate failure criteria and justification of the criteria must be used and documented.
                (iv) If SMYS or actual material yield and ultimate tensile strength is not known or not documented by traceable, verifiable, and complete records, then the operator must assume 30,000 p.s.i. or determine the material properties using § 192.607.
                (3) The ECA must analyze the interaction of defects to conservatively determine the most limiting predicted failure pressure. Examples include, but are not limited to, cracks in or near locations with corrosion metal loss, dents with gouges or other metal loss, or cracks in or near dents or other deformation damage. The ECA must document all evaluations and any assumptions used in the ECA process.
                (4) The MAOP must be established at the lowest predicted failure pressure for any known or postulated defect, or interacting defects, remaining in the pipe divided by the greater of 1.25 or the applicable factor listed in § 192.619(a)(2)(ii).
                (b) Assessment to determine defects remaining in the pipe. An operator must utilize previous pressure tests or develop and implement an assessment program to determine the size of defects remaining in the pipe to be analyzed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.

                (1) An operator may use a previous pressure test that complied with subpart J to determine the defects remaining in the pipe if records for a pressure test meeting the requirements of subpart J of this part exist for the pipeline segment. The operator must calculate the largest defect that could have survived the pressure test. The operator must predict how much the defects have grown since the date of the pressure test in accordance with § 192.712. The ECA must analyze the predicted size of the largest defect that could have survived the pressure test that could remain in the pipe at the time the ECA is performed. The operator must calculate the remaining life of the most severe defects that could have survived the pressure test and establish a re-assessment interval in accordance with the methodology in § 192.712.
                (2) Operators may use an inline inspection program in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
                (3) Operators may use “other technology” if it is validated by a subject matter expert to produce an equivalent understanding of the condition of the pipe equal to or greater than pressure testing or an inline inspection program. If an operator elects to use “other technology” in the ECA, it must notify PHMSA in advance of using the other technology in accordance with § 192.18. The “other technology” notification must have:
                (i) Descriptions of the technology or technologies to be used for all tests, examinations, and assessments, including characterization of defect size used in the crack assessments (length, depth, and volumetric); and
                (ii) Procedures and processes to conduct tests, examinations, assessments and evaluations, analyze defects, and remediate defects discovered.
                (c) In-line inspection. An inline inspection (ILI) program to determine the defects remaining the pipe for the ECA analysis must be performed using tools that can detect wall loss, deformation from dents, wrinkle bends, ovalities, expansion, seam defects, including cracking and selective seam weld corrosion, longitudinal, circumferential and girth weld cracks, hard spot cracking, and stress corrosion cracking.
                (1) If a pipeline has segments that might be susceptible to hard spots based on assessment, leak, failure, manufacturing vintage history, or other information, then the ILI program must include a tool that can detect hard spots.
                (2) If the pipeline has had a reportable incident, as defined in § 191.3, attributed to a girth weld failure since its most recent pressure test, then the ILI program must include a tool that can detect girth weld defects unless the ECA analysis performed in accordance with this section includes an engineering evaluation program to analyze and account for the susceptibility of girth weld failure due to lateral stresses.
                (3) Inline inspection must be performed in accordance with § 192.493.
                (4) An operator must use unity plots or equivalent methodologies to validate the performance of the ILI tools in identifying and sizing actionable manufacturing and construction related anomalies. Enough data points must be used to validate tool performance at the same or better statistical confidence level provided in the tool specifications. The operator must have a process for identifying defects outside the tool performance specifications and following up with the ILI vendor to conduct additional in-field examinations, reanalyze ILI data, or both.
                (5) Interpretation and evaluation of assessment results must meet the requirements of §§ 192.710, 192.713, and subpart O of this part, and must conservatively account for the accuracy and reliability of ILI, in-the-ditch examination methods and tools, and any other assessment and examination results used to determine the actual sizes of cracks, metal loss, deformation and other defect dimensions by applying the most conservative limit of the tool tolerance specification. ILI and in-the-ditch examination tools and procedures for crack assessments (length and depth) must have performance and evaluation standards confirmed for accuracy through confirmation tests for the defect types and pipe material vintage being evaluated. Inaccuracies must be accounted for in the procedures for evaluations and fracture mechanics models for predicted failure pressure determinations.
                (6) Anomalies detected by ILI assessments must be remediated in accordance with applicable criteria in §§ 192.713 and 192.933.
                (d) Defect remaining life. If any pipeline segment contains cracking or may be susceptible to cracking or crack-like defects found through or identified by assessments, leaks, failures, manufacturing vintage histories, or any other available information about the pipeline, the operator must estimate the remaining life of the pipeline in accordance with § 192.712.
                
                (e) Records. An operator must retain records of investigations, tests, analyses, assessments, repairs, replacements, alterations, and other actions taken in accordance with the requirements of this section for the life of the pipeline.

                Transmission lines: Assessments outside of high consequence areas.
                (a) Applicability: This section applies to onshore steel transmission pipeline segments with a maximum allowable operating pressure of greater than or equal to 30% of the specified minimum yield strength and are located in:
                (1) A Class 3 or Class 4 location; or

                (2) A moderate consequence area as defined in § 192.3, if the pipeline segment can accommodate inspection by means of an instrumented inline inspection tool (i.e., “smart pig”).
                (3) This section does not apply to a pipeline segment located in a high consequence area as defined in § 192.903.
                (b) General—(1) Initial assessment. An operator must perform initial assessments in accordance with this section based on a risk-based prioritization schedule and complete initial assessment for all applicable pipeline segments no later than July 3, 2034, or as soon as practicable but not to exceed 10 years after the pipeline segment first meets the conditions of § 192.710(a) (e.g., due to a change in class location or the area becomes a moderate consequence area), whichever is later.
                (2) Periodic reassessment. An operator must perform periodic reassessments at least once every 10 years, with intervals not to exceed 126 months, or a shorter reassessment interval based upon the type of anomaly, operational, material, and environmental conditions found on the pipeline segment, or as necessary to ensure public safety.
                (3) Prior assessment. An operator may use a prior assessment conducted before July 1, 2020 as an initial assessment for the pipeline segment, if the assessment met the subpart O requirements of part 192 for in-line inspection at the time of the assessment. If an operator uses this prior assessment as its initial assessment, the operator must reassess the pipeline segment according to the reassessment interval specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section calculated from the date of the prior assessment.

The initial assessments and the reassessments required by paragraph (b) of this section must be capable of identifying anomalies and defects associated with each of the threats to which the pipeline segment is susceptible and must be performed using one or more of the following methods:
                (1) Internal inspection. Internal inspection tool or tools capable of detecting those threats to which the pipeline is susceptible, such as corrosion, deformation and mechanical damage (e.g., dents, gouges and grooves), material cracking and crack-like defects (e.g., stress corrosion cracking, selective seam weld corrosion, environmentally assisted cracking, and girth weld cracks), hard spots with cracking, and any other threats to which the covered segment is susceptible. When performing an assessment using an in-line inspection tool, an operator must comply with § 192.493;
                (2) Pressure test. Pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart J of this part. The use of subpart J pressure testing is appropriate for threats such as internal corrosion, external corrosion, and other environmentally assisted corrosion mechanisms; manufacturing and related defect threats, including defective pipe and pipe seams; and stress corrosion cracking, selective seam weld corrosion, dents and other forms of mechanical damage;
                (3) Spike hydrostatic pressure test. A spike hydrostatic pressure test conducted in accordance with § 192.506. A spike hydrostatic pressure test is appropriate for time-dependent threats such as stress corrosion cracking; selective seam weld corrosion; manufacturing and related defects, including defective pipe and pipe seams; and other forms of defect or damage involving cracks or crack-like defects;
                (4) Direct examination. Excavation and in situ direct examination by means of visual examination, direct measurement, and recorded non-destructive examination results and data needed to assess all applicable threats. Based upon the threat assessed, examples of appropriate non-destructive examination methods include ultrasonic testing (UT), phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT), Inverse Wave Field Extrapolation (IWEX), radiography, and magnetic particle inspection (MPI);
                (5) Guided Wave Ultrasonic Testing. Guided Wave Ultrasonic Testing (GWUT) as described in Appendix F;
                (6) Direct assessment. Direct assessment to address threats of external corrosion, internal corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking. The use of use of direct assessment to address threats of external corrosion, internal corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking is allowed only if appropriate for the threat and pipeline segment being assessed. Use of direct assessment for threats other than the threat for which the direct assessment method is suitable is not allowed. An operator must conduct the direct assessment in accordance with the requirements listed in § 192.923 and with the applicable requirements specified in §§ 192.925, 192.927 and 192.929; or
                (7) Other technology. Other technology that an operator demonstrates can provide an equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe for each of the threats to which the pipeline is susceptible. An operator must notify PHMSA in advance of using the other technology in accordance with § 192.18.
                (d) Data analysis. An operator must analyze and account for the data obtained from an assessment performed under paragraph (c) of this section to determine if a condition could adversely affect the safe operation of the pipeline using personnel qualified by knowledge, training, and experience. In addition, when analyzing inline inspection data, an operator must account for uncertainties in reported results (e.g., tool tolerance, detection threshold, probability of detection, probability of identification, sizing accuracy, conservative anomaly interaction criteria, location accuracy, anomaly findings, and unity chart plots or equivalent for determining uncertainties and verifying actual tool performance) in identifying and characterizing anomalies.
                (e) Discovery of condition. Discovery of a condition occurs when an operator has adequate information about a condition to determine that the condition presents a potential threat to the integrity of the pipeline. An operator must promptly, but no later than 180 days after conducting an integrity assessment, obtain sufficient information about a condition to make that determination, unless the operator demonstrates that 180 days is impracticable.
                (f) Remediation. An operator must comply with the requirements in §§ 192.485, 192.711, and 192.713, where applicable, if a condition that could adversely affect the safe operation of a pipeline is discovered.
                (g) Analysis of information. An operator must analyze and account for all available relevant information about a pipeline in complying with the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.

                § 192.711
                Transmission lines: General requirements for repair procedures.
                (a) Temporary repairs. Each operator must take immediate temporary measures to protect the public whenever:
                (1) A leak, imperfection, or damage that impairs its serviceability is found in a segment of steel transmission line operating at or above 40 percent of the SMYS; and
                (2) It is not feasible to make a permanent repair at the time of discovery.
                (b) Permanent repairs. An operator must make permanent repairs on its pipeline system according to the following:
                (1) Non integrity management repairs: The operator must make permanent repairs as soon as feasible.
                (2) Integrity management repairs: When an operator discovers a condition on a pipeline covered under Subpart O-Gas Transmission Pipeline Integrity Management, the operator must remediate the condition as prescribed by § 192.933(d).
                (c) Welded patch. Except as provided in § 192.717(b)(3), no operator may use a welded patch as a means of repair.

                § 192.712
                Analysis of predicted failure pressure.
                (a) Applicability. Whenever required by this part, operators of onshore steel transmission pipelines must analyze anomalies or defects to determine the predicted failure pressure at the location of the anomaly or defect, and the remaining life of the pipeline segment at the location of the anomaly or defect, in accordance with this section.
                (b) Corrosion metal loss. When analyzing corrosion metal loss under this section, an operator must use a suitable remaining strength calculation method including, ASME/ANSI B31G (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7); R-STRENG (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7); or an alternative equivalent method of remaining strength calculation that will provide an equally conservative result.
                (c) [Reserved]
                (d) Cracks and crack-like defects—(1) Crack analysis models. When analyzing cracks and crack-like defects under this section, an operator must determine predicted failure pressure, failure stress pressure, and crack growth using a technically proven fracture mechanics model appropriate to the failure mode (ductile, brittle or both), material properties (pipe and weld properties), and boundary condition used (pressure test, ILI, or other).
                (2) Analysis for crack growth and remaining life. If the pipeline segment is susceptible to cyclic fatigue or other loading conditions that could lead to fatigue crack growth, fatigue analysis must be performed using an applicable fatigue crack growth law (for example, Paris Law) or other technically appropriate engineering methodology. For other degradation processes that can cause crack growth, appropriate engineering analysis must be used. The above methodologies must be validated by a subject matter expert to determine conservative predictions of flaw growth and remaining life at the maximum allowable operating pressure. The operator must calculate the remaining life of the pipeline by determining the amount of time required for the crack to grow to a size that would fail at maximum allowable operating pressure.

                (i) When calculating crack size that would fail at MAOP, and the material toughness is not documented in traceable, verifiable, and complete records, the same Charpy v-notch toughness value established in paragraph (e)(2) of this section must be used.
                (ii) Initial and final flaw size must be determined using a fracture mechanics model appropriate to the failure mode (ductile, brittle or both) and boundary condition used (pressure test, ILI, or other).
                (iii) An operator must re-evaluate the remaining life of the pipeline before 50% of the remaining life calculated by this analysis has expired. The operator must determine and document if further pressure tests or use of other assessment methods are required at that time. The operator must continue to re-evaluate the remaining life of the pipeline before 50% of the remaining life calculated in the most recent evaluation has expired.
                (3) Cracks that survive pressure testing. For cases in which the operator does not have in-line inspection crack anomaly data and is analyzing potential crack defects that could have survived a pressure test, the operator must calculate the largest potential crack defect sizes using the methods in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. If pipe material toughness is not documented in traceable, verifiable, and complete records, the operator must use one of the following for Charpy v-notch toughness values based upon minimum operational temperature and equivalent to a full-size specimen value:
                (i) Charpy v-notch toughness values from comparable pipe with known properties of the same vintage and from the same steel and pipe manufacturer;
                (ii) A conservative Charpy v-notch toughness value to determine the toughness based upon the material properties verification process specified in § 192.607;
                (iii) A full size equivalent Charpy v-notch upper-shelf toughness level of 120 ft.-lbs.; or
                (iv) Other appropriate values that an operator demonstrates can provide conservative Charpy v-notch toughness values of the crack-related conditions of the pipeline segment. Operators using an assumed Charpy v-notch toughness value must notify PHMSA in accordance with § 192.18.
                (e) Data. In performing the analyses of predicted or assumed anomalies or defects in accordance with this section, an operator must use data as follows.

                (1) An operator must explicitly analyze and account for uncertainties in reported assessment results (including tool tolerance, detection threshold, probability of detection, probability of identification, sizing accuracy, conservative anomaly interaction criteria, location accuracy, anomaly findings, and unity chart plots or equivalent for determining uncertainties and verifying tool performance) in identifying and characterizing the type and dimensions of anomalies or defects used in the analyses, unless the defect dimensions have been verified using in situ direct measurements.
                (2) The analyses performed in accordance with this section must utilize pipe and material properties that are documented in traceable, verifiable, and complete records. If documented data required for any analysis is not available, an operator must obtain the undocumented data through § 192.607. Until documented material properties are available, the operator shall use conservative assumptions as follows:
                (i) Material toughness. An operator must use one of the following for material toughness:
                (A) Charpy v-notch toughness values from comparable pipe with known properties of the same vintage and from the same steel and pipe manufacturer;
                (B) A conservative Charpy v-notch toughness value to determine the toughness based upon the ongoing material properties verification process specified in § 192.607;
                (C) If the pipeline segment does not have a history of reportable incidents caused by cracking or crack-like defects, maximum Charpy v-notch toughness values of 13.0 ft.-lbs. for body cracks and 4.0 ft.-lbs. for cold weld, lack of fusion, and selective seam weld corrosion defects;

                (D) If the pipeline segment has a history of reportable incidents caused by cracking or crack-like defects, maximum Charpy v-notch toughness values of 5.0 ft.-lbs. for body cracks and 1.0 ft.-lbs. for cold weld, lack of fusion, and selective seam weld corrosion; or
                
                (E) Other appropriate values that an operator demonstrates can provide conservative Charpy v-notch toughness values of crack-related conditions of the pipeline segment. Operators using an assumed Charpy v-notch toughness value must notify PHMSA in advance in accordance with § 192.18 and include in the notification the bases for demonstrating that the Charpy v-notch toughness values proposed are appropriate and conservative for use in analysis of crack-related conditions.
                (ii) Material strength. An operator must assume one of the following for material strength:
                (A) Grade A pipe (30,000 psi), or
                (B) The specified minimum yield strength that is the basis for the current maximum allowable operating pressure.
                (iii) Pipe dimensions and other data. Until pipe wall thickness, diameter, or other data are determined and documented in accordance with § 192.607, the operator must use values upon which the current MAOP is based.
                (f) Review. Analyses conducted in accordance with this section must be reviewed and confirmed by a subject matter expert.
                (g) Records. An operator must keep for the life of the pipeline records of the investigations, analyses, and other actions taken in accordance with the requirements of this section. Records must document justifications, deviations, and determinations made for the following, as applicable:
                (1) The technical approach used for the analysis;
                (2) All data used and analyzed;
                (3) Pipe and weld properties;

                (9) Pressure test data and results;
                (10) In-the-ditch assessments;
                (11) All measurement tool, assessment, and evaluation accuracy specifications and tolerances used in technical and operational results;

                68 FR 69817, Dec. 15, 2003, unless otherwise noted.
              
              
                § 192.901
                What do the regulations in this subpart cover?
                This subpart prescribes minimum requirements for an integrity management program on any gas transmission pipeline covered under this part. For gas transmission pipelines constructed of plastic, only the requirements in §§ 192.917, 192.921, 192.935 and 192.937 apply.
              
              
                § 192.903
                What definitions apply to this subpart?
                The following definitions apply to this subpart:
                
                  Assessment is the use of testing techniques as allowed in this subpart to ascertain the condition of a covered pipeline segment.
                
                  Confirmatory direct assessment is an integrity assessment method using more focused application of the principles and techniques of direct assessment to identify internal and external corrosion in a covered transmission pipeline segment.
                
                  Covered segment or covered pipeline segment means a segment of gas transmission pipeline located in a high consequence area. The terms gas and transmission line are defined in § 192.3.
                
                  Direct assessment is an integrity assessment method that utilizes a process to evaluate certain threats (i.e., external corrosion, internal corrosion and stress corrosion cracking) to a covered pipeline segment's integrity. The process includes the gathering and integration of risk factor data, indirect examination or analysis to identify areas of suspected corrosion, direct examination of the pipeline in these areas, and post assessment evaluation.
                
                  High consequence area means an area established by one of the methods described in paragraphs (1) or (2) as follows:
                (1) An area defined as—
                (i) A Class 3 location under § 192.5; or
                (ii) A Class 4 location under § 192.5; or
                (iii) Any area in a Class 1 or Class 2 location where the potential impact radius is greater than 660 feet (200 meters), and the area within a potential impact circle contains 20 or more buildings intended for human occupancy; or
                (iv) Any area in a Class 1 or Class 2 location where the potential impact circle contains an identified site.
                (2) The area within a potential impact circle containing—
                (i) 20 or more buildings intended for human occupancy, unless the exception in paragraph (4) applies; or
                (ii) An identified site.
                (3) Where a potential impact circle is calculated under either method (1) or (2) to establish a high consequence area, the length of the high consequence area extends axially along the length of the pipeline from the outermost edge of the first potential impact circle that contains either an identified site or 20 or more buildings intended for human occupancy to the outermost edge of the last contiguous potential impact circle that contains either an identified site or 20 or more buildings intended for human occupancy. (See figure E.I.A. in appendix E.)

                (4) If in identifying a high consequence area under paragraph (1)(iii) of this definition or paragraph (2)(i) of this definition, the radius of the potential impact circle is greater than 660 feet (200 meters), the operator may identify a high consequence area based on a prorated number of buildings intended for human occupancy with a distance of 660 feet (200 meters) from the centerline of the pipeline until December 17, 2006. If an operator chooses this approach, the operator must prorate the number of buildings intended for human occupancy based on the ratio of an area with a radius of 660 feet (200 meters) to the area of the potential impact circle (i.e., the prorated number of buildings intended for human occupancy is equal to 20 × (660 feet) [or 200 meters]/potential impact radius in feet [or meters] 2).
                
                
                  Identified site means each of the following areas:
                (a) An outside area or open structure that is occupied by twenty (20) or more persons on at least 50 days in any twelve (12)-month period. (The days need not be consecutive.) Examples include but are not limited to, beaches, playgrounds, recreational facilities, camping grounds, outdoor theaters, stadiums, recreational areas near a body of water, or areas outside a rural building such as a religious facility; or
                (b) A building that is occupied by twenty (20) or more persons on at least five (5) days a week for ten (10) weeks in any twelve (12)-month period. (The days and weeks need not be consecutive.) Examples include, but are not limited to, religious facilities, office buildings, community centers, general stores, 4-H facilities, or roller skating rinks; or
                (c) A facility occupied by persons who are confined, are of impaired mobility, or would be difficult to evacuate. Examples include but are not limited to hospitals, prisons, schools, day-care facilities, retirement facilities or assisted-living facilities.
                
                  Potential impact circle is a circle of radius equal to the potential impact radius (PIR).
                
                  Potential impact radius (PIR) means the radius of a circle within which the potential failure of a pipeline could have significant impact on people or property. PIR is determined by the formula r = 0.69* (square root of (p*d 2)), where ‘r’ is the radius of a circular area in feet surrounding the point of failure, ‘p’ is the maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) in the pipeline segment in pounds per square inch and ‘d’ is the nominal diameter of the pipeline in inches.
                
                
                  Note:

                  0.69 is the factor for natural gas. This number will vary for other gases depending upon their heat of combustion. An operator transporting gas other than natural gas must use section 3.2 of ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) to calculate the impact radius formula.
                
                
                
                  Remediation is a repair or mitigation activity an operator takes on a covered segment to limit or reduce the probability of an undesired event occurring or the expected consequences from the event.

                § 192.905
                How does an operator identify a high consequence area?
                (a) General. To determine which segments of an operator's transmission pipeline system are covered by this subpart, an operator must identify the high consequence areas. An operator must use method (1) or (2) from the definition in § 192.903 to identify a high consequence area. An operator may apply one method to its entire pipeline system, or an operator may apply one method to individual portions of the pipeline system. An operator must describe in its integrity management program which method it is applying to each portion of the operator's pipeline system. The description must include the potential impact radius when utilized to establish a high consequence area. (See appendix E.I. for guidance on identifying high consequence areas.)
                (b)(1) Identified sites. An operator must identify an identified site, for purposes of this subpart, from information the operator has obtained from routine operation and maintenance activities and from public officials with safety or emergency response or planning responsibilities who indicate to the operator that they know of locations that meet the identified site criteria. These public officials could include officials on a local emergency planning commission or relevant Native American tribal officials.
                (2) If a public official with safety or emergency response or planning responsibilities informs an operator that it does not have the information to identify an identified site, the operator must use one of the following sources, as appropriate, to identify these sites.
                (i) Visible marking (e.g., a sign); or
                (ii) The site is licensed or registered by a Federal, State, or local government agency; or

                (iii) The site is on a list (including a list on an internet web site) or map maintained by or available from a Federal, State, or local government agency and available to the general public.
                (c) Newly identified areas. When an operator has information that the area around a pipeline segment not previously identified as a high consequence area could satisfy any of the definitions in § 192.903, the operator must complete the evaluation using method (1) or (2). If the segment is determined to meet the definition as a high consequence area, it must be incorporated into the operator's baseline assessment plan as a high consequence area within one year from the date the area is identified.
              
              
                § 192.907
                What must an operator do to implement this subpart?
                (a) General. No later than December 17, 2004, an operator of a covered pipeline segment must develop and follow a written integrity management program that contains all the elements described in § 192.911 and that addresses the risks on each covered transmission pipeline segment. The initial integrity management program must consist, at a minimum, of a framework that describes the process for implementing each program element, how relevant decisions will be made and by whom, a time line for completing the work to implement the program element, and how information gained from experience will be continuously incorporated into the program. The framework will evolve into a more detailed and comprehensive program. An operator must make continual improvements to the program.
                (b) Implementation Standards. In carrying out this subpart, an operator must follow the requirements of this subpart and of ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) and its appendices, where specified. An operator may follow an equivalent standard or practice only when the operator demonstrates the alternative standard or practice provides an equivalent level of safety to the public and property. In the event of a conflict between this subpart and ASME/ANSI B31.8S, the requirements in this subpart control.
              
              
                § 192.909
                How can an operator change its integrity management program?
                (a) General. An operator must document any change to its program and the reasons for the change before implementing the change.
                (b) Notification. An operator must notify OPS, in accordance with § 192.949, of any change to the program that may substantially affect the program's implementation or may significantly modify the program or schedule for carrying out the program elements. An operator must also notify a State or local pipeline safety authority when either a covered segment is located in a State where OPS has an interstate agent agreement, or an intrastate covered segment is regulated by that State. An operator must provide the notification within 30 days after adopting this type of change into its program.

                      (b) Notification. An operator must notify OPS, in accordance with § 192.18, of any change to the program that may substantially affect the program's implementation or may significantly modify the program or schedule for carrying out the program elements. An operator must provide notification within 30 days after adopting this type of change into its program.
                    
                  
                
              
              
                § 192.911
                What are the elements of an integrity management program?

                An operator's initial integrity management program begins with a framework (see § 192.907) and evolves into a more detailed and comprehensive integrity management program, as information is gained and incorporated into the program. An operator must make continual improvements to its program. The initial program framework and subsequent program must, at minimum, contain the following elements. (When indicated, refer to ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see
                  § 192.7) for more detailed information on the listed element.)

                (c) An identification of threats to each covered pipeline segment, which must include data integration and a risk assessment. An operator must use the threat identification and risk assessment to prioritize covered segments for assessment (§ 192.917) and to evaluate the merits of additional preventive and mitigative measures (§ 192.935) for each covered segment.
                (d) A direct assessment plan, if applicable, meeting the requirements of § 192.923, and depending on the threat assessed, of §§ 192.925, 192.927, or 192.929.
                (e) Provisions meeting the requirements of § 192.933 for remediating conditions found during an integrity assessment.
                (f) A process for continual evaluation and assessment meeting the requirements of § 192.937.
                (g) If applicable, a plan for confirmatory direct assessment meeting the requirements of § 192.931.
                (h) Provisions meeting the requirements of § 192.935 for adding preventive and mitigative measures to protect the high consequence area.

                § 192.913
                When may an operator deviate its program from certain requirements of this subpart?
                (a) General. ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) provides the essential features of a performance-based or a prescriptive integrity management program. An operator that uses a performance-based approach that satisfies the requirements for exceptional performance in paragraph (b) of this section may deviate from certain requirements in this subpart, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
                (b) Exceptional performance. An operator must be able to demonstrate the exceptional performance of its integrity management program through the following actions.
                (1) To deviate from any of the requirements set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, an operator must have a performance-based integrity management program that meets or exceed the performance-based requirements of ASME/ANSI B31.8S and includes, at a minimum, the following elements—
                (i) A comprehensive process for risk analysis;
                (ii) All risk factor data used to support the program;
                (iii) A comprehensive data integration process;

                (iv) A procedure for applying lessons learned from assessment of covered pipeline segments to pipeline segments not covered by this subpart;
                
                (v) A procedure for evaluating every incident, including its cause, within the operator's sector of the pipeline industry for implications both to the operator's pipeline system and to the operator's integrity management program;
                (vi) A performance matrix that demonstrates the program has been effective in ensuring the integrity of the covered segments by controlling the identified threats to the covered segments;

                (vii) Semi-annual performance measures beyond those required in § 192.945 that are part of the operator's performance plan. (See § 192.911(i).) An operator must submit these measures, by electronic or other means, on a semi-annual frequency to OPS in accordance with § 192.951; and
                (viii) An analysis that supports the desired integrity reassessment interval and the remediation methods to be used for all covered segments.
                (2) In addition to the requirements for the performance-based plan, an operator must—
                (i) Have completed at least two integrity assessments on each covered pipeline segment the operator is including under the performance-based approach, and be able to demonstrate that each assessment effectively addressed the identified threats on the covered segment.
                (ii) Remediate all anomalies identified in the more recent assessment according to the requirements in § 192.933, and incorporate the results and lessons learned from the more recent assessment into the operator's data integration and risk assessment.
                (c) Deviation. Once an operator has demonstrated that it has satisfied the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the operator may deviate from the prescriptive requirements of ASME/ANSI B31.8S and of this subpart only in the following instances.
                (1) The time frame for reassessment as provided in § 192.939 except that reassessment by some method allowed under this subpart (e.g., confirmatory direct assessment) must be carried out at intervals no longer than seven years;
                (2) The time frame for remediation as provided in § 192.933 if the operator demonstrates the time frame will not jeopardize the safety of the covered segment.

                § 192.915
                What knowledge and training must personnel have to carry out an integrity management program?
                (a) Supervisory personnel. The integrity management program must provide that each supervisor whose responsibilities relate to the integrity management program possesses and maintains a thorough knowledge of the integrity management program and of the elements for which the supervisor is responsible. The program must provide that any person who qualifies as a supervisor for the integrity management program has appropriate training or experience in the area for which the person is responsible.
                (b) Persons who carry out assessments and evaluate assessment results. The integrity management program must provide criteria for the qualification of any person—
                (1) Who conducts an integrity assessment allowed under this subpart; or
                (2) Who reviews and analyzes the results from an integrity assessment and evaluation; or
                (3) Who makes decisions on actions to be taken based on these assessments.
                (c) Persons responsible for preventive and mitigative measures. The integrity management program must provide criteria for the qualification of any person—
                (1) Who implements preventive and mitigative measures to carry out this subpart, including the marking and locating of buried structures; or
                (2) Who directly supervises excavation work carried out in conjunction with an integrity assessment.
              
              
                § 192.917
                How does an operator identify potential threats to pipeline integrity and use the threat identification in its integrity program?
                (a) Threat identification. An operator must identify and evaluate all potential threats to each covered pipeline segment. Potential threats that an operator must consider include, but are not limited to, the threats listed in ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), section 2, which are grouped under the following four categories:
                (1) Time dependent threats such as internal corrosion, external corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking;
                (2) Static or resident threats, such as fabrication or construction defects;
                (3) Time independent threats such as third party damage and outside force damage; and
                (4) Human error.
                (b) Data gathering and integration. To identify and evaluate the potential threats to a covered pipeline segment, an operator must gather and integrate existing data and information on the entire pipeline that could be relevant to the covered segment. In performing this data gathering and integration, an operator must follow the requirements in ASME/ANSI B31.8S, section 4. At a minimum, an operator must gather and evaluate the set of data specified in Appendix A to ASME/ANSI B31.8S, and consider both on the covered segment and similar non-covered segments, past incident history, corrosion control records, continuing surveillance records, patrolling records, maintenance history, internal inspection records and all other conditions specific to each pipeline.
                (c) Risk assessment. An operator must conduct a risk assessment that follows ASME/ANSI B31.8S, section 5, and considers the identified threats for each covered segment. An operator must use the risk assessment to prioritize the covered segments for the baseline and continual reassessments (§§ 192.919, 192.921, 192.937), and to determine what additional preventive and mitigative measures are needed (§ 192.935) for the covered segment.
                (d) Plastic transmission pipeline. An operator of a plastic transmission pipeline must assess the threats to each covered segment using the information in sections 4 and 5 of ASME B31.8S, and consider any threats unique to the integrity of plastic pipe.
                (e) Actions to address particular threats. If an operator identifies any of the following threats, the operator must take the following actions to address the threat.
                (1) Third party damage. An operator must utilize the data integration required in paragraph (b) of this section and ASME/ANSI B31.8S, Appendix A7 to determine the susceptibility of each covered segment to the threat of third party damage. If an operator identifies the threat of third party damage, the operator must implement comprehensive additional preventive measures in accordance with § 192.935 and monitor the effectiveness of the preventive measures. If, in conducting a baseline assessment under § 192.921, or a reassessment under § 192.937, an operator uses an internal inspection tool or external corrosion direct assessment, the operator must integrate data from these assessments with data related to any encroachment or foreign line crossing on the covered segment, to define where potential indications of third party damage may exist in the covered segment.
                An operator must also have procedures in its integrity management program addressing actions it will take to respond to findings from this data integration.
                (2) Cyclic fatigue. An operator must evaluate whether cyclic fatigue or other loading condition (including ground movement, suspension bridge condition) could lead to a failure of a deformation, including a dent or gouge, or other defect in the covered segment. An evaluation must assume the presence of threats in the covered segment that could be exacerbated by cyclic fatigue. An operator must use the results from the evaluation together with the criteria used to evaluate the significance of this threat to the covered segment to prioritize the integrity baseline assessment or reassessment.
                (3) Manufacturing and construction defects. If an operator identifies the threat of manufacturing and construction defects (including seam defects) in the covered segment, an operator must analyze the covered segment to determine the risk of failure from these defects. The analysis must consider the results of prior assessments on the covered segment. An operator may consider manufacturing and construction related defects to be stable defects if the operating pressure on the covered segment has not increased over the maximum operating pressure experienced during the five years preceding identification of the high consequence area. If any of the following changes occur in the covered segment, an operator must prioritize the covered segment as a high risk segment for the baseline assessment or a subsequent reassessment.
                (i) Operating pressure increases above the maximum operating pressure experienced during the preceding five years;
                (ii) MAOP increases; or
                (iii) The stresses leading to cyclic fatigue increase.
                (4) ERW pipe. If a covered pipeline segment contains low frequency electric resistance welded pipe (ERW), lap welded pipe or other pipe that satisfies the conditions specified in ASME/ANSI B31.8S, Appendices A4.3 and A4.4, and any covered or noncovered segment in the pipeline system with such pipe has experienced seam failure, or operating pressure on the covered segment has increased over the maximum operating pressure experienced during the preceding five years, an operator must select an assessment technology or technologies with a proven application capable of assessing seam integrity and seam corrosion anomalies. The operator must prioritize the covered segment as a high risk segment for the baseline assessment or a subsequent reassessment.
                (5) Corrosion. If an operator identifies corrosion on a covered pipeline segment that could adversely affect the integrity of the line (conditions specified in § 192.933), the operator must evaluate and remediate, as necessary, all pipeline segments (both covered and non-covered) with similar material coating and environmental characteristics. An operator must establish a schedule for evaluating and remediating, as necessary, the similar segments that is consistent with the operator's established operating and maintenance procedures under part 192 for testing and repair.

                § 192.917, Nt.
                
                  Effective Date Note:
                  At 84 FR 52253, Oct. 1, 2019, § 192.917 was amended by revising paragraphs (a)(3) and (e)(2) through (4), and adding paragraph (e)(6), effective July 1, 2020. For the convenience of the user, the added and revised text is set forth as follows:
                  
                    
                      § 192.917
                      How does an operator identify potential threats to pipeline integrity and use the threat identification in its integrity program?
                      (a) * * *
                      (3) Time independent threats such as third party damage, mechanical damage, incorrect operational procedure, weather related and outside force damage to include consideration of seismicity, geology, and soil stability of the area; and
                      
                      (e) * * *
                      (2) Cyclic fatigue. An operator must analyze and account for whether cyclic fatigue or other loading conditions (including ground movement, and suspension bridge condition) could lead to a failure of a deformation, including a dent or gouge, crack, or other defect in the covered segment. The analysis must assume the presence of threats in the covered segment that could be exacerbated by cyclic fatigue. An operator must use the results from the analysis together with the criteria used to determine the significance of the threat(s) to the covered segment to prioritize the integrity baseline assessment or reassessment. Failure stress pressure and crack growth analysis of cracks and crack-like defects must be conducted in accordance with § 192.712. An operator must monitor operating pressure cycles and periodically, but at least every 7 calendar years, with intervals not to exceed 90 months, determine if the cyclic fatigue analysis remains valid or if the cyclic fatigue analysis must be revised based on changes to operating pressure cycles or other loading conditions.
                      (3) Manufacturing and construction defects. An operator must analyze the covered segment to determine and account for the risk of failure from manufacturing and construction defects (including seam defects) in the covered segment. The analysis must account for the results of prior assessments on the covered segment. An operator may consider manufacturing and construction related defects to be stable defects only if the covered segment has been subjected to hydrostatic pressure testing satisfying the criteria of subpart J of at least 1.25 times MAOP, and the covered segment has not experienced a reportable incident attributed to a manufacturing or construction defect since the date of the most recent subpart J pressure test. If any of the following changes occur in the covered segment, an operator must prioritize the covered segment as a high-risk segment for the baseline assessment or a subsequent reassessment.

                      (i) The pipeline segment has experienced a reportable incident, as defined in § 191.3, since its most recent successful subpart J pressure test, due to an original manufacturing-related defect, or a construction-, installation-, or fabrication-related defect;
                      (ii) MAOP increases; or
                      (iii) The stresses leading to cyclic fatigue increase.
                      (4) Electric Resistance Welded (ERW) pipe. If a covered pipeline segment contains low frequency ERW pipe, lap welded pipe, pipe with longitudinal joint factor less than 1.0 as defined in § 192.113, or other pipe that satisfies the conditions specified in ASME/ANSI B31.8S, Appendices A4.3 and A4.4, and any covered or non-covered segment in the pipeline system with such pipe has experienced seam failure (including seam cracking and selective seam weld corrosion), or operating pressure on the covered segment has increased over the maximum operating pressure experienced during the preceding 5 years (including abnormal operation as defined in § 192.605(c)), or MAOP has been increased, an operator must select an assessment technology or technologies with a proven application capable of assessing seam integrity and seam corrosion anomalies. The operator must prioritize the covered segment as a high-risk segment for the baseline assessment or a subsequent reassessment. Pipe with seam cracks must be evaluated using fracture mechanics modeling for failure stress pressures and cyclic fatigue crack growth analysis to estimate the remaining life of the pipe in accordance with § 192.712.
                      
                      (6) Cracks. If an operator identifies any crack or crack-like defect (e.g., stress corrosion cracking or other environmentally assisted cracking, seam defects, selective seam weld corrosion, girth weld cracks, hook cracks, and fatigue cracks) on a covered pipeline segment that could adversely affect the integrity of the pipeline, the operator must evaluate, and remediate, as necessary, all pipeline segments (both covered and non-covered) with similar characteristics associated with the crack or crack-like defect. Similar characteristics may include operating and maintenance histories, material properties, and environmental characteristics. An operator must establish a schedule for evaluating, and remediating, as necessary, the similar pipeline segments that is consistent with the operator's established operating and maintenance procedures under this part for testing and repair.
                    
                  
                
              
              
                § 192.919
                What must be in the baseline assessment plan?
                An operator must include each of the following elements in its written baseline assessment plan:

                (a) Identification of the potential threats to each covered pipeline segment and the information supporting the threat identification. (See § 192.917.);

                (b) The methods selected to assess the integrity of the line pipe, including an explanation of why the assessment method was selected to address the identified threats to each covered segment. The integrity assessment method an operator uses must be based on the threats identified to the covered segment. (See § 192.917.) More than one method may be required to address all the threats to the covered pipeline segment;
                (c) A schedule for completing the integrity assessment of all covered segments, including risk factors considered in establishing the assessment schedule;
                (d) If applicable, a direct assessment plan that meets the requirements of §§ 192.923, and depending on the threat to be addressed, of § 192.925, § 192.927, or § 192.929; and
                (e) A procedure to ensure that the baseline assessment is being conducted in a manner that minimizes environmental and safety risks.
              
              
                § 192.921
                How is the baseline assessment to be conducted?
                (a) Assessment methods. An operator must assess the integrity of the line pipe in each covered segment by applying one or more of the following methods depending on the threats to which the covered segment is susceptible. An operator must select the method or methods best suited to address the threats identified to the covered segment (See § 192.917).

                (1) Internal inspection tool or tools capable of detecting corrosion, and any other threats to which the covered segment is susceptible. An operator must follow ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), section 6.2 in selecting the appropriate internal inspection tools for the covered segment.

                (2) Pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart J of this part. An operator must use the test pressures specified in Table 3 of section 5 of ASME/ANSI B31.8S, to justify an extended reassessment interval in accordance with § 192.939.
                (3) Direct assessment to address threats of external corrosion, internal corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking. An operator must conduct the direct assessment in accordance with the requirements listed in § 192.923 and with, as applicable, the requirements specified in §§ 192.925, 192.927 or 192.929;
                (4) Other technology that an operator demonstrates can provide an equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe. An operator choosing this option must notify the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) 180 days before conducting the assessment, in accordance with § 192.949. An operator must also notify a State or local pipeline safety authority when either a covered segment is located in a State where OPS has an interstate agent agreement, or an intrastate covered segment is regulated by that State.
                (b) Prioritizing segments. An operator must prioritize the covered pipeline segments for the baseline assessment according to a risk analysis that considers the potential threats to each covered segment. The risk analysis must comply with the requirements in § 192.917.
                (c) Assessment for particular threats. In choosing an assessment method for the baseline assessment of each covered segment, an operator must take the actions required in § 192.917(e) to address particular threats that it has identified.
                (d) Time period. An operator must prioritize all the covered segments for assessment in accordance with § 192.917 (c) and paragraph (b) of this section. An operator must assess at least 50% of the covered segments beginning with the highest risk segments, by December 17, 2007. An operator must complete the baseline assessment of all covered segments by December 17, 2012.
                (e) Prior assessment. An operator may use a prior integrity assessment conducted before December 17, 2002 as a baseline assessment for the covered segment, if the integrity assessment meets the baseline requirements in this subpart and subsequent remedial actions to address the conditions listed in § 192.933 have been carried out. In addition, if an operator uses this prior assessment as its baseline assessment, the operator must reassess the line pipe in the covered segment according to the requirements of § 192.937 and § 192.939.
                (f) Newly identified areas. When an operator identifies a new high consequence area (see § 192.905), an operator must complete the baseline assessment of the line pipe in the newly identified high consequence area within ten (10) years from the date the area is identified.
                (g) Newly installed pipe. An operator must complete the baseline assessment of a newly-installed segment of pipe covered by this subpart within ten (10) years from the date the pipe is installed. An operator may conduct a pressure test in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, to satisfy the requirement for a baseline assessment.
                (h) Plastic transmission pipeline. If the threat analysis required in § 192.917(d) on a plastic transmission pipeline indicates that a covered segment is susceptible to failure from causes other than third-party damage, an operator must conduct a baseline assessment of the segment in accordance with the requirements of this section and of § 192.917. The operator must justify the use of an alternative assessment method that will address the identified threats to the covered segment.

                  At 84 FR 52253, Oct. 1, 2019, § 192.921 was amended by revising paragraph (a) and adding paragraph (i), effective July 1, 2020. For the convenience of the user, the added and revised text is set forth as follows:
                  
                    
                      § 192.921
                      How is the baseline assessment to be conducted?
                      (a) Assessment methods. An operator must assess the integrity of the line pipe in each covered segment by applying one or more of the following methods for each threat to which the covered segment is susceptible. An operator must select the method or methods best suited to address the threats identified to the covered segment (See § 192.917).

                      (1) Internal inspection tool or tools capable of detecting those threats to which the pipeline is susceptible. The use of internal inspection tools is appropriate for threats such as corrosion, deformation and mechanical damage (including dents, gouges and grooves), material cracking and crack-like defects (e.g., stress corrosion cracking, selective seam weld corrosion, environmentally assisted cracking, and girth weld cracks), hard spots with cracking, and any other threats to which the covered segment is susceptible. When performing an assessment using an in-line inspection tool, an operator must comply with § 192.493. In addition, an operator must analyze and account for uncertainties in reported results (e.g., tool tolerance, detection threshold, probability of detection, probability of identification, sizing accuracy, conservative anomaly interaction criteria, location accuracy, anomaly findings, and unity chart plots or equivalent for determining uncertainties and verifying actual tool performance) in identifying and characterizing anomalies;

                      (2) Pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart J of this part. The use of subpart J pressure testing is appropriate for threats such as internal corrosion; external corrosion and other environmentally assisted corrosion mechanisms; manufacturing and related defects threats, including defective pipe and pipe seams; stress corrosion cracking; selective seam weld corrosion; dents; and other forms of mechanical damage. An operator must use the test pressures specified in Table 3 of section 5 of ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) to justify an extended reassessment interval in accordance with § 192.939.
                      (3) Spike hydrostatic pressure test conducted in accordance with § 192.506. The use of spike hydrostatic pressure testing is appropriate for time-dependent threats such as stress corrosion cracking; selective seam weld corrosion; manufacturing and related defects, including defective pipe and pipe seams; and other forms of defect or damage involving cracks or crack-like defects;
                      (4) Excavation and in situ direct examination by means of visual examination, direct measurement, and recorded non-destructive examination results and data needed to assess all threats. Based upon the threat assessed, examples of appropriate non-destructive examination methods include ultrasonic testing (UT), phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT), inverse wave field extrapolation (IWEX), radiography, and magnetic particle inspection (MPI);
                      (5) Guided wave ultrasonic testing (GWUT) as described in Appendix F. The use of GWUT is appropriate for internal and external pipe wall loss;
                      (6) Direct assessment to address threats of external corrosion, internal corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking. The use of direct assessment to address threats of external corrosion, internal corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking is allowed only if appropriate for the threat and the pipeline segment being assessed. Use of direct assessment for threats other than the threat for which the direct assessment method is suitable is not allowed. An operator must conduct the direct assessment in accordance with the requirements listed in § 192.923 and with the applicable requirements specified in §§ 192.925, 192.927 and 192.929; or
                      (7) Other technology that an operator demonstrates can provide an equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe for each of the threats to which the pipeline is susceptible. An operator must notify PHMSA in advance of using the other technology in accordance with § 192.18.
                      
                      (i) Baseline assessments for pipeline segments with a reconfirmed MAOP. An integrity assessment conducted in accordance with the requirements of § 192.624(c) may be used as a baseline assessment under this section.
                    
                  
                
              
              
                § 192.923
                How is direct assessment used and for what threats?
                (a) General. An operator may use direct assessment either as a primary assessment method or as a supplement to the other assessment methods allowed under this subpart. An operator may only use direct assessment as the primary assessment method to address the identified threats of external corrosion (EC), internal corrosion (IC), and stress corrosion cracking (SCC).
                (b) Primary method. An operator using direct assessment as a primary assessment method must have a plan that complies with the requirements in—

                (1) Section 192.925 and ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) section 6.4, and NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) , if addressing external corrosion (EC).

                (2) Section 192.927 and ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), section 6.4, appendix B2, if addressing internal corrosion (IC).

                (3) Section 192.929 and ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), appendix A3, if addressing stress corrosion cracking (SCC).
                (c) Supplemental method. An operator using direct assessment as a supplemental assessment method for any applicable threat must have a plan that follows the requirements for confirmatory direct assessment in § 192.931.

                § 192.925
                What are the requirements for using External Corrosion Direct Assessment (ECDA)?
                (a) Definition. ECDA is a four-step process that combines preassessment, indirect inspection, direct examination, and post assessment to evaluate the threat of external corrosion to the integrity of a pipeline.
                (b) General requirements. An operator that uses direct assessment to assess the threat of external corrosion must follow the requirements in this section, in ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), section 6.4, and in NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7). An operator must develop and implement a direct assessment plan that has procedures addressing pre-assessment, indirect inspection, direct examination, and post assessment. If the ECDA detects pipeline coating damage, the operator must also integrate the data from the ECDA with other information from the data integration (§ 192.917(b)) to evaluate the covered segment for the threat of third party damage and to address the threat as required by § 192.917(e)(1).
                (1) Preassessment. In addition to the requirements in ASME/ANSI B31.8S section 6.4 and NACE SP0502, section 3, the plan's procedures for preassessment must include—
                (i) Provisions for applying more restrictive criteria when conducting ECDA for the first time on a covered segment; and
                (ii) The basis on which an operator selects at least two different, but complementary indirect assessment tools to assess each ECDA Region. If an operator utilizes an indirect inspection method that is not discussed in Appendix A of NACE SP0502, the operator must demonstrate the applicability, validation basis, equipment used, application procedure, and utilization of data for the inspection method.
                (2) Indirect inspection. In addition to the requirements in ASME/ANSI B31.8S, section 6.4 and in NACE SP0502, section 4, the plan's procedures for indirect inspection of the ECDA regions must include—
                (i) Provisions for applying more restrictive criteria when conducting ECDA for the first time on a covered segment;
                (ii) Criteria for identifying and documenting those indications that must be considered for excavation and direct examination. Minimum identification criteria include the known sensitivities of assessment tools, the procedures for using each tool, and the approach to be used for decreasing the physical spacing of indirect assessment tool readings when the presence of a defect is suspected;
                (iii) Criteria for defining the urgency of excavation and direct examination of each indication identified during the indirect examination. These criteria must specify how an operator will define the urgency of excavating the indication as immediate, scheduled or monitored; and
                (iv) Criteria for scheduling excavation of indications for each urgency level.
                (3) Direct examination. In addition to the requirements in ASME/ANSI B31.8S section 6.4 and NACE SP0502, section 5, the plan's procedures for direct examination of indications from the indirect examination must include—
                (i) Provisions for applying more restrictive criteria when conducting ECDA for the first time on a covered segment;
                (ii) Criteria for deciding what action should be taken if either:
                (A) Corrosion defects are discovered that exceed allowable limits (Section 5.5.2.2 of NACE SP0502), or
                (B) Root cause analysis reveals conditions for which ECDA is not suitable (Section 5.6.2 of NACE SP0502);
                (iii) Criteria and notification procedures for any changes in the ECDA Plan, including changes that affect the severity classification, the priority of direct examination, and the time frame for direct examination of indications; and
                (iv) Criteria that describe how and on what basis an operator will reclassify and reprioritize any of the provisions that are specified in section 5.9 of NACE SP0502.
                (4) Post assessment and continuing evaluation. In addition to the requirements in ASME/ANSI B31.8S section 6.4 and NACE SP0502, section 6, the plan's procedures for post assessment of the effectiveness of the ECDA process must include—
                
                (i) Measures for evaluating the long-term effectiveness of ECDA in addressing external corrosion in covered segments; and
                (ii) Criteria for evaluating whether conditions discovered by direct examination of indications in each ECDA region indicate a need for reassessment of the covered segment at an interval less than that specified in § 192.939. (See Appendix D of NACE SP0502.)

                § 192.927
                What are the requirements for using Internal Corrosion Direct Assessment (ICDA)?
                (a) Definition. Internal Corrosion Direct Assessment (ICDA) is a process an operator uses to identify areas along the pipeline where fluid or other electrolyte introduced during normal operation or by an upset condition may reside, and then focuses direct examination on the locations in covered segments where internal corrosion is most likely to exist. The process identifies the potential for internal corrosion caused by microorganisms, or fluid with CO2, O2, hydrogen sulfide or other contaminants present in the gas.
                (b) General requirements. An operator using direct assessment as an assessment method to address internal corrosion in a covered pipeline segment must follow the requirements in this section and in ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), section 6.4 and appendix B2. The ICDA process described in this section applies only for a segment of pipe transporting nominally dry natural gas, and not for a segment with electrolyte nominally present in the gas stream. If an operator uses ICDA to assess a covered segment operating with electrolyte present in the gas stream, the operator must develop a plan that demonstrates how it will conduct ICDA in the segment to effectively address internal corrosion, and must provide notification in accordance with § 192.921 (a)(4) or § 192.937(c)(4).
                (c) The ICDA plan. An operator must develop and follow an ICDA plan that provides for preassessment, identification of ICDA regions and excavation locations, detailed examination of pipe at excavation locations, and post-assessment evaluation and monitoring.
                (1) Preassessment. In the preassessment stage, an operator must gather and integrate data and information needed to evaluate the feasibility of ICDA for the covered segment, and to support use of a model to identify the locations along the pipe segment where electrolyte may accumulate, to identify ICDA regions, and to identify areas within the covered segment where liquids may potentially be entrained. This data and information includes, but is not limited to—
                (i) All data elements listed in appendix A2 of ASME/ANSI B31.8S;

                (ii) Information needed to support use of a model that an operator must use to identify areas along the pipeline where internal corrosion is most likely to occur. (See paragraph (a) of this section.) This information, includes, but is not limited to, location of all gas input and withdrawal points on the line; location of all low points on covered segments such as sags, drips, inclines, valves, manifolds, dead-legs, and traps; the elevation profile of the pipeline in sufficient detail that angles of inclination can be calculated for all pipe segments; and the diameter of the pipeline, and the range of expected gas velocities in the pipeline;
                (iii) Operating experience data that would indicate historic upsets in gas conditions, locations where these upsets have occurred, and potential damage resulting from these upset conditions; and
                (iv) Information on covered segments where cleaning pigs may not have been used or where cleaning pigs may deposit electrolytes.
                (2) ICDA region identification. An operator's plan must identify where all ICDA Regions are located in the transmission system, in which covered segments are located. An ICDA Region extends from the location where liquid may first enter the pipeline and encompasses the entire area along the pipeline where internal corrosion may occur and where further evaluation is needed. An ICDA Region may encompass one or more covered segments. In the identification process, an operator must use the model in GRI 02-0057, “Internal Corrosion Direct Assessment of Gas Transmission Pipelines—Methodology,” (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7). An operator may use another model if the operator demonstrates it is equivalent to the one shown in GRI 02-0057. A model must consider changes in pipe diameter, locations where gas enters a line (potential to introduce liquid) and locations down stream of gas draw-offs (where gas velocity is reduced) to define the critical pipe angle of inclination above which water film cannot be transported by the gas.
                (3) Identification of locations for excavation and direct examination. An operator's plan must identify the locations where internal corrosion is most likely in each ICDA region. In the location identification process, an operator must identify a minimum of two locations for excavation within each ICDA Region within a covered segment and must perform a direct examination for internal corrosion at each location, using ultrasonic thickness measurements, radiography, or other generally accepted measurement technique. One location must be the low point (e.g., sags, drips, valves, manifolds, dead-legs, traps) within the covered segment nearest to the beginning of the ICDA Region. The second location must be further downstream, within a covered segment, near the end of the ICDA Region. If corrosion exists at either location, the operator must—
                (i) Evaluate the severity of the defect (remaining strength) and remediate the defect in accordance with § 192.933;
                (ii) As part of the operator's current integrity assessment either perform additional excavations in each covered segment within the ICDA region, or use an alternative assessment method allowed by this subpart to assess the line pipe in each covered segment within the ICDA region for internal corrosion; and
                (iii) Evaluate the potential for internal corrosion in all pipeline segments (both covered and non-covered) in the operator's pipeline system with similar characteristics to the ICDA region containing the covered segment in which the corrosion was found, and as appropriate, remediate the conditions the operator finds in accordance with § 192.933.
                (4) Post-assessment evaluation and monitoring. An operator's plan must provide for evaluating the effectiveness of the ICDA process and continued monitoring of covered segments where internal corrosion has been identified. The evaluation and monitoring process includes—
                (i) Evaluating the effectiveness of ICDA as an assessment method for addressing internal corrosion and determining whether a covered segment should be reassessed at more frequent intervals than those specified in § 192.939. An operator must carry out this evaluation within a year of conducting an ICDA; and
                (ii) Continually monitoring each covered segment where internal corrosion has been identified using techniques such as coupons, UT sensors or electronic probes, periodically drawing off liquids at low points and chemically analyzing the liquids for the presence of corrosion products. An operator must base the frequency of the monitoring and liquid analysis on results from all integrity assessments that have been conducted in accordance with the requirements of this subpart, and risk factors specific to the covered segment. If an operator finds any evidence of corrosion products in the covered segment, the operator must take prompt action in accordance with one of the two following required actions and remediate the conditions the operator finds in accordance with § 192.933.
                (A) Conduct excavations of covered segments at locations downstream from where the electrolyte might have entered the pipe; or
                (B) Assess the covered segment using another integrity assessment method allowed by this subpart.
                (5) Other requirements. The ICDA plan must also include—
                (i) Criteria an operator will apply in making key decisions (e.g., ICDA feasibility, definition of ICDA Regions, conditions requiring excavation) in implementing each stage of the ICDA process;

                (ii) Provisions for applying more restrictive criteria when conducting ICDA for the first time on a covered segment and that become less stringent as the operator gains experience; and
                (iii) Provisions that analysis be carried out on the entire pipeline in which covered segments are present, except that application of the remediation criteria of § 192.933 may be limited to covered segments.
                [68 FR 69817, Dec. 15, 2003, as amended by Amdt. 192-95, 69 FR 18232, Apr. 6, 2004]
              
              
                § 192.929
                What are the requirements for using Direct Assessment for Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCCDA)?
                (a) Definition. Stress Corrosion Cracking Direct Assessment (SCCDA) is a process to assess a covered pipe segment for the presence of SCC primarily by systematically gathering and analyzing excavation data for pipe having similar operational characteristics and residing in a similar physical environment.
                (b) General requirements. An operator using direct assessment as an integrity assessment method to address stress corrosion cracking in a covered pipeline segment must have a plan that provides, at minimum, for—
                (1) Data gathering and integration. An operator's plan must provide for a systematic process to collect and evaluate data for all covered segments to identify whether the conditions for SCC are present and to prioritize the covered segments for assessment. This process must include gathering and evaluating data related to SCC at all sites an operator excavates during the conduct of its pipeline operations where the criteria in ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), appendix A3.3 indicate the potential for SCC. This data includes at minimum, the data specified in ASME/ANSI B31.8S, appendix A3.
                (2) Assessment method. The plan must provide that if conditions for SCC are identified in a covered segment, an operator must assess the covered segment using an integrity assessment method specified in ASME/ANSI B31.8S, appendix A3, and remediate the threat in accordance with ASME/ANSI B31.8S, appendix A3, section A3.4.
                [68 FR 69817, Dec. 15, 2003, as amended by Amdt. 192-95, 69 FR 18233, Apr. 6, 2004]
              
              
                § 192.931
                How may Confirmatory Direct Assessment (CDA) be used?
                An operator using the confirmatory direct assessment (CDA) method as allowed in § 192.937 must have a plan that meets the requirements of this section and of §§ 192.925 (ECDA) and § 192.927 (ICDA).
                (a) Threats. An operator may only use CDA on a covered segment to identify damage resulting from external corrosion or internal corrosion.
                (b) External corrosion plan. An operator's CDA plan for identifying external corrosion must comply with § 192.925 with the following exceptions.
                (1) The procedures for indirect examination may allow use of only one indirect examination tool suitable for the application.
                (2) The procedures for direct examination and remediation must provide that—
                (i) All immediate action indications must be excavated for each ECDA region; and
                (ii) At least one high risk indication that meets the criteria of scheduled action must be excavated in each ECDA region.
                (c) Internal corrosion plan. An operator's CDA plan for identifying internal corrosion must comply with § 192.927 except that the plan's procedures for identifying locations for excavation may require excavation of only one high risk location in each ICDA region.
                (d) Defects requiring near-term remediation. If an assessment carried out under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section reveals any defect requiring remediation prior to the next scheduled assessment, the operator must schedule the next assessment in accordance with NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), section 6.2 and 6.3. If the defect requires immediate remediation, then the operator must reduce pressure consistent with § 192.933 until the operator has completed reassessment using one of the assessment techniques allowed in § 192.937.
                [68 FR 69817, Dec. 15, 2003, as amended by Amdt. 192-114, 75 FR 48604, Aug. 11, 2010; Amdt. 192-119, 80 FR 178, Jan. 5, 2015]
              
              
                
                § 192.933
                What actions must be taken to address integrity issues?
                (a) General requirements. An operator must take prompt action to address all anomalous conditions the operator discovers through the integrity assessment. In addressing all conditions, an operator must evaluate all anomalous conditions and remediate those that could reduce a pipeline's integrity. An operator must be able to demonstrate that the remediation of the condition will ensure the condition is unlikely to pose a threat to the integrity of the pipeline until the next reassessment of the covered segment.
                (1) Temporary pressure reduction. If an operator is unable to respond within the time limits for certain conditions specified in this section, the operator must temporarily reduce the operating pressure of the pipeline or take other action that ensures the safety of the covered segment. An operator must determine any temporary reduction in operating pressure required by this section using ASME/ANSI B31G (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7); Pipeline Research Council, International, PR-3-805 (R-STRENG) (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7); or by reducing the operating pressure to a level not exceeding 80 percent of the level at the time the condition was discovered. An operator must notify PHMSA in accordance with § 192.949 if it cannot meet the schedule for evaluation and remediation required under paragraph (c) of this section and cannot provide safety through a temporary reduction in operating pressure or through another action. An operator must also notify a State pipeline safety authority when either a covered segment is located in a State where PHMSA has an interstate agent agreement or an intrastate covered segment is regulated by that State.
                (2) Long-term pressure reduction. When a pressure reduction exceeds 365 days, the operator must notify PHMSA under § 192.949 and explain the reasons for the remediation delay. This notice must include a technical justification that the continued pressure reduction will not jeopardize the integrity of the pipeline. The operator also must notify a State pipeline safety authority when either a covered segment is located in a State where PHMSA has an interstate agent agreement, or an intrastate covered segment is regulated by that State.
                (b) Discovery of condition. Discovery of a condition occurs when an operator has adequate information about a condition to determine that the condition presents a potential threat to the integrity of the pipeline. A condition that presents a potential threat includes, but is not limited to, those conditions that require remediation or monitoring listed under paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section. An operator must promptly, but no later than 180 days after conducting an integrity assessment, obtain sufficient information about a condition to make that determination, unless the operator demonstrates that the 180-day period is impracticable.
                (c) Schedule for evaluation and remediation. An operator must complete remediation of a condition according to a schedule prioritizing the conditions for evaluation and remediation. Unless a special requirement for remediating certain conditions applies, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, an operator must follow the schedule in ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), section 7, Figure 4. If an operator cannot meet the schedule for any condition, the operator must explain the reasons why it cannot meet the schedule and how the changed schedule will not jeopardize public safety.
                (d) Special requirements for scheduling remediation—(1) Immediate repair conditions. An operator's evaluation and remediation schedule must follow ASME/ANSI B31.8S, section 7 in providing for immediate repair conditions. To maintain safety, an operator must temporarily reduce operating pressure in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section or shut down the pipeline until the operator completes the repair of these conditions. An operator must treat the following conditions as immediate repair conditions:

                (i) A calculation of the remaining strength of the pipe shows a predicted failure pressure less than or equal to 1.1 times the maximum allowable operating pressure at the location of the anomaly. Suitable remaining strength calculation methods include ASME/ANSI B31G (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) , PRCI PR-3-805 (R-STRENG) (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), or an alternative equivalent method of remaining strength calculation.
                (ii) A dent that has any indication of metal loss, cracking or a stress riser.
                (iii) An indication or anomaly that in the judgment of the person designated by the operator to evaluate the assessment results requires immediate action.
                (2) One-year conditions. Except for conditions listed in paragraph (d)(1) and (d)(3) of this section, an operator must remediate any of the following within one year of discovery of the condition:
                (i) A smooth dent located between the 8 o'clock and 4 o'clock positions (upper 2/3 of the pipe) with a depth greater than 6% of the pipeline diameter (greater than 0.50 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than Nominal Pipe Size (NPS) 12).
                (ii) A dent with a depth greater than 2% of the pipeline's diameter (0.250 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS 12) that affects pipe curvature at a girth weld or at a longitudinal seam weld.
                (3) Monitored conditions. An operator does not have to schedule the following conditions for remediation, but must record and monitor the conditions during subsequent risk assessments and integrity assessments for any change that may require remediation:
                (i) A dent with a depth greater than 6% of the pipeline diameter (greater than 0.50 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS 12) located between the 4 o'clock position and the 8 o'clock position (bottom 1/3 of the pipe).
                (ii) A dent located between the 8 o'clock and 4 o'clock positions (upper 2/3 of the pipe) with a depth greater than 6% of the pipeline diameter (greater than 0.50 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than Nominal Pipe Size (NPS) 12), and engineering analyses of the dent demonstrate critical strain levels are not exceeded.
                (iii) A dent with a depth greater than 2% of the pipeline's diameter (0.250 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS 12) that affects pipe curvature at a girth weld or a longitudinal seam weld, and engineering analyses of the dent and girth or seam weld demonstrate critical strain levels are not exceeded. These analyses must consider weld properties.

                      (1) Temporary pressure reduction. If an operator is unable to respond within the time limits for certain conditions specified in this section, the operator must temporarily reduce the operating pressure of the pipeline or take other action that ensures the safety of the covered segment. An operator must determine any temporary reduction in operating pressure required by this section using ASME/ANSI B31G (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7); R-STRENG (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7); or by reducing the operating pressure to a level not exceeding 80 percent of the level at the time the condition was discovered. An operator must notify PHMSA in accordance with § 192.18 if it cannot meet the schedule for evaluation and remediation required under paragraph (c) of this section and cannot provide safety through a temporary reduction in operating pressure or through another action.
                      (2) Long-term pressure reduction. When a pressure reduction exceeds 365 days, an operator must notify PHMSA under § 192.18 and explain the reasons for the remediation delay. This notice must include a technical justification that the continued pressure reduction will not jeopardize the integrity of the pipeline.
                      
                    
                  
                
              
              
                § 192.935
                What additional preventive and mitigative measures must an operator take?
                (a) General requirements. An operator must take additional measures beyond those already required by Part 192 to prevent a pipeline failure and to mitigate the consequences of a pipeline failure in a high consequence area. An operator must base the additional measures on the threats the operator has identified to each pipeline segment. (See § 192.917) An operator must conduct, in accordance with one of the risk assessment approaches in ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), section 5, a risk analysis of its pipeline to identify additional measures to protect the high consequence area and enhance public safety. Such additional measures include, but are not limited to, installing Automatic Shut-off Valves or Remote Control Valves, installing computerized monitoring and leak detection systems, replacing pipe segments with pipe of heavier wall thickness, providing additional training to personnel on response procedures, conducting drills with local emergency responders and implementing additional inspection and maintenance programs.
                (b) Third party damage and outside force damage—
                (1) Third party damage. An operator must enhance its damage prevention program, as required under § 192.614 of this part, with respect to a covered segment to prevent and minimize the consequences of a release due to third party damage. Enhanced measures to an existing damage prevention program include, at a minimum—
                (i) Using qualified personnel (see § 192.915) for work an operator is conducting that could adversely affect the integrity of a covered segment, such as marking, locating, and direct supervision of known excavation work.
                (ii) Collecting in a central database information that is location specific on excavation damage that occurs in covered and non covered segments in the transmission system and the root cause analysis to support identification of targeted additional preventative and mitigative measures in the high consequence areas. This information must include recognized damage that is not required to be reported as an incident under part 191.
                (iii) Participating in one-call systems in locations where covered segments are present.

                (iv) Monitoring of excavations conducted on covered pipeline segments by pipeline personnel. If an operator finds physical evidence of encroachment involving excavation that the operator did not monitor near a covered segment, an operator must either excavate the area near the encroachment or conduct an above ground survey using methods defined in NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7). An operator must excavate, and remediate, in accordance with ANSI/ASME B31.8S and § 192.933 any indication of coating holidays or discontinuity warranting direct examination.
                (2) Outside force damage. If an operator determines that outside force (e.g., earth movement, floods, unstable suspension bridge) is a threat to the integrity of a covered segment, the operator must take measures to minimize the consequences to the covered segment from outside force damage. These measures include, but are not limited to, increasing the frequency of aerial, foot or other methods of patrols, adding external protection, reducing external stress, and relocating the line.
                (c) Automatic shut-off valves (ASV) or Remote control valves (RCV). If an operator determines, based on a risk analysis, that an ASV or RCV would be an efficient means of adding protection to a high consequence area in the event of a gas release, an operator must install the ASV or RCV. In making that determination, an operator must, at least, consider the following factors—swiftness of leak detection and pipe shutdown capabilities, the type of gas being transported, operating pressure, the rate of potential release, pipeline profile, the potential for ignition, and location of nearest response personnel.
                (d) Pipelines operating below 30% SMYS. An operator of a transmission pipeline operating below 30% SMYS located in a high consequence area must follow the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section. An operator of a transmission pipeline operating below 30% SMYS located in a Class 3 or Class 4 area but not in a high consequence area must follow the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.
                (1) Apply the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(iii) of this section to the pipeline; and

                (2) Either monitor excavations near the pipeline, or conduct patrols as required by § 192.705 of the pipeline at bi-monthly intervals. If an operator finds any indication of unreported construction activity, the operator must conduct a follow up investigation to determine if mechanical damage has occurred.
                (3) Perform semi-annual leak surveys (quarterly for unprotected pipelines or cathodically protected pipe where electrical surveys are impractical).
                (e) Plastic transmission pipeline. An operator of a plastic transmission pipeline must apply the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (b)(1)(iii) and (b)(1)(iv) of this section to the covered segments of the pipeline.

                      (2) Outside force damage. If an operator determines that outside force (e.g., earth movement, loading, longitudinal, or lateral forces, seismicity of the area, floods, unstable suspension bridge) is a threat to the integrity of a covered segment, the operator must take measures to minimize the consequences to the covered segment from outside force damage. These measures include increasing the frequency of aerial, foot or other methods of patrols; adding external protection; reducing external stress; relocating the line; or inline inspections with geospatial and deformation tools.
                      
                    
                  
                
              
              
                § 192.937
                What is a continual process of evaluation and assessment to maintain a pipeline's integrity?
                (a) General. After completing the baseline integrity assessment of a covered segment, an operator must continue to assess the line pipe of that segment at the intervals specified in § 192.939 and periodically evaluate the integrity of each covered pipeline segment as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. An operator must reassess a covered segment on which a prior assessment is credited as a baseline under § 192.921(e) by no later than December 17, 2009. An operator must reassess a covered segment on which a baseline assessment is conducted during the baseline period specified in § 192.921(d) by no later than seven years after the baseline assessment of that covered segment unless the evaluation under paragraph (b) of this section indicates earlier reassessment.
                (b) Evaluation. An operator must conduct a periodic evaluation as frequently as needed to assure the integrity of each covered segment. The periodic evaluation must be based on a data integration and risk assessment of the entire pipeline as specified in § 192.917. For plastic transmission pipelines, the periodic evaluation is based on the threat analysis specified in 192.917(d). For all other transmission pipelines, the evaluation must consider the past and present integrity assessment results, data integration and risk assessment information (§ 192.917), and decisions about remediation (§ 192.933) and additional preventive and mitigative actions (§ 192.935). An operator must use the results from this evaluation to identify the threats specific to each covered segment and the risk represented by these threats.
                (c) Assessment methods. In conducting the integrity reassessment, an operator must assess the integrity of the line pipe in the covered segment by any of the following methods as appropriate for the threats to which the covered segment is susceptible (see § 192.917), or by confirmatory direct assessment under the conditions specified in § 192.931.

                (1) Internal inspection tool or tools capable of detecting corrosion, and any other threats to which the covered segment is susceptible. An operator must follow ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), section 6.2 in selecting the appropriate internal inspection tools for the covered segment.

                (2) Pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart J of this part. An operator must use the test pressures specified in Table 3 of section 5 of ASME/ANSI B31.8S, to justify an extended reassessment interval in accordance with § 192.939.
                (3) Direct assessment to address threats of external corrosion, internal corrosion, or stress corrosion cracking. An operator must conduct the direct assessment in accordance with the requirements listed in § 192.923 and with as applicable, the requirements specified in §§ 192.925, 192.927 or 192.929;
                (4) Other technology that an operator demonstrates can provide an equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe. An operator choosing this option must notify the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) 180 days before conducting the assessment, in accordance with § 192.949. An operator must also notify a State or local pipeline safety authority when either a covered segment is located in a State where OPS has an interstate agent agreement, or an intrastate covered segment is regulated by that State.
                (5) Confirmatory direct assessment when used on a covered segment that is scheduled for reassessment at a period longer than seven years. An operator using this reassessment method must comply with § 192.931.

                  Effective Date Note:
                  At 84 FR 52254, Oct. 1, 2019, § 192.937 was amended by revising paragraph (c) and adding paragraph (d), effective July 1, 2020. For the convenience of the user, the added and revised text is set forth as follows:
                  
                    
                      § 192.937
                      What is a continual process of evaluation and assessment to maintain a pipeline's integrity?
                      
                      (c) Assessment methods. In conducting the integrity reassessment, an operator must assess the integrity of the line pipe in each covered segment by applying one or more of the following methods for each threat to which the covered segment is susceptible. An operator must select the method or methods best suited to address the threats identified on the covered segment (see § 192.917).
                      (1) Internal inspection tools. When performing an assessment using an in-line inspection tool, an operator must comply with the following requirements:
                      (i) Perform the in-line inspection in accordance with § 192.493;

                      (ii) Select a tool or combination of tools capable of detecting the threats to which the pipeline segment is susceptible such as corrosion, deformation and mechanical damage (e.g. dents, gouges and grooves), material cracking and crack-like defects (e.g. stress corrosion cracking, selective seam weld corrosion, environmentally assisted cracking, and girth weld cracks), hard spots with cracking, and any other threats to which the covered segment is susceptible; and

                      (iii) Analyze and account for uncertainties in reported results (e.g., tool tolerance, detection threshold, probability of detection, probability of identification, sizing accuracy, conservative anomaly interaction criteria, location accuracy, anomaly findings, and unity chart plots or equivalent for determining uncertainties and verifying actual tool performance) in identifying and characterizing anomalies.
                      (2) Pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart J of this part. The use of pressure testing is appropriate for threats such as: Internal corrosion; external corrosion and other environmentally assisted corrosion mechanisms; manufacturing and related defects threats, including defective pipe and pipe seams; stress corrosion cracking; selective seam weld corrosion; dents; and other forms of mechanical damage. An operator must use the test pressures specified in table 3 of section 5 of ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) to justify an extended reassessment interval in accordance with § 192.939.
                      (3) Spike hydrostatic pressure test in accordance with § 192.506. The use of spike hydrostatic pressure testing is appropriate for time-dependent threats such as: Stress corrosion cracking; selective seam weld corrosion; manufacturing and related defects, including defective pipe and pipe seams; and other forms of defect or damage involving cracks or crack-like defects;
                      (4) Excavation and in situ direct examination by means of visual examination, direct measurement, and recorded non-destructive examination results and data needed to assess all threats. Based upon the threat assessed, examples of appropriate non-destructive examination methods include ultrasonic testing (UT), phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT), inverse wave field extrapolation (IWEX), radiography, or magnetic particle inspection (MPI);
                      (5) Guided wave ultrasonic testing (GWUT) as described in Appendix F. The use of GWUT is appropriate for internal and external pipe wall loss;

                      (6) Direct assessment to address threats of external corrosion, internal corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking. The use of direct assessment to address threats of external corrosion, internal corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking is allowed only if appropriate for the threat and pipeline segment being assessed. Use of direct assessment for threats other than the threat for which the direct assessment method is suitable is not allowed. An operator must conduct the direct assessment in accordance with the requirements listed in § 192.923 and with the applicable requirements specified in §§ 192.925, 192.927, and 192.929;
                      (7) Other technology that an operator demonstrates can provide an equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe for each of the threats to which the pipeline is susceptible. An operator must notify PHMSA in advance of using the other technology in accordance with § 192.18; or
                      (8) Confirmatory direct assessment when used on a covered segment that is scheduled for reassessment at a period longer than 7 calendar years. An operator using this reassessment method must comply with § 192.931.
                      (d) MAOP reconfirmation assessments. An integrity assessment conducted in accordance with the requirements of § 192.624(c) may be used as a reassessment under this section.
                    
                  
                
              
              
                § 192.939
                What are the required reassessment intervals?
                An operator must comply with the following requirements in establishing the reassessment interval for the operator's covered pipeline segments.
                (a) Pipelines operating at or above 30% SMYS. An operator must establish a reassessment interval for each covered segment operating at or above 30% SMYS in accordance with the requirements of this section. The maximum reassessment interval by an allowable reassessment method is seven years. If an operator establishes a reassessment interval that is greater than seven years, the operator must, within the seven-year period, conduct a confirmatory direct assessment on the covered segment, and then conduct the follow-up reassessment at the interval the operator has established. A reassessment carried out using confirmatory direct assessment must be done in accordance with § 192.931. The table that follows this section sets forth the maximum allowed reassessment intervals.
                (1) Pressure test or internal inspection or other equivalent technology. An operator that uses pressure testing or internal inspection as an assessment method must establish the reassessment interval for a covered pipeline segment by—
                (i) Basing the interval on the identified threats for the covered segment (see § 192.917) and on the analysis of the results from the last integrity assessment and from the data integration and risk assessment required by § 192.917; or

                (ii) Using the intervals specified for different stress levels of pipeline (operating at or above 30% SMYS) listed in ASME B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), section 5, Table 3.
                (2) External Corrosion Direct Assessment. An operator that uses ECDA that meets the requirements of this subpart must determine the reassessment interval according to the requirements in paragraphs 6.2 and 6.3 of NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7).
                (3) Internal Corrosion or SCC Direct Assessment. An operator that uses ICDA or SCCDA in accordance with the requirements of this subpart must determine the reassessment interval according to the following method. However, the reassessment interval cannot exceed those specified for direct assessment in ASME/ANSI B31.8S, section 5, Table 3.
                (i) Determine the largest defect most likely to remain in the covered segment and the corrosion rate appropriate for the pipe, soil and protection conditions;
                (ii) Use the largest remaining defect as the size of the largest defect discovered in the SCC or ICDA segment; and
                (iii) Estimate the reassessment interval as half the time required for the largest defect to grow to a critical size.
                (b) Pipelines Operating Below 30% SMYS. An operator must establish a reassessment interval for each covered segment operating below 30% SMYS in accordance with the requirements of this section. The maximum reassessment interval by an allowable reassessment method is seven years. An operator must establish reassessment by at least one of the following—

                (1) Reassessment by pressure test, internal inspection or other equivalent technology following the requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section except that the stress level referenced in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section would be adjusted to reflect the lower operating stress level. If an established interval is more than seven years, the operator must conduct by the seventh year of the interval either a confirmatory direct assessment in accordance with § 192.931, or a low stress reassessment in accordance with § 192.941.
                (2) Reassessment by ECDA following the requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
                (3) Reassessment by ICDA or SCCDA following the requirements in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
                (4) Reassessment by confirmatory direct assessment at 7-year intervals in accordance with § 192.931, with reassessment by one of the methods listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section by year 20 of the interval.
                (5) Reassessment by the low stress assessment method at 7-year intervals in accordance with § 192.941 with reassessment by one of the methods listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section by year 20 of the interval.
                (6) The following table sets forth the maximum reassessment intervals. Also refer to Appendix E.II for guidance on Assessment Methods and Assessment Schedule for Transmission Pipelines Operating Below 30% SMYS.

                      What are the required reassessment intervals?
                      
                      (a) Pipelines operating at or above 30% SMYS. An operator must establish a reassessment interval for each covered segment operating at or above 30% SMYS in accordance with the requirements of this section. The maximum reassessment interval by an allowable reassessment method is 7 calendar years. Operators may request a 6-month extension of the 7-calendar-year reassessment interval if the operator submits written notice to OPS, in accordance with § 192.18, with sufficient justification of the need for the extension. If an operator establishes a reassessment interval that is greater than 7 calendar years, the operator must, within the 7-calendar-year period, conduct a confirmatory direct assessment on the covered segment, and then conduct the follow-up reassessment at the interval the operator has established. A reassessment carried out using confirmatory direct assessment must be done in accordance with § 192.931. The table that follows this section sets forth the maximum allowed reassessment intervals.
                      
                      (b) Pipelines Operating below 30% SMYS. An operator must establish a reassessment interval for each covered segment operating below 30% SMYS in accordance with the requirements of this section. The maximum reassessment interval by an allowable reassessment method is 7 calendar years. Operators may request a 6-month extension of the 7-calendar-year reassessment interval if the operator submits written notice to OPS in accordance with § 192.18. The notice must include sufficient justification of the need for the extension. An operator must establish reassessment by at least one of the following—

                      (1) Reassessment by pressure test, internal inspection or other equivalent technology following the requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section except that the stress level referenced in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section would be adjusted to reflect the lower operating stress level. If an established interval is more than 7 calendar years, an operator must conduct by the seventh calendar year of the interval either a confirmatory direct assessment in accordance with § 192.931, or a low stress reassessment in accordance with § 192.941.
                      
                    
                  
                
              
              
                § 192.941
                What is a low stress reassessment?
                (a) General. An operator of a transmission line that operates below 30% SMYS may use the following method to reassess a covered segment in accordance with § 192.939. This method of reassessment addresses the threats of external and internal corrosion. The operator must have conducted a baseline assessment of the covered segment in accordance with the requirements of §§ 192.919 and 192.921.
                (b) External corrosion. An operator must take one of the following actions to address external corrosion on the low stress covered segment.
                (1) Cathodically protected pipe. To address the threat of external corrosion on cathodically protected pipe in a covered segment, an operator must perform an electrical survey (i.e. indirect examination tool/method) at least every 7 years on the covered segment. An operator must use the results of each survey as part of an overall evaluation of the cathodic protection and corrosion threat for the covered segment. This evaluation must consider, at minimum, the leak repair and inspection records, corrosion monitoring records, exposed pipe inspection records, and the pipeline environment.
                (2) Unprotected pipe or cathodically protected pipe where electrical surveys are impractical. If an electrical survey is impractical on the covered segment an operator must—
                (i) Conduct leakage surveys as required by § 192.706 at 4-month intervals; and
                (ii) Every 18 months, identify and remediate areas of active corrosion by evaluating leak repair and inspection records, corrosion monitoring records, exposed pipe inspection records, and the pipeline environment.
                (c) Internal corrosion. To address the threat of internal corrosion on a covered segment, an operator must—
                (1) Conduct a gas analysis for corrosive agents at least once each calendar year;
                (2) Conduct periodic testing of fluids removed from the segment. At least once each calendar year test the fluids removed from each storage field that may affect a covered segment; and
                (3) At least every seven (7) years, integrate data from the analysis and testing required by paragraphs (c)(1)-(c)(2) with applicable internal corrosion leak records, incident reports, safety-related condition reports, repair records, patrol records, exposed pipe reports, and test records, and define and implement appropriate remediation actions.

                § 192.943
                When can an operator deviate from these reassessment intervals?
                (a) Waiver from reassessment interval in limited situations. In the following limited instances, OPS may allow a waiver from a reassessment interval required by § 192.939 if OPS finds a waiver would not be inconsistent with pipeline safety.
                (1) Lack of internal inspection tools. An operator who uses internal inspection as an assessment method may be able to justify a longer reassessment period for a covered segment if internal inspection tools are not available to assess the line pipe. To justify this, the operator must demonstrate that it cannot obtain the internal inspection tools within the required reassessment period and that the actions the operator is taking in the interim ensure the integrity of the covered segment.
                (2) Maintain product supply. An operator may be able to justify a longer reassessment period for a covered segment if the operator demonstrates that it cannot maintain local product supply if it conducts the reassessment within the required interval.
                (b) How to apply. If one of the conditions specified in paragraph (a) (1) or (a) (2) of this section applies, an operator may seek a waiver of the required reassessment interval. An operator must apply for a waiver in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 60118(c), at least 180 days before the end of the required reassessment interval, unless local product supply issues make the period impractical. If local product supply issues make the period impractical, an operator must apply for the waiver as soon as the need for the waiver becomes known.

                § 192.945
                What methods must an operator use to measure program effectiveness?
                (a) General. An operator must include in its integrity management program methods to measure whether the program is effective in assessing and evaluating the integrity of each covered pipeline segment and in protecting the high consequence areas. These measures must include the four overall performance measures specified in ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7 of this part), section 9.4, and the specific measures for each identified threat specified in ASME/ANSI B31.8S, Appendix A. An operator must submit the four overall performance measures as part of the annual report required by § 191.17 of this subchapter.
                (b) External Corrosion Direct assessment. In addition to the general requirements for performance measures in paragraph (a) of this section, an operator using direct assessment to assess the external corrosion threat must define and monitor measures to determine the effectiveness of the ECDA process. These measures must meet the requirements of § 192.925.

                (c) A written baseline assessment plan in accordance with § 192.919;
                (d) Documents to support any decision, analysis and process developed and used to implement and evaluate each element of the baseline assessment plan and integrity management program. Documents include those developed and used in support of any identification, calculation, amendment, modification, justification, deviation and determination made, and any action taken to implement and evaluate any of the program elements;
                (e) Documents that demonstrate personnel have the required training, including a description of the training program, in accordance with § 192.915;
                (f) Schedule required by § 192.933 that prioritizes the conditions found during an assessment for evaluation and remediation, including technical justifications for the schedule.
                (g) Documents to carry out the requirements in §§ 192.923 through 192.929 for a direct assessment plan;
                (h) Documents to carry out the requirements in § 192.931 for confirmatory direct assessment;
                (i) Verification that an operator has provided any documentation or notification required by this subpart to be provided to OPS, and when applicable, a State authority with which OPS has an interstate agent agreement, and a State or local pipeline safety authority that regulates a covered pipeline segment within that State.

                § 192.1007
                What are the required elements of an integrity management plan?
                A written integrity management plan must contain procedures for developing and implementing the following elements:
                (a) Knowledge. An operator must demonstrate an understanding of its gas distribution system developed from reasonably available information.

                (1) Identify the characteristics of the pipeline's design and operations and the environmental factors that are necessary to assess the applicable threats and risks to its gas distribution pipeline.
                
                (2) Consider the information gained from past design, operations, and maintenance.
                (3) Identify additional information needed and provide a plan for gaining that information over time through normal activities conducted on the pipeline (for example, design, construction, operations or maintenance activities).
                (4) Develop and implement a process by which the IM program will be reviewed periodically and refined and improved as needed.
                (5) Provide for the capture and retention of data on any new pipeline installed. The data must include, at a minimum, the location where the new pipeline is installed and the material of which it is constructed.
                (b) Identify threats. The operator must consider the following categories of threats to each gas distribution pipeline: corrosion, natural forces, excavation damage, other outside force damage, material or welds, equipment failure, incorrect operations, and other concerns that could threaten the integrity of its pipeline. An operator must consider reasonably available information to identify existing and potential threats. Sources of data may include, but are not limited to, incident and leak history, corrosion control records, continuing surveillance records, patrolling records, maintenance history, and excavation damage experience.
                (c) Evaluate and rank risk. An operator must evaluate the risks associated with its distribution pipeline. In this evaluation, the operator must determine the relative importance of each threat and estimate and rank the risks posed to its pipeline. This evaluation must consider each applicable current and potential threat, the likelihood of failure associated with each threat, and the potential consequences of such a failure. An operator may subdivide its pipeline into regions with similar characteristics (e.g., contiguous areas within a distribution pipeline consisting of mains, services and other appurtenances; areas with common materials or environmental factors), and for which similar actions likely would be effective in reducing risk.
                (d) Identify and implement measures to address risks. Determine and implement measures designed to reduce the risks from failure of its gas distribution pipeline. These measures must include an effective leak management program (unless all leaks are repaired when found).
                (e) Measure performance, monitor results, and evaluate effectiveness. (1) Develop and monitor performance measures from an established baseline to evaluate the effectiveness of its IM program. An operator must consider the results of its performance monitoring in periodically re-evaluating the threats and risks. These performance measures must include the following:
                (i) Number of hazardous leaks either eliminated or repaired as required by § 192.703(c) of this subchapter (or total number of leaks if all leaks are repaired when found), categorized by cause;
                (ii) Number of excavation damages;
                (iii) Number of excavation tickets (receipt of information by the underground facility operator from the notification center);
                (iv) Total number of leaks either eliminated or repaired, categorized by cause;
                (v) Number of hazardous leaks either eliminated or repaired as required by § 192.703(c) (or total number of leaks if all leaks are repaired when found), categorized by material; and
                (vi) Any additional measures the operator determines are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the operator's IM program in controlling each identified threat.
                (f) Periodic Evaluation and Improvement. An operator must re-evaluate threats and risks on its entire pipeline and consider the relevance of threats in one location to other areas. Each operator must determine the appropriate period for conducting complete program evaluations based on the complexity of its system and changes in factors affecting the risk of failure. An operator must conduct a complete program re-evaluation at least every five years. The operator must consider the results of the performance monitoring in these evaluations.
                (g) Report results. Report, on an annual basis, the four measures listed in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(iv) of this section, as part of the annual report required by § 191.11. An operator also must report the four measures to the state pipeline safety authority if a state exercises jurisdiction over the operator's pipeline.

                (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each operator of a distribution pipeline system must submit a report on each mechanical fitting failure, excluding any failure that results only in a nonhazardous leak, on a Department of Transportation Form PHMSA F-7100.1-2. The report(s) must be submitted in accordance with § 191.12.
                (b) The mechanical fitting failure reporting requirements in paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to the following:

                § 192.1013
                When may an operator deviate from required periodic inspections under this part?
                (a) An operator may propose to reduce the frequency of periodic inspections and tests required in this part on the basis of the engineering analysis and risk assessment required by this subpart.
                (b) An operator must submit its proposal to the PHMSA Associate Administrator for Pipeline Safety or, in the case of an intrastate pipeline facility regulated by the State, the appropriate State agency. The applicable oversight agency may accept the proposal on its own authority, with or without conditions and limitations, on a showing that the operator's proposal, which includes the adjusted interval, will provide an equal or greater overall level of safety.
                (c) An operator may implement an approved reduction in the frequency of a periodic inspection or test only where the operator has developed and implemented an integrity management program that provides an equal or improved overall level of safety despite the reduced frequency of periodic inspections.
              
              
                § 192.1015

No later than August 2, 2011 the operator of a master meter system or a small LPG operator must develop and implement an IM program that includes a written IM plan as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The IM program for these pipelines should reflect the relative simplicity of these types of pipelines.
                (b) Elements. A written integrity management plan must address, at a minimum, the following elements:
                (1) Knowledge. The operator must demonstrate knowledge of its pipeline, which, to the extent known, should include the approximate location and material of its pipeline. The operator must identify additional information needed and provide a plan for gaining knowledge over time through normal activities conducted on the pipeline (for example, design, construction, operations or maintenance activities).
                (2) Identify threats. The operator must consider, at minimum, the following categories of threats (existing and potential): Corrosion, natural forces, excavation damage, other outside force damage, material or weld failure, equipment failure, and incorrect operation.
                (3) Rank risks. The operator must evaluate the risks to its pipeline and estimate the relative importance of each identified threat.
                (4) Identify and implement measures to mitigate risks. The operator must determine and implement measures designed to reduce the risks from failure of its pipeline.
                
                (5) Measure performance, monitor results, and evaluate effectiveness. The operator must monitor, as a performance measure, the number of leaks eliminated or repaired on its pipeline and their causes.
                (6) Periodic evaluation and improvement. The operator must determine the appropriate period for conducting IM program evaluations based on the complexity of its pipeline and changes in factors affecting the risk of failure. An operator must re-evaluate its entire program at least every five years. The operator must consider the results of the performance monitoring in these evaluations.
                (c) Records. The operator must maintain, for a period of at least 10 years, the following records:
                (1) A written IM plan in accordance with this section, including superseded IM plans;
                (2) Documents supporting threat identification; and
                (3) Documents showing the location and material of all piping and appurtenances that are installed after the effective date of the operator's IM program and, to the extent known, the location and material of all pipe and appurtenances that were existing on the effective date of the operator's program.

                II. Steel pipe of unknown or unlisted specification.
                
                A. Bending Properties. For pipe 2 inches (51 millimeters) or less in diameter, a length of pipe must be cold bent through at least 90 degrees around a cylindrical mandrel that has a diameter 12 times the diameter of the pipe, without developing cracks at any portion and without opening the longitudinal weld.

                For pipe more than 2 inches (51 millimeters) in diameter, the pipe must meet the requirements of the flattening tests set forth in ASTM A53/A53M (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), except that the number of tests must be at least equal to the minimum required in paragraph II-D of this appendix to determine yield strength.
                B. Weldability. A girth weld must be made in the pipe by a welder who is qualified under subpart E of this part. The weld must be made under the most severe conditions under which welding will be allowed in the field and by means of the same procedure that will be used in the field. On pipe more than 4 inches (102 millimeters) in diameter, at least one test weld must be made for each 100 lengths of pipe. On pipe 4 inches (102 millimeters) or less in diameter, at least one test weld must be made for each 400 lengths of pipe. The weld must be tested in accordance with API Standard 1104 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7). If the requirements of API Standard 1104 cannot be met, weldability may be established by making chemical tests for carbon and manganese, and proceeding in accordance with section IX of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (ibr, see 192.7). The same number of chemical tests must be made as are required for testing a girth weld.
                C. Inspection. The pipe must be clean enough to permit adequate inspection. It must be visually inspected to ensure that it is reasonably round and straight and there are no defects which might impair the strength or tightness of the pipe.
                D. Tensile Properties. If the tensile properties of the pipe are not known, the minimum yield strength may be taken as 24,000 p.s.i. (165 MPa) or less, or the tensile properties may be established by performing tensile tests as set forth in API Specification 5L (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7). All test specimens shall be selected at random and the following number of tests must be performed:
                
                  Number of Tensile Tests—All Sizes
                  
                    10 lengths or less
                    1 set of tests for each length.
                  
                  
                    11 to 100 lengths
                    1 set of tests for each 5 lengths, but not less than 10 tests.
                  
                  
                    Over 100 lengths
                    1 set of tests for each 10 lengths, but not less than 20 tests.
                  
                
                If the yield-tensile ratio, based on the properties determined by those tests, exceeds 0.85, the pipe may be used only as provided in § 192.55(c).
                III. Steel pipe manufactured before November 12, 1970, to earlier editions of listed specifications. Steel pipe manufactured before November 12, 1970, in accordance with a specification of which a later edition is listed in section I of this appendix, is qualified for use under this part if the following requirements are met:
                A. Inspection. The pipe must be clean enough to permit adequate inspection. It must be visually inspected to ensure that it is reasonably round and straight and that there are no defects which might impair the strength or tightness of the pipe.
                B. Similarity of specification requirements. The edition of the listed specification under which the pipe was manufactured must have substantially the same requirements with respect to the following properties as a later edition of that specification listed in section I of this appendix:
                
                (1) Physical (mechanical) properties of pipe, including yield and tensile strength, elongation, and yield to tensile ratio, and testing requirements to verify those properties.
                (2) Chemical properties of pipe and testing requirements to verify those properties.
                C. Inspection or test of welded pipe. On pipe with welded seams, one of the following requirements must be met:
                (1) The edition of the listed specification to which the pipe was manufactured must have substantially the same requirements with respect to nondestructive inspection of welded seams and the standards for acceptance or rejection and repair as a later edition of the specification listed in section I of this appendix.
                (2) The pipe must be tested in accordance with subpart J of this part to at least 1.25 times the maximum allowable operating pressure if it is to be installed in a class 1 location and to at least 1.5 times the maximum allowable operating pressure if it is to be installed in a class 2, 3, or 4 location. Notwithstanding any shorter time period permitted under subpart J of this part, the test pressure must be maintained for at least 8 hours.

                Appendix C to Part 192—Qualification of Welders for Low Stress Level Pipe
                I. Basic test. The test is made on pipe 12 inches (305 millimeters) or less in diameter. The test weld must be made with the pipe in a horizontal fixed position so that the test weld includes at least one section of overhead position welding. The beveling, root opening, and other details must conform to the specifications of the procedure under which the welder is being qualified. Upon completion, the test weld is cut into four coupons and subjected to a root bend test. If, as a result of this test, two or more of the four coupons develop a crack in the weld material, or between the weld material and base metal, that is more than 1/8-inch (3.2 millimeters) long in any direction, the weld is unacceptable. Cracks that occur on the corner of the specimen during testing are not considered. A welder who successfully passes a butt-weld qualification test under this section shall be qualified to weld on all pipe diameters less than or equal to 12 inches.
                II. Additional tests for welders of service line connections to mains. A service line connection fitting is welded to a pipe section with the same diameter as a typical main. The weld is made in the same position as it is made in the field. The weld is unacceptable if it shows a serious undercutting or if it has rolled edges. The weld is tested by attempting to break the fitting off the run pipe. The weld is unacceptable if it breaks and shows incomplete fusion, overlap, or poor penetration at the junction of the fitting and run pipe.
                III. Periodic tests for welders of small service lines. Two samples of the welder's work, each about 8 inches (203 millimeters) long with the weld located approximately in the center, are cut from steel service line and tested as follows:
                (1) One sample is centered in a guided bend testing machine and bent to the contour of the die for a distance of 2 inches (51 millimeters) on each side of the weld. If the sample shows any breaks or cracks after removal from the bending machine, it is unacceptable.
                (2) The ends of the second sample are flattened and the entire joint subjected to a tensile strength test. If failure occurs adjacent to or in the weld metal, the weld is unacceptable. If a tensile strength testing machine is not available, this sample must also pass the bending test prescribed in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.

                Appendix D to Part 192—Criteria for Cathodic Protection and Determination of Measurements
                I. Criteria for cathodic protection— A. Steel, cast iron, and ductile iron structures. (1) A negative (cathodic) voltage of at least 0.85 volt, with reference to a saturated copper-copper sulfate half cell. Determination of this voltage must be made with the protective current applied, and in accordance with sections II and IV of this appendix.
                (2) A negative (cathodic) voltage shift of at least 300 millivolts. Determination of this voltage shift must be made with the protective current applied, and in accordance with sections II and IV of this appendix. This criterion of voltage shift applies to structures not in contact with metals of different anodic potentials.
                (3) A minimum negative (cathodic) polarization voltage shift of 100 millivolts. This polarization voltage shift must be determined in accordance with sections III and IV of this appendix.

                (4) A voltage at least as negative (cathodic) as that originally established at the beginning of the Tafel segment of the E-log-I curve. This voltage must be measured in accordance with section IV of this appendix.
                
                (5) A net protective current from the electrolyte into the structure surface as measured by an earth current technique applied at predetermined current discharge (anodic) points of the structure.
                B. Aluminum structures. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph, a minimum negative (cathodic) voltage shift of 150 millivolts, produced by the application of protective current. The voltage shift must be determined in accordance with sections II and IV of this appendix.
                (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph, a minimum negative (cathodic) polarization voltage shift of 100 millivolts. This polarization voltage shift must be determined in accordance with sections III and IV of this appendix.
                (3) Notwithstanding the alternative minimum criteria in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph, aluminum, if cathodically protected at voltages in excess of 1.20 volts as measured with reference to a copper-copper sulfate half cell, in accordance with section IV of this appendix, and compensated for the voltage (IR) drops other than those across the structure-electrolyte boundary may suffer corrosion resulting from the build-up of alkali on the metal surface. A voltage in excess of 1.20 volts may not be used unless previous test results indicate no appreciable corrosion will occur in the particular environment.
                (4) Since aluminum may suffer from corrosion under high pH conditions, and since application of cathodic protection tends to increase the pH at the metal surface, careful investigation or testing must be made before applying cathodic protection to stop pitting attack on aluminum structures in environments with a natural pH in excess of 8.
                C. Copper structures. A minimum negative (cathodic) polarization voltage shift of 100 millivolts. This polarization voltage shift must be determined in accordance with sections III and IV of this appendix.
                D. Metals of different anodic potentials. A negative (cathodic) voltage, measured in accordance with section IV of this appendix, equal to that required for the most anodic metal in the system must be maintained. If amphoteric structures are involved that could be damaged by high alkalinity covered by paragraphs (3) and (4) of paragraph B of this section, they must be electrically isolated with insulating flanges, or the equivalent.
                II. Interpretation of voltage measurement. Voltage (IR) drops other than those across the structure-electrolyte boundary must be considered for valid interpretation of the voltage measurement in paragraphs A(1) and (2) and paragraph B(1) of section I of this appendix.
                III. Determination of polarization voltage shift. The polarization voltage shift must be determined by interrupting the protective current and measuring the polarization decay. When the current is initially interrupted, an immediate voltage shift occurs. The voltage reading after the immediate shift must be used as the base reading from which to measure polarization decay in paragraphs A(3), B(2), and C of section I of this appendix.
                IV. Reference half cells. A. Except as provided in paragraphs B and C of this section, negative (cathodic) voltage must be measured between the structure surface and a saturated copper-copper sulfate half cell contacting the electrolyte.
                B. Other standard reference half cells may be substituted for the saturated cooper-copper sulfate half cell. Two commonly used reference half cells are listed below along with their voltage equivalent to −0.85 volt as referred to a saturated copper-copper sulfate half cell:
                (1) Saturated KCl calomel half cell: −0.78 volt.
                (2) Silver-silver chloride half cell used in sea water: −0.80 volt.
                C. In addition to the standard reference half cells, an alternate metallic material or structure may be used in place of the saturated copper-copper sulfate half cell if its potential stability is assured and if its voltage equivalent referred to a saturated copper-copper sulfate half cell is established.

                I. Guidance on Determining a High Consequence Area
                To determine which segments of an operator's transmission pipeline system are covered for purposes of the integrity management program requirements, an operator must identify the high consequence areas. An operator must use method (1) or (2) from the definition in § 192.903 to identify a high consequence area. An operator may apply one method to its entire pipeline system, or an operator may apply one method to individual portions of the pipeline system. (Refer to figure E.I.A for a diagram of a high consequence area).

                Appendix F to Part 192-Criteria for Conducting Integrity Assessments Using Guided Wave Ultrasonic Testing (GWUT)
                This appendix defines criteria which must be properly implemented for use of guided wave ultrasonic testing (GWUT) as an integrity assessment method. Any application of GWUT that does not conform to these criteria is considered “other technology” as described by §§ 192.710(c)(7), 192.921(a)(7), and 192.937(c)(7), for which OPS must be notified 90 days prior to use in accordance with §§ 192.921(a)(7) or 192.937(c)(7). GWUT in the “Go-No Go” mode means that all indications (wall loss anomalies) above the testing threshold (a maximum of 5% of cross sectional area (CSA) sensitivity) be directly examined, in-line tool inspected, pressure tested, or replaced prior to completing the integrity assessment on the carrier pipe.
                I. Equipment and Software: Generation. The equipment and the computer software used are critical to the success of the inspection. Computer software for the inspection equipment must be reviewed and updated, as required, on an annual basis, with intervals not to exceed 15 months, to support sensors, enhance functionality, and resolve any technical or operational issues identified.
                II. Inspection Range. The inspection range and sensitivity are set by the signal to noise (S/N) ratio but must still keep the maximum threshold sensitivity at 5% cross sectional area (CSA). A signal that has an amplitude that is at least twice the noise level can be reliably interpreted. The greater the S/N ratio the easier it is to identify and interpret signals from small changes. The signal to noise ratio is dependent on several variables such as surface roughness, coating, coating condition, associated pipe fittings (T's, elbows, flanges), soil compaction, and environment. Each of these affects the propagation of sound waves and influences the range of the test. It may be necessary to inspect from both ends of the pipeline segment to achieve a full inspection. In general, the inspection range can approach 60 to 100 feet for a 5% CSA, depending on field conditions.
                III. Complete Pipe Inspection. To ensure that the entire pipeline segment is assessed there should be at least a 2 to 1 signal to noise ratio across the entire pipeline segment that is inspected. This may require multiple GWUT shots. Double-ended inspections are expected. These two inspections are to be overlaid to show the minimum 2 to 1 S/N ratio is met in the middle. If possible, show the same near or midpoint feature from both sides and show an approximate 5% distance overlap.
                IV. Sensitivity. The detection sensitivity threshold determines the ability to identify a cross sectional change. The maximum threshold sensitivity cannot be greater than 5% of the cross sectional area (CSA).
                The locations and estimated CSA of all metal loss features in excess of the detection threshold must be determined and documented.
                All defect indications in the “Go-No Go” mode above the 5% testing threshold must be directly examined, in-line inspected, pressure tested, or replaced prior to completing the integrity assessment.
                V. Wave Frequency. Because a single wave frequency may not detect certain defects, a minimum of three frequencies must be run for each inspection to determine the best frequency for characterizing indications. The frequencies used for the inspections must be documented and must be in the range specified by the manufacturer of the equipment.
                VI. Signal or Wave Type: Torsional and Longitudinal. Both torsional and longitudinal waves must be used and use must be documented.
                VII. Distance Amplitude Correction (DAC) Curve and Weld Calibration. The distance amplitude correction curve accounts for coating, pipe diameter, pipe wall and environmental conditions at the assessment location. The DAC curve must be set for each inspection as part of establishing the effective range of a GWUT inspection. DAC curves provide a means for evaluating the cross-sectional area change of reflections at various distances in the test range by assessing signal to noise ratio. A DAC curve is a means of taking apparent attenuation into account along the time base of a test signal. It is a line of equal sensitivity along the trace which allows the amplitudes of signals at different axial distances from the collar to be compared.
                VIII. Dead Zone. The dead zone is the area adjacent to the collar in which the transmitted signal blinds the received signal, making it impossible to obtain reliable results. Because the entire line must be inspected, inspection procedures must account for the dead zone by requiring the movement of the collar for additional inspections. An alternate method of obtaining valid readings in the dead zone is to use B-scan ultrasonic equipment and visual examination of the external surface. The length of the dead zone and the near field for each inspection must be documented.
                IX. Near Field Effects. The near field is the region beyond the dead zone where the receiving amplifiers are increasing in power, before the wave is properly established. Because the entire line must be inspected, inspection procedures must account for the near field by requiring the movement of the collar for additional inspections. An alternate method of obtaining valid readings in the near field is to use B-scan ultrasonic equipment and visual examination of the external surface. The length of the dead zone and the near field for each inspection must be documented.
                X. Coating Type. Coatings can have the effect of attenuating the signal. Their thickness and condition are the primary factors that affect the rate of signal attenuation. Due to their variability, coatings make it difficult to predict the effective inspection distance. Several coating types may affect the GWUT results to the point that they may reduce the expected inspection distance. For example, concrete coated pipe may be problematic when well bonded due to the attenuation effects. If an inspection is done and the required sensitivity is not achieved for the entire length of the pipe, then another type of assessment method must be utilized.
                XI. End Seal. When assessing cased carrier pipe with GWUT, operators must remove the end seal from the casing at each GWUT test location to facilitate visual inspection. Operators must remove debris and water from the casing at the end seals. Any corrosion material observed must be removed, collected and reviewed by the operator's corrosion technician. The end seal does not interfere with the accuracy of the GWUT inspection but may have a dampening effect on the range.
                XII. Weld Calibration to set DAC Curve. Accessible welds, along or outside the pipeline segment to be inspected, must be used to set the DAC curve. A weld or welds in the access hole (secondary area) may be used if welds along the pipeline segment are not accessible. In order to use these welds in the secondary area, sufficient distance must be allowed to account for the dead zone and near field. There must not be a weld between the transducer collar and the calibration weld. A conservative estimate of the predicted amplitude for the weld is 25% CSA (cross sectional area) and can be used if welds are not accessible. Calibrations (setting of the DAC curve) should be on pipe with similar properties such as wall thickness and coating. If the actual weld cap height is different from the assumed weld cap height, the estimated CSA may be inaccurate and adjustments to the DAC curve may be required. Alternative means of calibration can be used if justified by a documented engineering analysis and evaluation.
                XIII. Validation of Operator Training. Pipeline operators must require all guided wave service providers to have equipment-specific training and experience for all GWUT Equipment Operators which includes training for:
                A. Equipment operation,
                B. field data collection, and
                C. data interpretation on cased and buried pipe.
                Only individuals who have been qualified by the manufacturer or an independently assessed evaluation procedure similar to ISO 9712 (Sections: 5 Responsibilities; 6 Levels of Qualification; 7 Eligibility; and 10 Certification), as specified above, may operate the equipment. A senior-level GWUT equipment operator with pipeline specific experience must provide onsite oversight of the inspection and approve the final reports. A senior-level GWUT equipment operator must have additional training and experience, including training specific to cased and buried pipe, with a quality control program which that conforms to Section 12 of ASME B31.8S (for availability, see § 192.7).
                XIV. Training and Experience Minimums for Senior Level GWUT Equipment Operators:
                
                • Equipment Manufacturer's minimum qualification for equipment operation and data collection with specific endorsements for casings and buried pipe
                • Training, qualification and experience in testing procedures and frequency determination
                • Training, qualification and experience in conversion of guided wave data into pipe features and estimated metal loss (estimated cross-sectional area loss and circumferential extent)
                • Equipment Manufacturer's minimum qualification with specific endorsements for data interpretation of anomaly features for pipe within casings and buried pipe.
                XV. Equipment: Traceable from vendor to inspection company. An operator must maintain documentation of the version of the GWUT software used and the serial number of the other equipment such as collars, cables, etc., in the report.
                XVI. Calibration Onsite. The GWUT equipment must be calibrated for performance in accordance with the manufacturer's requirements and specifications, including the frequency of calibrations. A diagnostic check and system check must be performed on-site each time the equipment is relocated to a different casing or pipeline segment. If on-site diagnostics show a discrepancy with the manufacturer's requirements and specifications, testing must cease until the equipment can be restored to manufacturer's specifications.
                XVII. Use on Shorted Casings (direct or electrolytic). GWUT may not be used to assess shorted casings. GWUT operators must have operations and maintenance procedures (see § 192.605) to address the effect of shorted casings on the GWUT signal. The equipment operator must clear any evidence of interference, other than some slight dampening of the GWUT signal from the shorted casing, according to their operating and maintenance procedures. All shorted casings found while conducting GWUT inspections must be addressed by the operator's standard operating procedures.
                XVIII. Direct examination of all indications above the detection sensitivity threshold. The use of GWUT in the “Go-No Go” mode requires that all indications (wall loss anomalies) above the testing threshold (5% of CSA sensitivity) be directly examined (or replaced) prior to completing the integrity assessment on the cased carrier pipe or other GWUT application. If this cannot be accomplished, then alternative methods of assessment (such as hydrostatic pressure tests or ILI) must be utilized.
                XIV. Timing of direct examination of all indications above the detection sensitivity threshold. Operators must either replace or conduct direct examinations of all indications identified above the detection sensitivity threshold according to the table below. Operators must conduct leak surveys and reduce operating pressure as specified until the pipe is replaced or direct examinations are completed.
                
                  Required Response to GWUT Indications
                  
                    GWUT criterion
                    Operating pressure less than or equal to 30% SMYS
                    Operating pressure over 30 and less than or equal to 50% SMYS
                    Operating pressure over 50% SMYS
                  
                  
                    Over the detection sensitivity threshold (maximum of 5% CSA)
                    Replace or direct examination within 12 months, and instrumented leak survey once every 30 calendar days
                    Replace or direct examination within 6 months, instrumented leak survey once every 30 calendar days, and maintain MAOP below the operating pressure at time of discovery
                    Replace or direct examination within 6 months, instrumented leak survey once every 30 calendar days, and reduce MAOP to 80% of operating pressure at time of discovery.

                Flammable vapor-gas dispersion protection.

                Each LNG container and LNG transfer system must have a dispersion exclusion zone in accordance with sections 2.2.3.3 and 2.2.3.4 of NFPA-59A-2001 (incorporated by reference, see § 193.2013) with the following exceptions:

                (a) Flammable vapor-gas dispersion distances must be determined in accordance with the model described in the GTI-04/0049, “LNG Vapor Dispersion Prediction with the DEGADIS 2.1 Dense Gas Dispersion Model”” (incorporated by reference, see § 193.2013).” Alternatively, in order to account for additional cloud dilution which may be caused by the complex flow patterns induced by tank and dike structure, dispersion distances may be calculated in accordance with the model described in the Gas Research Institute report GRI-96/0396.5 (incorporated by reference, see § 193.2013), “Evaluation of Mitigation Methods for Accidental LNG Releases. Volume 5: Using FEM3A for LNG Accident Consequence Analyses”. The use of alternate models which take into account the same physical factors and have been validated by experimental test data shall be permitted, subject to the Administrator's approval.
                (b) The following dispersion parameters must be used in computing dispersion distances:
                (1) Average gas concentration in air = 2.5 percent.
                (2) Dispersion conditions are a combination of those which result in longer predicted downwind dispersion distances than other weather conditions at the site at least 90 percent of the time, based on figures maintained by National Weather Service of the U.S. Department of Commerce, or as an alternative where the model used gives longer distances at lower wind speeds, Atmospheric Stability (Pasquill Class) F, wind speed = 4.5 miles per hour (2.01 meters/sec) at reference height of 10 meters, relative humidity = 50.0 percent, and atmospheric temperature = average in the region.
                (3) The elevation for contour (receptor) output H = 0.5 meters.
                (4) A surface roughness factor of 0.03 meters shall be used. Higher values for the roughness factor may be used if it can be shown that the terrain both upwind and downwind of the vapor cloud has dense vegetation and that the vapor cloud height is more than ten times the height of the obstacles encountered by the vapor cloud.

                (c) The design spill shall be determined in accordance with section 2.2.3.5 of NFPA-59A-2001 (incorporated by reference, see § 193.2013).

                (b) The wind forces at the location of the specific facility must be based on one of the following:

                (1) For shop fabricated containers of LNG or other hazardous fluids with a capacity of not more than 70,000 gallons, applicable wind load data in ASCE/SEI 7 (incorporated by reference, see § 193.2013).
                (2) For all other LNG facilities:
                (i) An assumed sustained wind velocity of not less than 150 miles per hour, unless the Administrator finds a lower velocity is justified by adequate supportive data; or
                (ii) The most critical combination of wind velocity and duration, with respect to the effect on the structure, having a probability of exceedance in a 50-year period of 0.5 percent or less, if adequate wind data are available and the probabilistic methodology is reliable.

                  (iv) Anticipated hydraulic forces from a credible opening in the component or item served, assuming that the discharge pressure equals design pressure.
                  (2) The erosive action from a spill, including jetting of spilling LNG, and any other anticipated erosive action including surface water runoff, ice formation, dislodgement of ice formation, and snow removal.
                  (3) The effect of the temperature, any thermal gradient, and any other anticipated degradation resulting from sudden or localized contact with LNG.
                  (4) Exposure to fire from impounded LNG or from sources other than impounded LNG.
                  (5) If applicable, the potential impact and loading on the dike due to—
                  (i) Collapse of the component or item served or adjacent components; and
                  (ii) If the LNG facility adjoins the right-of-way of any highway or railroad, collision by or explosion of a train, tank car, or tank truck that could reasonably be expected to cause the most severe loading.

                  (b) An LNG storage tank must not be located within a horizontal distance of one mile (1.6 km) from the ends, or 1/4 mile (0.4 km) from the nearest point of a runway, whichever is longer.

                § 194.101
                Operators required to submit plans.
                (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, unless OPS grants a request from an Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) to require an operator of a pipeline in paragraph (b) to submit a response plan, each operator of an onshore pipeline facility shall prepare and submit a response plan to PHMSA as provided in § 194.119. A pipeline which does not meet the criteria for significant and substantial harm as defined in § 194.103(c) and is not eligible for an exception under § 194.101(b), can be expected to cause substantial harm. Operators of substantial harm pipeline facilities must prepare and submit plans to PHMSA for review.
                (b) Exception. An operator need not submit a response plan for:
                (1) A pipeline that is 65/8 inches (168 millimeters) or less in outside nominal diameter, is 10 miles (16 kilometers) or less in length, and all of the following conditions apply to the pipeline:
                (i) The pipeline has not experienced a release greater than 1,000 barrels (159 cubic meters) within the previous five years,
                (ii) The pipeline has not experienced at least two reportable releases, as defined in § 195.50, within the previous five years,
                (iii) A pipeline containing any electric resistance welded pipe, manufactured prior to 1970, does not operate at a maximum operating pressure established under § 195.406 that corresponds to a stress level greater than 50 percent of the specified minimum yield strength of the pipe, and
                (iv) The pipeline is not in proximity to navigable waters, public drinking water intakes, or environmentally sensitive areas.

                (2)(i) A line section that is greater than 65/8 inches in outside nominal diameter and is greater than 10 miles in length, where the operator determines that it is unlikely that the worst case discharge from any point on the line section would adversely affect, within 12 hours after the initiation of the discharge, any navigable waters, public drinking water intake, or environmentally sensitive areas.
                (ii) A line section that is 65/8 inches (168 millimeters) or less in outside nominal diameter and is 10 miles (16 kilometers) or less in length, where the operator determines that it is unlikely that the worst case discharge from any point on the line section would adversely affect, within 4 hours after the initiation of the discharge, any navigable waters, public drinking water intake, or environmentally sensitive areas.

                § 194.103
                Significant and substantial harm; operator's statement.
                (a) Each operator shall submit a statement with its response plan, as required by §§ 194.107 and 194.113, identifying which line sections in a response zone can be expected to cause significant and substantial harm to the environment in the event of a discharge of oil into or on the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines.
                (b) If an operator expects a line section in a response zone to cause significant and substantial harm, then the entire response zone must, for the purpose of response plan review and approval, be treated as if it is expected to cause significant and substantial harm. However, an operator will not have to submit separate plans for each line section.
                (c) A line section can be expected to cause significant and substantial harm to the environment in the event of a discharge of oil into or on the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines if; the pipeline is greater than 65/8 inches (168 millimeters) in outside nominal diameter, greater than 10 miles (16 kilometers) in length, and the line section—
                (1) Has experienced a release greater than 1,000 barrels (159 cubic meters) within the previous five years,
                (2) Has experienced two or more reportable releases, as defined in § 195.50, within the previous five years,
                (3) Containing any electric resistance welded pipe, manufactured prior to 1970, operates at a maximum operating pressure established under § 195.406 that corresponds to a stress level greater than 50 percent of the specified minimum yield strength of the pipe,
                (4) Is located within a 5 mile (8 kilometer) radius of potentially affected public drinking water intakes and could reasonably be expected to reach public drinking water intakes, or
                (5) Is located within a 1 mile (1.6 kilometer) radius of potentially affected environmentally sensitive areas, and could reasonably be expected to reach these areas.

                (a) Each operator shall determine the worst case discharge for each of its response zones and provide the methodology, including calculations, used to arrive at the volume.
                (b) The worst case discharge is the largest volume, in barrels (cubic meters), of the following:
                (1) The pipeline's maximum release time in hours, plus the maximum shutdown response time in hours (based on historic discharge data or in the absence of such historic data, the operator's best estimate), multiplied by the maximum flow rate expressed in barrels per hour (based on the maximum daily capacity of the pipeline), plus the largest line drainage volume after shutdown of the line section(s) in the response zone expressed in barrels (cubic meters); or
                (2) The largest foreseeable discharge for the line section(s) within a response zone, expressed in barrels (cubic meters), based on the maximum historic discharge, if one exists, adjusted for any subsequent corrective or preventive action taken; or

                (3) If the response zone contains one or more breakout tanks, the capacity of the single largest tank or battery of tanks within a single secondary containment system, adjusted for the capacity or size of the secondary containment system, expressed in barrels (cubic meters).
                (4) Operators may claim prevention credits for breakout tank secondary containment and other specific spill prevention measures as follows:

                § 194.107
                General response plan requirements.
                (a) Each response plan must include procedures and a list of resources for responding, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst case discharge and to a substantial threat of such a discharge. The “substantial threat” term is equivalent to abnormal operations outlined in 49 CFR 195.402(d). To comply with this requirement, an operator can incorporate by reference into the response plan the appropriate procedures from its manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies, which is prepared in compliance with 49 CFR 195.402.
                (b) An operator must certify in the response plan that it reviewed the NCP and each applicable ACP and that its response plan is consistent with the NCP and each applicable ACP as follows:
                (1) As a minimum to be consistent with the NCP a facility response plan must:
                (i) Demonstrate an operator's clear understanding of the function of the Federal response structure, including procedures to notify the National Response Center reflecting the relationship between the operator's response organization's role and the Federal On Scene Coordinator's role in pollution response;
                (ii) Establish provisions to ensure the protection of safety at the response site; and
                (iii) Identify the procedures to obtain any required Federal and State permissions for using alternative response strategies such as in-situ burning and dispersants as provided for in the applicable ACPs; and
                (2) As a minimum, to be consistent with the applicable ACP the plan must:
                (i) Address the removal of a worst case discharge and the mitigation or prevention of a substantial threat of a worst case discharge;
                (ii) Identify environmentally and economically sensitive areas;
                (iii) Describe the responsibilities of the operator and of Federal, State and local agencies in removing a discharge and in mitigating or preventing a substantial threat of a discharge; and
                (iv) Establish the procedures for obtaining an expedited decision on use of dispersants or other chemicals.
                (c) Each response plan must include:
                (1) A core plan consisting of—
                (i) An information summary as required in § 194.113,
                (ii) Immediate notification procedures,
                (iii) Spill detection and mitigation procedures,
                (iv) The name, address, and telephone number of the oil spill response organization, if appropriate,
                (v) Response activities and response resources,
                (vi) Names and telephone numbers of Federal, State and local agencies which the operator expects to have pollution control responsibilities or support,
                (vii) Training procedures,
                (viii) Equipment testing,
                
                (ix) Drill program—an operator will satisfy the requirement for a drill program by following the National Preparedness for Response Exercise Program (PREP) guidelines. An operator choosing not to follow PREP guidelines must have a drill program that is equivalent to PREP. The operator must describe the drill program in the response plan and OPS will determine if the program is equivalent to PREP.
                (x) Plan review and update procedures;
                (2) An appendix for each response zone that includes the information required in paragraph (c)(1)(i)-(ix) of this section and the worst case discharge calculations that are specific to that response zone. An operator submitting a response plan for a single response zone does not need to have a core plan and a response zone appendix. The operator of a single response zone onshore pipeline shall have a single summary in the plan that contains the required information in § 194.113.7; and
                (3) A description of the operator's response management system including the functional areas of finance, logistics, operations, planning, and command. The plan must demonstrate that the operator's response management system uses common terminology and has a manageable span of control, a clearly defined chain of command, and sufficient trained personnel to fill each position.

                § 194.109
                Submission of state response plans.
                (a) In lieu of submitting a response plan required by § 194.103, an operator may submit a response plan that complies with a state law or regulation, if the state law or regulation requires a plan that provides equivalent or greater spill protection than a plan required under this part.
                (b) A plan submitted under this section must
                (1) Have an information summary required by § 194.113;
                (2) List the names or titles and 24-hour telephone numbers of the qualified individual(s) and at least one alternate qualified individual(s); and
                (3) Ensure through contract or other approved means the necessary private personnel and equipment to respond to a worst case discharge or a substantial threat of such a discharge.

                Conversion to service subject to this part.
                (a) A steel pipeline previously used in service not subject to this part qualifies for use under this part if the operator prepares and follows a written procedure to accomplish the following:
                (1) The design, construction, operation, and maintenance history of the pipeline must be reviewed and, where sufficient historical records are not available, appropriate tests must be performed to determine if the pipeline is in satisfactory condition for safe operation. If one or more of the variables necessary to verify the design pressure under § 195.106 or to perform the testing under paragraph (a)(4) of this section is unknown, the design pressure may be verified and the maximum operating pressure determined by—

                (i) Testing the pipeline in accordance with ASME/ANSI B31.8 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3), Appendix N, to produce a stress equal to the yield strength; and
                (ii) Applying, to not more than 80 percent of the first pressure that produces a yielding, the design factor F in § 195.106(a) and the appropriate factors in § 195.106(e).
                (2) The pipeline right-of-way, all aboveground segments of the pipeline, and appropriately selected underground segments must be visually inspected for physical defects and operating conditions which reasonably could be expected to impair the strength or tightness of the pipeline.
                (3) All known unsafe defects and conditions must be corrected in accordance with this part.
                (4) The pipeline must be tested in accordance with subpart E of this part to substantiate the maximum operating pressure permitted by § 195.406.
                (b) A pipeline that qualifies for use under this section need not comply with the corrosion control requirements of subpart H of this part until 12 months after it is placed into service, notwithstanding any previous deadlines for compliance.
                (c) Each operator must keep for the life of the pipeline a record of the investigations, tests, repairs, replacements, and alterations made under the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
                (d) An operator converting a pipeline from service not previously covered by this part must notify PHMSA 60 days before the conversion occurs as required by § 195.64.

                § 195.6
                Unusually Sensitive Areas (USAs).
                As used in this part, a USA means a drinking water or ecological resource area that is unusually sensitive to environmental damage from a hazardous liquid pipeline release.
                (a) An USA drinking water resource is:
                (1) The water intake for a Community Water System (CWS) or a Non-transient Non-community Water System (NTNCWS) that obtains its water supply primarily from a surface water source and does not have an adequate alternative drinking water source;
                (2) The Source Water Protection Area (SWPA) for a CWS or a NTNCWS that obtains its water supply from a Class I or Class IIA aquifer and does not have an adequate alternative drinking water source. Where a state has not yet identified the SWPA, the Wellhead Protection Area (WHPA) will be used until the state has identified the SWPA; or
                (3) The sole source aquifer recharge area where the sole source aquifer is a karst aquifer in nature.
                (b) An USA ecological resource is:
                (1) An area containing a critically imperiled species or ecological community;
                (2) A multi-species assemblage area;
                
                (3) A migratory waterbird concentration area;
                (4) An area containing an imperiled species, threatened or endangered species, depleted marine mammal species, or an imperiled ecological community where the species or community is aquatic, aquatic dependent, or terrestrial with a limited range; or
                (5) An area containing an imperiled species, threatened or endangered species, depleted marine mammal species, or imperiled ecological community where the species or community occurrence is considered to be one of the most viable, highest quality, or in the best condition, as identified by an element occurrence ranking (EORANK) of A (excellent quality) or B (good quality).

                  Adequate Alternative Drinking Water Source means a source of water that currently exists, can be used almost immediately with a minimal amount of effort and cost, involves no decline in water quality, and will meet the consumptive, hygiene, and fire fighting requirements of the existing population of impacted customers for at least one month for a surface water source of water and at least six months for a groundwater source.
                
                  Aquatic or Aquatic Dependent Species or Community means a species or community that primarily occurs in aquatic, marine, or wetland habitats, as well as species that may use terrestrial habitats during all or some portion of their life cycle, but that are still closely associated with or dependent upon aquatic, marine, or wetland habitats for some critical component or portion of their life-history (i.e., reproduction, rearing and development, feeding, etc).
                
                  Class I Aquifer means an aquifer that is surficial or shallow, permeable, and is highly vulnerable to contamination. Class I aquifers include:
                (1) Unconsolidated Aquifers (Class Ia) that consist of surficial, unconsolidated, and permeable alluvial, terrace, outwash, beach, dune and other similar deposits. These aquifers generally contain layers of sand and gravel that, commonly, are interbedded to some degree with silt and clay. Not all Class Ia aquifers are important water-bearing units, but they are likely to be both permeable and vulnerable. The only natural protection of these aquifers is the thickness of the unsaturated zone and the presence of fine-grained material;
                (2) Soluble and Fractured Bedrock Aquifers (Class Ib). Lithologies in this class include limestone, dolomite, and, locally, evaporitic units that contain documented karst features or solution channels, regardless of size. Generally these aquifers have a wide range of permeability. Also included in this class are sedimentary strata, and metamorphic and igneous (intrusive and extrusive) rocks that are significantly faulted, fractured, or jointed. In all cases groundwater movement is largely controlled by secondary openings. Well yields range widely, but the important feature is the potential for rapid vertical and lateral ground water movement along preferred pathways, which result in a high degree of vulnerability;
                (3) Semiconsolidated Aquifers (Class Ic) that generally contain poorly to moderately indurated sand and gravel that is interbedded with clay and silt. This group is intermediate to the unconsolidated and consolidated end members. These systems are common in the Tertiary age rocks that are exposed throughout the Gulf and Atlantic coastal states. Semiconsolidated conditions also arise from the presence of intercalated clay and caliche within primarily unconsolidated to poorly consolidated units, such as occurs in parts of the High Plains Aquifer; or
                (4) Covered Aquifers (Class Id) that are any Class I aquifer overlain by less than 50 feet of low permeability, unconsolidated material, such as glacial till, lacustrian, and loess deposits.
                
                  Class IIa aquifer means a Higher Yield Bedrock Aquifer that is consolidated and is moderately vulnerable to contamination. These aquifers generally consist of fairly permeable sandstone or conglomerate that contain lesser amounts of interbedded fine grained clastics (shale, siltstone, mudstone) and occasionally carbonate units. In general, well yields must exceed 50 gallons per minute to be included in this class. Local fracturing may contribute to the dominant primary porosity and permeability of these systems.
                
                
                  Community Water System (CWS) means a public water system that serves at least 15 service connections used by year-round residents of the area or regularly serves at least 25 year-round residents.
                
                  Critically imperiled species or ecological community (habitat) means an animal or plant species or an ecological community of extreme rarity, based on The Nature Conservancy's Global Conservation Status Rank. There are generally 5 or fewer occurrences, or very few remaining individuals (less than 1,000) or acres (less than 2,000). These species and ecological communities are extremely vulnerable to extinction due to some natural or man-made factor.
                
                  Depleted marine mammal species means a species that has been identified and is protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended (MMPA) (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.). The term “depleted” refers to marine mammal species that are listed as threatened or endangered, or are below their optimum sustainable populations (16 U.S.C. 1362). The term “marine mammal” means “any mammal which is morphologically adapted to the marine environment (including sea otters and members of the orders Sirenia, Pinnipedia, and Cetacea), or primarily inhabits the marine environment (such as the polar bear)” (16 U.S.C. 1362). The order Sirenia includes manatees, the order Pinnipedia includes seals, sea lions, and walruses, and the order Cetacea includes dolphins, porpoises, and whales.
                
                  Ecological community means an interacting assemblage of plants and animals that recur under similar environmental conditions across the landscape.
                
                  Element occurrence rank (EORANK) means the condition or viability of a species or ecological community occurrence, based on a population's size, condition, and landscape context. EORANKs are assigned by the Natural Heritage Programs. An EORANK of A means an excellent quality and an EORANK of B means good quality.
                
                  Imperiled species or ecological community (habitat) means a rare species or ecological community, based on The Nature Conservancy's Global Conservation Status Rank. There are generally 6 to 20 occurrences, or few remaining individuals (1,000 to 3,000) or acres (2,000 to 10,000). These species and ecological communities are vulnerable to extinction due to some natural or man-made factor.

                  Non-transient Non-community Water System (NTNCWS) means a public water system that regularly serves at least 25 of the same persons over six months per year. Examples of these systems include schools, factories, and hospitals that have their own water supplies.
                
                  Public Water System (PWS) means a system that provides the public water for human consumption through pipes or other constructed conveyances, if such system has at least 15 service connections or regularly serves an average of at least 25 individuals daily at least 60 days out of the year. These systems include the sources of the water supplies—i.e., surface or ground. PWS can be community, non-transient non-community, or transient non-community systems.
                
                  Ramsar site means a site that has been designated under The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat program. Ramsar sites are globally critical wetland areas that support migratory waterfowl. These include wetland areas that regularly support 20,000 waterfowl; wetland areas that regularly support substantial numbers of individuals from particular groups of waterfowl, indicative of wetland values, productivity, or diversity; and wetland areas that regularly support 1% of the individuals in a population of one species or subspecies of waterfowl.
                
                
                  Sole source aquifer (SSA) means an area designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Sole Source Aquifer program as the “sole or principal” source of drinking water for an area. Such designations are made if the aquifer's ground water supplies 50% or more of the drinking water for an area, and if that aquifer were to become contaminated, it would pose a public health hazard. A sole source aquifer that is karst in nature is one composed of limestone where the porosity is derived from connected solution cavities. They are often cavernous, with high rates of flow.
                
                  Source Water Protection Area (SWPA) means the area delineated by the state for a public water supply system (PWS) or including numerous PWSs, whether the source is ground water or surface water or both, as part of the state source water assessment program (SWAP) approved by EPA under section 1453 of the Safe Drinking Water Act.
                
                  Species means species, subspecies, population stocks, or distinct vertebrate populations.
                
                  Terrestrial ecological community with a limited range means a non-aquatic or non-aquatic dependent ecological community that covers less than five (5) acres.

                  Transient Non-community Water System (TNCWS) means a public water system that does not regularly serve at least 25 of the same persons over six months per year. This type of water system serves a transient population found at rest stops, campgrounds, restaurants, and parks with their own source of water.
                
                  Wellhead Protection Area (WHPA) means the surface and subsurface area surrounding a well or well field that supplies a public water system through which contaminants are likely to pass and eventually reach the water well or well field.

                Transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in pipelines constructed with other than steel pipe.

                No person may transport any hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide through a pipe that is constructed after October 1, 1970, for hazardous liquids or after July 12, 1991 for carbon dioxide of material other than steel unless the person has notified the Administrator in writing at least 90 days before the transportation is to begin. The notice must state whether carbon dioxide or a hazardous liquid is to be transported and the chemical name, common name, properties and characteristics of the hazardous liquid to be transported and the material used in construction of the pipeline. If the Administrator determines that the transportation of the hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in the manner proposed would be unduly hazardous, he will, within 90 days after receipt of the notice, order the person that gave the notice, in writing, not to transport the hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in the proposed manner until further notice.

                Outer continental shelf pipelines.
                Operators of transportation pipelines on the Outer Continental Shelf must identify on all their respective pipelines the specific points at which operating responsibility transfers to a producing operator. For those instances in which the transfer points are not identifiable by a durable marking, each operator will have until September 15, 1998 to identify the transfer points. If it is not practicable to durably mark a transfer point and the transfer point is located above water, the operator must depict the transfer point on a schematic maintained near the transfer point. If a transfer point is located subsea, the operator must identify the transfer point on a schematic which must be maintained at the nearest upstream facility and provided to PHMSA upon request. For those cases in which adjoining operators have not agreed on a transfer point by September 15, 1998 the Regional Director and the MMS Regional Supervisor will make a joint determination of the transfer point.

                (d) Economic compliance burden. (1) An operator may notify PHMSA in accordance with § 195.452(m) of a situation meeting the following criteria:
                (i) The pipeline is a Category 1 rural low-stress pipeline;
                (ii) The pipeline carries crude oil from a production facility;
                (iii) The pipeline, when in operation, operates at a flow rate less than or equal to 14,000 barrels per day; and

                (iv) The operator determines it would abandon or shut-down the pipeline as a result of the economic burden to comply with the assessment requirements in § 195.452(d) or 195.452(j).
                
                (2) A notification submitted under this provision must include, at minimum, the following information about the pipeline: its operating, maintenance and leak history; the estimated cost to comply with the integrity assessment requirements (with a brief description of the basis for the estimate); the estimated amount of production from affected wells per year, whether wells will be shut in or alternate transportation used, and if alternate transportation will be used, the estimated cost to do so.
                (3) When an operator notifies PHMSA in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this Section, PHMSA will stay compliance with §§ 195.452(d) and 195.452(j)(3) until it has completed an analysis of the notification. PHMSA will consult the Department of Energy, as appropriate, to help analyze the potential energy impact of loss of the pipeline. Based on the analysis, PHMSA may grant the operator a special permit to allow continued operation of the pipeline subject to alternative safety requirements.
                (e) Changes in unusually sensitive areas. (1) If, after June 3, 2008, for Category 1 rural low-stress pipelines or October 1, 2011 for Category 2 rural low-stress pipelines, an operator identifies a new USA that causes a segment of pipeline to meet the criteria in paragraph (b) of this Section as a Category 1 or Category 2 rural low-stress pipeline, the operator must:
                (i) Comply with the IM program requirement in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) or (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this Section, as appropriate, within 12 months following the date the area is identified regardless of the prior categorization of the pipeline; and
                (ii) Complete the baseline assessment required by paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(C) or (c)(2)(iii)(C) of this Section, as appropriate, according to the schedule in § 195.452(d)(3).
                (2) If a change to the boundaries of a USA causes a Category 1 or Category 2 pipeline segment to no longer be within one-half mile of a USA, an operator must continue to comply with paragraph (c)(1)(iii) or paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, as applicable, with respect to that segment unless the operator determines that a release from the pipeline could not affect the USA.
                (f) Record Retention. An operator must maintain records demonstrating compliance with each requirement applicable to the category of pipeline according to the following schedule.
                (1) An operator must maintain the segment identification records required in paragraph (c)(1)(i), (c)(2)(i) or (c)(3)(i) of this Section for the life of the pipe.
                (2) Except for the segment identification records, an operator must maintain the records necessary to demonstrate compliance with each applicable requirement set forth in paragraph (c) of this section according to the record retention requirements of the referenced section or subpart.

                Variations in pressure.
                If, within a pipeline system, two or more components are to be connected at a place where one will operate at a higher pressure than another, the system must be designed so that any component operating at the lower pressure will not be overstressed.
              
              
                § 195.106
                Internal design pressure.
                (a) Internal design pressure for the pipe in a pipeline is determined in accordance with the following formula:
                P = (2St/D) × E × F
                
                
                
                  
                    P = Internal design pressure in p.s.i. (kPa) gage.
                  
                    S = Yield strength in pounds per square inch (kPa) determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
                  
                    t = Nominal wall thickness of the pipe in inches (millimeters). If this is unknown, it is determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
                  
                    D = Nominal outside diameter of the pipe in inches (millimeters).
                  
                    E = Seam joint factor determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
                  
                    F = A design factor of 0.72, except that a design factor of 0.60 is used for pipe, including risers, on a platform located offshore or on a platform in inland navigable waters, and 0.54 is used for pipe that has been subjected to cold expansion to meet the specified minimum yield strength and is subsequently heated, other than by welding or stress relieving as a part of welding, to a temperature higher than 900 °F (482 °C) for any period of time or over 600 °F (316 °C) for more than 1 hour.
                
                
                (b) The yield strength to be used in determining the internal design pressure under paragraph (a) of this section is the specified minimum yield strength. If the specified minimum yield strength is not known, the yield strength to be used in the design formula is one of the following:
                (1)(i) The yield strength determined by performing all of the tensile tests of ANSI/API Spec 5L (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) on randomly selected specimens with the following number of tests:
                
                  
                    Pipe size
                    No. of tests
                  
                  
                    Less than 65/8 in (168 mm) nominal outside diameter
                    One test for each 200 lengths.
                  
                  
                    6 5/8 in through 123/4 in (168 mm through 324 mm) nominal outside diameter
                    One test for each 100 lengths.
                  
                  
                    Larger than 123/4 in (324 mm) nominal outside diameter
                    One test for each 50 lengths.
                  
                
                (ii) If the average yield-tensile ratio exceeds 0.85, the yield strength shall be taken as 24,000 p.s.i. (165,474 kPa). If the average yield-tensile ratio is 0.85 or less, the yield strength of the pipe is taken as the lower of the following:
                (A) Eighty percent of the average yield strength determined by the tensile tests.
                (B) The lowest yield strength determined by the tensile tests.
                (2) If the pipe is not tensile tested as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the yield strength shall be taken as 24,000 p.s.i. (165,474 kPa).
                (c) If the nominal wall thickness to be used in determining internal design pressure under paragraph (a) of this section is not known, it is determined by measuring the thickness of each piece of pipe at quarter points on one end. However, if the pipe is of uniform grade, size, and thickness, only 10 individual lengths or 5 percent of all lengths, whichever is greater, need be measured. The thickness of the lengths that are not measured must be verified by applying a gage set to the minimum thickness found by the measurement. The nominal wall thickness to be used is the next wall thickness found in commercial specifications that is below the average of all the measurements taken. However, the nominal wall thickness may not be more than 1.14 times the smallest measurement taken on pipe that is less than 20 inches (508 mm) nominal outside diameter, nor more than 1.11 times the smallest measurement taken on pipe that is 20 inches (508 mm) or more in nominal outside diameter.

                (d) The minimum wall thickness of the pipe may not be less than 87.5 percent of the value used for nominal wall thickness in determining the internal design pressure under paragraph (a) of this section. In addition, the anticipated external loads and external pressures that are concurrent with internal pressure must be considered in accordance with §§ 195.108 and 195.110 and, after determining the internal design pressure, the nominal wall thickness must be increased as necessary to compensate for these concurrent loads and pressures.

                (e)(1) The seam joint factor used in paragraph (a) of this section is determined in accordance with the following standards incorporated by reference (see § 195.3):

                § 195.303
                Risk-based alternative to pressure testing older hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines.
                (a) An operator may elect to follow a program for testing a pipeline on risk-based criteria as an alternative to the pressure testing in § 195.302(b)(1)(i)-(iii) and § 195.302(b)(2)(i) of this subpart. Appendix B provides guidance on how this program will work. An operator electing such a program shall assign a risk classification to each pipeline segment according to the indicators described in paragraph (b) of this section as follows:
                (1) Risk Classification A if the location indicator is ranked as low or medium risk, the product and volume indicators are ranked as low risk, and the probability of failure indicator is ranked as low risk;
                (2) Risk Classification C if the location indicator is ranked as high risk; or
                (3) Risk Classification B.
                (b) An operator shall evaluate each pipeline segment in the program according to the following indicators of risk:
                (1) The location indicator is—
                (i) High risk if an area is non-rural or environmentally sensitive 1; or
                (ii) Medium risk; or
                (iii) Low risk if an area is not high or medium risk.
                (2) The product indicator is 1
                  
                
                
                  
                    1 (See Appendix B, Table C).
                
                (i) High risk if the product transported is highly toxic or is both highly volatile and flammable;
                (ii) Medium risk if the product transported is flammable with a flashpoint of less than 100 °F, but not highly volatile; or
                (iii) Low risk if the product transported is not high or medium risk.
                (3) The volume indicator is—
                (i) High risk if the line is at least 18 inches in nominal diameter;
                (ii) Medium risk if the line is at least 10 inches, but less than 18 inches, in nominal diameter; or
                (iii) Low risk if the line is not high or medium risk.
                (4) The probability of failure indicator is—
                (i) High risk if the segment has experienced more than three failures in the last 10 years due to time-dependent defects (e.g., corrosion, gouges, or problems developed during manufacture, construction or operation, etc.); or
                (ii) Low risk if the segment has experienced three failures or less in the last 10 years due to time-dependent defects.
                (c) The program under paragraph (a) of this section shall provide for pressure testing for a segment constructed of electric resistance-welded (ERW) pipe and lapwelded pipe manufactured prior to 1970 susceptible to longitudinal seam failures as determined through paragraph (d) of this section. The timing of such pressure test may be determined based on risk classifications discussed under paragraph (b) of this section. For other segments, the program may provide for use of a magnetic flux leakage or ultrasonic internal inspection survey as an alternative to pressure testing and, in the case of such segments in Risk Classification A, may provide for no additional measures under this subpart.

                (d) All pre-1970 ERW pipe and lapwelded pipe is deemed susceptible to longitudinal seam failures unless an engineering analysis shows otherwise. In conducting an engineering analysis an operator must consider the seam-related leak history of the pipe and pipe manufacturing information as available, which may include the pipe steel's mechanical properties, including fracture toughness; the manufacturing process and controls related to seam properties, including whether the ERW process was high-frequency or low-frequency, whether the weld seam was heat treated, whether the seam was inspected, the test pressure and duration during mill hydrotest; the quality control of the steel-making process; and other factors pertinent to seam properties and quality.
                
                (e) Pressure testing done under this section must be conducted in accordance with this subpart. Except for segments in Risk Classification B which are not constructed with pre-1970 ERW pipe, water must be the test medium.
                (f) An operator electing to follow a program under paragraph (a) must develop plans that include the method of testing and a schedule for the testing by December 7, 1998. The compliance deadlines for completion of testing are as shown in the table below:

If the risk classification of an untested or uninspected segment changes, an operator must take appropriate action within two years, or establish the maximum operating pressure under § 195.406(a)(5).
                (h) An operator must maintain records establishing compliance with this section, including records verifying the risk classifications, the plans and schedule for testing, the conduct of the testing, and the review of the risk classifications.

                § 195.414
                Inspections of pipelines in areas affected by extreme weather and natural disasters.
                (a) General. Following an extreme weather event or natural disaster that has the likelihood of damage to infrastructure by the scouring or movement of the soil surrounding the pipeline, such as a named tropical storm or hurricane; a flood that exceeds the river, shoreline, or creek high-water banks in the area of the pipeline; a landslide in the area of the pipeline; or an earthquake in the area of the pipeline, an operator must inspect all potentially affected pipeline facilities to detect conditions that could adversely affect the safe operation of that pipeline.
                (b) Inspection method. An operator must consider the nature of the event and the physical characteristics, operating conditions, location, and prior history of the affected pipeline in determining the appropriate method for performing the initial inspection to determine the extent of any damage and the need for the additional assessments required under paragraph (a) of this section.
                (c) Time period. The inspection required under paragraph (a) of this section must commence within 72 hours after the cessation of the event, defined as the point in time when the affected area can be safely accessed by the personnel and equipment required to perform the inspection as determined under paragraph (b) of this section. In the event that the operator is unable to commence the inspection due to the unavailability of personnel or equipment, the operator must notify the appropriate PHMSA Region Director as soon as practicable.
                (d) Remedial action. An operator must take prompt and appropriate remedial action to ensure the safe operation of a pipeline based on the information obtained as a result of performing the inspection required under paragraph (a) of this section. Such actions might include, but are not limited to:
                (1) Reducing the operating pressure or shutting down the pipeline;
                (2) Modifying, repairing, or replacing any damaged pipeline facilities;
                (3) Preventing, mitigating, or eliminating any unsafe conditions in the pipeline right-of-way;
                (4) Performing additional patrols, surveys, tests, or inspections;
                (5) Implementing emergency response activities with Federal, State, or local personnel; and
                (6) Notifying affected communities of the steps that can be taken to ensure public safety.

                § 195.416
                Pipeline assessments.
                (a) Scope. This section applies to onshore line pipe that can accommodate inspection by means of in-line inspection tools and is not subject to the integrity management requirements in § 195.452.
                (b) General. An operator must perform an initial assessment of each of its pipeline segments by October 1, 2029, and perform periodic assessments of its pipeline segments at least once every 10 calendar years from the year of the prior assessment or as otherwise necessary to ensure public safety or the protection of the environment.
                (c) Method. Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, an operator must perform the integrity assessment for the range of relevant threats to the pipeline segment by the use of an appropriate in-line inspection tool(s). When performing an assessment using an in-line inspection tool, an operator must comply with § 195.591. An operator must explicitly consider uncertainties in reported results (including tool tolerance, anomaly findings, and unity chart plots or other equivalent methods for determining uncertainties) in identifying anomalies. If this is impracticable based on operational limits, including operating pressure, low flow, and pipeline length or availability of in-line inspection tool technology for the pipe diameter, then the operator must perform the assessment using the appropriate method(s) in paragraphs (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this section for the range of relevant threats being assessed. The methods an operator selects to assess low-frequency electric resistance welded pipe, pipe with a seam factor less than 1.0 as defined in § 195.106(e) or lap-welded pipe susceptible to longitudinal seam failure must be capable of assessing seam integrity, cracking, and of detecting corrosion and deformation anomalies. The following alternative assessment methods may be used as specified in this paragraph:
                (1) A pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart E of this part;
                (2) External corrosion direct assessment in accordance with § 195.588; or
                (3) Other technology in accordance with paragraph (d).
                (d) Other technology. Operators may elect to use other technologies if the operator can demonstrate the technology can provide an equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe for threat being assessed. An operator choosing this option must notify the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) 90 days before conducting the assessment by:
                (1) Sending the notification, along with the information required to demonstrate compliance with this paragraph, to the Information Resources Manager, Office of Pipeline Safety, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE, Washington, DC 20590; or
                (2) Sending the notification, along with the information required to demonstrate compliance with this paragraph, to the Information Resources Manager by facsimile to (202) 366-7128.
                (3) Prior to conducting the “other technology” assessments, the operator must receive a notice of “no objection” from the PHMSA Information Services Manager or Designee.
                (e) Data analysis. A person qualified by knowledge, training, and experience must analyze the data obtained from an assessment performed under paragraph (b) of this section to determine if a condition could adversely affect the safe operation of the pipeline. Operators must consider uncertainties in any reported results (including tool tolerance) as part of that analysis.
                (f) Discovery of condition. For purposes of § 195.401(b)(1), discovery of a condition occurs when an operator has adequate information to determine that a condition presenting a potential threat to the integrity of the pipeline exists. An operator must promptly, but no later than 180 days after an assessment, obtain sufficient information about a condition to make that determination required under paragraph (e) of this section, unless the operator can demonstrate the 180-day interval is impracticable. If the operator believes that 180 days are impracticable to make a determination about a condition found during an assessment, the pipeline operator must notify PHMSA and provide an expected date when adequate information will become available. This notification must be made in accordance with § 195.452 (m).
                (g) Remediation. An operator must comply with the requirements in § 195.401 if a condition that could adversely affect the safe operation of a pipeline is discovered in complying with paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.
                (h) Consideration of information. An operator must consider all relevant information about a pipeline in complying with the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section.

                (b) No operator may move any pipeline containing highly volatile liquids where materials in the line section involved are joined by welding unless—
                (1) Movement when the pipeline does not contain highly volatile liquids is impractical;
                (2) The procedures of the operator under § 195.402 contain precautions to protect the public against the hazard in moving pipelines containing highly volatile liquids, including the use of warnings, where necessary, to evacuate the area close to the pipeline; and
                (3) The pressure in that line section is reduced to the lower of the following:
                (i) Fifty percent or less of the maximum operating pressure; or
                (ii) The lowest practical level that will maintain the highly volatile liquid in a liquid state with continuous flow, but not less than 50 p.s.i. (345 kPa) gage above the vapor pressure of the commodity.
                (c) No operator may move any pipeline containing highly volatile liquids where materials in the line section involved are not joined by welding unless—

                (b) Each operator must inspect the physical integrity of in-service atmospheric and low-pressure steel above-ground breakout tanks according to API Std 653 (except section 6.4.3, Alternative Internal Inspection Interval) (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3). However, if structural conditions prevent access to the tank bottom, its integrity may be assessed according to a plan included in the operations and maintenance manual under § 195.402(c)(3). The risk-based internal inspection procedures in API Std 653, section 6.4.3 cannot be used to determine the internal inspection interval.

                (1) Operators who established internal inspection intervals based on risk-based inspection procedures prior to March 6, 2015 must re-establish internal inspection intervals based on API Std 653, section 6.4.2 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3).
                (i) If the internal inspection interval was determined by the prior risk-based inspection procedure using API Std 653, section 6.4.3 and the resulting calculation exceeded 20 years, and it has been more than 20 years since an internal inspection was performed, the operator must complete a new internal inspection in accordance with § 195.432(b)(1) by January 5, 2017.
                (ii) If the internal inspection interval was determined by the prior risk-based inspection procedure using API Std 653, section 6.4.3 and the resulting calculation was less than or equal to 20 years, and the time since the most recent internal inspection exceeds the re-established inspection interval in accordance with § 195.432(b)(1), the operator must complete a new internal inspection by January 5, 2017.

                (iii) If the internal inspection interval was not based upon current engineering and operational information (i.e., actual corrosion rate of floor plates, actual remaining thickness of the floor plates, etc.), the operator must complete a new internal inspection by January 5, 2017 and re-establish a new internal inspection interval in accordance with § 195.432(b)(1).

                (a) Each pipeline operator must develop and implement a written continuing public education program that follows the guidance provided in the American Petroleum Institute's (API) Recommended Practice (RP) 1162 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3).
                (b) The operator's program must follow the general program recommendations of API RP 1162 and assess the unique attributes and characteristics of the operator's pipeline and facilities.
                (c) The operator must follow the general program recommendations, including baseline and supplemental requirements of API RP 1162, unless the operator provides justification in its program or procedural manual as to why compliance with all or certain provisions of the recommended practice is not practicable and not necessary for safety.
                (d) The operator's program must specifically include provisions to educate the public, appropriate government organizations, and persons engaged in excavation related activities on:
                (1) Use of a one-call notification system prior to excavation and other damage prevention activities;
                (2) Possible hazards associated with unintended releases from a hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide pipeline facility;
                (3) Physical indications that such a release may have occurred;
                (4) Steps that should be taken for public safety in the event of a hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide pipeline release; and

                § 195.442
                Damage prevention program.
                (a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, each operator of a buried pipeline must carry out, in accordance with this section, a written program to prevent damage to that pipeline from excavation activities. For the purpose of this section, the term “excavation activities” includes excavation, blasting, boring, tunneling, backfilling, the removal of aboveground structures by either explosive or mechanical means, and other earthmoving operations.

                (b) An operator may comply with any of the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section through participation in a public service program, such as a one-call system, but such participation does not relieve the operator of the responsibility for compliance with this section. However, an operator must perform the duties of paragraph (c)(3) of this section through participation in a one-call system, if that one-call system is a qualified one-call system. In areas that are covered by more than one qualified one-call system, an operator need only join one of the qualified one-call systems if there is a central telephone number for excavators to call for excavation activities, or if the one-call systems in those areas communicate with one another. An operator's pipeline system must be covered by a qualified one-call system where there is one in place. For the purpose of this section, a one-call system is considered a “qualified one-call system” if it meets the requirements of section (b)(1) or (b)(2) or this section.
                (1) The state has adopted a one-call damage prevention program under § 198.37 of this chapter; or
                (2) The one-call system:
                (i) Is operated in accordance with § 198.39 of this chapter;
                (ii) Provides a pipeline operator an opportunity similar to a voluntary participant to have a part in management responsibilities; and
                (iii) Assesses a participating pipeline operator a fee that is proportionate to the costs of the one-call system's coverage of the operator's pipeline.
                (c) The damage prevention program required by paragraph (a) of this section must, at a minimum:
                (1) Include the identity, on a current basis, of persons who normally engage in excavation activities in the area in which the pipeline is located.
                (2) Provides for notification of the public in the vicinity of the pipeline and actual notification of persons identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section of the following as often as needed to make them aware of the damage prevention program:
                (i) The program's existence and purpose; and
                (ii) How to learn the location of underground pipelines before excavation activities are begun.
                (3) Provide a means of receiving and recording notification of planned excavation activities.
                (4) If the operator has buried pipelines in the area of excavation activity, provide for actual notification of persons who give notice of their intent to excavate of the type of temporary marking to be provided and how to identify the markings.
                (5) Provide for temporary marking of buried pipelines in the area of excavation activity before, as far as practical, the activity begins.
                (6) Provide as follows for inspection of pipelines that an operator has reason to believe could be damaged by excavation activities:
                (i) The inspection must be done as frequently as necessary during and after the activities to verify the integrity of the pipeline; and
                (ii) In the case of blasting, any inspection must include leakage surveys.
                (d) A damage prevention program under this section is not required for the following pipelines:
                (1) Pipelines located offshore.
                (2) Pipelines to which access is physically controlled by the operator.

                  Effective Date Note:
                  At 84 FR 52296, Oct. 1, 2019, § 195.444 was revised, effective July 1, 2020. For the convenience of the user, the revised text is set forth as follows:
                  
                    
                      § 195.444
                      Leak detection.
                      (a) Scope. Except for offshore gathering and regulated rural gathering pipelines, this section applies to all hazardous liquid pipelines transporting liquid in single phase (without gas in the liquid).
                      (b) General. A pipeline must have an effective system for detecting leaks in accordance with §§ 195.134 or 195.452, as appropriate. An operator must evaluate the capability of its leak detection system to protect the public, property, and the environment and modify it as necessary to do so. At a minimum, an operator's evaluation must consider the following factors—length and size of the pipeline, type of product carried, the swiftness of leak detection, location of nearest response personnel, and leak history.
                      (c) CPM leak detection systems. Each computational pipeline monitoring (CPM) leak detection system installed on a hazardous liquid pipeline must comply with API RP 1130 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) in operating, maintaining, testing, record keeping, and dispatcher training of the system.
                    
                  
                
              
              
                § 195.446
                Control room management.
                (a) General. This section applies to each operator of a pipeline facility with a controller working in a control room who monitors and controls all or part of a pipeline facility through a SCADA system. Each operator must have and follow written control room management procedures that implement the requirements of this section. The procedures required by this section must be integrated, as appropriate, with the operator's written procedures required by § 195.402. An operator must develop the procedures no later than August 1, 2011, and must implement the procedures according to the following schedule. The procedures required by paragraphs (b), (c)(5), (d)(2) and (d)(3), (f) and (g) of this section must be implemented no later than October 1, 2011. The procedures required by paragraphs (c)(1) through (4), (d)(1), (d)(4), and (e) must be implemented no later than August 1, 2012. The training procedures required by paragraph (h) must be implemented no later than August 1, 2012, except that any training required by another paragraph of this section must be implemented no later than the deadline for that paragraph.
                (b) Roles and responsibilities. Each operator must define the roles and responsibilities of a controller during normal, abnormal, and emergency operating conditions. To provide for a controller's prompt and appropriate response to operating conditions, an operator must define each of the following:
                (1) A controller's authority and responsibility to make decisions and take actions during normal operations;
                (2) A controller's role when an abnormal operating condition is detected, even if the controller is not the first to detect the condition, including the controller's responsibility to take specific actions and to communicate with others;
                (3) A controller's role during an emergency, even if the controller is not the first to detect the emergency, including the controller's responsibility to take specific actions and to communicate with others;
                (4) A method of recording controller shift-changes and any hand-over of responsibility between controllers; and
                (5) The roles, responsibilities and qualifications of others who have the authority to direct or supersede the specific technical actions of controllers.
                (c) Provide adequate information. Each operator must provide its controllers with the information, tools, processes and procedures necessary for the controllers to carry out the roles and responsibilities the operator has defined by performing each of the following:

                (1) Implement API RP 1165 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) whenever a SCADA system is added, expanded or replaced, unless the operator demonstrates that certain provisions of API RP 1165 are not practical for the SCADA system used;
                (2) Conduct a point-to-point verification between SCADA displays and related field equipment when field equipment is added or moved and when other changes that affect pipeline safety are made to field equipment or SCADA displays;
                (3) Test and verify an internal communication plan to provide adequate means for manual operation of the pipeline safely, at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months;
                (4) Test any backup SCADA systems at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months; and

                (5) Implement section 5 of API RP 1168 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) to establish procedures for when a different controller assumes responsibility, including the content of information to be exchanged.
                (d) Fatigue mitigation. Each operator must implement the following methods to reduce the risk associated with controller fatigue that could inhibit a controller's ability to carry out the roles and responsibilities the operator has defined:
                (1) Establish shift lengths and schedule rotations that provide controllers off-duty time sufficient to achieve eight hours of continuous sleep;
                (2) Educate controllers and supervisors in fatigue mitigation strategies and how off-duty activities contribute to fatigue;
                (3) Train controllers and supervisors to recognize the effects of fatigue; and
                (4) Establish a maximum limit on controller hours-of-service, which may provide for an emergency deviation from the maximum limit if necessary for the safe operation of a pipeline facility.
                (e) Alarm management. Each operator using a SCADA system must have a written alarm management plan to provide for effective controller response to alarms. An operator's plan must include provisions to:
                (1) Review SCADA safety-related alarm operations using a process that ensures alarms are accurate and support safe pipeline operations;
                (2) Identify at least once each calendar month points affecting safety that have been taken off scan in the SCADA host, have had alarms inhibited, generated false alarms, or that have had forced or manual values for periods of time exceeding that required for associated maintenance or operating activities;
                (3) Verify the correct safety-related alarm set-point values and alarm descriptions when associated field instruments are calibrated or changed and at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months;
                (4) Review the alarm management plan required by this paragraph at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not exceeding 15 months, to determine the effectiveness of the plan;
                (5) Monitor the content and volume of general activity being directed to and required of each controller at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not exceeding 15 months, that will assure controllers have sufficient time to analyze and react to incoming alarms; and
                (6) Address deficiencies identified through the implementation of paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(5) of this section.
                (f) Change management. Each operator must assure that changes that could affect control room operations are coordinated with the control room personnel by performing each of the following:
                (1) Implement section 7 of API RP 1168 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) for control room management change and require coordination between control room representatives, operator's management, and associated field personnel when planning and implementing physical changes to pipeline equipment or configuration; and
                (2) Require its field personnel to contact the control room when emergency conditions exist and when making field changes that affect control room operations.
                (g) Operating experience. Each operator must assure that lessons learned from its operating experience are incorporated, as appropriate, into its control room management procedures by performing each of the following:
                (1) Review accidents that must be reported pursuant to § 195.50 and 195.52 to determine if control room actions contributed to the event and, if so, correct, where necessary, deficiencies related to:
                (i) Controller fatigue;
                (ii) Field equipment;
                (iii) The operation of any relief device;
                (iv) Procedures;
                (v) SCADA system configuration; and
                (vi) SCADA system performance.
                (2) Include lessons learned from the operator's experience in the training program required by this section.
                (h) Training. Each operator must establish a controller training program and review the training program content to identify potential improvements at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months. An operator's program must provide for training each controller to carry out the roles and responsibilities defined by the operator. In addition, the training program must include the following elements:
                
                (1) Responding to abnormal operating conditions likely to occur simultaneously or in sequence;
                (2) Use of a computerized simulator or non-computerized (tabletop) method for training controllers to recognize abnormal operating conditions;
                (3) Training controllers on their responsibilities for communication under the operator's emergency response procedures;
                (4) Training that will provide a controller a working knowledge of the pipeline system, especially during the development of abnormal operating conditions;
                (5) For pipeline operating setups that are periodically, but infrequently used, providing an opportunity for controllers to review relevant procedures in advance of their application; and
                (6) Control room team training and exercises that include both controllers and other individuals, defined by the operator, who would reasonably be expected to operationally collaborate with controllers (control room personnel) during normal, abnormal or emergency situations. Operators must comply with the team training requirements under this paragraph no later than January 23, 2018.
                (i) Compliance validation. Upon request, operators must submit their procedures to PHMSA or, in the case of an intrastate pipeline facility regulated by a State, to the appropriate State agency.
                (j) Compliance and deviations. An operator must maintain for review during inspection:
                (1) Records that demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this section; and
                (2) Documentation to demonstrate that any deviation from the procedures required by this section was necessary for the safe operation of the pipeline facility.

                      1 year after the date the pipeline begins operation.
                    
                  
                  (2) Include in the program an identification of each pipeline or pipeline segment in the first column of the following table not later than the date in the second column:

                      Date the pipeline begins operation.
                    
                  
                  (3) Include in the program a plan to carry out baseline assessments of line pipe as required by paragraph (c) of this section.
                  (4) Include in the program a framework that—
                  (i) Addresses each element of the integrity management program under paragraph (f) of this section, including continual integrity assessment and evaluation under paragraph (j) of this section; and
                  (ii) Initially indicates how decisions will be made to implement each element.
                  (5) Implement and follow the program.
                  (6) Follow recognized industry practices in carrying out this section, unless—
                  (i) This section specifies otherwise; or
                  (ii) The operator demonstrates that an alternative practice is supported by a reliable engineering evaluation and provides an equivalent level of public safety and environmental protection.
                  (c) What must be in the baseline assessment plan? (1) An operator must include each of the following elements in its written baseline assessment plan:
                  (i) The methods selected to assess the integrity of the line pipe. An operator must assess the integrity of the line pipe by any of the following methods. The methods an operator selects to assess low frequency electric resistance welded pipe or lap welded pipe susceptible to longitudinal seam failure must be capable of assessing seam integrity and of detecting corrosion and deformation anomalies.
                  (A) In-Line Inspection tool or tools capable of detecting corrosion and deformation anomalies, including dents, gouges, and grooves. For pipeline segments that are susceptible to cracks (pipe body and weld seams), an operator must use an in-line inspection tool or tools capable of detecting crack anomalies. When performing an assessment using an In-Line Inspection Tool, an operator must comply with § 195.591;
                  (B) Pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart E of this part;
                  (C) External corrosion direct assessment in accordance with § 195.588; or
                  (D) Other technology that the operator demonstrates can provide an equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe. An operator choosing this option must notify the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) 90 days before conducting the assessment, by sending a notice to the address or facsimile number specified in paragraph (m) of this section.
                  (ii) A schedule for completing the integrity assessment;
                  (iii) An explanation of the assessment methods selected and evaluation of risk factors considered in establishing the assessment schedule.

                  (2) An operator must document, prior to implementing any changes to the plan, any modification to the plan, and reasons for the modification.
                  (d) When must operators complete baseline assessments? Operators must complete baseline assessments as follows:
                  (1) Time periods. Complete assessments before the following deadlines:
                  
                    
                      If the pipeline is:
                      Then complete baseline assessments not later than the following date according to a schedule that prioritizes assessments:
                      And assess at least 50 percent of the line pipe on an expedited basis, beginning with the highest risk pipe, not later than:

                  (2) Prior assessment. To satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section for pipelines in the first column of the following table, operators may use integrity assessments conducted after the date in the second column, if the integrity assessment method complies with this section. However, if an operator uses this prior assessment as its baseline assessment, the operator must reassess the line pipe according to paragraph (j)(3) of this section. The table follows:

                  (3) Newly-identified areas. (i) When information is available from the information analysis (see paragraph (g) of this section), or from Census Bureau maps, that the population density around a pipeline segment has changed so as to fall within the definition in § 195.450 of a high population area or other populated area, the operator must incorporate the area into its baseline assessment plan as a high consequence area within one year from the date the area is identified. An operator must complete the baseline assessment of any line pipe that could affect the newly-identified high consequence area within five years from the date the area is identified.
                  (ii) An operator must incorporate a new unusually sensitive area into its baseline assessment plan within one year from the date the area is identified. An operator must complete the baseline assessment of any line pipe that could affect the newly-identified high consequence area within five years from the date the area is identified.
                  (e) What are the risk factors for establishing an assessment schedule (for both the baseline and continual integrity assessments)? (1) An operator must establish an integrity assessment schedule that prioritizes pipeline segments for assessment (see paragraphs (d)(1) and (j)(3) of this section). An operator must base the assessment schedule on all risk factors that reflect the risk conditions on the pipeline segment. The factors an operator must consider include, but are not limited to:
                  (i) Results of the previous integrity assessment, defect type and size that the assessment method can detect, and defect growth rate;
                  (ii) Pipe size, material, manufacturing information, coating type and condition, and seam type;
                  (iii) Leak history, repair history and cathodic protection history;
                  (iv) Product transported;
                  (v) Operating stress level;
                  (vi) Existing or projected activities in the area;
                  (vii) Local environmental factors that could affect the pipeline (e.g., corrosivity of soil, subsidence, climatic);
                  (viii) geo-technical hazards; and
                  (ix) Physical support of the segment such as by a cable suspension bridge.
                  (2) Appendix C of this part provides further guidance on risk factors.
                  (f) What are the elements of an integrity management program? An integrity management program begins with the initial framework. An operator must continually change the program to reflect operating experience, conclusions drawn from results of the integrity assessments, and other maintenance and surveillance data, and evaluation of consequences of a failure on the high consequence area. An operator must include, at minimum, each of the following elements in its written integrity management program:
                  (1) A process for identifying which pipeline segments could affect a high consequence area;
                  (2) A baseline assessment plan meeting the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section;
                  (3) An analysis that integrates all available information about the integrity of the entire pipeline and the consequences of a failure (see paragraph (g) of this section);
                  (4) Criteria for remedial actions to address integrity issues raised by the assessment methods and information analysis (see paragraph (h) of this section);
                  (5) A continual process of assessment and evaluation to maintain a pipeline's integrity (see paragraph (j) of this section);
                  (6) Identification of preventive and mitigative measures to protect the high consequence area (see paragraph (i) of this section);
                  (7) Methods to measure the program's effectiveness (see paragraph (k) of this section);
                  (8) A process for review of integrity assessment results and information analysis by a person qualified to evaluate the results and information (see paragraph (h)(2) of this section).
                  (g) What is an information analysis? In periodically evaluating the integrity of each pipeline segment (paragraph (j) of this section), an operator must analyze all available information about the integrity of the entire pipeline and the consequences of a failure. This information includes:
                  (1) Information critical to determining the potential for, and preventing, damage due to excavation, including current and planned damage prevention activities, and development or planned development along the pipeline segment;
                  (2) Data gathered through the integrity assessment required under this section;
                  (3) Data gathered in conjunction with other inspections, tests, surveillance and patrols required by this Part, including, corrosion control monitoring and cathodic protection surveys; and
                  (4) Information about how a failure would affect the high consequence area, such as location of the water intake.
                  (h) What actions must an operator take to address integrity issues?—(1) General requirements. An operator must take prompt action to address all anomalous conditions the operator discovers through the integrity assessment or information analysis. In addressing all conditions, an operator must evaluate all anomalous conditions and remediate those that could reduce a pipeline's integrity. An operator must be able to demonstrate that the remediation of the condition will ensure the condition is unlikely to pose a threat to the long-term integrity of the pipeline. An operator must comply with § 195.422 when making a repair.
                  (i) Temporary pressure reduction. An operator must notify PHMSA, in accordance with paragraph (m) of this section, if the operator cannot meet the schedule for evaluation and remediation required under paragraph (h)(3) of this section and cannot provide safety through a temporary reduction in operating pressure.
                  (ii) Long-term pressure reduction. When a pressure reduction exceeds 365 days, the operator must notify PHMSA in accordance with paragraph (m) of this section and explain the reasons for the delay. An operator must also take further remedial action to ensure the safety of the pipeline.
                  (2) Discovery of condition. Discovery of a condition occurs when an operator has adequate information about the condition to determine that the condition presents a potential threat to the integrity of the pipeline. An operator must promptly, but no later than 180 days after an integrity assessment, obtain sufficient information about a condition to make that determination, unless the operator can demonstrate that the 180-day period is impracticable.
                  (3) Schedule for evaluation and remediation. An operator must complete remediation of a condition according to a schedule prioritizing the conditions for evaluation and remediation. If an operator cannot meet the schedule for any condition, the operator must explain the reasons why it cannot meet the schedule and how the changed schedule will not jeopardize public safety or environmental protection.
                  (4) Special requirements for scheduling remediation—(i) Immediate repair conditions. An operator's evaluation and remediation schedule must provide for immediate repair conditions. To maintain safety, an operator must temporarily reduce the operating pressure or shut down the pipeline until the operator completes the repair of these conditions. An operator must calculate the temporary reduction in operating pressure using the formulas referenced in paragraph (h)(4)(i)(B) of this section. If no suitable remaining strength calculation method can be identified, an operator must implement a minimum 20 percent or greater operating pressure reduction, based on actual operating pressure for two months prior to the date of inspection, until the anomaly is repaired. An operator must treat the following conditions as immediate repair conditions:
                  (A) Metal loss greater than 80% of nominal wall regardless of dimensions.

                  (B) A calculation of the remaining strength of the pipe shows a predicted burst pressure less than the established maximum operating pressure at the location of the anomaly. Suitable remaining strength calculation methods include, but are not limited to, ASME/ANSI B31G (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) and PRCI PR-3-805 (R-STRENG) (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3).
                  (C) A dent located on the top of the pipeline (above the 4 and 8 o'clock positions) that has any indication of metal loss, cracking or a stress riser.
                  (D) A dent located on the top of the pipeline (above the 4 and 8 o'clock positions) with a depth greater than 6% of the nominal pipe diameter.
                  (E) An anomaly that in the judgment of the person designated by the operator to evaluate the assessment results requires immediate action.
                  (ii) 60-day conditions. Except for conditions listed in paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, an operator must schedule evaluation and remediation of the following conditions within 60 days of discovery of condition.
                  (A) A dent located on the top of the pipeline (above the 4 and 8 o'clock positions) with a depth greater than 3% of the pipeline diameter (greater than 0.250 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than Nominal Pipe Size (NPS) 12).
                  (B) A dent located on the bottom of the pipeline that has any indication of metal loss, cracking or a stress riser.
                  (iii) 180-day conditions. Except for conditions listed in paragraph (h)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section, an operator must schedule evaluation and remediation of the following within 180 days of discovery of the condition:
                  (A) A dent with a depth greater than 2% of the pipeline's diameter (0.250 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS 12) that affects pipe curvature at a girth weld or a longitudinal seam weld.
                  (B) A dent located on the top of the pipeline (above 4 and 8 o'clock position) with a depth greater than 2% of the pipeline's diameter (0.250 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS 12).
                  (C) A dent located on the bottom of the pipeline with a depth greater than 6% of the pipeline's diameter.
                  (D) A calculation of the remaining strength of the pipe shows an operating pressure that is less than the current established maximum operating pressure at the location of the anomaly. Suitable remaining strength calculation methods include, but are not limited to, ASME/ANSI B31G and PRCI PR-3-805 (R-STRENG).
                  (E) An area of general corrosion with a predicted metal loss greater than 50% of nominal wall.
                  (F) Predicted metal loss greater than 50% of nominal wall that is located at a crossing of another pipeline, or is in an area with widespread circumferential corrosion, or is in an area that could affect a girth weld.
                  (G) A potential crack indication that when excavated is determined to be a crack.
                  (H) Corrosion of or along a longitudinal seam weld.
                  (I) A gouge or groove greater than 12.5% of nominal wall.
                  (iv) Other conditions. In addition to the conditions listed in paragraphs (h)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section, an operator must evaluate any condition identified by an integrity assessment or information analysis that could impair the integrity of the pipeline, and as appropriate, schedule the condition for remediation. Appendix C of this part contains guidance concerning other conditions that an operator should evaluate.
                  (i) What preventive and mitigative measures must an operator take to protect the high consequence area?—(1) General requirements. An operator must take measures to prevent and mitigate the consequences of a pipeline failure that could affect a high consequence area. These measures include conducting a risk analysis of the pipeline segment to identify additional actions to enhance public safety or environmental protection. Such actions may include, but are not limited to, implementing damage prevention best practices, better monitoring of cathodic protection where corrosion is a concern, establishing shorter inspection intervals, installing EFRDs on the pipeline segment, modifying the systems that monitor pressure and detect leaks, providing additional training to personnel on response procedures, conducting drills with local emergency responders and adopting other management controls.
                  (2) Risk analysis criteria. In identifying the need for additional preventive and mitigative measures, an operator must evaluate the likelihood of a pipeline release occurring and how a release could affect the high consequence area. This determination must consider all relevant risk factors, including, but not limited to:
                  (i) Terrain surrounding the pipeline segment, including drainage systems such as small streams and other smaller waterways that could act as a conduit to the high consequence area;
                  (ii) Elevation profile;
                  (iii) Characteristics of the product transported;
                  (iv) Amount of product that could be released;
                  (v) Possibility of a spillage in a farm field following the drain tile into a waterway;
                  (vi) Ditches along side a roadway the pipeline crosses;
                  (vii) Physical support of the pipeline segment such as by a cable suspension bridge;
                  (viii) Exposure of the pipeline to operating pressure exceeding established maximum operating pressure.
                  (3) Leak detection. An operator must have a means to detect leaks on its pipeline system. An operator must evaluate the capability of its leak detection means and modify, as necessary, to protect the high consequence area. An operator's evaluation must, at least, consider, the following factors—length and size of the pipeline, type of product carried, the pipeline's proximity to the high consequence area, the swiftness of leak detection, location of nearest response personnel, leak history, and risk assessment results.
                  (4) Emergency Flow Restricting Devices (EFRD). If an operator determines that an EFRD is needed on a pipeline segment to protect a high consequence area in the event of a hazardous liquid pipeline release, an operator must install the EFRD. In making this determination, an operator must, at least, consider the following factors—the swiftness of leak detection and pipeline shutdown capabilities, the type of commodity carried, the rate of potential leakage, the volume that can be released, topography or pipeline profile, the potential for ignition, proximity to power sources, location of nearest response personnel, specific terrain between the pipeline segment and the high consequence area, and benefits expected by reducing the spill size.
                  (j) What is a continual process of evaluation and assessment to maintain a pipeline's integrity?—(1) General. After completing the baseline integrity assessment, an operator must continue to assess the line pipe at specified intervals and periodically evaluate the integrity of each pipeline segment that could affect a high consequence area.
                  (2) Evaluation. An operator must conduct a periodic evaluation as frequently as needed to assure pipeline integrity. An operator must base the frequency of evaluation on risk factors specific to its pipeline, including the factors specified in paragraph (e) of this section. The evaluation must consider the results of the baseline and periodic integrity assessments, information analysis (paragraph (g) of this section), and decisions about remediation, and preventive and mitigative actions (paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section).
                  (3) Assessment intervals. An operator must establish five-year intervals, not to exceed 68 months, for continually assessing the line pipe's integrity. An operator must base the assessment intervals on the risk the line pipe poses to the high consequence area to determine the priority for assessing the pipeline segments. An operator must establish the assessment intervals based on the factors specified in paragraph (e) of this section, the analysis of the results from the last integrity assessment, and the information analysis required by paragraph (g) of this section.
                  (4) Variance from the 5-year intervals in limited situations—(i) Engineering basis. An operator may be able to justify an engineering basis for a longer assessment interval on a segment of line pipe. The justification must be supported by a reliable engineering evaluation combined with the use of other technology, such as external monitoring technology, that provides an understanding of the condition of the line pipe equivalent to that which can be obtained from the assessment methods allowed in paragraph (j)(5) of this section. An operator must notify OPS 270 days before the end of the five-year (or less) interval of the justification for a longer interval, and propose an alternative interval. An operator must send the notice to the address specified in paragraph (m) of this section.
                  (ii) Unavailable technology. An operator may require a longer assessment period for a segment of line pipe (for example, because sophisticated internal inspection technology is not available). An operator must justify the reasons why it cannot comply with the required assessment period and must also demonstrate the actions it is taking to evaluate the integrity of the pipeline segment in the interim. An operator must notify OPS 180 days before the end of the five-year (or less) interval that the operator may require a longer assessment interval, and provide an estimate of when the assessment can be completed. An operator must send a notice to the address specified in paragraph (m) of this section.
                  (5) Assessment methods. An operator must assess the integrity of the line pipe by any of the following methods. The methods an operator selects to assess low frequency electric resistance welded pipe or lap welded pipe susceptible to longitudinal seam failure must be capable of assessing seam integrity and of detecting corrosion and deformation anomalies.
                  (i) In-Line Inspection tool or tools capable of detecting corrosion and deformation anomalies, including dents, gouges, and grooves. For pipeline segments that are susceptible to cracks (pipe body and weld seams), an operator must use an in-line inspection tool or tools capable of detecting crack anomalies. When performing an assessment using an In-Line Inspection tool, an operator must comply with § 195.591;
                  (ii) Pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart E of this part;
                  (iii) External corrosion direct assessment in accordance with § 195.588; or
                  (iv) Other technology that the operator demonstrates can provide an equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe. An operator choosing this option must notify OPS 90 days before conducting the assessment, by sending a notice to the address or facsimile number specified in paragraph (m) of this section.
                  (k) What methods to measure program effectiveness must be used? An operator's program must include methods to measure whether the program is effective in assessing and evaluating the integrity of each pipeline segment and in protecting the high consequence areas. See Appendix C of this part for guidance on methods that can be used to evaluate a program's effectiveness.
                  (l) What records must an operator keep to demonstrate compliance? (1) An operator must maintain, for the useful life of the pipeline, records that demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this subpart. At a minimum, an operator must maintain the following records for review during an inspection:
                  (i) A written integrity management program in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

                  (ii) Documents to support the decisions and analyses, including any modifications, justifications, deviations and determinations made, variances, and actions taken, to implement and evaluate each element of the integrity management program listed in paragraph (f) of this section.
                  (2) See Appendix C of this part for examples of records an operator would be required to keep.
                  (m) How does an operator notify PHMSA? An operator must provide any notification required by this section by:

                  (1) Sending the notification by electronic mail to InformationResourcesManager@dot.gov; or
                  (2) Sending the notification by mail to ATTN: Information Resources Manager, DOT/PHMSA/OPS, East Building, 2nd Floor, E22-321, 1200 New Jersey Ave SE., Washington, DC 20590.

                        (i) The methods selected to assess the integrity of the line pipe. An operator must assess the integrity of the line pipe by in-line inspection tool(s) described in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section for the range of relevant threats to the pipeline segment. If it is impracticable based upon the construction of the pipeline (e.g., diameter changes, sharp bends, and elbows) or operational limits including operating pressure, low flow, pipeline length, or availability of in-line inspection tool technology for the pipe diameter, then the operator must use the appropriate method(s) in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(B), (C), or (D) of this section for the range of relevant threats to the pipeline segment. The methods an operator selects to assess low-frequency electric resistance welded pipe, pipe with a seam factor less than 1.0 as defined in § 195.106(e) or lap-welded pipe susceptible to longitudinal seam failure, must be capable of assessing seam integrity, cracking, and of detecting corrosion and deformation anomalies.
                        (A) In-line inspection tool or tools capable of detecting corrosion and deformation anomalies including dents, gouges, and grooves. For pipeline segments with an identified or probable risk or threat related to cracks (such as at pipe body or weld seams) based on the risk factors specified in paragraph (e), an operator must use an in-line inspection tool or tools capable of detecting crack anomalies. When performing an assessment using an in-line inspection tool, an operator must comply with § 195.591. An operator using this method must explicitly consider uncertainties in reported results (including tool tolerance, anomaly findings, and unity chart plots or equivalent for determining uncertainties) in identifying anomalies;
                        
                        (d) When must operators complete baseline assessments?
                        
                        (1) All pipelines. An operator must complete the baseline assessment before a new or conversion-to-service pipeline begins operation through the development of procedures, identification of high consequence areas, and pressure testing of could-affect high consequence areas in accordance with § 195.304.
                        
                        (2) Newly identified areas. If an operator obtains information (whether from the information analysis required under paragraph (g) of this section, Census Bureau maps, or any other source) demonstrating that the area around a pipeline segment has changed to meet the definition of a high consequence area (see § 195.450), that area must be incorporated into the operator's baseline assessment plan within 1 year from the date that the information is obtained. An operator must complete the baseline assessment of any pipeline segment that could affect a newly identified high consequence area within 5 years from the date an operator identifies the area.
                        
                        (e) * * *
                        (1) * * *

                        (vii) Local environmental factors that could affect the pipeline (e.g., seismicity, corrosivity of soil, subsidence, climatic);
                        
                        (g) What is an information analysis? In periodically evaluating the integrity of each pipeline segment (see paragraph (j) of this section), an operator must analyze all available information about the integrity of its entire pipeline and the consequences of a possible failure along the pipeline. Operators must continue to comply with the data integration elements specified in § 195.452(g) that were in effect on October 1, 2018, until October 1, 2022. Operators must begin to integrate all the data elements specified in this section starting October 1, 2020, with all attributes integrated by October 1, 2022. This analysis must:
                        (1) Integrate information and attributes about the pipeline that include, but are not limited to:
                        (i) Pipe diameter, wall thickness, grade, and seam type;
                        (ii) Pipe coating, including girth weld coating;
                        (iii) Maximum operating pressure (MOP) and temperature;
                        (iv) Endpoints of segments that could affect high consequence areas (HCAs);
                        (v) Hydrostatic test pressure including any test failures or leaks—if known;
                        (vi) Location of casings and if shorted;
                        (vii) Any in-service ruptures or leaks—including identified causes;
                        (viii) Data gathered through integrity assessments required under this section;
                        (ix) Close interval survey (CIS) survey results;
                        (x) Depth of cover surveys;
                        (xi) Corrosion protection (CP) rectifier readings;
                        (xii) CP test point survey readings and locations;
                        (xiii) AC/DC and foreign structure interference surveys;
                        (xiv) Pipe coating surveys and cathodic protection surveys.

                        (xv) Results of examinations of exposed portions of buried pipelines (i.e., pipe and pipe coating condition, see § 195.569);
                        (xvi) Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and other cracking (pipe body or weld) excavations and findings, including in-situ non-destructive examinations and analysis results for failure stress pressures and cyclic fatigue crack growth analysis to estimate the remaining life of the pipeline;
                        (xvii) Aerial photography;
                        (xviii) Location of foreign line crossings;
                        (xix) Pipe exposures resulting from repairs and encroachments;
                        (xx) Seismicity of the area; and
                        (xxi) Other pertinent information derived from operations and maintenance activities and any additional tests, inspections, surveys, patrols, or monitoring required under this part.
                        (2) Consider information critical to determining the potential for, and preventing, damage due to excavation, including current and planned damage prevention activities, and development or planned development along the pipeline;
                        (3) Consider how a potential failure would affect high consequence areas, such as location of a water intake.

                        (4) Identify spatial relationships among anomalous information (e.g., corrosion coincident with foreign line crossings; evidence of pipeline damage where aerial photography shows evidence of encroachment). Storing the information in a geographic information system (GIS), alone, is not sufficient. An operator must analyze for interrelationships among the data.
                        (h) * * *
                        (1) General requirements. An operator must take prompt action to address all anomalous conditions in the pipeline that the operator discovers through the integrity assessment or information analysis. In addressing all conditions, an operator must evaluate all anomalous conditions and remediate those that could reduce a pipeline's integrity, as required by this part. An operator must be able to demonstrate that the remediation of the condition will ensure that the condition is unlikely to pose a threat to the long-term integrity of the pipeline. An operator must comply with all other applicable requirements in this part in remediating a condition. Each operator must, in repairing its pipeline systems, ensure that the repairs are made in a safe and timely manner and are made so as to prevent damage to persons, property, or the environment. The calculation method(s) used for anomaly evaluation must be applicable for the range of relevant threats.
                        
                        (2) Discovery of condition. Discovery of a condition occurs when an operator has adequate information to determine that a condition presenting a potential threat to the integrity of the pipeline exists. An operator must promptly, but no later than 180 days after an assessment, obtain sufficient information about a condition to make that determination, unless the operator can demonstrate the 180-day interval is impracticable. If the operator believes that 180 days are impracticable to make a determination about a condition found during an assessment, the pipeline operator must notify PHMSA in accordance with paragraph (m) of this section and provide an expected date when adequate information will become available.

                        (j) * * *
                        (2) Verifying covered segments. An operator must verify the risk factors used in identifying pipeline segments that could affect a high consequence area on at least an annual basis not to exceed 15 months (Appendix C of this part provides additional guidance on factors that can influence whether a pipeline segment could affect a high consequence area). If a change in circumstance indicates that the prior consideration of a risk factor is no longer valid or that an operator should consider new risk factors, an operator must perform a new integrity analysis and evaluation to establish the endpoints of any previously identified covered segments. The integrity analysis and evaluation must include consideration of the results of any baseline and periodic integrity assessments (see paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section), information analyses (see paragraph (g) of this section), and decisions about remediation and preventive and mitigative actions (see paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section). An operator must complete the first annual verification under this paragraph no later than July 1, 2021.
                        
                        (n) Accommodation of instrumented internal inspection devices—
                        (1) Scope. This paragraph does not apply to any pipeline facilities listed in § 195.120(b).
                        (2) General. An operator must ensure that each pipeline is modified to accommodate the passage of an instrumented internal inspection device by July 2, 2040.
                        (3) Newly identified areas. If a pipeline could affect a newly identified high consequence area (see paragraph (d)(2) of this section) after July 2, 2035, an operator must modify the pipeline to accommodate the passage of an instrumented internal inspection device within 5 years of the date of identification or before performing the baseline assessment, whichever is sooner.
                        (4) Lack of accommodation. An operator may file a petition under § 190.9 of this chapter for a finding that the basic construction (i.e., length, diameter, operating pressure, or location) of a pipeline cannot be modified to accommodate the passage of an instrumented internal inspection device or that the operator determines it would abandon or shut-down a pipeline as a result of the cost to comply with the requirement of this section.
                        (5) Emergencies. An operator may file a petition under § 190.9 of this chapter for a finding that a pipeline cannot be modified to accommodate the passage of an instrumented internal inspection device as a result of an emergency. An operator must file such a petition within 30 days after discovering the emergency. If the petition is denied, the operator must modify the pipeline to allow the passage of an instrumented internal inspection device within 1 year after the date of the notice of the denial.
                        Note: no paragraph (o) was set out.

                  Integrity assessments for certain underwater hazardous liquid pipeline facilities located in high consequence areas.
                  Notwithstanding any pipeline integrity management program or integrity assessment schedule otherwise required under § 195.452, each operator of any underwater hazardous liquid pipeline facility located in a high consequence area that is not an offshore pipeline facility and any portion of which is located at depths greater than 150 feet under the surface of the water must ensure that:
                  (a) Pipeline integrity assessments using internal inspection technology appropriate for the integrity threats to the pipeline are completed not less often than once every 12 months, and;

                  (b) Pipeline integrity assessments using pipeline route surveys, depth of cover surveys, pressure tests, external corrosion direct assessment, or other technology that the operator demonstrates can further the understanding of the condition of the pipeline facility, are completed on a schedule based on the risk that the pipeline facility poses to the high consequence area in which the pipeline facility is located.

                § 195.551
                What do the regulations in this subpart cover?
                This subpart prescribes minimum requirements for protecting steel pipelines against corrosion.
              
              
                § 195.553
                What special definitions apply to this subpart?
                As used in this subpart—
                Active corrosion means continuing corrosion which, unless controlled, could result in a condition that is detrimental to public safety or the environment.
                
                  Buried means covered or in contact with soil.
                
                  Direct assessment means an integrity assessment method that utilizes a process to evaluate certain threats (i.e., external corrosion, internal corrosion and stress corrosion cracking) to a pipeline segment's integrity. The process includes the gathering and integration of risk factor data, indirect examination or analysis to identify areas of suspected corrosion, direct examination of the pipeline in these areas, and post assessment evaluation.
                
                  Electrical survey means a series of closely spaced pipe-to-soil readings over a pipeline that are subsequently analyzed to identify locations where a corrosive current is leaving the pipeline.
                
                  External corrosion direct assessment (ECDA) means a four-step process that combines pre-assessment, indirect inspection, direct examination, and post-assessment to evaluate the threat of external corrosion to the integrity of a pipeline.
                
                  Pipeline environment includes soil resistivity (high or low), soil moisture (wet or dry), soil contaminants that may promote corrosive activity, and other known conditions that could affect the probability of active corrosion.
                
                  You means operator.

                § 195.555
                What are the qualifications for supervisors?
                You must require and verify that supervisors maintain a thorough knowledge of that portion of the corrosion control procedures established under § 195.402(c)(3) for which they are responsible for insuring compliance.
              
              
                § 195.557
                Which pipelines must have coating for external corrosion control?
                Except bottoms of aboveground breakout tanks, each buried or submerged pipeline must have an external coating for external corrosion control if the pipeline is—
                (a) Constructed, relocated, replaced, or otherwise changed after the applicable date in § 195.401(c), not including the movement of pipe covered by § 195.424; or
                (b) Converted under § 195.5 and—
                (1) Has an external coating that substantially meets § 195.559 before the pipeline is placed in service; or
                (2) Is a segment that is relocated, replaced, or substantially altered.
              
              
                § 195.559
                What coating material may I use for external corrosion control?
                Coating material for external corrosion control under § 195.557 must—
                (a) Be designed to mitigate corrosion of the buried or submerged pipeline;
                (b) Have sufficient adhesion to the metal surface to prevent under film migration of moisture;
                (c) Be sufficiently ductile to resist cracking;
                (d) Have enough strength to resist damage due to handling and soil stress;
                (e) Support any supplemental cathodic protection; and
                (f) If the coating is an insulating type, have low moisture absorption and provide high electrical resistance.
              
              
                § 195.561
                When must I inspect pipe coating used for external corrosion control?
                (a) You must inspect all external pipe coating required by § 195.557 just prior to lowering the pipe into the ditch or submerging the pipe.
                (b) You must repair any coating damage discovered.
              
              
                § 195.563
                Which pipelines must have cathodic protection?
                (a) Each buried or submerged pipeline that is constructed, relocated, replaced, or otherwise changed after the applicable date in § 195.401(c) must have cathodic protection. The cathodic protection must be in operation not later than 1 year after the pipeline is constructed, relocated, replaced, or otherwise changed, as applicable.
                (b) Each buried or submerged pipeline converted under § 195.5 must have cathodic protection if the pipeline—
                (1) Has cathodic protection that substantially meets § 195.571 before the pipeline is placed in service; or
                (2) Is a segment that is relocated, replaced, or substantially altered.
                (c) All other buried or submerged pipelines that have an effective external coating must have cathodic protection. 1
                   Except as provided by paragraph (d) of this section, this requirement does not apply to breakout tanks and does not apply to buried piping in breakout tank areas and pumping stations until December 29, 2003.
                
                  
                    1 A pipeline does not have an effective external coating material if the current required to cathodically protect the pipeline is substantially the same as if the pipeline were bare.
                
                (d) Bare pipelines, breakout tank areas, and buried pumping station piping must have cathodic protection in places where regulations in effect before January 28, 2002 required cathodic protection as a result of electrical inspections. See previous editions of this part in 49 CFR, parts 186 to 199.
                (e) Unprotected pipe must have cathodic protection if required by § 195.573(b).
              
              
                § 195.565
                How do I install cathodic protection on breakout tanks?

                After October 2, 2000, when you install cathodic protection under § 195.563(a) to protect the bottom of an aboveground breakout tank of more than 500 barrels 79.49m3 capacity built to API Spec 12F (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3), API Std 620 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3), API Std 650 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3), or API Std 650's predecessor, Standard 12C, you must install the system in accordance with ANSI/API RP 651 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3). However, you don't need to comply with ANSI/API RP 651 when installing any tank for which you note in the corrosion control procedures established under § 195.402(c)(3) why complying with all or certain provisions of ANSI/API RP 651 is not necessary for the safety of the tank.

                § 195.567
                Which pipelines must have test leads and what must I do to install and maintain the leads?
                (a) General. Except for offshore pipelines, each buried or submerged pipeline or segment of pipeline under cathodic protection required by this subpart must have electrical test leads for external corrosion control. However, this requirement does not apply until December 27, 2004 to pipelines or pipeline segments on which test leads were not required by regulations in effect before January 28, 2002.
                (b) Installation. You must install test leads as follows:
                (1) Locate the leads at intervals frequent enough to obtain electrical measurements indicating the adequacy of cathodic protection.
                (2) Provide enough looping or slack so backfilling will not unduly stress or break the lead and the lead will otherwise remain mechanically secure and electrically conductive.
                (3) Prevent lead attachments from causing stress concentrations on pipe.
                (4) For leads installed in conduits, suitably insulate the lead from the conduit.
                (5) At the connection to the pipeline, coat each bared test lead wire and bared metallic area with an electrical insulating material compatible with the pipe coating and the insulation on the wire.
                (c) Maintenance. You must maintain the test lead wires in a condition that enables you to obtain electrical measurements to determine whether cathodic protection complies with § 195.571.
              
              
                § 195.569
                Do I have to examine exposed portions of buried pipelines?
                Whenever you have knowledge that any portion of a buried pipeline is exposed, you must examine the exposed portion for evidence of external corrosion if the pipe is bare, or if the coating is deteriorated. If you find external corrosion requiring corrective action under § 195.585, you must investigate circumferentially and longitudinally beyond the exposed portion (by visual examination, indirect method, or both) to determine whether additional corrosion requiring remedial action exists in the vicinity of the exposed portion.
              
              
                § 195.571
                What criteria must I use to determine the adequacy of cathodic protection?

                Cathodic protection required by this subpart must comply with one or more of the applicable criteria and other considerations for cathodic protection contained paragraphs 6.2.2, 6.2.3, 6.2.4, 6.2.5 and 6.3 in NACE SP 0169 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3).

                § 195.573
                What must I do to monitor external corrosion control?
                (a) Protected pipelines. You must do the following to determine whether cathodic protection required by this subpart complies with § 195.571:
                (1) Conduct tests on the protected pipeline at least once each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 15 months. However, if tests at those intervals are impractical for separately protected short sections of bare or ineffectively coated pipelines, testing may be done at least once every 3 calendar years, but with intervals not exceeding 39 months.

                (2) Identify not more than 2 years after cathodic protection is installed, the circumstances in which a close-interval survey or comparable technology is practicable and necessary to accomplish the objectives of paragraph 10.1.1.3 of NACE SP 0169 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3).
                (b) Unprotected pipe. You must reevaluate your unprotected buried or submerged pipe and cathodically protect the pipe in areas in which active corrosion is found, as follows:
                
                (1) Determine the areas of active corrosion by electrical survey, or where an electrical survey is impractical, by other means that include review and analysis of leak repair and inspection records, corrosion monitoring records, exposed pipe inspection records, and the pipeline environment.
                (2) For the period in the first column, the second column prescribes the frequency of evaluation.

                    At least once every 5 calendar years, but with intervals not exceeding 63 months.
                  
                  
                    Beginning December 29, 2003
                    At least once every 3 calendar years, but with intervals not exceeding 39 months.
                  
                
                (c) Rectifiers and other devices. You must electrically check for proper performance each device in the first column at the frequency stated in the second column.

                (d) Breakout tanks. You must inspect each cathodic protection system used to control corrosion on the bottom of an aboveground breakout tank to ensure that operation and maintenance of the system are in accordance with API RP 651 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3). However, this inspection is not required if you note in the corrosion control procedures established under § 195.402(c)(3) why complying with all or certain operation and maintenance provisions of API RP 651 is not necessary for the safety of the tank.
                (e) Corrective action. You must correct any identified deficiency in corrosion control as required by § 195.401(b). However, if the deficiency involves a pipeline in an integrity management program under § 195.452, you must correct the deficiency as required by § 195.452(h).

                § 195.575
                Which facilities must I electrically isolate and what inspections, tests, and safeguards are required?
                (a) You must electrically isolate each buried or submerged pipeline from other metallic structures, unless you electrically interconnect and cathodically protect the pipeline and the other structures as a single unit.
                (b) You must install one or more insulating devices where electrical isolation of a portion of a pipeline is necessary to facilitate the application of corrosion control.
                (c) You must inspect and electrically test each electrical isolation to assure the isolation is adequate.
                (d) If you install an insulating device in an area where a combustible atmosphere is reasonable to foresee, you must take precautions to prevent arcing.
                (e) If a pipeline is in close proximity to electrical transmission tower footings, ground cables, or counterpoise, or in other areas where it is reasonable to foresee fault currents or an unusual risk of lightning, you must protect the pipeline against damage from fault currents or lightning and take protective measures at insulating devices.
              
              
                § 195.577
                What must I do to alleviate interference currents?
                (a) For pipelines exposed to stray currents, you must have a program to identify, test for, and minimize the detrimental effects of such currents.
                (b) You must design and install each impressed current or galvanic anode system to minimize any adverse effects on existing adjacent metallic structures.
              
              
                § 195.579
                What must I do to mitigate internal corrosion?
                (a) General. If you transport any hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide that would corrode the pipeline, you must investigate the corrosive effect of the hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide on the pipeline and take adequate steps to mitigate internal corrosion.
                (b) Inhibitors. If you use corrosion inhibitors to mitigate internal corrosion, you must—
                (1) Use inhibitors in sufficient quantity to protect the entire part of the pipeline system that the inhibitors are designed to protect;
                (2) Use coupons or other monitoring equipment to determine the effectiveness of the inhibitors in mitigating internal corrosion; and
                (3) Examine the coupons or other monitoring equipment at least twice each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 71/2 months.
                (c) Removing pipe. Whenever you remove pipe from a pipeline, you must inspect the internal surface of the pipe for evidence of corrosion. If you find internal corrosion requiring corrective action under § 195.585, you must investigate circumferentially and longitudinally beyond the removed pipe (by visual examination, indirect method, or both) to determine whether additional corrosion requiring remedial action exists in the vicinity of the removed pipe.
                (d) Breakout tanks. After October 2, 2000, when you install a tank bottom lining in an aboveground breakout tank built to API Spec 12F (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3), API Std 620 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3), API Std 650 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3), or API Std 650's predecessor, Standard 12C, you must install the lining in accordance with API RP 652 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3). However, you don't need to comply with API RP 652 when installing any tank for which you note in the corrosion control procedures established under § 195.402(c)(3) why compliance with all or certain provisions of API RP 652 is not necessary for the safety of the tank.

                (b) Coating material must be suitable for the prevention of atmospheric corrosion.
                (c) Except portions of pipelines in offshore splash zones or soil-to-air interfaces, you need not protect against atmospheric corrosion any pipeline for which you demonstrate by test, investigation, or experience appropriate to the environment of the pipeline that corrosion will—
                (1) Only be a light surface oxide; or
                (2) Not affect the safe operation of the pipeline before the next scheduled inspection.

                (b) During inspections you must give particular attention to pipe at soil-to-air interfaces, under thermal insulation, under disbonded coatings, at pipe supports, in splash zones, at deck penetrations, and in spans over water.

                § 195.585
                What must I do to correct corroded pipe?
                (a) General corrosion. If you find pipe so generally corroded that the remaining wall thickness is less than that required for the maximum operating pressure of the pipeline, you must replace the pipe. However, you need not replace the pipe if you—
                (1) Reduce the maximum operating pressure commensurate with the strength of the pipe needed for serviceability based on actual remaining wall thickness; or
                (2) Repair the pipe by a method that reliable engineering tests and analyses show can permanently restore the serviceability of the pipe.
                (b) Localized corrosion pitting. If you find pipe that has localized corrosion pitting to a degree that leakage might result, you must replace or repair the pipe, unless you reduce the maximum operating pressure commensurate with the strength of the pipe based on actual remaining wall thickness in the pits.
              
              
                § 195.587

                Under § 195.585, you may use the procedure in ASME/ANSI B31G (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) or in PRCI PR-3-805 (R-STRENG) (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) to determine the strength of corroded pipe based on actual remaining wall thickness. These procedures apply to corroded regions that do not penetrate the pipe wall, subject to the limitations set out in the respective procedures.

                § 195.588
                What standards apply to direct assessment?
                (a) If you use direct assessment on an onshore pipeline to evaluate the effects of external corrosion or stress corrosion cracking, you must follow the requirements of this section. This section does not apply to methods associated with direct assessment, such as close interval surveys, voltage gradient surveys, or examination of exposed pipelines, when used separately from the direct assessment process.
                (b) The requirements for performing external corrosion direct assessment are as follows:
                (1) General. You must follow the requirements of NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3). Also, you must develop and implement a External Corrosion Direct Assessment (ECDA) plan that includes procedures addressing pre-assessment, indirect examination, direct examination, and post-assessment.
                (2) Pre-assessment. In addition to the requirements in Section 3 of NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3), the ECDA plan procedures for pre-assessment must include—
                (i) Provisions for applying more restrictive criteria when conducting ECDA for the first time on a pipeline segment;
                (ii) The basis on which you select at least two different, but complementary, indirect assessment tools to assess each ECDA region; and

                (iii) If you utilize an indirect inspection method not described in Appendix A of NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3), you must demonstrate the applicability, validation basis, equipment used, application procedure, and utilization of data for the inspection method.
                (3) Indirect examination. In addition to the requirements in Section 4 of NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3), the procedures for indirect examination of the ECDA regions must include—
                (i) Provisions for applying more restrictive criteria when conducting ECDA for the first time on a pipeline segment;
                (ii) Criteria for identifying and documenting those indications that must be considered for excavation and direct examination, including at least the following:
                (A) The known sensitivities of assessment tools;
                (B) The procedures for using each tool; and
                (C) The approach to be used for decreasing the physical spacing of indirect assessment tool readings when the presence of a defect is suspected;
                (iii) For each indication identified during the indirect examination, criteria for—
                (A) Defining the urgency of excavation and direct examination of the indication; and

                (B) Defining the excavation urgency as immediate, scheduled, or monitored; and
                
                (iv) Criteria for scheduling excavations of indications in each urgency level.
                (4) Direct examination. In addition to the requirements in Section 5 of NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3), the procedures for direct examination of indications from the indirect examination must include—
                (i) Provisions for applying more restrictive criteria when conducting ECDA for the first time on a pipeline segment;
                (ii) Criteria for deciding what action should be taken if either:

                (A) Corrosion defects are discovered that exceed allowable limits (Section 5.5.2.2 of NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) provides guidance for criteria); or

                (B) Root cause analysis reveals conditions for which ECDA is not suitable (Section 5.6.2 of NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) provides guidance for criteria);
                (iii) Criteria and notification procedures for any changes in the ECDA plan, including changes that affect the severity classification, the priority of direct examination, and the time frame for direct examination of indications; and

                (iv) Criteria that describe how and on what basis you will reclassify and re-prioritize any of the provisions specified in Section 5.9 of NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3).
                (5) Post assessment and continuing evaluation. In addition to the requirements in Section 6 of NACE SP 0502 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3), the procedures for post assessment of the effectiveness of the ECDA process must include—
                (i) Measures for evaluating the long-term effectiveness of ECDA in addressing external corrosion in pipeline segments; and

                (ii) Criteria for evaluating whether conditions discovered by direct examination of indications in each ECDA region indicate a need for reassessment of the pipeline segment at an interval less than that specified in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 of NACE SP0502 (see appendix D of NACE SP0502) (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3).

                (c) If you use direct assessment on an onshore pipeline to evaluate the effects of stress corrosion cracking, you must develop and follow a Stress Corrosion Cracking Direct Assessment plan that meets all requirements and recommendations of NACE SP0204-2008 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) and that implements all four steps of the Stress Corrosion Cracking Direct Assessment process including pre-assessment, indirect inspection, detailed examination and post-assessment. As specified in NACE SP0204-2008, Section 1.1.7, Stress Corrosion Cracking Direct Assessment is complementary with other inspection methods such as in-line inspection or hydrostatic testing and is not necessarily an alternative or replacement for these methods in all instances. In addition, the plan must provide for—
                (1) Data gathering and integration. An operator's plan must provide for a systematic process to collect and evaluate data to identify whether the conditions for stress corrosion cracking are present and to prioritize the segments for assessment in accordance with NACE SP0204-2008, Sections 3 and 4, and Table 1. This process must also include gathering and evaluating data related to SCC at all sites an operator excavates during the conduct of its pipeline operations (both within and outside covered segments) where the criteria in NACE SP0204-2008 indicate the potential for Stress Corrosion Cracking Direct Assessment. This data gathering process must be conducted in accordance with NACE SP0204-2008, Section 5.3, and must include, at a minimum, all data listed in NACE SP0204-2008, Table 2. Further, an operator must analyze the following factors as part of this evaluation:
                (i) The effects of a carbonate-bicarbonate environment, including the implications of any factors that promote the production of a carbonate-bicarbonate environment such as soil temperature, moisture, factors that affect the rate of carbon dioxide generation, and/or cathodic protection.
                (ii) The effects of cyclic loading conditions on the susceptibility and propagation of SCC in both high-pH and near-neutral-pH environments.

                (iii) The effects of variations in applied cathodic protection such as overprotection, cathodic protection loss for extended periods, and high negative potentials.
                (iv) The effects of coatings that shield cathodic protection when disbonded from the pipe.
                (v) Other factors that affect the mechanistic properties associated with SCC including but not limited to operating pressures, high tensile residual stresses, and the presence of sulfides.
                (2) Indirect inspection. In addition to the requirements and recommendations of NACE SP0204-2008, Section 4, the plan's procedures for indirect inspection must include provisions for conducting at least two different, but complementary, indirect assessment electrical surveys, and the basis on the selections as the most appropriate for the pipeline segment based on the data gathering and integration step.
                (3) Direct examination. In addition to the requirements and recommendations of NACE SP0204-2008, Section 5, the plan's procedures for direct examination must provide for conducting a minimum of four direct examinations within the SCC segment at locations determined to be the most likely for SCC to occur.
                (4) Remediation and mitigation. If any indication of SCC is discovered in a segment, an operator must mitigate the threat in accordance with one of the following applicable methods:

                (i) Non-significant SCC, as defined by NACE SP0204-2008, may be mitigated by either hydrostatic testing in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, or by grinding out with verification by Non-Destructive Examination (NDE) methods that the SCC defect is removed and repairing the pipe. If grinding is used for repair, the remaining strength of the pipe at the repair location must be determined using ASME/ANSI B31G or RSTRENG (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) and must be sufficient to meet the design requirements of subpart C of this part.
                (ii) Significant SCC must be mitigated using a hydrostatic testing program with a minimum test pressure between 100% up to 110% of the specified minimum yield strength for a 30-minute spike test immediately followed by a pressure test in accordance with subpart E of this part. The test pressure for the entire sequence must be continuously maintained for at least 8 hours, in accordance with subpart E of this part. Any test failures due to SCC must be repaired by replacement of the pipe segment, and the segment retested until the pipe passes the complete test without leakage. Pipe segments that have SCC present, but that pass the pressure test, may be repaired by grinding in accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.
                (5) Post assessment. In addition to the requirements and recommendations of NACE SP0204-2008, sections 6.3, periodic reassessment, and 6.4, effectiveness of Stress Corrosion Cracking Direct Assessment, the plan's procedures for post assessment must include development of a reassessment plan based on the susceptibility of the operator's pipe to Stress Corrosion Cracking as well as on the behavior mechanism of identified cracking. Factors to be considered include, but are not limited to:
                (i) Evaluation of discovered crack clusters during the direct examination step in accordance with NACE SP0204-2008, sections 5.3.5.7, 5.4, and 5.5;
                (ii) Conditions conducive to creation of the carbonate-bicarbonate environment;
                (iii) Conditions in the application (or loss) of cathodic protection that can create or exacerbate SCC;
                (iv) Operating temperature and pressure conditions;
                (v) Cyclic loading conditions;
                (vi) Conditions that influence crack initiation and growth rates;
                (vii) The effects of interacting crack clusters;
                (viii) The presence of sulfides; and
                (ix) Disbonded coatings that shield CP from the pipe.

                Appendix A to Part 195—Delineation Between Federal and State Jurisdiction—Statement of Agency Policy and Interpretation

                In 1979, Congress enacted comprehensive safety legislation governing the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline, the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, 49 U.S.C. 2001 et seq. (HLPSA). The HLPSA expanded the existing statutory authority for safety regulation, which was limited to transportation by common carriers in interstate and foreign commerce, to transportation through facilities used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce. It also added civil penalty, compliance order, and injunctive enforcement authorities to the existing criminal sanctions. Modeled largely on the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, 49 U.S.C. 1671 et seq. (NGPSA), the HLPSA provides for a national hazardous liquid pipeline safety program with nationally uniform minimal standards and with enforcement administered through a Federal-State partnership. The HLPSA leaves to exclusive Federal regulation and enforcement the “interstate pipeline facilities,” those used for the pipeline transportation of hazardous liquids in interstate or foreign commerce. For the remainder of the pipeline facilities, denominated “intrastate pipeline facilities,” the HLPSA provides that the same Federal regulation and enforcement will apply unless a State certifies that it will assume those responsibilities. A certified State must adopt the same minimal standards but may adopt additional more stringent standards so long as they are compatible. Therefore, in States which participate in the hazardous liquid pipeline safety program through certification, it is necessary to distinguish the interstate from the intrastate pipeline facilities.
                In deciding that an administratively practical approach was necessary in distinguishing between interstate and intrastate liquid pipeline facilities and in determining how best to accomplish this, DOT has logically examined the approach used in the NGPSA. The NGPSA defines the interstate gas pipeline facilities subject to exclusive Federal jurisdiction as those subject to the economic regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Experience has proven this approach practical. Unlike the NGPSA however, the HLPSA has no specific reference to FERC jurisdiction, but instead defines interstate liquid pipeline facilities by the more commonly used means of specifying the end points of the transportation involved. For example, the economic regulatory jurisdiction of FERC over the transportation of both gas and liquids by pipeline is defined in much the same way. In implementing the HLPSA DOT has sought a practicable means of distinguishing between interstate and intrastate pipeline facilities that provide the requisite degree of certainty to Federal and State enforcement personnel and to the regulated entities. DOT intends that this statement of agency policy and interpretation provide that certainty.

                In 1981, DOT decided that the inventory of liquid pipeline facilities identified as subject to the jurisdiction of FERC approximates the HLPSA category of “interstate pipeline facilities.” Administrative use of the FERC inventory has the added benefit of avoiding the creation of a separate Federal scheme for determination of jurisdiction over the same regulated entities. DOT recognizes that the FERC inventory is only an approximation and may not be totally satisfactory without some modification. The difficulties stem from some significant differences in the economic regulation of liquid and of natural gas pipelines. There is an affirmative assertion of jurisdiction by FERC over natural gas pipelines through the issuance of certificates of public convenience and necessity prior to commencing operations. With liquid pipelines, there is only a rebuttable presumption of jurisdiction created by the filing by pipeline operators of tariffs (or concurrences) for movement of liquids through existing facilities. Although FERC does police the filings for such matters as compliance with the general duties of common carriers, the question of jurisdiction is normally only aired upon complaint. While any person, including State or Federal agencies, can avail themselves of the FERC forum by use of the complaint process, that process has only been rarely used to review jurisdictional matters (probably because of the infrequency of real disputes on the issue). Where the issue has arisen, the reviewing body has noted the need to examine various criteria primarily of an economic nature. DOT believes that, in most cases, the formal FERC forum can better receive and evaluate the type of information that is needed to make decisions of this nature than can DOT.

                In delineating which liquid pipeline facilities are interstate pipeline facilities within the meaning of the HLPSA, DOT will generally rely on the FERC filings; that is, if there is a tariff or concurrence filed with FERC governing the transportation of hazardous liquids over a pipeline facility or if there has been an exemption from the obligation to file tariffs obtained from FERC, then DOT will, as a general rule, consider the facility to be an interstate pipeline facility within the meaning of the HLPSA. The types of situations in which DOT will ignore the existence or non-existence of a filing with FERC will be limited to those cases in which it appears obvious that a complaint filed with FERC would be successful or in which blind reliance on a FERC filing would result in a situation clearly not intended by the HLPSA such as a pipeline facility not being subject to either State or Federal safety regulation. DOT anticipates that the situations in which there is any question about the validity of the FERC filings as a ready reference will be few and that the actual variations from reliance on those filings will be rare. The following examples indicate the types of facilities which DOT believes are interstate pipeline facilities subject to the HLPSA despite the lack of a filing with FERC and the types of facilities over which DOT will generally defer to the jurisdiction of a certifying state despite the existence of a filing with FERC.
                
                
                  Example 1.
                  Pipeline company P operates a pipeline from “Point A” located in State X to “Point B” (also in X). The physical facilities never cross a state line and do not connect with any other pipeline which does cross a state line. Pipeline company P also operates another pipeline between “Point C” in State X and “Point D” in an adjoining State Y. Pipeline company P files a tariff with FERC for transportation from “Point A” to “Point B” as well as for transportation from “Point C” to “Point D.” DOT will ignore filing for the line from “Point A” to “Point B” and consider the line to be intrastate.
                
                
                  Example 2.
                  Same as in example 1 except that P does not file any tariffs with FERC. DOT will assume jurisdiction of the line between “Point C” and “Point D.”
                
                
                  Example 3.
                  Same as in example 1 except that P files its tariff for the line between “Point C” and “Point D” not only with FERC but also with State X. DOT will rely on the FERC filing as indication of interstate commerce.
                
                
                  Example 4.
                  Same as in example 1 except that the pipeline from “Point A” to “Point B” (in State X) connects with a pipeline operated by another company transports liquid between “Point B” (in State X) and “Point D” (in State Y). DOT will rely on the FERC filing as indication of interstate commerce.
                
                
                  Example 5.
                  Same as in example 1 except that the line between “Point C” and “Point D” has a lateral line connected to it. The lateral is located entirely with State X. DOT will rely on the existence or non-existence of a FERC filing covering transportation over that lateral as determinative of interstate commerce.
                
                
                  Example 6.
                  Same as in example 1 except that the certified agency in State X has brought an enforcement action (under the pipeline safety laws) against P because of its operation of the line between “Point A” and “Point B”. P has successfully defended against the action on jurisdictional grounds. DOT will assume jurisdiction if necessary to avoid the anomaly of a pipeline subject to neither State or Federal safety enforcement. DOT's assertion of jurisdiction in such a case would be based on the gap in the state's enforcement authority rather than a DOT decision that the pipeline is an interstate pipeline facility.
                
                
                  Example 7.
                  Pipeline Company P operates a pipeline that originates on the Outer Continental Shelf. P does not file any tariff for that line with FERC. DOT will consider the pipeline to be an interstate pipeline facility.
                
                
                  Example 8.
                  Pipeline Company P is constructing a pipeline from “Point C” (in State X) to “Point D” (in State Y). DOT will consider the pipeline to be an interstate pipeline facility.
                
                
                  Example 9.

                  Pipeline company P is constructing a pipeline from “Point C” to “Point E” (both in State X) but intends to file tariffs with FERC in the transportation of hazardous liquid in interstate commerce. Assuming there is some connection to an interstate pipeline facility, DOT will consider this line to be an interstate pipeline facility.
                
                
                  Example 10.
                  Pipeline Company P has operated a pipeline subject to FERC economic regulation. Solely because of some statutory economic deregulation, that pipeline is no longer regulated by FERC. DOT will continue to consider that pipeline to be an interstate pipeline facility.
                
                
                As seen from the examples, the types of situations in which DOT will not defer to the FERC regulatory scheme are generally clear-cut cases. For the remainder of the situations where variation from the FERC scheme would require DOT to replicate the forum already provided by FERC and to consider economic factors better left to that agency, DOT will decline to vary its reliance on the FERC filings unless, of course, not doing so would result in situations clearly not intended by the HLPSA.

                Appendix B to Part 195—Risk-Based Alternative to Pressure Testing Older Hazardous Liquid and Carbon Dioxide Pipelines
                Risk-Based Alternative
                This Appendix provides guidance on how a risk-based alternative to pressure testing older hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines rule allowed by § 195.303 will work. This risk-based alternative establishes test priorities for older pipelines, not previously pressure tested, based on the inherent risk of a given pipeline segment. The first step is to determine the classification based on the type of pipe or on the pipeline segment's proximity to populated or environmentally sensitive area. Secondly, the classifications must be adjusted based on the pipeline failure history, product transported, and the release volume potential.
                Tables 2-6 give definitions of risk classification A, B, and C facilities. For the purposes of this rule, pipeline segments containing high risk electric resistance-welded pipe (ERW pipe) and lapwelded pipe manufactured prior to 1970 and considered a risk classification C or B facility shall be treated as the top priority for testing because of the higher risk associated with the susceptibility of this pipe to longitudinal seam failures.
                In all cases, operators shall annually, at intervals not to exceed 15 months, review their facilities to reassess the classification and shall take appropriate action within two years or operate the pipeline system at a lower pressure. Pipeline failures, changes in the characteristics of the pipeline route, or changes in service should all trigger a reassessment of the originally classification.
                Table 1 explains different levels of test requirements depending on the inherent risk of a given pipeline segment. The overall risk classification is determined based on the type of pipe involved, the facility's location, the product transported, the relative volume of flow and pipeline failure history as determined from Tables 2-6.

                    1 If operational experience indicates a history of past failures for a particular pipeline segment, failure causes (time-dependent defects due to corrosion, construction, manufacture, or transmission problems, etc.) shall be reviewed in determining risk classification (See Table 6) and the timing of the pressure test should be accelerated.
                  
                    2 All pre-1970 ERW pipeline segments may not require testing. In determining which ERW pipeline segments should be included in this category, an operator must consider the seam-related leak history of the pipe and pipe manufacturing information as available, which may include the pipe steel's mechanical properties, including fracture toughness; the manufacturing process and controls related to seam properties, including whether the ERW process was high-frequency or low-frequency, whether the weld seam was heat treated, whether the seam was inspected, the test pressure and duration during mill hydrotest; the quality control of the steel-making process; and other factors pertinent to seam properties and quality.
                  
                    3 For those pipeline operators with extensive mileage of pre-1970 ERW pipe, any waiver requests for timing relief should be supported by an assessment of hazards in accordance with location, product, volume, and probability of failure considerations consistent with Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6.
                  
                    4 A magnetic flux leakage or ultrasonic internal inspection survey may be utilized as an alternative to pressure testing where leak history and operating experience do not indicate leaks caused by longitudinal cracks or seam failures.
                  
                    5 Pressure tests utilizing a hydrocarbon liquid may be conducted, but only with a liquid which does not vaporize rapidly.
                

                Using LOCATION, PRODUCT, VOLUME, and FAILURE HISTORY “Indicators” from Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6 respectively, the overall risk classification of a given pipeline or pipeline segment can be established from Table 2. The LOCATION Indicator is the primary factor which determines overall risk, with the PRODUCT, VOLUME, and PROBABILITY OF FAILURE Indicators used to adjust to a higher or lower overall risk classification per the following table.

                Appendix C to Part 195—Guidance for Implementation of an Integrity Management Program
                This Appendix gives guidance to help an operator implement the requirements of the integrity management program rule in §§ 195.450 and 195.452. Guidance is provided on:
                (1) Information an operator may use to identify a high consequence area and factors an operator can use to consider the potential impacts of a release on an area;
                (2) Risk factors an operator can use to determine an integrity assessment schedule;
                (3) Safety risk indicator tables for leak history, volume or line size, age of pipeline, and product transported, an operator may use to determine if a pipeline segment falls into a high, medium or low risk category;
                (4) Types of internal inspection tools an operator could use to find pipeline anomalies;
                (5) Measures an operator could use to measure an integrity management program's performance; and
                (6) Types of records an operator will have to maintain.
                (7) Types of conditions that an integrity assessment may identify that an operator should include in its required schedule for evaluation and remediation.
                I. Identifying a high consequence area and factors for considering a pipeline segment's potential impact on a high consequence area.

                A. The rule defines a High Consequence Area as a high population area, an other populated area, an unusually sensitive area, or a commercially navigable waterway. The Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) will map these areas on the National Pipeline Mapping System (NPMS). An operator, member of the public or other government agency may view and download the data from the NPMS home page http://www.npms.phmsa.gov/. OPS will maintain the NPMS and update it periodically. However, it is an operator's responsibility to ensure that it has identified all high consequence areas that could be affected by a pipeline segment. An operator is also responsible for periodically evaluating its pipeline segments to look for population or environmental changes that may have occurred around the pipeline and to keep its program current with this information. (Refer to § 195.452(d)(3).)
                (1) Digital Data on populated areas available on U.S. Census Bureau maps.

                (2) Geographic Database on the commercial navigable waterways available on http://www.bts.gov/gis/ntatlas/networks.html.
                

                (3) The Bureau of Transportation Statistics database that includes commercially navigable waterways and non-commercially navigable waterways. The database can be downloaded from the BTS website at http://www.bts.gov/gis/ntatlas/networks.html.
                
                B. The rule requires an operator to include a process in its program for identifying which pipeline segments could affect a high consequence area and to take measures to prevent and mitigate the consequences of a pipeline failure that could affect a high consequence area. (See §§ 195.452 (f) and (i).) Thus, an operator will need to consider how each pipeline segment could affect a high consequence area. The primary source for the listed risk factors is a US DOT study on instrumented Internal Inspection devices (November 1992). Other sources include the National Transportation Safety Board, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards Committee. The following list provides guidance to an operator on both the mandatory and additional factors:
                (1) Terrain surrounding the pipeline. An operator should consider the contour of the land profile and if it could allow the liquid from a release to enter a high consequence area. An operator can get this information from topographical maps such as U.S. Geological Survey quadrangle maps.
                (2) Drainage systems such as small streams and other smaller waterways that could serve as a conduit to a high consequence area.
                (3) Crossing of farm tile fields. An operator should consider the possibility of a spillage in the field following the drain tile into a waterway.
                (4) Crossing of roadways with ditches along the side. The ditches could carry a spillage to a waterway.
                (5) The nature and characteristics of the product the pipeline is transporting (refined products, crude oils, highly volatile liquids, etc.) Highly volatile liquids becomes gaseous when exposed to the atmosphere. A spillage could create a vapor cloud that could settle into the lower elevation of the ground profile.

                (6) Physical support of the pipeline segment such as by a cable suspension bridge. An operator should look for stress indicators on the pipeline (strained supports, inadequate support at towers), atmospheric corrosion, vandalism, and other obvious signs of improper maintenance.
                (7) Operating conditions of the pipeline (pressure, flow rate, etc.). Exposure of the pipeline to an operating pressure exceeding the established maximum operating pressure.
                (8) The hydraulic gradient of the pipeline.
                (9) The diameter of the pipeline, the potential release volume, and the distance between the isolation points.
                (10) Potential physical pathways between the pipeline and the high consequence area.
                (11) Response capability (time to respond, nature of response).
                (12) Potential natural forces inherent in the area (flood zones, earthquakes, subsidence areas, etc.)
                II. Risk factors for establishing frequency of assessment.
                A. By assigning weights or values to the risk factors, and using the risk indicator tables, an operator can determine the priority for assessing pipeline segments, beginning with those segments that are of highest risk, that have not previously been assessed. This list provides some guidance on some of the risk factors to consider (see § 195.452(e)). An operator should also develop factors specific to each pipeline segment it is assessing, including:
                (1) Populated areas, unusually sensitive environmental areas, National Fish Hatcheries, commercially navigable waters, areas where people congregate.
                (2) Results from previous testing/inspection. (See § 195.452(h).)
                (3) Leak History. (See leak history risk table.)
                (4) Known corrosion or condition of pipeline. (See § 195.452(g).)
                (5) Cathodic protection history.
                (6) Type and quality of pipe coating (disbonded coating results in corrosion).
                (7) Age of pipe (older pipe shows more corrosion—may be uncoated or have an ineffective coating) and type of pipe seam. (See Age of Pipe risk table.)
                (8) Product transported (highly volatile, highly flammable and toxic liquids present a greater threat for both people and the environment) (see Product transported risk table.)
                (9) Pipe wall thickness (thicker walls give a better safety margin)
                (10) Size of pipe (higher volume release if the pipe ruptures).
                (11) Location related to potential ground movement (e.g., seismic faults, rock quarries, and coal mines); climatic (permafrost causes settlement—Alaska); geologic (landslides or subsidence).
                (12) Security of throughput (effects on customers if there is failure requiring shutdown).
                (13) Time since the last internal inspection/pressure testing.
                (14) With respect to previously discovered defects/anomalies, the type, growth rate, and size.
                (15) Operating stress levels in the pipeline.
                (16) Location of the pipeline segment as it relates to the ability of the operator to detect and respond to a leak. (e.g., pipelines deep underground, or in locations that make leak detection difficult without specific sectional monitoring and/or significantly impede access for spill response or any other purpose).
                (17) Physical support of the segment such as by a cable suspension bridge.

                (18) Non-standard or other than recognized industry practice on pipeline installation (e.g., horizontal directional drilling).
                
                B. Example: This example illustrates a hypothetical model used to establish an integrity assessment schedule for a hypothetical pipeline segment. After we determine the risk factors applicable to the pipeline segment, we then assign values or numbers to each factor, such as, high (5), moderate (3), or low (1). We can determine an overall risk classification (A, B, C) for the segment using the risk tables and a sliding scale (values 5 to 1) for risk factors for which tables are not provided. We would classify a segment as C if it fell above 2/3 of maximum value (highest overall risk value for any one segment when compared with other segments of a pipeline), a segment as B if it fell between 1/3 to 2/3 of maximum value, and the remaining segments as A.

For the baseline assessment schedule, we would plan to assess 50% of all pipeline segments covered by the rule, beginning with the highest risk segments, within the first 31/2 years and the remaining segments within the seven-year period. For the continuing integrity assessments, we would plan to assess the C segments within the first two (2) years of the schedule, the segments classified as moderate risk no later than year three or four and the remaining lowest risk segments no later than year five (5).

                ii. For our hypothetical pipeline segment, we have chosen the following risk factors and obtained risk factor values from the appropriate table. The values assigned to the risk factors are for illustration only.
                
                
                  Age of pipeline: assume 30 years old (refer to “Age of Pipeline” risk table)—
                Risk Value = 5
                
                  Pressure tested: tested once during construction—
                Risk Value = 5
                
                  Coated: (yes/no)—yes
                
                  Coating Condition: Recent excavation of suspected areas showed holidays in coating (potential corrosion risk)—
                Risk Value = 5
                
                
                  Cathodically Protected: (yes/no)—yes—Risk Value = 1
                
                  Date cathodic protection installed: five years after pipeline was constructed (Cathodic protection installed within one year of the pipeline's construction is generally considered low risk.)—Risk Value = 3
                
                  Close interval survey: (yes/no)—no—Risk Value = 5
                
                  Internal Inspection tool used: (yes/no)—yes. Date of pig run? In last five years—Risk Value = 1
                
                  Anomalies found: (yes/no)—yes, but do not pose an immediate safety risk or environmental hazard—Risk Value = 3
                
                  Leak History: yes, one spill in last 10 years. (refer to “Leak History” risk table)—Risk Value = 2
                
                  Product transported: Diesel fuel. Product low risk. (refer to “Product” risk table)—Risk Value = 1
                
                  Pipe size: 16 inches. Size presents moderate risk (refer to “Line Size” risk table)—Risk Value = 3
                iii. Overall risk value for this hypothetical segment of pipe is 34. Assume we have two other pipeline segments for which we conduct similar risk rankings. The second pipeline segment has an overall risk value of 20, and the third segment, 11. For the baseline assessment we would establish a schedule where we assess the first segment (highest risk segment) within two years, the second segment within five years and the third segment within seven years. Similarly, for the continuing integrity assessment, we could establish an assessment schedule where we assess the highest risk segment no later than the second year, the second segment no later than the third year, and the third segment no later than the fifth year.
                III. Safety risk indicator tables for leak history, volume or line size, age of pipeline, and product transported.

                IV. Types of internal inspection tools to use.
                An operator should consider at least two types of internal inspection tools for the integrity assessment from the following list. The type of tool or tools an operator selects will depend on the results from previous internal inspection runs, information analysis and risk factors specific to the pipeline segment:
                (1) Geometry Internal inspection tools for detecting changes to ovality, e.g., bends, dents, buckles or wrinkles, due to construction flaws or soil movement, or other outside force damage;
                (2) Metal Loss Tools (Ultrasonic and Magnetic Flux Leakage) for determining pipe wall anomalies, e.g., wall loss due to corrosion.
                (3) Crack Detection Tools for detecting cracks and crack-like features, e.g., stress corrosion cracking (SCC), fatigue cracks, narrow axial corrosion, toe cracks, hook cracks, etc.
                V. Methods to measure performance.
                A. General. (1) This guidance is to help an operator establish measures to evaluate the effectiveness of its integrity management program. The performance measures required will depend on the details of each integrity management program and will be based on an understanding and analysis of the failure mechanisms or threats to integrity of each pipeline segment.

                (2) An operator should select a set of measurements to judge how well its program is performing. An operator's objectives for its program are to ensure public safety, prevent or minimize leaks and spills and prevent property and environmental damage. A typical integrity management program will be an ongoing program and it may contain many elements. Therefore, several performance measure are likely to be needed to measure the effectiveness of an ongoing program.
                B. Performance measures. These measures show how a program to control risk on pipeline segments that could affect a high consequence area is progressing under the integrity management requirements. Performance measures generally fall into three categories:
                (1) Selected Activity Measures—Measures that monitor the surveillance and preventive activities the operator has implemented. These measure indicate how well an operator is implementing the various elements of its integrity management program.
                (2) Deterioration Measures—Operation and maintenance trends that indicate when the integrity of the system is weakening despite preventive measures. This category of performance measure may indicate that the system condition is deteriorating despite well executed preventive activities.
                (3) Failure Measures—Leak History, incident response, product loss, etc. These measures will indicate progress towards fewer spills and less damage.
                C. Internal vs. External Comparisons. These comparisons show how a pipeline segment that could affect a high consequence area is progressing in comparison to the operator's other pipeline segments that are not covered by the integrity management requirements and how that pipeline segment compares to other operators' pipeline segments.
                (1) Internal—Comparing data from the pipeline segment that could affect the high consequence area with data from pipeline segments in other areas of the system may indicate the effects from the attention given to the high consequence area.
                (2) External—Comparing data external to the pipeline segment (e.g., OPS incident data) may provide measures on the frequency and size of leaks in relation to other companies.
                D. Examples. Some examples of performance measures an operator could use include—
                (1) A performance measurement goal to reduce the total volume from unintended releases by -% (percent to be determined by operator) with an ultimate goal of zero.
                (2) A performance measurement goal to reduce the total number of unintended releases (based on a threshold of 5 gallons) by __-% (percent to be determined by operator) with an ultimate goal of zero.
                (3) A performance measurement goal to document the percentage of integrity management activities completed during the calendar year.
                (4) A performance measurement goal to track and evaluate the effectiveness of the operator's community outreach activities.
                (5) A narrative description of pipeline system integrity, including a summary of performance improvements, both qualitative and quantitative, to an operator's integrity management program prepared periodically.
                (6) A performance measure based on internal audits of the operator's pipeline system per 49 CFR Part 195.
                (7) A performance measure based on external audits of the operator's pipeline system per 49 CFR Part 195.
                (8) A performance measure based on operational events (for example: relief occurrences, unplanned valve closure, SCADA outages, etc.) that have the potential to adversely affect pipeline integrity.
                (9) A performance measure to demonstrate that the operator's integrity management program reduces risk over time with a focus on high risk items.
                (10) A performance measure to demonstrate that the operator's integrity management program for pipeline stations and terminals reduces risk over time with a focus on high risk items.
                VI. Examples of types of records an operator must maintain.
                The rule requires an operator to maintain certain records. (See § 195.452(l)). This section provides examples of some records that an operator would have to maintain for inspection to comply with the requirement. This is not an exhaustive list.
                (1) a process for identifying which pipelines could affect a high consequence area and a document identifying all pipeline segments that could affect a high consequence area;
                (2) a plan for baseline assessment of the line pipe that includes each required plan element;
                (3) modifications to the baseline plan and reasons for the modification;
                (4) use of and support for an alternative practice;
                (5) a framework addressing each required element of the integrity management program, updates and changes to the initial framework and eventual program;
                (6) a process for identifying a new high consequence area and incorporating it into the baseline plan, particularly, a process for identifying population changes around a pipeline segment;
                (7) an explanation of methods selected to assess the integrity of line pipe;
                (8) a process for review of integrity assessment results and data analysis by a person qualified to evaluate the results and data;
                (9) the process and risk factors for determining the baseline assessment interval;

                (10) results of the baseline integrity assessment;
                
                (11) the process used for continual evaluation, and risk factors used for determining the frequency of evaluation;
                (12) process for integrating and analyzing information about the integrity of a pipeline, information and data used for the information analysis;
                (13) results of the information analyses and periodic evaluations;
                (14) the process and risk factors for establishing continual re-assessment intervals;
                (15) justification to support any variance from the required re-assessment intervals;
                (16) integrity assessment results and anomalies found, process for evaluating and remediating anomalies, criteria for remedial actions and actions taken to evaluate and remediate the anomalies;
                (17) other remedial actions planned or taken;
                (18) schedule for evaluation and remediation of anomalies, justification to support deviation from required remediation times;
                (19) risk analysis used to identify additional preventive or mitigative measures, records of preventive and mitigative actions planned or taken;
                (20) criteria for determining EFRD installation;
                (21) criteria for evaluating and modifying leak detection capability;
                (22) methods used to measure the program's effectiveness.
                VII. Conditions that may impair a pipeline's integrity.
                Section 195.452(h) requires an operator to evaluate and remediate all pipeline integrity issues raised by the integrity assessment or information analysis. An operator must develop a schedule that prioritizes conditions discovered on the pipeline for evaluation and remediation. The following are some examples of conditions that an operator should schedule for evaluation and remediation.
                A. Any change since the previous assessment.
                B. Mechanical damage that is located on the top side of the pipe.
                C. An anomaly abrupt in nature.
                D. An anomaly longitudinal in orientation.
                E. An anomaly over a large area.
                F. An anomaly located in or near a casing, a crossing of another pipeline, or an area with suspect cathodic protection.

                This subpart prescribes the minimum requirements that excavators must follow to protect pipelines subject to PHMSA or State pipeline safety regulations from excavation-related damage.
              
              
                § 196.103
                What must an excavator do to protect underground pipelines from excavation-related damage?
                Prior to and during excavation activity, the excavator must:
                (a) Use an available one-call system before excavating to notify operators of underground pipeline facilities of the timing and location of the intended excavation;
                (b) If underground pipelines exist in the area, wait for the pipeline operator to arrive at the excavation site and establish and mark the location of its underground pipeline facilities before excavating;
                (c) Excavate with proper regard for the marked location of pipelines an operator has established by taking all practicable steps to prevent excavation damage to the pipeline;
                (d) Make additional use of one-call as necessary to obtain locating and marking before excavating to ensure that underground pipelines are not damaged by excavation.
              
              
                § 196.105

                § 196.107
                What must an excavator do if a pipeline is damaged by excavation activity?
                If a pipeline is damaged in any way by excavation activity, the excavator must promptly report such damage to the pipeline operator, whether or not a leak occurs, at the earliest practicable moment following discovery of the damage.
              
              
                § 196.109
                What must an excavator do if damage to a pipeline from excavation activity causes a leak where product is released from the pipeline?
                If damage to a pipeline from excavation activity causes the release of any PHMSA regulated natural and other gas or hazardous liquid as defined in part 192, 193, or 195 of this chapter from the pipeline, the excavator must promptly report the release to appropriate emergency response authorities by calling the 911 emergency telephone number.
              
              
                § 196.111
                What if a pipeline operator fails to respond to a locate request or fails to accurately locate and mark its pipeline?

                PHMSA may enforce existing requirements applicable to pipeline operators, including those specified in 49 CFR 192.614 and 195.442 and 49 U.S.C. 60114 if a pipeline operator fails to properly respond to a locate request or fails to accurately locate and mark its pipeline. The limitation in 49 U.S.C. 60114(f) does not apply to enforcement taken against pipeline operators and excavators working for pipeline operators.
              
            
            
              Subpart C—Administrative Enforcement Process
              
                § 196.201
                What is the purpose and scope of this subpart?
                This subpart describes the enforcement authority and sanctions exercised by the Associate Administrator for Pipeline Safety for achieving and maintaining pipeline safety under this part. It also prescribes the procedures governing the exercise of that authority and the imposition of those sanctions.
              
              
                § 196.203
                What is the administrative process PHMSA will use to conduct enforcement proceedings for alleged violations of excavation damage prevention requirements?
                PHMSA will use the existing administrative adjudication process for alleged pipeline safety violations set forth in 49 CFR part 190, subpart B. This process provides for notification that a probable violation has been committed, a 30-day period to respond including the opportunity to request an administrative hearing, the issuance of a final order, and the opportunity to petition for reconsideration.
              
              
                § 196.205
                Can PHMSA assess administrative civil penalties for violations?

                Yes. When the Associate Administrator for Pipeline Safety has reason to believe that a person has violated any provision of the 49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq. or any regulation or order issued thereunder, including a violation of excavation damage prevention requirements under this part and 49 U.S.C. 60114(d) in a State with an excavation damage prevention law enforcement program PHMSA has deemed inadequate under 49 CFR part 198, subpart D, PHMSA may conduct a proceeding to determine the nature and extent of the violation and to assess a civil penalty.
              
              
                § 196.207
                What are the maximum administrative civil penalties for violations?
                The maximum administrative civil penalties that may be imposed are specified in 49 U.S.C. 60122.
              
              
                § 196.209
                May other civil enforcement actions be taken?

                Whenever the Associate Administrator has reason to believe that a person has engaged, is engaged, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of 49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq., or any regulations issued thereunder, PHMSA, or the person to whom the authority has been delegated, may request the Attorney General to bring an action in the appropriate U.S. District Court for such relief as is necessary or appropriate, including mandatory or prohibitive injunctive relief, interim equitable relief, civil penalties, and punitive damages as provided under 49 U.S.C. 60120.
              
              
                § 196.211
                May criminal penalties be imposed?
                Yes. Criminal penalties may be imposed as specified in 49 U.S.C. 60123.

                § 198.13
                Grant allocation formula.

                (a) Beginning in calendar year 1993, the Administrator places increasing emphasis on program performance in allocating state agency funds under § 198.11. The maximum percent of each state agency allocation that is based on performance follows: 1993—75 percent; 1994 and subsequent years—100 percent.
                (b) A state's annual grant allocation is based on maximum of 100 performance points derived as follows:
                (1) Fifty points based on information provided in the state's annual certification/agreement attachments which document its activities for the past year; and
                (2) Fifty points based on the annual state program evaluation.
                (c) The Administrator assigns weights to various performance factors reflecting program compliance, safety priorities, and national concerns identified by the Administrator and communicated to each State agency. At a minimum, the Administrator considers the following performance factors in allocating funds:
                (1) Adequacy of state operating practices;
                (2) Quality of state inspections, investigations, and enforcement/compliance actions;
                (3) Adequacy of state recordkeeping;
                (4) Extent of state safety regulatory jurisdiction over pipeline facilities;
                (5) Qualifications of state inspectors;
                (6) Number of state inspection person-days;
                (7) State adoption of applicable federal pipeline safety standards; and
                (8) Any other factor the Administrator deems necessary to measure performance.
                (d) Notwithstanding these performance factors, the Administrator may, in 1993 and subsequent years, continue funding any state at the 1991 level, provided its request is at the 1991 level or higher and appropriated funds are at the 1991 level or higher.
                (e) The Administrator notifies each state agency in writing of the specific performance factors to be used and the weights to be assigned to each factor at least 9 months prior to allocating funds. Prior to notification, PHMSA seeks state agency comments on any proposed changes to the allocation formula.
                (f) Grants are limited to the appropriated funds available. If total state agency requests for grants exceed the funds available, the Administrator prorates each state agency's allocation.

                § 198.31
                Scope.

                This subpart implements parts of the pipeline safety laws (49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq.), which direct the Secretary to require each State to adopt a one-call damage prevention program as a condition to receiving a full grant-in-aid for its pipeline safety compliance program.

                § 198.35
                Grants conditioned on adoption of one-call damage prevention program.

                In allocating grants to State agencies under the pipeline safety laws, (49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq.), the Secretary considers whether a State has adopted or is seeking to adopt a one-call damage prevention program in accordance with § 198.37. If a State has not adopted or is not seeking to adopt such program, the State agency may not receive the full reimbursement to which it would otherwise be entitled.

                State one-call damage prevention program.
                A State must adopt a one-call damage prevention program that requires each of the following at a minimum:
                (a) Each area of the State that contains underground pipeline facilities must be covered by a one-call notification system.
                (b) Each one-call notification system must be operated in accordance with § 198.39.
                (c) Excavators must be required to notify the operational center of the one-call notification system that covers the area of each intended excavation activity and provide the following information:
                (1) Name of the person notifying the system.

                (2) Name, address and telephone number of the excavator.
                
                (3) Specific location, starting date, and description of the intended excavation activity.
                However, an excavator must be allowed to begin an excavation activity in an emergency but, in doing so, required to notify the operational center at the earliest practicable moment.
                (d) The State must determine whether telephonic and other communications to the operational center of a one-call notification system under paragraph (c) of this section are to be toll free or not.

                (e) Except with respect to interstate transmission facilities as defined in the pipeline safety laws (49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq.), operators of underground pipeline facilities must be required to participate in the one-call notification systems that cover the areas of the State in which those pipeline facilities are located.
                (f) Operators of underground pipeline facilities participating in the one-call notification systems must be required to respond in the manner prescribed by § 192.614 (c)(4) through (c)(6) of this chapter to notices of intended excavation activity received from the operational center of a one-call notification system.
                (g) Persons who operate one-call notification systems or operators of underground pipeline facilities participating or required to participate in the one-call notification systems must be required to notify the public and known excavators in the manner prescribed by § 192.614 (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this chapter of the availability and use of one-call notification systems to locate underground pipeline facilities. However, this paragraph does not apply to persons (including operator's master meters) whose primary activity does not include the production, transportation or marketing of gas or hazardous liquids.

                (h) Operators of underground pipeline facilities (other than operators of interstate transmission facilities as defined in the pipeline safety laws (49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq.), and interstate pipelines as defined in § 195.2 of this chapter), excavators and persons who operate one-call notification systems who violate the applicable requirements of this subpart must be subject to civil penalties and injunctive relief that are substantially the same as are provided under the pipeline safety laws (49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq.).

                When and how will PHMSA evaluate State damage prevention enforcement programs?
                PHMSA conducts annual program evaluations and certification reviews of State pipeline safety programs. PHMSA will also conduct annual reviews of State excavation damage prevention law enforcement programs. PHMSA will use the criteria described in § 198.55 as the basis for the enforcement program reviews, utilizing information obtained from any State agency or office with a role in the State's excavation damage prevention law enforcement program. If PHMSA finds a State's enforcement program inadequate, PHMSA may take immediate enforcement against excavators in that State. The State will have five years from the date of the finding to make program improvements that meet PHMSA's criteria for minimum adequacy. A State that fails to establish an adequate enforcement program in accordance with § 198.55 within five years of the finding of inadequacy may be subject to reduced grant funding established under 49 U.S.C. 60107. PHMSA will determine the amount of the reduction using the same process it uses to distribute the grant funding; PHMSA will factor the findings from the annual review of the excavation damage prevention enforcement program into the 49 U.S.C. 60107 grant funding distribution to State pipeline safety programs. The amount of the reduction in 49 U.S.C. 60107 grant funding will not exceed four percent (4%) of prior year funding (not cumulative). If a State fails to implement an adequate enforcement program within five years of a finding of inadequacy, the Governor of that State may petition the Administrator of PHMSA, in writing, for a temporary waiver of the penalty, provided the petition includes a clear plan of action and timeline for achieving program adequacy.
              
              
                § 198.55
                What criteria will PHMSA use in evaluating the effectiveness of State damage prevention enforcement programs?
                (a) PHMSA will use the following criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of a State excavation damage prevention enforcement program:
                (1) Does the State have the authority to enforce its State excavation damage prevention law using civil penalties and other appropriate sanctions for violations?
                (2) Has the State designated a State agency or other body as the authority responsible for enforcement of the State excavation damage prevention law?
                (3) Is the State assessing civil penalties and other appropriate sanctions for violations at levels sufficient to deter noncompliance and is the State making publicly available information that demonstrates the effectiveness of the State's enforcement program?
                (4) Does the enforcement authority (if one exists) have a reliable mechanism (e.g., mandatory reporting, complaint-driven reporting) for learning about excavation damage to underground facilities?
                (5) Does the State employ excavation damage investigation practices that are adequate to determine the responsible party or parties when excavation damage to underground facilities occurs?
                (6) At a minimum, do the State's excavation damage prevention requirements include the following:
                (i) Excavators may not engage in excavation activity without first using an available one-call notification system to establish the location of underground facilities in the excavation area.
                (ii) Excavators may not engage in excavation activity in disregard of the marked location of a pipeline facility as established by a pipeline operator.
                (iii) An excavator who causes damage to a pipeline facility:
                (A) Must report the damage to the operator of the facility at the earliest practical moment following discovery of the damage; and

                (B) If the damage results in the escape of any PHMSA regulated natural and other gas or hazardous liquid, must promptly report to other appropriate authorities by calling the 911 emergency telephone number or another emergency telephone number.
                (7) Does the State limit exemptions for excavators from its excavation damage prevention law? A State must provide to PHMSA a written justification for any exemptions for excavators from State damage prevention requirements. PHMSA will make the written justifications available to the public.
                (b) PHMSA may consider individual enforcement actions taken by a State in evaluating the effectiveness of a State's damage prevention enforcement program.
              
              
                § 198.57
                What is the process PHMSA will use to notify a State that its damage prevention enforcement program appears to be inadequate?
                PHMSA will issue a notice of inadequacy to the State in accordance with 49 CFR 190.5. The notice will state the basis for PHMSA's determination that the State's damage prevention enforcement program appears inadequate for purposes of this subpart and set forth the State's response options.
              
              
                § 198.59
                How may a State respond to a notice of inadequacy?
                A State receiving a notice of inadequacy will have 30 days from receipt of the notice to submit a written response to the PHMSA official who issued the notice. In its response, the State may include information and explanations concerning the alleged inadequacy or contest the allegation of inadequacy and request the notice be withdrawn.
              
              
                § 198.61
                How is a State notified of PHMSA's final decision?
                PHMSA will issue a final decision on whether the State's damage prevention enforcement program has been found inadequate in accordance with 49 CFR 190.5.
              
              
                § 198.63
                How may a State with an inadequate damage prevention enforcement program seek reconsideration by PHMSA?
                At any time following a finding of inadequacy, the State may petition PHMSA to reconsider such finding based on changed circumstances including improvements in the State's enforcement program. Upon receiving a petition, PHMSA will reconsider its finding of inadequacy promptly and will notify the State of its decision on reconsideration promptly but no later than the time of the next annual certification review.

                § 199.103
                Use of persons who fail or refuse a drug test.
                (a) An operator may not knowingly use as an employee any person who—
                (1) Fails a drug test required by this part and the medical review officer makes a determination under DOT Procedures; or
                (2) Refuses to take a drug test required by this part.
                (b) Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to a person who has—
                (1) Passed a drug test under DOT Procedures;
                (2) Been considered by the medical review officer in accordance with DOT Procedures and been determined by a substance abuse professional to have successfully completed required education or treatment; and
                (3) Not failed a drug test required by this part after returning to duty.

                § 199.105
                Drug tests required.
                Each operator shall conduct the following drug tests for the presence of a prohibited drug:
                (a) Pre-employment testing. No operator may hire or contract for the use of any person as an employee unless that person passes a drug test or is covered by an anti-drug program that conforms to the requirements of this part.
                (b) Post-accident testing. (1) As soon as possible but no later than 32 hours after an accident, an operator must drug test each surviving covered employee whose performance of a covered function either contributed to the accident or cannot be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident. An operator may decide not to test under this paragraph but such a decision must be based on specific information that the covered employee's performance had no role in the cause(s) or severity of the accident.
                (2) If a test required by this section is not administered within the 32 hours following the accident, the operator must prepare and maintain its decision stating the reasons why the test was not promptly administered. If a test required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not administered within 32 hours following the accident, the operator must cease attempts to administer a drug test and must state in the record the reasons for not administering the test.
                (c) Random testing. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) through (4) of this section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing shall be 50 percent of covered employees.

                (2) The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is based on the reported positive rate for the entire industry. All information used for this determination is drawn from the drug MIS reports required by this subpart. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator considers the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional information or reports from operators, and may make appropriate modifications in calculating the industry positive rate. Each year, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing of covered employees. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following publication.
                
                (3) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of § 199.119 for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the reported positive rate is less than 1.0 percent.
                (4) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 25 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of § 199.119 for any calendar year indicate that the reported positive rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing to 50 percent of all covered employees.
                (5) The selection of employees for random drug testing shall be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random number table or a computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees' Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each covered employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made.
                (6) The operator shall randomly select a sufficient number of covered employees for testing during each calendar year to equal an annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing determined by the Administrator. If the operator conducts random drug testing through a consortium, the number of employees to be tested may be calculated for each individual operator or may be based on the total number of covered employees covered by the consortium who are subject to random drug testing at the same minimum annual percentage rate under this subpart or any DOT drug testing rule.
                (7) Each operator shall ensure that random drug tests conducted under this subpart are unannounced and that the dates for administering random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.
                (8) If a given covered employee is subject to random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency for the same operator, the employee shall be subject to random drug testing at the percentage rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency regulating more than 50 percent of the employee's function.
                (9) If an operator is required to conduct random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the operator may—
                (i) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same required rate; or
                (ii) Randomly select such employees for testing at the highest percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to which the operator is subject.
                (d) Testing based on reasonable cause. Each operator shall drug test each employee when there is reasonable cause to believe the employee is using a prohibited drug. The decision to test must be based on a reasonable and articulable belief that the employee is using a prohibited drug on the basis of specific, contemporaneous physical, behavioral, or performance indicators of probable drug use. At least two of the employee's supervisors, one of whom is trained in detection of the possible symptoms of drug use, shall substantiate and concur in the decision to test an employee. The concurrence between the two supervisors may be by telephone. However, in the case of operators with 50 or fewer employees subject to testing under this part, only one supervisor of the employee trained in detecting possible drug use symptoms shall substantiate the decision to test.
                (e) Return-to-duty testing. A covered employee who refuses to take or has a positive drug test may not return to duty in the covered function until the covered employee has complied with applicable provisions of DOT Procedures concerning substance abuse professionals and the return-to-duty process.
                (f) Follow-up testing. A covered employee who refuses to take or has a positive drug test shall be subject to unannounced follow-up drug tests administered by the operator following the covered employee's return to duty. The number and frequency of such follow-up testing shall be determined by a substance abuse professional, but shall consist of at least six tests in the first 12 months following the covered employee's return to duty. In addition, follow-up testing may include testing for alcohol as directed by the substance abuse professional, to be performed in accordance with 49 CFR part 40. Follow-up testing shall not exceed 60 months from the date of the covered employee's return to duty. The substance abuse professional may terminate the requirement for follow-up testing at any time after the first six tests have been administered, if the substance abuse professional determines that such testing is no longer necessary.

                (a) Each operator shall use for the drug testing required by this part only drug testing laboratories certified by the Department of Health and Human Services under the DOT Procedures.
                (b) The drug testing laboratory must permit—
                (1) Inspections by the operator before the laboratory is awarded a testing contract; and
                (2) Unannounced inspections, including examination of records, at any time, by the operator, the Administrator, and if the operator is subject to state agency jurisdiction, a representative of that state agency.

                Review of drug testing results.
                (a) MRO appointment. Each operator shall designate or appoint a medical review officer (MRO). If an operator does not have a qualified individual on staff to serve as MRO, the operator may contract for the provision of MRO services as part of its anti-drug program.
                (b) MRO qualifications. Each MRO must be a licensed physician who has the qualifications required by DOT Procedures.
                (c) MRO duties. The MRO must perform functions for the operator as required by DOT Procedures.
                (d) MRO reports. The MRO must report all drug test results to the operator in accordance with DOT Procedures.
                (e) Evaluation and rehabilitation may be provided by the operator, by a substance abuse professional under contract with the operator, or by a substance abuse professional not affiliated with the operator. The choice of substance abuse professional and assignment of costs shall be made in accordance with the operator/employee agreements and operator/employee policies.
                (f) The operator shall ensure that a substance abuse professional, who determines that a covered employee requires assistance in resolving problems with drug abuse, does not refer the covered employee to the substance abuse professional's private practice or to a person or organization from which the substance abuse professional receives remuneration or in which the substance abuse professional has a financial interest. This paragraph does not prohibit a substance abuse professional from referring a covered employee for assistance provided through:
                (1) A public agency, such as a State, county, or municipality;
                (2) The operator or a person under contract to provide treatment for drug problems on behalf of the operator;
                (3) The sole source of therapeutically appropriate treatment under the employee's health insurance program; or
                (4) The sole source of therapeutically appropriate treatment reasonably accessible to the employee.

The operator may establish the EAP as a part of its internal personnel services or the operator may contract with an entity that provides EAP services. Each EAP must include education and training on drug use. At the discretion of the operator, the EAP may include an opportunity for employee rehabilitation.
                (b) Education under each EAP must include at least the following elements: display and distribution of informational material; display and distribution of a community service hot-line telephone number for employee assistance; and display and distribution of the employer's policy regarding the use of prohibited drugs.
                (c) Training under each EAP for supervisory personnel who will determine whether an employee must be drug tested based on reasonable cause must include one 60-minute period of training on the specific, contemporaneous physical, behavioral, and performance indicators of probable drug use.

                Reporting of anti-drug testing results.

                (a) Each large operator (having more than 50 covered employees) must submit an annual Management Information System (MIS) report to PHMSA of its anti-drug testing using the MIS form and instructions as required by 49 CFR part 40 (at § 40.26 and appendix H to part 40), not later than March 15 of each year for the prior calendar year (January 1 through December 31). The Administrator may require by notice in the PHMSA Portal (https://portal.phmsa.dot.gov/phmsaportallanding) that small operators (50 or fewer covered employees), not otherwise required to submit annual MIS reports, to prepare and submit such reports to PHMSA.
                

                (b) Each report required under this section must be submitted electronically at http://damis.dot.gov. An operator may obtain the user name and password needed for electronic reporting from the PHMSA Portal (https://portal.phmsa.dot.gov/phmsaportallanding). If electronic reporting imposes an undue burden and hardship, the operator may submit a written request for an alternative reporting method to the Information Resources Manager, Office of Pipeline Safety, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20590. The request must describe the undue burden and hardship. PHMSA will review the request and may authorize, in writing, an alternative reporting method. An authorization will state the period for which it is valid, which may be indefinite. An operator must contact PHMSA at 202-366-8075, or electronically to informationresourcesmanager@dot.gov to make arrangements for submitting a report that is due after a request for alternative reporting is submitted but before an authorization or denial is received.
                (c) To calculate the total number of covered employees eligible for random testing throughout the year, as an operator, you must add the total number of covered employees eligible for testing during each random testing period for the year and divide that total by the number of random testing periods. Covered employees, and only covered employees, are to be in an employer's random testing pool, and all covered employees must be in the random pool. If you are an employer conducting random testing more often than once per month (e.g., you select daily, weekly, bi-weekly), you do not need to compute this total number of covered employees rate more than on a once per month basis.
                (d) As an employer, you may use a service agent (e.g., C/TPA) to perform random selections for you; and your covered employees may be part of a larger random testing pool of covered employees. However, you must ensure that the service agent you use is testing at the appropriate percentage established for your industry and that only covered employees are in the random testing pool.
                (e) Each operator that has a covered employee who performs multi-DOT agency functions (e.g., an employee performs pipeline maintenance duties and drives a commercial motor vehicle), count the employee only on the MIS report for the DOT agency under which he or she is randomly tested. Normally, this will be the DOT agency under which the employee performs more than 50% of his or her duties. Operators may have to explain the testing data for these employees in the event of a DOT agency inspection or audit.
                (f) A service agent (e.g., Consortia/Third Party Administrator as defined in 49 CFR part 40) may prepare the MIS report on behalf of an operator. However, each report shall be certified by the operator's anti-drug manager or designated representative for accuracy and completeness.

                Each operator shall prohibit a covered employee from reporting for duty or remaining on duty requiring the performance of covered functions while having an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater. No operator having actual knowledge that a covered employee has an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater shall permit the employee to perform or continue to perform covered functions.
              
              
                § 199.217
                On-duty use.
                Each operator shall prohibit a covered employee from using alcohol while performing covered functions. No operator having actual knowledge that a covered employee is using alcohol while performing covered functions shall permit the employee to perform or continue to perform covered functions.
              
              
                § 199.219
                Pre-duty use.
                Each operator shall prohibit a covered employee from using alcohol within four hours prior to performing covered functions, or, if an employee is called to duty to respond to an emergency, within the time period after the employee has been notified to report for duty. No operator having actual knowledge that a covered employee has used alcohol within four hours prior to performing covered functions or within the time period after the employee has been notified to report for duty shall permit that covered employee to perform or continue to perform covered functions.
              
              
                § 199.221
                Use following an accident.

                Each operator shall prohibit a covered employee who has actual knowledge of an accident in which his or her performance of covered functions has not been discounted by the operator as a contributing factor to the accident from using alcohol for eight hours following the accident, unless he or she has been given a post-accident test under § 199.225(a), or the operator has determined that the employee's performance could not have contributed to the accident.
              
              
                § 199.223
                Refusal to submit to a required alcohol test.
                Each operator shall require a covered employee to submit to a post-accident alcohol test required under § 199.225(a), a reasonable suspicion alcohol test required under § 199.225(b), or a follow-up alcohol test required under § 199.225(d). No operator shall permit an employee who refuses to submit to such a test to perform or continue to perform covered functions.
              
              
                § 199.225
                Alcohol tests required.
                Each operator must conduct the following types of alcohol tests for the presence of alcohol:
                (a) Post-accident. (1) As soon as practicable following an accident, each operator must test each surviving covered employee for alcohol if that employee's performance of a covered function either contributed to the accident or cannot be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident. The decision not to administer a test under this section must be based on specific information that the covered employee's performance had no role in the cause(s) or severity of the accident.
                (2)(i) If a test required by this section is not administered within 2 hours following the accident, the operator shall prepare and maintain on file a record stating the reasons the test was not promptly administered. If a test required by paragraph (a) is not administered within 8 hours following the accident, the operator shall cease attempts to administer an alcohol test and shall state in the record the reasons for not administering the test.
                (ii) [Reserved]
                (3) A covered employee who is subject to post-accident testing who fails to remain readily available for such testing, including notifying the operator or operator representative of his/her location if he/she leaves the scene of the accident prior to submission to such test, may be deemed by the operator to have refused to submit to testing. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the delay of necessary medical attention for injured people following an accident or to prohibit a covered employee from leaving the scene of an accident for the period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident or to obtain necessary emergency medical care.
                (b) Reasonable suspicion testing. (1) Each operator shall require a covered employee to submit to an alcohol test when the operator has reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has violated the prohibitions in this subpart.
                (2) The operator's determination that reasonable suspicion exists to require the covered employee to undergo an alcohol test shall be based on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors of the employee. The required observations shall be made by a supervisor who is trained in detecting the symptoms of alcohol misuse. The supervisor who makes the determination that reasonable suspicion exists shall not conduct the breath alcohol test on that employee.
                (3) Alcohol testing is authorized by this section only if the observations required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section are made during, just preceding, or just after the period of the work day that the employee is required to be in compliance with this subpart. A covered employee may be directed by the operator to undergo reasonable suspicion testing for alcohol only while the employee is performing covered functions; just before the employee is to perform covered functions; or just after the employee has ceased performing covered functions.

                (4)(i) If a test required by this section is not administered within 2 hours following the determination under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the operator shall prepare and maintain on file a record stating the reasons the test was not promptly administered. If a test required by this section is not administered within 8 hours following the determination under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the operator shall cease attempts to administer an alcohol test and shall state in the record the reasons for not administering the test. Records shall be submitted to PHMSA upon request of the Administrator.
                
                (ii) [Reserved]
                (iii) Notwithstanding the absence of a reasonable suspicion alcohol test under this section, an operator shall not permit a covered employee to report for duty or remain on duty requiring the performance of covered functions while the employee is under the influence of or impaired by alcohol, as shown by the behavioral, speech, or performance indicators of alcohol misuse, nor shall an operator permit the covered employee to perform or continue to perform covered functions, until:
                (A) An alcohol test is administered and the employee's alcohol concentration measures less than 0.02; or
                (B) The start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than 8 hours following the determination under paragraph (b)(2) of this section that there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has violated the prohibitions in this subpart.
                (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii), no operator shall take any action under this subpart against a covered employee based solely on the employee's behavior and appearance in the absence of an alcohol test. This does not prohibit an operator with the authority independent of this subpart from taking any action otherwise consistent with law.
                (c) Return-to-duty testing. Each operator shall ensure that before a covered employee returns to duty requiring the performance of a covered function after engaging in conduct prohibited by §§ 199.215 through 199.223, the employee shall undergo a return-to-duty alcohol test with a result indicating an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02.
                (d) Follow-up testing. (1) Following a determination under § 199.243(b) that a covered employee is in need of assistance in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse, each operator shall ensure that the employee is subject to unannounced follow-up alcohol testing as directed by a substance abuse professional in accordance with the provisions of § 199.243(c)(2)(ii).
                (2) Follow-up testing shall be conducted when the covered employee is performing covered functions; just before the employee is to perform covered functions; or just after the employee has ceased performing such functions.
                (e) Retesting of covered employees with an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04. Each operator shall retest a covered employee to ensure compliance with the provisions of § 199.237, if an operator chooses to permit the employee to perform a covered function within 8 hours following the administration of an alcohol test indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04.

                § 199.229
                Reporting of alcohol testing results.

                (a) Each large operator (having more than 50 covered employees) must submit an annual MIS report to PHMSA of its alcohol testing results using the MIS form and instructions as required by 49 CFR part 40 (at § 40.26 and appendix H to part 40), not later than March 15 of each year for the prior calendar year (January 1 through December 31). The Administrator may require by notice in the PHMSA Portal (https://portal.phmsa.dot.gov/phmsaportallanding) that small operators (50 or fewer covered employees), not otherwise required to submit annual MIS reports, to prepare and submit such reports to PHMSA.
                (b) Each operator that has a covered employee who performs multi-DOT agency functions (e.g., an employee performs pipeline maintenance duties and drives a commercial motor vehicle), count the employee only on the MIS report for the DOT agency under which he or she is tested. Normally, this will be the DOT agency under which the employee performs more than 50% of his or her duties. Operators may have to explain the testing data for these employees in the event of a DOT agency inspection or audit.

                (c) Each report required under this section must be submitted electronically at http://damis.dot.gov. An operator may obtain the user name and password needed for electronic reporting from the PHMSA Portal (https://portal.phmsa.dot.gov/phmsaportallanding). If electronic reporting imposes an undue burden and hardship, the operator may submit a written request for an alternative reporting method to the Information Resources Manager, Office of Pipeline Safety, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20590. The request must describe the undue burden and hardship. PHMSA will review the request and may authorize, in writing, an alternative reporting method. An authorization will state the period for which it is valid, which may be indefinite. An operator must contact PHMSA at 202-366-8075, or electronically to informationresourcesmanager@dot.gov to make arrangements for submitting a report that is due after a request for alternative reporting is submitted but before an authorization or denial is received.
                (d) A service agent (e.g., Consortia/Third Party Administrator as defined in part 40) may prepare the MIS report on behalf of an operator. However, each report shall be certified by the operator's anti-drug manager or designated representative for accuracy and completeness.

                (a) Except as required by law or expressly authorized or required in this subpart, no employer shall release covered employee information that is contained in records required to be maintained in § 199.227.
                (b) A covered employee is entitled, upon written request, to obtain copies of any records pertaining to the employee's use of alcohol, including any records pertaining to his or her alcohol tests. The operator shall promptly provide the records requested by the employee. Access to an employee's records shall not be contingent upon payment for records other than those specifically requested.
                (c) Each operator shall permit access to all facilities utilized in complying with the requirements of this subpart to the Secretary of Transportation, any DOT agency, or a representative of a state agency with regulatory authority over the operator.
                (d) Each operator shall make available copies of all results for employer alcohol testing conducted under this subpart and any other information pertaining to the operator's alcohol misuse prevention program, when requested by the Secretary of Transportation, any DOT agency with regulatory authority over the operator, or a representative of a state agency with regulatory authority over the operator. The information shall include name-specific alcohol test results, records, and reports.
                (e) When requested by the National Transportation Safety Board as part of an accident investigation, an operator shall disclose information related to the operator's administration of any post- accident alcohol tests administered following the accident under investigation.
                (f) An operator shall make records available to a subsequent employer upon receipt of the written request from the covered employee. Disclosure by the subsequent employer is permitted only as expressly authorized by the terms of the employee's written request.
                (g) An operator may disclose information without employee consent as provided by DOT Procedures concerning certain legal proceedings.
                (h) An operator shall release information regarding a covered employee's records as directed by the specific, written consent of the employee authorizing release of the information to an identified person. Release of such information by the person receiving the information is permitted only in accordance with the terms of the employee's consent.

                (1) The employee's alcohol concentration measures less than 0.02 in accordance with a test administered under § 199.225(e); or
                (2) The start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than eight hours following administration of the test.
                (b) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, no operator shall take any action under this subpart against an employee based solely on test results showing an alcohol concentration less than 0.04. This does not prohibit an operator with authority independent of this subpart from taking any action otherwise consistent with law.

                Operator obligation to promulgate a policy on the misuse of alcohol.
                (a) General requirements. Each operator shall provide educational materials that explain these alcohol misuse requirements and the operator's policies and procedures with respect to meeting those requirements.
                (1) The operator shall ensure that a copy of these materials is distributed to each covered employee prior to start of alcohol testing under this subpart, and to each person subsequently hired for or transferred to a covered position.
                (2) Each operator shall provide written notice to representatives of employee organizations of the availability of this information.
                (b) Required content. The materials to be made available to covered employees shall include detailed discussion of at least the following:

                (5) The circumstances under which a covered employee will be tested for alcohol under this subpart.
                (6) The procedures that will be used to test for the presence of alcohol, protect the covered employee and the integrity of the breath testing process, safeguard the validity of the test results, and ensure that those results are attributed to the correct employee.
                (7) The requirement that a covered employee submit to alcohol tests administered in accordance with this subpart.
                (8) An explanation of what constitutes a refusal to submit to an alcohol test and the attendant consequences.

                (c) Optional provisions. The materials supplied to covered employees may also include information on additional operator policies with respect to the use or possession of alcohol, including any consequences for an employee found to have a specified alcohol level, that are based on the operator's authority independent of this subpart. Any such additional policies or consequences shall be clearly described as being based on independent authority.

                (b) Each covered employee who engages in conduct prohibited under §§ 199.215 through 199.223 shall be evaluated by a substance abuse professional who shall determine what assistance, if any, the employee needs in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse.
                (c)(1) Before a covered employee returns to duty requiring the performance of a covered function after engaging in conduct prohibited by §§ 199.215 through 199.223 of this subpart, the employee shall undergo a return-to-duty alcohol test with a result indicating an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02.
                (2) In addition, each covered employee identified as needing assistance in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse—
                (i) Shall be evaluated by a substance abuse professional to determine that the employee has properly followed any rehabilitation program prescribed under paragraph (b) of this section, and
                (ii) Shall be subject to unannounced follow-up alcohol tests administered by the operator following the employee's return to duty. The number and frequency of such follow-up testing shall be determined by a substance abuse professional, but shall consist of at least six tests in the first 12 months following the employee's return to duty. In addition, follow-up testing may include testing for drugs, as directed by the substance abuse professional, to be performed in accordance with 49 CFR part 40. Follow-up testing shall not exceed 60 months from the date of the employee's return to duty. The substance abuse professional may terminate the requirement for follow-up testing at any time after the first six tests have been administered, if the substance abuse professional determines that such testing is no longer necessary.
                (d) Evaluation and rehabilitation may be provided by the operator, by a substance abuse professional under contract with the operator, or by a substance abuse professional not affiliated with the operator. The choice of substance abuse professional and assignment of costs shall be made in accordance with the operator/employee agreements and operator/employee policies.
                (e) The operator shall ensure that a substance abuse professional who determines that a covered employee requires assistance in resolving problems with alcohol misuse does not refer the employee to the substance abuse professional's private practice or to a person or organization from which the substance abuse professional receives remuneration or in which the substance abuse professional has a financial interest. This paragraph does not prohibit a substance abuse professional from referring an employee for assistance provided through—
