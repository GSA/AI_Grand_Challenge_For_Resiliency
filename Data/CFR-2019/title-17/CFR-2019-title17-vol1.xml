      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

            <P>(iii) The potential change in the value of services which a person provides, purchases, or anticipates providing or purchasing.</P>
            <P>(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no transactions or positions shall be classified as bona fide hedging unless their purpose is to offset price risks incidental to commercial cash or spot operations and such positions are established and liquidated in an orderly manner in accordance with sound commercial practices and, for transactions or positions on contract markets subject to trading and position limits in effect pursuant to section 4a of the Act, unless the provisions of paragraphs (2) and (3) of this definition have been satisfied.</P>

            <P>(ii) Purchases of any agreement, contract or transaction in an excluded commodity on a designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility which do not exceed in quantity:</P>

            <P>(A) The fixed-price sale of the same cash commodity by the same person;<PRTPAGE P="8"/>
            </P>

            <P>(C) Twelve months' unfilled anticipated requirements of the same cash commodity for processing, manufacturing, or feeding by the same person, provided that such transactions and positions in the five last trading days of any agreement, contract or transaction do not exceed the person's unfilled anticipated requirements of the same cash commodity for that month and for the next succeeding month.</P>
            <P>(iii) Offsetting sales and purchases in any agreement, contract or transaction in an excluded commodity on a designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility which do not exceed in quantity that amount of the same cash commodity which has been bought and sold by the same person at unfixed prices basis different delivery months of the contract market, provided that no such position is maintained in any agreement, contract or transaction during the five last trading days.</P>
            <P>(iv) Purchases or sales by an agent who does not own or has not contracted to sell or purchase the offsetting cash commodity at a fixed price, provided that the agent is responsible for the merchandising of the cash position that is being offset, and the agent has a contractual arrangement with the person who owns the commodity or has the cash market commitment being offset.</P>
            <P>(v) Sales and purchases described in paragraphs (2)(i) through (iv) of this definition may also be offset other than by the same quantity of the same cash commodity, provided that the fluctuations in value of the position for in any agreement, contract or transaction are substantially related to the fluctuations in value of the actual or anticipated cash position, and provided that the positions in any agreement, contract or transaction shall not be maintained during the five last trading days.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Non-Enumerated cases.</E> A designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility may recognize, consistent with the purposes of this definition, transactions and positions other than those enumerated in paragraph (2) of this definition as bona fide hedging. Prior to recognizing such non-enumerated transactions and positions, the designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility shall submit such rules for Commission review under section 5c of the Act and part 40 of this chapter.</P>

            <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) $1 billion in aggregate uncollateralized outward exposure plus aggregate potential outward exposure in any major category of swaps; if the person is subject to the definition in this section of <E T="03">substantial position,</E> by virtue of being a highly leveraged financial entity that is not subject to capital requirements established by an appropriate Federal banking agency, this analysis shall account for all of the person's swap positions in that major category (without excluding hedging positions), otherwise this analysis shall exclude the same hedging and related positions that are excluded from consideration pursuant to paragraph (1)(i) of the definition in this section of <E T="03">substantial position;</E> or</P>

            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) At the end of each month, the sum of the amount calculated under paragraph (6)(iii)(A)(1) of this definition with respect to each major swap category and the total notional principal amount of the person's swap positions in each such major swap category, adjusted by the multipliers set forth in paragraph (3)(ii)(1) of the definition in this section of <E T="03">substantial position</E> on a position-by-position basis reflecting the type of swap, is less than $3 billion with respect to the rate swap category and less than $1 billion with respect to each of the other major swap categories; or</P>
            <P>(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) At the end of each month, the person's aggregate uncollateralized outward exposure with respect to its swap positions across all major swap categories is less than $500 million; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The sum of the amount calculated under paragraph (6)(iii)(B)(1) of this definition and the product of the total effective notional principal amount of the person's swap positions in all major swap categories multiplied by 0.15 is less than $1 billion.</P>

            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The person's aggregate uncollateralized outward exposure for positions held with swap dealers shall be equal to such exposure reported on the most recent reports of such exposure received from such swap dealers; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The person's aggregate uncollateralized outward exposure for positions that are not reflected in any report of exposure from a swap dealer (including all swap positions it holds with persons other than swap dealers) shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (2) of the definition in this section of <E T="03">substantial position.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(iv) For purposes of the calculations set forth in paragraph (6) of this definition, the person shall use the effective notional amount of a position rather than the stated notional amount of the position if the stated notional amount is leveraged or enhanced by the structure of the position.</P>
            <P>(v) No presumption shall arise that a person is required to perform the calculations needed to determine if it is a major swap participant, solely by reason that the person does not meet the conditions specified in paragraph (6)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this definition.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Exclusions.</E> A person who is registered as a derivatives clearing organization with the Commission pursuant to section 5b of the Act and regulations thereunder, shall not be deemed to be a major swap participant, regardless of whether the criteria in this definition otherwise would cause the person to be a major swap participant.</P>

            <P>(i) <E T="03">Segregation risk.</E> The written policies and procedures shall be reasonably designed to ensure that segregated funds are separately accounted for and segregated or secured as belonging to customers as required by the Act and Commission regulations and must, at a minimum, include or address the following:</P>
            <P>(A) A process for the evaluation of depositories of segregated funds, including, at a minimum, documented criteria that any depository that will hold segregated funds, including an entity affiliated with the futures commission merchant, must meet, including criteria addressing the depository's capitalization, creditworthiness, operational reliability, and access to liquidity. The criteria should further consider the extent to which segregated funds are concentrated with any depository or group of depositories. The criteria also should include the availability of deposit insurance and the extent of the regulation and supervision of the depository;</P>

            <P>(B) A program to monitor an approved depository on an ongoing basis <PRTPAGE P="55"/>to assess its continued satisfaction of the futures commission merchant's established criteria, including a thorough due diligence review of each depository at least annually;</P>
            <P>(C) An account opening process for depositories, including documented authorization requirements, procedures that ensure that segregated funds are not deposited with a depository prior to the futures commission merchant receiving the acknowledgment letter required from such depository pursuant to §§ 1.20, and 22.2 and 30.7 of this chapter, and procedures that ensure that such account is properly titled to reflect that it is holding segregated funds pursuant to the Act and Commission regulations;</P>
            <P>(D) A process for establishing a targeted amount of residual interest that the futures commission merchant seeks to maintain as its residual interest in the segregated funds accounts and such process must be designed to reasonably ensure that the futures commission merchant maintains the targeted residual amounts and remains in compliance with the segregated funds requirements at all times. The policies and procedures must require that senior management, in establishing the total amount of the targeted residual interest in the segregated funds accounts, perform appropriate due diligence and consider various factors, as applicable, relating to the nature of the futures commission merchant's business including, but not limited to, the composition of the futures commission merchant's customer base, the general creditworthiness of the customer base, the general trading activity of the customers, the types of markets and products traded by the customers, the proprietary trading of the futures commission merchant, the general volatility and liquidity of the markets and products traded by customers, the futures commission merchant's own liquidity and capital needs, and the historical trends in customer segregated fund balances, including undermargined amounts and net deficit balances in customers' accounts. The analysis and calculation of the targeted amount of the future commission merchant's residual interest must be described in writing with the specificity necessary to allow the Commission and the futures commission merchant's designated self-regulatory organization to duplicate the analysis and calculation and test the assumptions made by the futures commission merchant. The adequacy of the targeted residual interest and the process for establishing the targeted residual interest must be reassessed periodically by Senior Management and revised as necessary;</P>
            <P>(E) A process for the withdrawal of cash, securities, or other property from accounts holding segregated funds, where the withdrawal is not for the purpose of payments to or on behalf of the futures commission merchant's customers. Such policies and procedures must satisfy the requirements of § 1.23, § 22.17 of this chapter, or § 30.7 of this chapter, as applicable;</P>
            <P>(F) A process for assessing the appropriateness of specific investments of segregated funds in permitted investments in accordance with § 1.25. Such policies and procedures must take into consideration the market, credit, counterparty, operational, and liquidity risks associated with such investments, and assess whether such investments comply with the requirements in § 1.25 including that the futures commission merchant manage the permitted investments consistent with the objectives of preserving principal and maintaining liquidity;</P>
            <P>(G) Procedures requiring the appropriate separation of duties among individuals responsible for compliance with the Act and Commission regulations relating to the protection and financial reporting of segregated funds, including the separation of duties among personnel that are responsible for advising customers on trading activities, approving or overseeing cash receipts and disbursements (including investment operations), and recording and reporting financial transactions. The policies and procedures must require that any movement of funds to affiliated companies and parties are properly approved and documented;</P>

            <P>(H) A process for the timely recording of all transactions, including transactions impacting customers' accounts, in the firm's books of record;<PRTPAGE P="56"/>
            </P>
            <P>(I) A program for conducting annual training of all finance, treasury, operations, regulatory, compliance, settlement, and other relevant officers and employees regarding the segregation requirements for segregated funds required by the Act and regulations, the requirements for notices under § 1.12, procedures for reporting suspected breaches of the policies and procedures required by this section to the chief compliance officer, without fear of retaliation, and the consequences of failing to comply with the segregation requirements of the Act and regulations; and</P>
            <P>(J) Policies and procedures for assessing the liquidity, marketability and mark-to-market valuation of all securities or other non-cash assets held as segregated funds, including permitted investments under § 1.25, to ensure that all non-cash assets held in the customer segregated accounts, both customer-owned securities and investments in accordance with § 1.25, are readily marketable and highly liquid. Such policies and procedures must require daily measurement of liquidity needs with respect to customers; assessment of procedures to liquidate all non-cash collateral in a timely manner and without significant effect on price; and application of appropriate collateral haircuts that accurately reflect market and credit risk.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Operational risk.</E> The Risk Management Program shall include automated financial risk management controls reasonably designed to prevent the placing of erroneous orders, including those that exceed pre-set capital, credit, or volume thresholds. The Risk Management Program shall ensure that the use of automated trading programs is subject to policies and procedures governing the use, supervision, maintenance, testing, and inspection of such programs.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Capital risk.</E> The written policies and procedures shall be reasonably designed to ensure that the futures commission merchant has sufficient capital to be in compliance with the Act and the regulations, and sufficient capital and liquidity to meet the reasonably foreseeable needs of the futures commission merchant.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Supervision of the Risk Management Program.</E> The Risk Management Program shall include a supervisory system that is reasonably designed to ensure that the policies and procedures required by this section are diligently followed.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Review and testing.</E> (1) The Risk Management Program of each futures commission merchant shall be reviewed and tested on at least an annual basis, or upon any material change in the business of the futures commission merchant that is reasonably likely to alter the risk profile of the futures commission merchant.</P>
            <P>(2) The annual reviews of the Risk Management Program shall include an analysis of adherence to, and the effectiveness of, the risk management policies and procedures, and any recommendations for modifications to the Risk Management Program. The annual testing shall be performed by qualified internal audit staff that are independent of the business unit, or by a qualified third party audit service reporting to staff that are independent of the business unit. The results of the annual review of the Risk Management Program shall be promptly reported to and reviewed by the chief compliance officer, senior management, and governing body of the futures commission merchant.</P>
            <P>(3) Each futures commission merchant shall document all internal and external reviews and testing of its Risk Management Program and written risk management policies and procedures including the date of the review or test; the results; any deficiencies identified; the corrective action taken; and the date that corrective action was taken. Such documentation shall be provided to Commission staff, upon request.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Distribution of risk management policies and procedures.</E> The Risk Management Program shall include procedures for the timely distribution of its written risk management policies and procedures to relevant supervisory personnel. Each futures commission merchant shall maintain records of the persons to whom the risk management policies and procedures were distributed and when they were distributed.<PRTPAGE P="57"/>
            </P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Recordkeeping.</E> (1) Each futures commission merchant shall maintain copies of all written approvals required by this section.</P>
            <P>(2) All records or reports, including, but not limited to, the written policies and procedures and any changes thereto that a futures commission merchant is required to maintain pursuant to this regulation shall be maintained in accordance with § 1.31 and shall be made available promptly upon request to representatives of the Commission.</P>

            <P>(f)(1) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(2) Whenever a registered futures commission merchant determines that any position it carries for another registered futures commission merchant or for a registered leverage transaction merchant must be liquidated immediately, transferred immediately or that the trading of any account of such futures commission merchant or leverage transaction merchant shall be only for purposes of liquidation, because the other futures commission merchant or the leverage transaction merchant has failed to meet a call for margin or to make other required deposits, the carrying futures commission merchant must immediately give notice, as provided in paragraph (n) of this section, of such a determination.</P>

            <P>(k) A futures commission merchant must provide immediate notice, as provided in paragraph (n) of this section, whenever the futures commission merchant, or the futures commission merchant's parent or material affiliate, experiences a material adverse impact to its creditworthiness or ability to fund its obligations, including any change that could adversely impact the firm's liquidity resources.</P>
            <P>(l) A futures commission merchant must provide prompt notice, but in no event later than 24 hours, as provided in paragraph (n) of this section, whenever the futures commission merchant experiences a material change in its operations or risk profile, including a change in the senior management of the futures commission merchant, the establishment or termination of a line of business, or a material adverse change in the futures commission merchant's clearing arrangements.</P>

            <P>(m) A futures commission merchant must provide notice, if the futures commission merchant has been notified by the Securities and Exchange Commission, a securities self-regulatory organization, or a futures self-regulatory organization, that it is the subject of a formal investigation.

            <P>(n) <E T="03">Notice.</E> (1) Every notice and report required to be filed by this section by a futures commission merchant or a self-regulatory organization must be filed with the Commission, with the designated self-regulatory organization, if any, and with the Securities and Exchange Commission, if such registrant is a securities broker or dealer.

Every notice or report that is required to be filed by this section by an introducing broker or applicant for registration as an introducing broker must include a discussion of how the reporting event originated and what steps have been, or are being taken, to address the reporting event.</P>

            <P>(3) Every notice or report that is required to be filed by a futures commission merchant with the Commission or with a designated self-regulatory organization under this section must be in writing and must be filed via electronic transmission using a form of user authentication assigned in accordance with procedures established by or approved by the Commission, and otherwise in accordance with instructions issued by or approved by the Commission; <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> that if the registered futures commission merchant cannot file the notice or report using the electronic transmission approved by the Commission due to a transmission or systems failure, the futures commission merchant must immediately contact the Commission's regional office with jurisdiction over the futures commission merchant as provided in § 140.02 of this chapter, and by email to <E T="03">FCMNotice@CFTC.gov.</E> Any such electronic submission must clearly indicate the futures commission merchant on whose behalf such filing is made and the use of such user authentication in submitting such filing will constitute and become a substitute for the manual signature of the authorized signer.</P>

In granting exemptions under this section, the Commission shall consider, among other factors, whether the records required by this section concerning the Material Affiliated Persons of the futures commission merchant affiliated with the Reporting Futures Commission Merchant will be available to the Commission pursuant to this section or § 1.15. A request for exemption filed under this paragraph (d)(2) shall explain the basis for the designation of a particular futures commission merchant as the Reporting Futures Commission Merchant and will become effective on the thirtieth day after receipt of such request by the Commission unless the Commission objects to the request by that date.</P>
            <P>(3) The Commission may exempt any futures commission merchant from any provision of this section if it finds that the exemption is not contrary to the public interest and the purposes of the provisions from which the exemption is sought. The Commission may grant the exemption subject to such terms and conditions as it may find appropriate.</P>

The election to maintain records at the principal place of business of the Material Affiliated Person or at a records storage facility pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall not relieve the futures commission merchant required to maintain and preserve such records from any of its responsibilities under this section or § 1.15.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Confidentiality.</E> All information obtained by the Commission pursuant to <PRTPAGE P="65"/>the provisions of this section from a futures commission merchant concerning a Material Affiliated Person shall be deemed confidential information for the purposes of section 8 of the Act.</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Special provisions with respect to Material Affiliated Persons subject to the supervision of certain domestic regulators.</E> (1) In the case of a futures commission merchant which is required to file, or has a Material Affiliated Person which is required to file, Form 17-H (or such other forms or reports as may be required) with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to § 240.17h-2T of this title, or such other risk assessment regulations as the Securities and Exchange Commission may adopt, such futures commission merchant shall be deemed to be in compliance with the reporting requirements of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(2) of this section if the futures commission merchant furnishes, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a copy of the most recent Form 17-H filed by the futures commission merchant or its Material Affiliated Person with the Securities and Exchange Commission, provided however, that if the futures commission merchant has designated any of its affiliated persons as Material Affiliated Persons for purposes of this section and § 1.14 which are not designated as Material Associated Persons for purposes of the Form 17-H filed pursuant to §§ 240.17h-1T and 240.17h-2T of this title, the futures commission must also designate any such affiliated person as a Material Affiliated Person on the organizational chart required as Item 1 of part I of Form 17-H. To comply with paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(2) of this section, such futures commission merchant may, at its option, file Form 17-H in its entirety or file such form without the information required under part II of Form 17-H.</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of a Material Affiliated Person (including a foreign banking organization) that is subject to examination by, or the reporting requirements of, a Federal banking agency, the futures commission merchant shall be deemed to be in compliance with the reporting requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section with respect to such Material Affiliated Person if the futures commission merchant or such Material Affiliated Person maintains in accordance with § 1.14 copies of all reports filed by the Material Affiliated Person with the Federal banking agency pursuant to section 5211 of the Revised Statutes, section 9 of the Federal Reserve Act, section 7(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, section 10(b) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, or section 5 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956.</P>

            <P>(1) The futures commission merchant agrees to use its best efforts to obtain from the Material Affiliated Person and to cause the Material Affiliated Person to provide, directly or through its foreign futures authority or other foreign regulatory authority, any supplemental information the Commission may request and there is no statute or other bar in the foreign jurisdiction that would preclude the futures commission merchant, the Material Affiliated Person, the foreign futures authority or other foreign regulatory authority from providing such information to the Commission; or</P>
            <P>(2) The foreign futures authority or other foreign regulatory authority with whom the Material Affiliated Person files such reports has entered into an information sharing agreement with the Commission which is in effect as of the futures commission merchant's fiscal year-end and which will allow the Commission to obtain the type of information required herein.

            <SECTNO>§ 1.16</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Qualifications and reports of accountants.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions—</E>(1) <E T="03">Accountant's report.</E> The term “accountant's report,” when used in regard to financial statements and schedules, means a document in which an independent licensed or certified public accountant indicates the scope of the audit (or examination) which he has made and sets forth his opinion regarding the financial statements and schedules taken as a whole or an assertion to the fact that an overall opinion cannot be expressed. When an overall opinion cannot be expressed, the reasons therefore must be stated.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Audit or examination.</E> The terms “audit” and “examination,” when used in regard to financial statements and schedules, mean an examination of the <PRTPAGE P="69"/>statements and schedules by an accountant in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards for the purposes of expressing an opinion thereon.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Certified.</E> The term “certified,” when used in regard to financial statements and schedules, means audited and reported upon with an opinion expressed by an independent certified public accountant or independent licensed public accountant.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Customer.</E> The term “customer” means customer, as defined in §§ 1.3, and 30.7 customer, as defined in § 30.1 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Qualifications of accountants.</E> (1) The Commission will recognize any person as a certified public accountant who is duly registered and in good standing as such under the laws of the place of his residence or principal office; <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> that a certified public accountant engaged to conduct an examination of a futures commission merchant must be registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and must have undergone an examination by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and may not be subject to a permanent or temporary bar to engage in the examination of public issuers or brokers or dealers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a result of a Public Company Accounting Oversight Board disciplinary hearing.</P>
            <P>(2) The Commission will not recognize any certified public accountant or licensed public accountant as independent who is not in fact independent. For example, an accountant will not be considered independent with respect to any applicant or registrant or any parent, subsidiary, or other affiliate of such applicant or registrant (i) in which, during the period of his professional engagement to examine the financial statements and schedules being reported on or at the date of his report, he or his firm or a member thereof had, or was committed to acquire, any direct financial interest or any material indirect financial interest, or (ii) with which, during the period of his professional engagement to examine the financial statements and schedules being reported on, at the date of his report or during the period covered by the financial statements, he or his firm or a member thereof was connected as a promoter, underwriter, voting trustee, director, officer, or employee, except that a firm will be deemed independent with respect to an applicant or registrant and its affiliates if a former employee or officer of such applicant or registrant or any such affiliate is employed by the firm and such individual has completely disassociated himself from the applicant or registrant and its affiliates and does not participate in auditing financial statements and schedules of the applicant or registrant or its affiliates covering any period of his employment by the applicant or registrant or its affiliates. An accountant will not be considered independent if he or his firm or a member thereof performs manual or automated bookkeeping services or assumes responsibility for maintenance of the accounting records, including accounting classification decisions, of such applicant or registrant or any of its affiliates. For the purposes of this § 1.16(b), the term “member” means all partners in the firm and all professional employees participating in the audit or located in the office of the firm participating in a significant portion of the audit.</P>
            <P>(3) In determining whether an accountant may in fact not be independent with respect to a particular applicant or registrant, the Commission will give appropriate consideration to all relevant circumstances, including evidence bearing on all relationships between the accountant and that applicant or registrant or any affiliate thereof, and will not confine itself to the relationship existing in connection with the filing of reports with the Commission.</P>

            <P>(4) The governing body of each futures commission merchant must ensure that the certified public accountant engaged is duly qualified to perform an audit of the futures commission merchant. Such an evaluation of the qualifications of the certified public accountant should include, among other issues, the certified public accountant's experience in auditing futures commission merchants, the depth of the certified public accountant's staff, the certified public accountant's <PRTPAGE P="70"/>knowledge of the Act and Regulations, the size and geographic location of the futures commission merchant, and the independence of the certified public accountant. The governing body should also review and consider the inspection reports issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board as part of the assessment of the qualifications of the public accountant to perform an audit of the futures commission merchant.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Accountant's reports</E>—(1) <E T="03">Technical requirements.</E> The accountant's report must:</P>
            <P>(i) Be dated;</P>
            <P>(ii) Indicate the city and State where issued; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Identify without detailed enumeration the financial statements covered by the report.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Representations as to the audit.</E> The accountant's report must state whether the audit was made in accordance with the auditing standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and must designate any auditing procedures deemed necessary by the accountant under the circumstances of the particular case which have been omitted and the reasons for their omission. However, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to imply authority for the omission of any procedure which independent accountants would ordinarily employ in the course of an audit made for the purposes of expressing the opinion required by paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Opinion to be expressed.</E> The accountant's report must state clearly: (i) The opinion of the accountant with respect to the financial statements and schedules covered by the report and the accounting principles and practices reflected therein and (ii) the opinion of the accountant as to the consistency of the application of the accounting principles, or as to any changes in such principles which have material effect on the financial statements and schedules.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> Any matters to which the accountant takes exception must be clearly identified, such exceptions specifically and clearly stated, and to the extent practicable, the effect of each exception on related financial statements and schedules given.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Accountant's report on material inadequacies.</E> A registrant must file concurrently with the annual audit report a supplemental report by the accountant describing any material inadequacies found to exist or found to have existed since the date of the previous audit. An applicant must file concurrently with the audit report a supplemental report by the accountant describing any material inadequacies found to exist as of the date of the Form 1-FR being filed: <E T="03">Provided, however</E>, That if such applicant is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a securities broker or dealer, and it files (in accordance with § 1.10(h)) a copy of its Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single Report under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Part II, Part IIA, or Part II CSE, in lieu of Form 1-FR, the accountant's supplemental report must be made as of the date of such report. The supplemental report must indicate any corrective action taken or proposed by the applicant or registrant in regard thereto. If the audit did not disclose any material inadequacies, the supplemental report must so state.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Audit objectives.</E> (1) The audit must be made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and must include a review and appropriate tests of the accounting system, the internal accounting control, and the procedures for safeguarding customer and firm assets in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the regulations thereunder, since the prior examination date. The audit must include all procedures necessary under the circumstances to enable the independent licensed or certified public accountant to express an opinion on the financial statements and schedules. The scope of the audit and review of the accounting system, the internal controls, and procedures for safeguarding customer and firm assets must be sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that any material inadequacies existing at the date of the examination in (i) the accounting system, (ii) the internal accounting controls, and (iii) the procedures for safeguarding customer and firm assets <PRTPAGE P="71"/>(including, in the case of a futures commission merchant, the segregation requirements of section 4d(a)(2) of the Act and these regulations and the secured amount requirements of the Act and these regulations) will be discovered. Additionally, as specified objectives the audit must include reviews of the practices and procedures followed by the registrant in making (A) periodic computations of the minimum financial requirements pursuant to § 1.17 and (B) in the case of a futures commission merchant, daily computations of the segregation requirements of section 4d(a)(2) of the Act and these regulations and the secured amount requirements of the Act and these regulations.</P>
            <P>(2) A material inadequacy in the accounting system, the internal accounting controls, the procedures for safeguarding customer and firm assets, and the practices and procedures referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of this section which is to be reported in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section includes any conditions which contributed substantially to or, if appropriate corrective action is not taken, could reasonably be expected to:</P>
            <P>(i) Inhibit an applicant or registrant from promptly completing transactions or promptly discharging his responsibilities to customers or other creditors;</P>
            <P>(ii) Result in material financial loss;</P>
            <P>(iii) Result in material misstatement of the applicant's or registrant's financial statements and schedules; or</P>
            <P>(iv) Result in violations of the Commission's segregation or secured amount (in the case of a futures commission merchant), recordkeeping or financial reporting requirements to the extent that could reasonably be expected to result in the conditions described in paragraph (d)(2) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Extent and timing of audit procedures.</E> (1) The extent and timing of audit procedures are matters for the independent public accountant to determine on the basis of his review and evaluation of existing internal controls and other audit procedures performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and the audit objectives set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. In determining the extent of testing, consideration must be given to the materiality of an area and to the possible effect on the financial statements and schedules of a material misstatement in a related account.</P>

            <P>(2) If during the course of an audit or interim work, the independent public accountant determines that any material inadequacies exist in the accounting system, in the internal accounting control, in the procedures for safeguarding customer or firm assets, or as otherwise defined in paragraph (d) of this section, he must call such inadequacies to the attention of the applicant or registrant, which has the responsibility to give notice to the National Futures Association and, if an applicant, or the Commission and the designated self-regulatory organization, if any, if a registrant, in accordance with paragraphs (d) and (g) of § 1.12: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That if the applicant or registrant is an introducing broker or applicant for registration as an introducing broker, it also has the responsibility to give notice to the National Futures Association, the designated self-regulatory organization, if any, and every futures commission merchant carrying or intending to carry customer accounts for the introducing broker or applicant for registration as an introducing broker. The applicant or registrant must also furnish the accountant with a copy of said notice within three (3) business days. If the accountant fails to receive such notice from the applicant or registrant within three (3) business days, or if he disagrees with the statements contained in the notice of the applicant or registrant, the accountant must inform the National Futures Association, in the case of an applicant, or the Commission and the designated self-regulatory organization, if any, in the case of a registrant, by reporting the material inadequacy and, in the case of an applicant or registrant which is an introducing broker or applicant for registration as in introducing broker, the accountant must also inform the National Futures Association, the designated self-regulatory organization, if any, and every futures commission merchant carrying or intending to <PRTPAGE P="72"/>carry customer accounts for the introducing an introducing broker, within three (3) business days thereafter. Such report from the accountant must, if the applicant or registrant failed to file a notice, describe the material inadequacies found to exist. If the applicant or registrant filed a notice, the accountant must file a report detailing the aspects, if any, of the applicant's or registrant's notice with which the accountant does not agree.</P>
            <P>(f)(1) <E T="03">Extension of time for filing audited reports.</E> In the event a registered futures commission merchant or a registered introducing broker finds that it cannot file, without substantial undue hardship, its certified financial statements and schedules for any year within the time specified in § 1.10 (b)(1)(ii) or § 1.10 (b)(2)(ii) of this part, as applicable, such registrants may request approval for an extension of time, as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Futures commission merchant registrants.</E> (A) A futures commission merchant may file with its designated self-regulatory organization an application for an extension of time, a copy of which the registrant must file with the Commission. The application shall be approved or denied in writing by the designated self-regulatory organization. The registrant must file immediately with the Commission a copy of any notice it receives from the designated self-regulatory organization to approve or deny the registrant's request for extension of time. A written notice of approval shall become effective upon the filing by the registrant of a copy with the Commission, and a written notice of denial shall be effective as of the date of the notice.</P>

            <P>(B) A futures commission merchant that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a securities broker or dealer may file with its designated self-regulatory organization a copy of any application that the registrant has filed with its designated examining authority, pursuant to § 240.17-a5(<E T="03">l</E>)(1)of this title, for an extension of time to file audited annual financial statements. The registrant must also file immediately with the designated self-regulatory organization and the Commission copies of any notice it receives from its designated examining authority to approve or deny the requested extension of time. Upon receipt by the designated self-regulatory organization and the Commission of copies of any such notice of approval, the requested extension of time referenced in the notice shall be deemed approved under this paragraph (f)(1)(i).</P>
            <P>(C) Any copy that under this paragraph is required to be filed with the Commission must be filed via electronic transmission using a form of user authentication assigned in accordance with procedures established by or approved by the Commission, and otherwise in accordance with instructions issued by or approved by the Commission. Any such electronic submission must clearly indicate the registrant on whose behalf such filing is made and the use of such user authentication in submitting such filing will constitute and become a substitute for the manual signature of the authorized signer.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Introducing broker registrants.</E> (A) An introducing broker may file with the National Futures Association an application for extension of time, which shall be approved or denied in writing.</P>

            <P>(B) An introducing broker that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a securities broker or dealer may file with the National Futures Association copies of any application that the registrant has filed with its designated examining authority, pursuant to § 240.17-a5(<E T="03">l</E>)(1) of this title, for an extension of time to file audited annual financial statements. The registrant must also file immediately with the National Futures Association copies of any notice it receives from its designated examining authority to approve or deny the requested extension of time. Upon the receipt by the National Futures Association of a copy of any such notice of approval, the requested extension of time referenced in the notice shall be deemed approved under this paragraph (f)(1)(ii).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Exemption requests.</E> On the written request of any designated self-regulatory organization or registrant, or on its own motion, the Commission may grant an extension of time or an exemption from any of the certified financial reporting requirements of this <PRTPAGE P="73"/>chapter either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Replacement of accountant.</E> (1) In the event (i) the independent public accountant who was previously engaged as the principal accountant to audit an applicant's or registrant's financial statements resigns (or indicates he declines to stand for re-election after the completion of the current audit) or is dismissed as the applicant's or registrant's principal accountant, (ii) another independent accountant is engaged as principal accountant, or (iii) an independent accountant on whom the principal accountant expresses reliance in his report regarding a subsidiary resigns (or formally indicates he declines to stand for re-election after completion of the current audit) or is dismissed or another independent public accountant is engaged to audit that subsidiary, an applicant shall file written notice of such occurrence with the National Futures Association, and a registrant shall file written notice of such occurrence with the Commission at its principal office in Washington, DC, and with the designated self-regulatory organization, if any, not more than 15 business days after such occurrence.</P>

            <P>(2) Such notice must state (i) the date of such resignation (or declination to stand for re-election, dismissal or engagement) and (ii) whether, in connection with the audit of the two most recent fiscal years and any subsequent interim period preceding such resignation, dismissal or engagement, there were any disagreements with the former accountant on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statements disclosure, auditing scope or procedures, or compliance with the applicable rules of the Commission, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of the former accountant, would have caused him to make reference in connection with his report to the subject matter of the disagreements (if so, describe such disagreements). The disagreements required to be reported in this paragraph (g)(2) include both those resolved to the former accountant's satisfaction and those not resolved to the former accountant's satisfaction. Disagreements contemplated by this paragraph (g)(2) are those which occur at the decision-making level, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> between personnel of the applicant or registrant responsible for presentation of its financial statements and schedules and personnel of the accounting firm responsible for rendering its report. The notice must also state whether the accountant's report on the financial statements and schedules for any of the past two years contained an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion or was qualified as to uncertainties, audit scope, or accounting principles (if so, describe the nature of each such adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion, or qualification). An applicant must also request the former accountant to furnish the applicant with a letter addressed to the National Futures Association, and a registrant must also request the former accountant to furnish the registrant with a letter addressed to the Commission, stating whether he agrees with the statements contained in the notice of the applicant or registrant and, if not, stating the respects in which he does not agree. Each copy of the notice and accountant's letter must be manually signed by the sole proprietor or a general partner or a duly authorized corporate officer of the applicant or registrant, as appropriate, and by the accountant.</P>

            <P>(3) If (i) within the 24 months prior to the date of the most recent audited financial statement, a notice has been filed pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section reporting a change of accountants, (ii) included in such filing there is a reported disagreement on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statements disclosure, auditing scope, or noncompliance with the applicable rules of the Commission, (iii) during the fiscal year in which the change in accountants took place or during the subsequent fiscal year, there have been any transactions or events similar to those which involved a reported disagreement, and (iv) such transactions or events are material and were accounted for or disclosed in a manner different from that which the former accountant apparently would have concluded was required, the existence and nature of the disagreements and also the effect on <PRTPAGE P="74"/>the financial statements must be stated in a written notice to the National Futures Association, in the case of an applicant, or to the Commission at its principal office in Washington, DC, and the designated self-regulatory organization, if any, in the case of a registrant, if the method which the former accountant apparently would have concluded was required had been followed. These disclosures need not be made if the method asserted by the former accountant ceases to be generally accepted because of authoritative standards or interpretations subsequently issued. The notice required by this paragraph (g)(3) must be filed by the applicant or registrant concurrently with the financial statements and schedules to which it pertains.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Exemption for introducing broker or applicant therefor.</E> The provisions of this section do not apply to an introducing broker which is operating pursuant to a guarantee agreement, nor do such provisions apply to an applicant for registration as an introducing broker who files concurrently with such application a guarantee agreement, provided such introducing broker or applicant therefor is not also a securities broker or dealer.</P>

            <P>(i) Any futures commission merchant that is also registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a securities broker or dealer, and who also satisfies the other requirements of this paragraph (c)(6), may elect to compute its adjusted net capital using the alternative capital deductions that, under § 240.15c3-1(a)(7) of this title, the Securities and Exchange Commission has approved by written order. To the extent that a futures commission merchant is permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission to use alternative capital deductions for its unsecured receivables from over-the-counter transactions in derivatives, or <PRTPAGE P="82"/>for its proprietary positions in securities, forward contracts, or futures contracts, the futures commission merchant may use these same alternative capital deductions when computing its adjusted net capital, in lieu of the deductions that would otherwise be required by paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section for its unsecured receivables from over-the-counter derivatives transactions; by paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section for its proprietary positions in forward contracts; by paragraph (c)(5)(v) of this section for its proprietary positions in securities; and by paragraph (c)(5)(x) of this section for its proprietary positions in futures contracts.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Notifications of election or of changes to election.</E> (A) No election to use the alternative market risk and credit risk deductions referenced in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section shall be effective unless and until the futures commission merchant has filed with the Commission, addressed to the Director of the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight, a notice that is to include a copy of the approval order of the Securities and Exchange Commission referenced in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, and to include also a statement that identifies the amount of tentative net capital below which the futures commission merchant is required to provide notice to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and which also provides the following information: a list of the categories of positions that the futures commission merchant holds in its proprietary accounts, and, for each such category, a description of the methods that the futures commission merchant will use to calculate its deductions for market risk and credit risk, and also, if calculated separately, deductions for specific risk; a description of the value at risk (VaR) models to be used for its market risk and credit risk deductions, and an overview of the integration of the models into the internal risk management control system of the futures commission merchant; a description of how the futures commission merchant will calculate current exposure and maximum potential exposure for its deductions for credit risk; a description of how the futures commission merchant will determine internal credit ratings of counterparties and internal credit risk weights of counterparties, if applicable; and a description of the estimated effect of the alternative market risk and credit risk deductions on the amounts reported by the futures commission merchant as net capital and adjusted net capital.</P>
            <P>(B) A futures commission merchant must also, upon the request of the Commission at any time, supplement the statement described in paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(A) of this section, by providing any other explanatory information regarding the computation of its alternative market risk and credit risk deductions as the Commission may require at its discretion.</P>
            <P>(C) A futures commission merchant must also file the following supplemental notices with the Director of the Division and Clearing and Intermediary Oversight:</P>

            <P>(D) A futures commission merchant may voluntarily change its election to use the alternative market risk and credit risk deductions referenced in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, by filing with the Director of the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight a written notice specifying a future date as of which it will no longer use the alternative market risk and credit risk deductions, and will instead compute such deductions in accordance with the requirements otherwise applicable under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section for unsecured receivables from over-the-counter derivatives transactions; by paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section for proprietary positions in forward contracts; by paragraph (c)(5)(v) <PRTPAGE P="83"/>of this section for proprietary positions in securities; and by paragraph (c)(5)(x) of this section for proprietary positions in futures contracts.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Conditions under which election terminated.</E> A futures commission merchant may no longer elect to use the alternative market risk and credit risk deductions referenced in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, and shall instead compute the deductions otherwise required under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section for unsecured receivables from over-the-counter derivatives transactions; by paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section for proprietary positions in forward contracts; by paragraph (c)(5)(v) of this section for proprietary positions in securities; and by paragraph (c)(5)(x) of this section for proprietary positions in futures contracts, upon the occurrence of any of the following:</P>

            <P>(B) A futures commission merchant fails to come into compliance with its filing requirements under this paragraph (c)(6), after having received from the Director of the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight written notification that the firm is not in compliance with its filing requirements, and must cease using alternative capital deductions permitted under this paragraph (c)(6) if it has not come into compliance by a date specified in the notice; or</P>
            <P>(C) The Commission by written order finds that permitting the futures commission merchant to continue to use such alternative market risk and credit risk deductions is no longer necessary or appropriate for the protection of customers of the futures commission merchant or of the integrity of the futures or options markets.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Additional filing requirements.</E> Any futures commission merchant that elects to use the alternative market risk and credit risk deductions referenced in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section must file with the Commission, in addition to the filings required by paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section, copies of any and all of the following documents, at such time as the originals are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission:</P>

            <P>(8) The term <E T="03">contractual commitments</E> shall include underwriting, when issued, when distributed, and delayed delivery contracts; and the writing or endorsement of security puts and calls and combinations thereof; but shall not include uncleared regular way purchases and sales of securities. A series of contracts of purchase or sale of the same security, conditioned, if at all, only upon issuance, may be treated as an individual commitment.</P>

            <P>(d) Each applicant or registrant shall have equity capital (inclusive of satisfactory subordination agreements which qualify under this paragraph (d) as equity capital) of not less than 30 percent of the debt-equity total, provided, an applicant or registrant may be exempted from the provisions of this paragraph (d) for a period not to exceed 90 days or for such longer period which the Commission may, upon application of the applicant or registrant, grant in <PRTPAGE P="84"/>the public interest or for the protection of investors.

              <E T="03">Provided,</E> That this paragraph (e) shall not preclude an applicant or registrant from making required tax payments or preclude the payment to partners of reasonable compensation. The Commission may, upon application of the applicant or registrant, grant relief from this paragraph (e) if the Commission deems it to be in the public interest or for the protection of nonproprietary accounts.</FP>
            <P>(f)(1) Every applicant or registrant, in computing its net capital pursuant to this section must, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(4) of this section, consolidate in a single computation, assets and liabilities of any subsidiary or affiliate for which it guarantees, endorses, or assumes directly or indirectly the obligations or liabilities. The assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or affiliate whose liabilities and obligations have not been guaranteed, endorsed, or assumed directly or indirectly by the applicant or registrant may also be so consolidated if an opinion of counsel is obtained as provided for in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) If the consolidation, provided for in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, of any such subsidiary or affiliate results in the increase of the applicant's or registrant's adjusted net capital or decreases the minimum adjusted net capital requirement, and an opinion of counsel called for in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section has not been obtained, such benefits shall not be recognized in the applicant's or registrant's computation required by this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) Except as provided for in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, consolidation shall be permitted with respect to any subsidiaries or affiliates which are majority owned and controlled by the applicant or registrant, and for which the applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the National Futures Association, or for which the registrant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commission and the designated self-regulatory organization, if any, by an opinion of counsel, that the net asset values or the portion thereof related to the parent's ownership interest in the subsidiary or affiliate, may be caused by the applicant or registrant or an appointed trustee to be distributed to the applicant or registrant within 30 calendar days. Such opinion must also set forth the actions necessary to cause such a distribution to be made, identify the parties having the authority to take such actions, identify and describe the rights of other parties or classes of parties, including but not limited to customers, general creditors, subordinated lenders, minority shareholders, employees, litigants, and governmental or regulatory authorities, who may delay or prevent such a distribution and such other assurances as the National Futures Association, the Commission or the designated self-regulatory organization by rule or interpretation may require. Such opinion must be current and periodically renewed in connection with the applicant's or registrant's annual audit pursuant to § 1.10 or upon any material change in circumstances.</P>
            <P>(3) In preparing a consolidated computation of adjusted net capital pursuant to this section, the following minimum and non-exclusive requirements shall be observed;</P>
            <P>(i) Consolidated adjusted net capital shall be reduced by the estimated amount of any tax reasonably anticipated to be incurred upon distribution of the assets of the subsidiary or affiliate.</P>
            <P>(ii) Liabilities of a consolidated subsidiary or affiliate which are subordinated to the claims of present and future creditors pursuant to a satisfactory subordination agreement shall be deducted from consolidated adjusted net capital unless such subordination extends also to the claims of present or future creditors of the parent applicant or registrant and all consolidated subsidiaries.</P>

            <P>(iii) Subordinated liabilities of a consolidated subsidiary or affiliate which are consolidated in accordance with paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section may <PRTPAGE P="86"/>not be prepaid, repaid, or accelerated if any of the entities included in such consolidation would otherwise be unable to comply with the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
            <P>(iv) Each applicant or registrant included within the consolidation shall at all times be in compliance with the adjusted net capital requirement to which it is subject.</P>

            <P>(g)(1) The Commission may by order restrict, for a period up to twenty business days, any withdrawal by a futures commission merchant of equity capital, or any unsecured advance or loan to a stockholder, partner, limited liability company member, sole proprietor, employee or affiliate, if:</P>
            <P>(i) Such withdrawal, advance or loan would cause, when aggregated with all other withdrawals, advances or loans during a 30 calendar day period from the futures commission merchant or a subsidiary or affiliate of the futures commission merchant consolidated pursuant to § 1.17(f) (or 17 CFR 240.15c3-1e), a net reduction in excess adjusted net capital (or, if the futures commission merchant is qualified to use the filing option available under § 1.10(h), excess net capital as defined in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) of 30 percent or more, and</P>
            <P>(ii) The Commission, based on the facts and information available, concludes that any such withdrawal, advance or loan may be detrimental to the financial integrity of the futures commission merchant, or may unduly jeopardize its ability to meet customer obligations or other liabilities that may cause a significant impact on the markets.</P>
            <P>(2) The futures commission merchant may file with the Secretary of the Commission a written petition to request rescission of the order issued under paragraph (g)(1) of this section. The petition filed by the futures commission merchant must specify the facts and circumstances supporting its request for rescission. The Commission shall respond in writing to deny the futures commission merchant's petition for rescission, or, if the Commission determines that the order issued under paragraph (g)(1) of this section should not remain in effect, the order shall be rescinded.</P>

            <P>(B) The secured demand note shall be a promissory note executed by the lender and shall be payable on the demand of the applicant or registrant to which it is contributed: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That the making of such demand may be conditioned upon the occurrence of any of certain events which are acceptable to the designated self-regultory organization and the Commission.</P>
            <P>(C) If such note is not paid upon presentment and demand as provided for therein, the applicant or registrant shall have the right to liquidate all or any part of the securities then pledged as collateral to secure payment of the same and to apply the net proceeds of such liquidation, together with any cash then included in the collateral, in payment of such note.

            <P>(D) Subject to the prior rights of the applicant or registrant as pledgee, the lender may have the right to direct the sale of any securities included in the collateral, to direct the purchase of securities with any cash included therein, to withdraw excess collateral or to substitute cash or other securities as collateral: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the net proceeds of any such sale and the cash so substituted and the securities so purchased or substituted are held by the applicant or registrant as pledgee, and are included within the collateral to secure payment of the secured demand note: <E T="03">And provided further,</E> That no such transaction shall be permitted, if, after giving effect therto, the sum of the amount of any cash, plus the collateral value of the securities, then pledged as collateral to secure the secured demand note would be less than the unpaid principal amount of the secured demand note.</P>
            <P>(E) Upon payment by the lender, as distinguished from a reduction by the lender which is provided for in paragraph (h)(2)(vi)(C) of this section or reduction by the applicant or registrant as provided for in paragraph (h)(2)(vii) of this section, of all or any part of the unpaid principal amount of the secured demand note, the applicant or registrant shall issue to the lender a subordinated loan agreement in the amount of such payment (or in the case of an applicant or registrant that is a partnership, credit a capital account of the lender), or issue preferred or common stock of the applicant or registrant in the amount of such payment, or any combination of the foregoing, as provided for in the secured demand note agreement.</P>
            <P>(F) The term <E T="03">lender</E> means the person who lends cash to an applicant or registrant pursuant to a subordinated loan agreement and the person who contributes a secured demand note to an applicant or registrant pursuant to a secured demand note agreement.</P>

            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Specific amount.</E> All subordination agreements shall be for a specific dollar amount which shall not be reduced <PRTPAGE P="88"/>for the duration of the agreement except by installments as specifically provided for therein and except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (h)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Effective subordination.</E> The subordination agreement shall effectively subordinate any right of the lender to receive any payment with respect thereto, together with accrued interest or compensation, to the prior payment or provision for payment in full of all claims of all present and future creditors of the applicant or registrant arising out of any matter occurring prior to the date on which the related payment obligation matures, except for claims which are the subject of subordination agreements which rank on the same priority as or junior to the claim of the lender under such subordination agreements.</P>

The applicant or registrant shall also file with said parties a statement setting forth the name and address of the lender, the business relationship of the lender to the applicant or registrant and whether the applicant or registrant carried funds or securities for the lender at or about the time the proposed agreement was so filed.

            <P>(a) No futures commission merchant shall use, or permit the use of, the futures customer funds of one futures customer to purchase, margin, or settle the trades, contracts, or commodity options of, or to secure or extend the credit of, any person other than such futures customer.</P>
            <P>(b) Futures customer funds shall not be used to carry trades or positions of the same futures customer other than in contracts for the purchase of sale of any commodity for future delivery or for options thereon traded through the facilities of a designated contract market.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) The undermargined amount for a futures customer's account is the amount, if any, by which:</P>
            <P>(i) The total amount of collateral required for that futures customer's positions in that account, at the time or times referred to in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, exceeds</P>
            <P>(ii) The value of the futures customer funds for that account, as calculated in § 1.20(i)(2).</P>

            <P>(2) Each futures commission merchant must compute, based on the information available to the futures commission merchant as of the close of each business day,<PRTPAGE P="106"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) The undermargined amounts, based on the clearing initial margin that will be required to be maintained by that futures commission merchant for its futures customers, at each derivatives clearing organization of which the futures commission merchant is a member, at the point of the daily settlement (as described in § 39.14 of this chapter) that will complete during the following business day for each such derivatives clearing organization less</P>
            <P>(ii) Any debit balances referred to in § 1.20(i)(4) included in such undermargined amounts.</P>
            <P>(3)(i) Prior to the Residual Interest Deadline, such futures commission merchant must maintain residual interest in segregated funds that is at least equal to the computation set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Where a futures commission merchant is subject to multiple Residual Interest Deadlines, prior to each Residual Interest Deadline, such futures commission merchant must maintain residual interest in segregated funds that is at least equal to the portion of the computation set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section attributable to the clearing initial margin required by the derivatives clearing organization making such settlement.</P>
            <P>(ii) A futures commission merchant may reduce the amount of residual interest required in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section to account for payments received from or on behalf of undermargined futures customers (less the sum of any disbursements made to or on behalf of such customers) between the close of the previous business day and the Residual Interest Deadline.</P>
            <P>(4) For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a futures commission merchant should include, as clearing initial margin, customer initial margin that the futures commission merchant will be required to maintain, for that futures commission merchant's futures customers, at another futures commission merchant.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Residual Interest Deadline defined.</E> (i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, the Residual Interest Deadline shall be the time of the settlement referenced in paragraph (c)(2)(i) or, as appropriate, (c)(4), of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) Starting on November 14, 2014 and during the phase-in period described in paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section, the Residual Interest Deadline shall be 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the date of the settlement referenced in paragraph (c)(2)(i) or, as appropriate, (c)(4), of this section.</P>
            <P>(iii)(A) No later than May 16, 2016, the staff of the Commission shall complete and publish for public comment a report addressing, to the extent information is practically available, the practicability (for both futures commission merchants and customers) of moving that deadline from 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the date of the settlement referenced in paragraph (c)(2)(i) or, as appropriate, (c)(4), of this section to the time of that settlement (or to some other time of day), including whether and on what schedule it would be feasible to do so, and the costs and benefits of such potential requirements. Staff shall, using the Commission's Web site, solicit public comment and shall conduct a public roundtable regarding specific issues to be covered by such report.</P>
            <P>(B) Nine months after publication of the report required by paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, the Commission may (but shall not be required to) do either of the following:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Terminate the phase-in period through rulemaking, in which case the phase-in period shall end as of a date established by a final rule published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> which date shall be no less than one year after the date such rule is published; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Determine that it is necessary or appropriate in the public interest to propose through rulemaking a different Residual Interest Deadline. In that event, the Commission shall establish, if necessary, a phase-in schedule in the final rule published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>

            <P>(C) If the phase-in schedule has not been terminated or revised pursuant to paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B) of this section, then the Residual Interest Deadline shall remain 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the date of the settlement referenced in paragraph (c)(2)(i) or, as appropriate, (c)(4) of this section until such time <PRTPAGE P="107"/>that the Commission takes further action through rulemaking.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1.23</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Interest of futures commission merchant in segregated futures customer funds; additions and withdrawals.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) The provision in sections 4d(a)(2) and 4d(b) of the Act and the provision in § 1.20 that prohibit the commingling of futures customer funds with the funds of a futures commission merchant, shall not be construed to prevent a futures commission merchant from having a residual financial interest in the futures customer funds segregated as required by the Act and the regulations in this part and set apart for the benefit of futures customers; nor shall such provisions be construed to prevent a futures commission merchant from adding to such segregated futures customer funds such amount or amounts of money, from its own funds or unencumbered securities from its own inventory, of the type set forth in § 1.25 of this part, as it may deem necessary to ensure any and all futures customers' accounts from becoming undersegregated at any time.</P>
            <P>(2) If a futures commission merchant discovers at any time that it is holding insufficient funds in segregated accounts to meet its obligations under §§ 1.20 and 1.22, the futures commission merchant shall immediately deposit sufficient funds into segregation to bring the account into compliance.</P>

            <P>(b) A futures commission merchant may not withdraw funds, except withdrawals that are made to or for the benefit of futures customers, from an account or accounts holding futures customer funds unless the futures commission merchant has prepared the daily segregation calculation required by § 1.32 as of the close of business on the previous business day. A futures commission merchant that has completed its daily segregation calculation may make withdrawals, in addition to withdrawals that are made to or for the benefit of futures customers, to the extent of its actual residual financial interest in funds held in segregated futures accounts, adjusted to reflect market activity and other events that may have decreased the amount of the firm's residual financial interest since the close of business on the previous business day, including the withdrawal of securities held in segregated safekeeping accounts held by a bank, trust company, derivatives clearing organization or other futures commission merchant. Such withdrawal(s), <E T="03">however,</E> shall not result in the funds of one futures customer being used to purchase, margin or carry the trades, contracts or commodity options, or extend the credit of any other futures customer or other person.</P>

            <P>(c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, each futures commission merchant shall establish a targeted residual interest (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> excess funds) that is in an amount that, when maintained as its residual interest in the segregated funds accounts, reasonably ensures that the futures commission merchant shall remain in compliance with the segregated funds requirements at all times. Each futures commission merchant shall establish policies and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that the futures commission merchant maintains the targeted residual amounts in segregated funds at all times. The futures commission merchant shall maintain sufficient capital and liquidity, and take such other appropriate steps as are necessary, to reasonably ensure that such amount of targeted residual interest is maintained as the futures commission merchant's residual interest in the segregated funds accounts at all times. In determining the amount of the targeted residual interest, the futures commission merchant shall analyze all relevant factors affecting the amounts in segregated funds from time to time, including without limitation various factors, as applicable, relating to the nature of the futures commission merchant's business including, but not limited to, the composition of the futures commission merchant's customer base, the general creditworthiness of the customer base, the general trading activity of the customers, the types of markets and products traded by the customers, the proprietary trading of the futures commission merchant, the general volatility and liquidity of the <PRTPAGE P="108"/>markets and products traded by customers, the futures commission merchant's own liquidity and capital needs, and the historical trends in customer segregated fund balances and debit balances in customers' and undermargined accounts. The analysis and calculation of the targeted amount of the future commission merchant's residual interest must be described in writing with the specificity necessary to allow the Commission and the futures commission merchant's designated self-regulatory organization to duplicate the analysis and calculation and test the assumptions made by the futures commission merchant. The adequacy of the targeted residual interest and the process for establishing the targeted residual interest must be reassessed periodically by the futures commission merchant and revised as necessary.</P>
            <P>(d) Notwithstanding any other paragraph of this section, a futures commission merchant may not withdraw funds, in a single transaction or a series of transactions, that are not made to or for the benefit of futures customers from futures accounts if such withdrawal(s) would exceed 25 percent of the futures commission merchant's residual interest in such accounts as reported on the daily segregation calculation required by § 1.32 and computed as of the close of business on the previous business day, unless:</P>
            <P>(1) The futures commission merchant's chief executive officer, chief finance officer or other senior official that is listed as a principal of the futures commission merchant on its Form 7-R and is knowledgeable about the futures commission merchant's financial requirements and financial position pre-approves in writing the withdrawal, or series of withdrawals;</P>
            <P>(2) The futures commission merchant files written notice of the withdrawal or series of withdrawals, with the Commission and with its designated self-regulatory organization immediately after the chief executive officer, chief finance officer or other senior official as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section pre-approves the withdrawal or series of withdrawals. The written notice must:</P>
            <P>(i) Be signed by the chief executive officer, chief finance officer or other senior official as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section that pre-approved the withdrawal, and give notice that the futures commission merchant has withdrawn or intends to withdraw more than 25 percent of its residual interest in segregated accounts holding futures customer funds;</P>
            <P>(ii) Include a description of the reasons for the withdrawal or series of withdrawals;</P>
            <P>(iii) List the amount of funds provided to each recipient and each recipient's name;</P>
            <P>(iv) Include the current estimate of the amount of the futures commission merchant's residual interest in the futures accounts after the withdrawal;</P>
            <P>(v) Contain a representation by the chief executive officer, chief finance officer or other senior official as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section that pre-approved the withdrawal, or series of withdrawals, that, after due diligence, to such person's knowledge and reasonable belief, the futures commission merchant remains in compliance with the segregation requirements after the withdrawal. The chief executive officer, chief finance officer or other senior official as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section must consider the daily segregation calculation as of the close of business on the previous business day and any other factors that may cause a material change in the futures commission merchant's residual interest since the close of business the previous business day, including known unsecured futures customer debits or deficits, current day market activity and any other withdrawals made from the futures accounts; and</P>

            <P>(vi) Any such written notice filed with the Commission must be filed via electronic transmission using a form of user authentication assigned in accordance with procedures established by or approved by the Commission, and otherwise in accordance with instruction issued by or approved by the Commission. Any such electronic submission must clearly indicate the registrant on whose behalf such filing is made and the use of such user authentication in submitting such filing will constitute <PRTPAGE P="109"/>and become a substitute for the manual signature of the authorized signer. Any written notice filed must be followed up with direct communication to the Regional office of the Commission that has supervisory authority over the futures commission merchant whereby the Commission acknowledges receipt of the notice; and</P>
            <P>(3) After making a withdrawal requiring the approval and notice required in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, and before the completion of its next daily segregated funds calculation, no futures commission merchant may make any further withdrawals from accounts holding futures customer funds, except to or for the benefit of futures customers, without, for each withdrawal, obtaining the approval required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section and filing a written notice in the manner specified under paragraph (d)(2) of this section with the Commission and its designated self-regulatory organization signed by the chief executive officer, chief finance officer, or other senior official. The written notice must:</P>
            <P>(i) List the amount of funds provided to each recipient and each recipient's name;</P>
            <P>(ii) Disclose the reason for each withdrawal;</P>
            <P>(iii) Confirm that the chief executive officer, chief finance officer, or other senior official (and identify of the person if different from the person who signed the notice) pre-approved the withdrawal in writing;</P>
            <P>(iv) Disclose the current estimate of the futures commission merchant's remaining total residual interest in the segregated accounts holding futures customer funds after the withdrawal; and</P>
            <P>(v) Include a representation that, after due diligence, to the best of the notice signatory's knowledge and reasonable belief the futures commission merchant remains in compliance with the segregation requirements after the withdrawal.</P>
            <P>(e) If a futures commission merchant withdraws funds from futures accounts that are not made to or for the benefit of futures customers, and the withdrawal causes the futures commission merchant to not hold sufficient funds in the futures accounts to meet its targeted residual interest, as required to be computed under § 1.11, the futures commission merchant should deposit its own funds into the futures accounts to restore the account balance to the targeted residual interest amount by the close of business on the next business day, or, if appropriate, revise the futures commission merchant's targeted amount of residual interest pursuant to the policies and procedures required by § 1.11. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a the futures commission merchant's residual interest in customer accounts is less than the amount required by § 1.22 at any particular point in time, the futures commission merchant must immediately restore the residual interest to exceed the sum of such amounts. Any proprietary funds deposited in the futures accounts must be unencumbered and otherwise compliant with § 1.25, as applicable.</P>

            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The term <E T="03">floating rate security</E> means a security, the terms of which provide for the adjustment of its interest rate whenever a specified interest rate changes and that, at any time until the final maturity of the instrument or the period remaining until the principal amount can be recovered through demand, can reasonably be expected to have market value that approximates its amortized cost.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The term <E T="03">variable rate security</E> means a security, the terms of which provide for the adjustment of its interest rate on set dates (such as the last day of a month or calendar quarter) and that, upon each adjustment until the final maturity of the instrument or the period remaining until the principal amount can be recovered through demand, can reasonably be expected to have a market value that approximates its amortized cost.</P>

            <P>(1) The securities are specifically identified by coupon rate, par amount, market value, maturity date, and CUSIP or ISIN number.</P>
            <P>(2) Permitted counterparties are limited to a bank as defined in section 3(a)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a domestic branch of a foreign bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a securities broker or dealer, or a government securities broker or government securities dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission or which has filed notice pursuant to section 15C(a) of the Government Securities Act of 1986.</P>
            <P>(3) A futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization shall not enter into an agreement to repurchase or resell with a counterparty that is an affiliate of the futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization, respectively. An affiliate includes parent companies, including all entities through the ultimate holding company, subsidiaries to the lowest level, and companies under common ownership of such parent company or affiliates.</P>
            <P>(4) The transaction is executed in compliance with the concentration limit requirements applicable to the securities transferred to the customer segregated custodial account in connection with the agreements to repurchase referred to in paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section.</P>

            <P>(7) Securities transferred to the futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization under the agreement are held in a safekeeping account with a bank as referred to in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a Federal Reserve Bank, a derivatives clearing organization, or the Depository Trust Company in an account that complies with the requirements of § 1.26.</P>

            <P>(8) The futures commission merchant or the derivatives clearing organization may not use securities received under the agreement in another similar transaction and may not otherwise hypothecate or pledge such securities, except securities may be pledged on behalf of customers at another futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization. Substitution of securities is allowed, <E T="03">provided, however,</E> that:</P>

            <P>(i) The qualifying securities being substituted and original securities are specifically identified by date of substitution, market values substituted, coupon rates, par amounts, maturity dates and CUSIP or ISIN numbers;<PRTPAGE P="115"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) Substitution is made on a “delivery versus delivery” basis; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The market value of the substituted securities is at least equal to that of the original securities.</P>
            <P>(9) The transfer of securities to the customer segregated custodial account is made on a delivery versus payment basis in immediately available funds. The transfer of funds to the customer segregated cash account is made on a payment versus delivery basis. The transfer is not recognized as accomplished until the funds and/or securities are actually received by the custodian of the futures commission merchant's or derivatives clearing organization's customer funds or securities purchased on behalf of customers. The transfer or credit of securities covered by the agreement to the futures commission merchant's or derivatives clearing organization's customer segregated custodial account is made simultaneously with the disbursement of funds from the futures commission merchant's or derivatives clearing organization's customer segregated cash account at the custodian bank. On the sale or resale of securities, the futures commission merchant's or derivatives clearing organization's customer segregated cash account at the custodian bank must receive same-day funds credited to such segregated account simultaneously with the delivery or transfer of securities from the customer segregated custodial account.</P>
            <P>(10) A written confirmation to the futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization specifying the terms of the agreement and a safekeeping receipt are issued immediately upon entering into the transaction and a confirmation to the futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization is issued once the transaction is reversed.</P>
            <P>(11) The transactions effecting the agreement are recorded in the record required to be maintained under § 1.27 of investments of customer funds, and the securities subject to such transactions are specifically identified in such record as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and further identified in such record as being subject to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.</P>
            <P>(12) An actual transfer of securities to the customer segregated custodial account by book entry is made consistent with Federal or State commercial law, as applicable. At all times, securities received subject to an agreement are reflected as “customer property.”</P>
            <P>(13) The agreement makes clear that, in the event of the bankruptcy of the futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization, any securities purchased with customer funds that are subject to an agreement may be immediately transferred. The agreement also makes clear that, in the event of a futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization bankruptcy, the counterparty has no right to compel liquidation of securities subject to an agreement or to make a priority claim for the difference between current market value of the securities and the price agreed upon for resale of the securities to the counterparty, if the former exceeds the latter.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Deposit of firm-owned securities into segregation.</E> A futures commission merchant may deposit unencumbered securities of the type specified in this section, which it owns for its own account, into a customer account. A futures commission merchant must include such securities, transfers of securities, and disposition of proceeds from the sale or maturity of such securities in the record of investments required to be maintained by § 1.27. All such securities may be segregated in safekeeping only with a bank, trust company, derivatives clearing organization, or other registered futures commission merchant in accordance with the provisions of § 1.20 part. For purposes of this section and §§ 1.27, 1.28, 1.29, and 1.32, securities of the type specified by this section that are owned by the futures commission merchant and deposited into a customer account shall be considered customer funds until such investments are withdrawn from segregation in accordance with the provisions of § 1.23. Investments permitted by § 1.25 that are owned by the futures commission merchant and deposited into a futures customer account pursuant to § 1.26 shall be considered futures customer funds until such investments are <PRTPAGE P="116"/>withdrawn from segregation in accordance with § 1.23. Investments permitted by § 1.25 that are owned by the futures commission merchant and deposited into a Cleared Swaps Customer Account, as defined in § 22.1 of this chapter, shall be considered Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral, as defined in § 22.1 of this chapter, until such investments are withdrawn from segregation in accordance with § 22.17 of this chapter.</P>

            <P>(2) The amount of such futures customer funds required by the Act and these regulations to be on deposit in segregated accounts on behalf of such futures customers; and</P>

            <P>(b) In computing the amount of futures customer funds required to be in segregated accounts, a futures commission merchant may offset any net deficit in a particular futures customer's account against the current market value of readily marketable securities, less applicable deductions (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> “securities haircuts”) as set forth in Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (17 CFR 241.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)), held for the same futures customer's account. Futures commission merchants that establish and enforce written policies and procedures to assess the credit risk of commercial paper, convertible debt instruments, or nonconvertible debt instruments in accordance with Rule 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)) may apply the lower haircut percentages specified in Rule 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi) for such commercial paper, convertible debt instruments and nonconvertible debt instruments.

            <P>(d) Each futures commission merchant is required to submit to the Commission and to the firm's designated self-regulatory organization the daily Statement of Segregation Requirements and Funds in Segregation for Customers Trading on U.S. Commodity Exchanges required by paragraph (c) of this section by noon the following business day.</P>

            <P>(f) Each futures commission merchant is required to submit to the <PRTPAGE P="124"/>Commission and to the firm's designated self-regulatory organization a report listing the names of all banks, trust companies, futures commission merchants, derivatives clearing organizations, or any other depository or custodian holding futures customer funds as of the fifteenth day of the month, or the first business day thereafter, and the last business day of each month.

            <P>(i) Obligations of the United States and obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States (U.S. government securities);</P>
            <P>(ii) General obligations of any State or of any political subdivision of a State (municipal securities);</P>
            <P>(iii) General obligation issued by any enterprise sponsored by the United States (government sponsored enterprise securities);</P>
            <P>(iv) Certificates of deposit issued by a bank;</P>
            <P>(v) Commercial paper fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program as administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;</P>
            <P>(vi) Corporate notes or bonds fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program as administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and</P>
            <P>(vii) Interests in money market mutual funds.</P>
            <P>(g) Each futures commission merchant must report the total amount of futures customer-owned securities held by the futures commission merchant as margin collateral and must list the names and locations of the depositories holding such margin collateral.</P>
            <P>(h) Each futures commission merchant must report the total amount of futures customer funds that have been used to purchase securities under agreements to resell the securities (reverse repurchase transactions).</P>

The supervisory program must be based on an understanding of the internal control environment to determine the nature, timing and extent of the controls and substantive testing to be performed. The determination as to which elements of the supervisory program are to be performed on any examination must be based on the risk profile of each registered futures commission merchant member.</P>
            <P>(ii) All aspects of the supervisory program, including the standards pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, must, at minimum, conform to auditing standards issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board as such standards would be applicable to a non-financial statement audit.

            <P>(v) The supervisory program must require the self-regulatory organization to report to its risk and/or audit committee of the board of directors, or a functional equivalent committee, with timely reports of the activities and findings of the supervisory program to assist the risk and/or audit committee of the board of directors, or a functional equivalent committee, to fulfill its responsibility of overseeing the examination function.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Public disclosures by futures commission merchants.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) Except as provided in 1.65, no futures commission merchant, or in the case of an introduced account no introducing broker, may open a commodity futures account for a customer, other than for a customer specified in paragraph (f) of this section, unless the futures commission merchant or introducing broker first:</P>

            <P>(i) Furnishes the customer with a separate written disclosure statement containing only the language set forth in paragraph (b) of this section (except for nonsubstantive additions such as captions) or as otherwise approved under paragraph (c) of this section; <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> that the disclosure statement may be attached to other documents as the cover page or the first page of such documents and as the only material on such page; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Receives from the customer an acknowledgment signed and dated by the customer that he received and understood the disclosure statement.</P>
            <P>(b) The language set forth in the written disclosure document required by paragraph (a) of this section shall be as follows:</P>
            <EXTRACT>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Risk Disclosure Statement</HD>
              <P>The risk of loss in trading commodity futures contracts can be substantial. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. You should be aware of the following points:</P>
              <P>(1) You may sustain a total loss of the funds that you deposit with your broker to establish or maintain a position in the commodity futures market, and you may incur losses beyond these amounts. If the market moves against your position, you may be called upon by your broker to deposit a substantial amount of additional margin funds, on short notice, in order to maintain your position. If you do not provide the required funds within the time required by your broker, your position may be liquidated at a loss, and you will be liable for any resulting deficit in your account.</P>
              <P>(2) The funds you deposit with a futures commission merchant for trading futures positions are not protected by insurance in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the futures commission merchant, or in the event your funds are misappropriated.</P>
              <P>(3) The funds you deposit with a futures commission merchant for trading futures positions are not protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation even if the futures commission merchant is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a broker or dealer.</P>
              <P>(4) The funds you deposit with a futures commission merchant are generally not guaranteed or insured by a derivatives clearing organization in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the futures commission merchant, or if the futures commission merchant is otherwise unable to refund your funds. Certain derivatives clearing organizations, however, may have programs that provide limited insurance to customers. You should inquire of your futures commission merchant whether your funds will be insured by a derivatives clearing organization and you should understand the benefits and limitations of such insurance programs.</P>
              <P>(5) The funds you deposit with a futures commission merchant are not held by the futures commission merchant in a separate account for your individual benefit. Futures commission merchants commingle the funds received from customers in one or more accounts and you may be exposed to losses incurred by other customers if the futures commission merchant does not have sufficient capital to cover such other customers' trading losses.</P>
              <P>(6) The funds you deposit with a futures commission merchant may be invested by the futures commission merchant in certain types of financial instruments that have been approved by the Commission for the purpose of such investments. Permitted investments are listed in Commission Regulation 1.25 and include: U.S. government securities; municipal securities; money market mutual funds; and certain corporate notes and bonds. The futures commission merchant may retain the interest and other earnings realized from its investment of customer funds. You should be familiar with the types of financial instruments that a futures commission merchant may invest customer funds in.</P>

              <P>(7) Futures commission merchants are permitted to deposit customer funds with affiliated entities, such as affiliated banks, securities brokers or dealers, or foreign brokers. <PRTPAGE P="151"/>You should inquire as to whether your futures commission merchant deposits funds with affiliates and assess whether such deposits by the futures commission merchant with its affiliates increases the risks to your funds.</P>
              <P>(8) You should consult your futures commission merchant concerning the nature of the protections available to safeguard funds or property deposited for your account.</P>
              <P>(9) Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This can occur, for example, when the market reaches a daily price fluctuation limit (“limit move”).</P>
              <P>(10) All futures positions involve risk, and a “spread” position may not be less risky than an outright “long” or “short” position.</P>
              <P>(11) The high degree of leverage (gearing) that is often obtainable in futures trading because of the small margin requirements can work against you as well as for you. Leverage (gearing) can lead to large losses as well as gains.</P>

              <P>(12) In addition to the risks noted in the paragraphs enumerated above, you should be familiar with the futures commission merchant you select to entrust your funds for trading futures positions. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission requires each futures commission merchant to make publicly available on its Web site firm specific disclosures and financial information to assist you with your assessment and selection of a futures commission merchant. Information regarding this futures commission merchant may be obtained by visiting our Web site, www.[Web site address].
              </P>
              <FP>ALL OF THE POINTS NOTED ABOVE APPLY TO ALL FUTURES TRADING WHETHER FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC. IN ADDITION, IF YOU ARE CONTEMPLATING TRADING FOREIGN FUTURES OR OPTIONS CONTRACTS, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL RISKS:</FP>
              
              <P>(13) Foreign futures transactions involve executing and clearing trades on a foreign exchange. This is the case even if the foreign exchange is formally “linked” to a domestic exchange, whereby a trade executed on one exchange liquidates or establishes a position on the other exchange. No domestic organization regulates the activities of a foreign exchange, including the execution, delivery, and clearing of transactions on such an exchange, and no domestic regulator has the power to compel enforcement of the rules of the foreign exchange or the laws of the foreign country. Moreover, such laws or regulations will vary depending on the foreign country in which the transaction occurs. For these reasons, customers who trade on foreign exchanges may not be afforded certain of the protections which apply to domestic transactions, including the right to use domestic alternative dispute resolution procedures. In particular, funds received from customers to margin foreign futures transactions may not be provided the same protections as funds received to margin futures transactions on domestic exchanges. Before you trade, you should familiarize yourself with the foreign rules which will apply to your particular transaction.</P>

              <P>(14) Finally, you should be aware that the price of any foreign futures or option contract and, therefore, the potential profit and loss resulting therefrom, may be affected by any fluctuation in the foreign exchange rate between the time the order is placed and the foreign futures contract is liquidated or the foreign option contract is liquidated or exercised.
              </P>
              <FP>THIS BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT, OF COURSE, DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE COMMODITY MARKETS.</FP>
              
              <P>I hereby acknowledge that I have received and understood this risk disclosure statement.</P>

            <P>(c) The Commission may approve for use in lieu of the risk disclosure document required by paragraph (b) of this section a risk disclosure statement approved by one or more foreign regulatory agencies or self-regulatory organizations if the Commission determines that such risk disclosure statement is reasonably calculated to provide the disclosure required by paragraph (b) of this section. Notice of risk disclosure statements that may be used to satisfy Commission disclosure requirements, what requirements such statements meet and the jurisdictions which accept each format will be set forth in appendix A to this section; <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> that an FCM also provides a customer with the risk disclosure statement required by paragraph (b) of this section and obtains the customer's acknowledgment that it has read and understands the disclosure document.</P>

            <P>(d) Any futures commission merchant, or in the case of an introduced account any introducing broker, may open a commodity futures account for a customer without obtaining the separate acknowledgments of disclosure and elections required by this section <PRTPAGE P="152"/>and by § 1.33(g), and by §§ 33.7 and 190.06 of this chapter, provided that:</P>
            <P>(1) Prior to the opening of such account, the futures commission merchant or introducing broker obtains an acknowledgement from the customer, which may consist of a single signature at the end of the futures commission merchant's or introducing broker's customer account agreement, or on a separate page, of the disclosure statements, consents and elections specified in this section and § 1.33(g), and in §§ 33.7, 155.3(b)(2), 155.4(b)(2), and 190.06 of this chapter, and which may include authorization for the transfer of funds from a segregated customer account to another account of such customer, as listed directly above the signature line, provided the customer has acknowledged by check or other indication next to a description of each specified disclosure statement, consent or election that the customer has received and understood such disclosure statement or made such consent or election; and</P>
            <P>(2) The acknowledgment referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is accompanied by and executed contemporaneously with delivery of the disclosures and elective provisions required by this section and § 1.33(g), and by §§ 33.7 and 190.06 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(e) The acknowledgment required by paragraph (a) of this section must be retained by the futures commission merchant or introducing broker in accordance with § 1.31.</P>
            <P>(f) A futures commission merchant or, in the case of an introduced account, an introducing broker, may open a commodity futures account for an “institutional customer” as defined in § 1.3 without furnishing such institutional customer the disclosure statements or obtaining the acknowledgments required under paragraph (a) of this section §§ 1.33(g) and 1.65(a)(3), and §§ 30.6(a), 33.7(a), 155.3(b)(2), 155.4(b)(2) and 190.10(c) of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(g) This section does not relieve a futures commission merchant or introducing broker from any other disclosure obligation it may have under applicable law.</P>
            <P>(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or § 1.65, a person registered or required to be registered with the Commission as a futures commission merchant pursuant to sections 4f(a)(1) or 4f(a)(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act and registered or required to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a broker or dealer pursuant to sections 15(b)(1) or 15(b)(11) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and rules thereunder must provide to a customer or prospective customer, prior to the acceptance of any order for, or otherwise handling any transaction in or in connection with, a security futures product for a customer, the disclosures set forth in § 41.41(b)(1) of this chapter.</P>

            <P>(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no futures commission merchant may enter into a customer account agreement or first accept funds from a customer, unless the futures commission merchant discloses to the customer all information about the futures commission merchant, including its business, operations, risk profile, and affiliates, that would be material to the customer's decision to entrust such funds to and otherwise do business with the futures commission merchant and that is otherwise necessary for full and fair disclosure. In connection with the disclosure of such information, the futures commission merchant shall provide material information about the topics described in paragraph (k) of this section, expanding upon such information as necessary to keep such disclosure from being misleading, whether through omission or otherwise. The futures commission merchant shall also disclose the same information required by this paragraph to all customers existing on the effective date of this paragraph even if the futures commission merchant and such existing customers have previously entered into a customer account agreement or the futures commission merchant has already accepted funds from such existing customers. The futures commission merchant shall update the information required by this section as and when necessary, but at least annually, to keep such information accurate and complete and shall promptly disclose such updated information to all of its customers.

            <P>(2) 50 percent or more of the total number of customer accounts carried or introduced by such firm. The computation of the percentage and number of accounts must be based on the total number of accounts carried by the <PRTPAGE P="167"/>transferor futures commission merchant or introduced by the introducing broker, irrespective of whether such accounts are transferred to a single or multiple transferees.</P>

            <SUBJECT>No-action positions with respect to floor traders.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if a contract market submits to the National Futures Association by April 26, 1993 a list of floor traders who were granted trading privileges on that contract market on or before April 26, 1993, and whose floor trading privileges remain in effect, which includes the name, date of birth and social security number of such floor traders, as well as facts regarding such floor traders which are set forth as statutory disqualifications in section 8a(2) of the Act if the contract market knows of such facts, and such list is signed by the chief operating officer of the contract market, the Commission will not commence an enforcement proceeding against a floor trader on that list based solely upon the floor trader's failure to register or receive a temporary license under section 4f of the Act and § 3.11 of this chapter, nor will the Commission commence an enforcement proceeding against the contract market under § 1.62 for failing to bar such floor trader from operating as such: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That for those floor traders listed as to whom the contract market knows of facts set forth as statutory disqualifications in section 8a(2) of the Act, the no-action position contained in paragraph (a) of this section will only apply if the contract market submits a supplemental statement signed by the chief operating officer of the contract market stating that, in light of the Congressional mandate requiring registration of floor traders under the Act, the contract market acknowledges its responsibility to take affirmative action to conduct appropriate surveillance of <PRTPAGE P="168"/>such floor traders. These no-action positions shall expire upon the floor's trader being granted or denied registration under the Act, or on June 11, 1993, whichever comes earliest: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That if the floor trader files an application for registration in accordance with § 3.11 of this chapter with the National Futures Association by June 11, 1993, the no-action positions for the floor trader and the contract market as to the registration of such floor trader will be extended until the floor trader is granted or denied registration under the Act, unless an Administrative Law Judge issues an interim order suspending the no-action position as to such floor trader in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section or the application for registration is withdrawn.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Suspension of no-action position under paragraph (a) of this section pursuant to section 8a(2) of the Act</E>—(1) <E T="03">Notice.</E> On the basis of information obtained by the Commission, the Commission may at any time serve notice upon a floor trader whose name appears on a list submitted in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section that:</P>
            <P>(i) The Commission alleges and is prepared to prove that such floor trader is subject to one or more of the statutory disqualifications set forth in section 8a(2) of the Act;</P>
            <P>(ii) An Administrative Law Judge shall make a determination, based upon written evidence, as to whether the floor trader is subject to such statutory disqualification; and</P>
            <P>(iii) If the floor trader is found to be subject to a statutory disqualification, the no-action status of the floor trader under paragraph (a) of this section may be suspended and the floor trader ordered to show cause why registration should not be denied.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Written submission.</E> If the floor trader wishes to challenge the accuracy of the allegations set forth in the notice, the floor trader may submit written evidence limited to the type described in § 3.60(b)(1) of this chapter. Such written submission must be served upon the Division of Enforcement and filed with the Proceedings Clerk within twenty days of the date of service of notice to the floor trader.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Reply.</E> Within ten days of receipt of any written submission filed by the floor trader, the Division of Enforcement may serve upon the floor trader and file with the Proceedings Clerk a reply.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Determination by Administrative Law Judge.</E> A determination by the Administrative Law Judge as to whether the floor trader is subject to a statutory disqualification must be based upon the evidence of the statutory disqualification, notice with proof of service, the written submission, if any, filed by the floor trader in response thereto, any written reply submitted by the Division of Enforcement and such other papers as the Administrative Law Judge may require or permit.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Suspension and order to show cause.</E> (i) If the floor trader is found to be subject to a statutory disqualification, the Administrative Law Judge, within thirty days after receipt of the floor trader's written submission, if any, and any reply thereto, shall issue an interim order suspending the no-action status of the floor trader under paragraph (a) of this section and requiring the floor trader to show cause within twenty days of the date of the order why, notwithstanding the existence of the statutory disqualification, the registration of the floor trader should not be denied. The no-action status of the floor trader shall be suspended, effective five days after the order to show cause is served upon the floor trader in accordance with § 3.50(a) of this chapter, until a final order with respect to the order to show cause has been issued: <E T="03">Provided, That</E> if the sole basis upon which the floor trader is subject to statutory disqualification is the existence of a temporary order, judgment or decree of the type described in section 8a(2)(C) of the Act, the order to show cause shall not be issued and the floor trader shall be suspended until such time as the temporary order, judgment or decree shall have expired: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That in no event shall the floor trader's no-action status be suspended for a period to exceed six months.</P>

            <P>(ii) If the floor trader is found not to be subject to a statutory disqualification, the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an order to that effect and <PRTPAGE P="169"/>the Proceedings Clerk shall promptly serve a copy of such order on the floor trader, the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight and the Division of Enforcement. Such order shall be effective as a final order of the Commission fifteen days after the date it is served upon the floor trader in accordance with the provisions of § 3.50(a) of this chapter unless a timely application for review is filed in accordance with § 10.102 of this chapter. The appellate procedures set forth in §§ 10.102, 10.103, 10.104, 10.106, 10.107 and 10.109 of this chapter shall apply to any appeal brought under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Notice.</E> (1) On the basis of information obtained by the Commission, the Commission may at any time serve written notice upon a registrant in any capacity under the Act that:</P>
            <P>(i) The Commission alleges and is prepared to prove, by reference to an information, indictment or complaint authorized by a United States Attorney or an appropriate official of any State that the registrant is charged with the commission of or participation in a crime involving a violation of the Act or a violation of any other provision of Federal or State law that would reflect on the honesty or the fitness of the person to act as a fiduciary that is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, and that continued registration of the person may pose a threat to the public interest or may threaten to impair public confidence in any market regulated by the Commission;</P>
            <P>(ii) An Administrative Law Judge shall make a determination, based upon written evidence and any oral hearing granted, as to whether the registrant is charged with the Commission of or participation in such a crime and whether the continued registration of the person may pose a threat to the public interest or may threaten to impair public confidence in any market regulated by the Commission; and</P>
            <P>(iii) If the registrant is found to be charged with the commission of or participation in such a crime and it is found that the continued registration of the person may pose a threat to the public interest or may threaten to impair public confidence in any market regulated by the Commission, the registration of the registrant shall be suspended or modified.</P>
            <P>(2) The notice referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall include a short and plain statement that the continued registration of the registrant may pose a threat to the public interest or may threaten to impair public confidence in any market regulated by the Commission.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Response.</E> (1) If the registrant wishes to challenge the accuracy of the allegations in the notice, the registrant may submit written evidence as to:</P>
            <P>(i) The registrant's identity;</P>
            <P>(ii) The existence of a clerical error in any record documenting the information, indictment or complaint;</P>
            <P>(iii) The nature of the information, indictment or complaint; or</P>
            <P>(iv) The statement accompanying the notice referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and, in an effort to have his registration modified rather than suspended, the Supplemental Sponsor Certification Statement signed by a sponsor, supervising floor broker or, in the case of a floor trader, a supervising registrant, principal, contract market, or swap execution facility, as appropriate for the registrant in accordance with § 3.60(b)(2)(i) and who meets the standards set forth in § 3.60(b)(2)(i)(A) and (C).</P>
            <P>(2) The registrant may also request an oral hearing, which shall include a statement of the issues to be addressed, a list of any witnesses to be called, a summary of the testimony to be elicited and copies of any documents to be introduced. An oral hearing shall be granted upon request.</P>

            <P>(3) Such written submissions must be served upon the Division of Enforcement and filed with the Proceedings Clerk within twenty days of the date of service of notice to the registrant under paragraph (a) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="210"/>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Reply.</E> Within ten days of receipt of any written submission filed by the registrant, the Division of Enforcement may serve upon the registrant and file with the Proceedings Clerk a reply.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Oral hearing.</E> An oral hearing shall be conducted pursuant to such sections of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 CFR part 10, as the Administrative Law Judge deems necessary and in a manner which shall ensure that the proceeding is resolved expeditiously.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Determination by Administrative Law Judge.</E> (1) A determination by the Administrative Law Judge as to whether the Division of Enforcement has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the registrant is charged with the commission of or participation in a crime as set forth in the notice and that the continued registration of the registrant may pose a threat to the public interest or may threaten to impair public confidence in any market regulated by the Commission must be based upon the evidence of service, the response, if any, filed by the registrant, any written reply submitted by the Division of Enforcement and such other papers as the Administrative Law Judge may require or permit, and the oral hearing, if any. If the Division of Enforcement has made the required showings, the Administrative Law Judge, within thirty days after the last written submission or the oral hearing, shall issue an order suspending or modifying the registration of the registrant. If the Division of Enforcement has not made the required showings, the Administrative Law Judge, within thirty days after the last written submission or the oral hearing, shall issue an order to that effect. The Administrative Law Judge's order shall include a written determination setting forth the basis for his ruling.</P>
            <P>(2) The Proceedings Clerk shall promptly serve a copy of such order on the registrant, the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight and the Division of Enforcement. Such Order shall be effective as a final order of the Commission fifteen days after the date it is served upon the registrant in accordance with the provisions of § 3.50(a) unless a timely application for review is filed in accordance with § 10.102 of this chapter. The appellate procedures set forth in §§ 10.102, 10.103, 10.104, 10.106, 10.107 and 10.109 of this chapter shall apply to any appeal brought under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(f) Any order of suspension or modification issued under this section shall remain in effect until such information, indictment, or complaint is disposed of or until terminated by the Commission.</P>
            <P>(g) On disposition of such information, indictment, or complaint, the Commission may issue and serve on such registrant a notice under § 3.55 or § 3.60 to suspend, restrict, or revoke the registration of such person.</P>
            <P>(h) A finding of not guilty or other disposition of the charge shall not preclude the Commission from thereafter instituting any other proceedings under the Act or its rules.</P>
            <P>(i) A person aggrieved by an order issued under this section may obtain review of such order in the same manner and on the same terms and conditions as are provided in section 6(c) of the Act.</P>

            <P>(1) The Commission alleges and is prepared to prove that the registrant or applicant is subject to one or more of the statutory disqualifications set forth in section 8a(2), 8a(3) or 8a(4) of the Act;<PRTPAGE P="211"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) The allegations set forth in the notice, if true, constitute a basis upon which registration may be denied, granted upon conditions, suspended, revoked or restricted;</P>
            <P>(3) The applicant or registrant is entitled to file a response within thirty days of the date of service of the notice to challenge the evidentiary basis of the statutory disqualification set forth in the notice or show cause why, notwithstanding the accuracy of those allegations, registration should nevertheless be granted, or granted upon condition, or should not be conditioned, suspended, revoked or restricted; and</P>
            <P>(4) If the applicant or registrant does not file a timely response to the notice:</P>
            <P>(i) The applicant or registrant will be deemed to have waived his right to a hearing on all issues and the facts stated in the notice shall be deemed to be true and conclusive for the purpose of finding that the applicant or registrant is subject to a statutory disqualification under sections 8a(2), 8a(3) or 8a(4) of the Act; and</P>
            <P>(ii) A presiding officer may thereafter decide whether to issue an order of default in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section to deny, condition, suspend, revoke, or place restrictions upon registration based solely upon the facts set forth in the notice.</P>

            <P>(1) In the response, the applicant or registrant shall state whether he challenges the evidentiary basis of the statutory disqualification set forth in the notice. The grounds for such a challenge shall include evidence as to:</P>
            <P>(i) The applicant's or registrant's identity,</P>
            <P>(ii) The existence of a clerical error in any record documenting the statutory disqualification,</P>

            <P>(iv) The post-conviction modification of any record of conviction, or</P>
            <P>(v) The favorable disposition of any appeal.
            </P>
            <FP>The applicant or registrant shall state the nature of each challenge and submit a verified statement or affidavit to support facts material to each challenge raised in the response.</FP>

            <P>(2)(i) In the response, if the person is not an associated person, a floor broker or a floor trader or an applicant for registration in any of those capacities, the applicant or registrant shall also state whether he or she intends to show that registration would not pose a substantial risk to the public despite the existence of the disqualification set forth in the notice. If the person is an associated person, a floor broker or a floor trader or an applicant for registration in any of those capacities, the applicant or registrant shall also state whether he or she intends to show that full, conditioned or restricted registration would not pose a substantial risk to the public despite the existence of the disqualification set forth in the notice. If the person is an associated person or an applicant for registration as an associated person and intends to make such a showing, he or she must also submit a letter signed by an officer or general partner authorized to bind the sponsor whereby the sponsor agrees to sign a Supplemental Sponsor Certification Statement and supervise compliance with any conditions or restrictions that may be imposed on the applicant or registrant as a result of a statutory disqualification proceeding under this section; if the person is a floor broker or a floor trader or an applicant for registration in either capacity and intends to make such a showing, he or she must, in the case of a floor broker or applicant for registration as a floor broker, also submit a letter signed by his employer or if he or she has no employer by another floor broker or, in the case of a floor trader or applicant for registration as a floor trader, also submit a letter signed by an officer of the floor trader's clearing member, if such officer is a registrant or a principal of a registrant, or the chief operating officer of each contract market or swap execution facility that has granted trading privileges, whereby the employer or floor broker, appropriate registrant, principal or <PRTPAGE P="212"/>chief operating officer (on behalf of the contract market or swap execution facility) agrees to sign a Supplemental Sponsor Certification Statement and supervise compliance with any conditions or restrictions that may be imposed on the applicant or registrant as a result of a statutory disqualification proceeding under this section; provided, that, with respect to such sponsor, supervising employer or floor broker, supervising registrant or principal:</P>
            <P>(A) An adjudicatory proceeding pursuant to the provisions of sections 6(c), 6(d), 6c, 6d, 8a or 9 of the Act is not pending; and</P>
            <P>(B) In the case of a sponsor which is a futures commission merchant, a retail foreign exchange dealer or a leverage transaction merchant, the sponsor is not subject to the reporting requirements of § 1.12(b), § 5.6(b) or § 31.7(b) of this chapter, respectively; and</P>
            <P>(C) Such person is not barred from service on self-regulatory organization governing boards or committees based on disciplinary history in accordance with § 1.63 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(ii) If, in the response, the applicant or registrant states that he intends to make the showing referred to in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, he shall also, within fifteen days after filing his initial response under paragraph (b) of this section, file with the Proceedings Clerk and serve a copy on the Division of Enforcement a submission which includes a statement of the applicant, registrant or his attorney identifying and summarizing the testimony of each witness whom the applicant or registrant intends to have testify in support of facts material to his showing, and copies of all documents which the applicant or registrant intends to introduce to support facts material to his showing. The factors forming the basis for a disqualified applicant's or registrant's showing referred to in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section may include:</P>
            <P>(A) Evidence mitigating the seriousness of the wrongdoing underlying the statutory disqualification set forth in the notice;</P>
            <P>(B) Evidence that the applicant or registrant has undergone rehabilitation since the time of the wrongdoing underlying the statutory disqualification; and</P>
            <P>(C) If the person is an associated person, floor broker or floor trader or an applicant for registration in any of those capacities, evidence that the applicant's or registrant's registration on a conditioned or restricted basis would be subject to supervisory controls likely both to detect future wrongdoing by the applicant or registrant and protect the public from any harm arising from the applicant's or registrant's future wrongdoing, including proposed conditions or restrictions.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Reply.</E> Within thirty days after the latter of the date the applicant or registrant serves a copy of the response on the Division of Enforcement (if no further submission is to be made in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section), or the date the applicant or registrant serves a copy of the further submission made in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section on the Division of Enforcement, the Division of Enforcement shall file a reply thereto with the Proceedings Clerk and serve a copy of the reply on the applicant or registrant. The Division of Enforcement's reply shall include either:</P>

            <P>(2) A description of factual issues raised in the applicant's or registrant's response and further submission, if any, that the Division of Enforcement regards as material and disputed. Such a reply shall also include the identity and a summary of the expected testimony of each witness whom the Division intends to have testify, and copies of all documents which the Division intends to introduce.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Oral Presentation.</E> Within thirty days of the date the Division of Enforcement files its reply in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) of <PRTPAGE P="213"/>this section to the applicant's or registrant's response and further submission, if any, the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an order:</P>
            <P>(1) If the Administrative Law Judge finds, based on the motion for summary disposition, that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, granting, denying, suspending, or revoking the registration of an applicant or registrant, or dismissing the notice issued in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, and such order shall be made in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section; or</P>
            <P>(2) Notifying the parties of a time and place of hearing. At such hearing, the parties shall be limited to presentation of witnesses and documents listed in previous filings except, for good cause shown, the parties may request that the witness and document lists be supplemented for purposes of rebuttal. Such oral hearing shall be conducted in accordance with §§ 10.61-10.81 and 10.83 of this chapter. The Administrative Law Judge shall file an initial decision after completion of the oral hearing in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) Upon notice that the Administrative Law Judge has concluded that an oral presentation is appropriate, the parties may elect to participate by telephone in accordance with the terms set forth in § 12.209(b) of this chapter. To effect such an election, the party shall file a notice with the Proceedings Clerk and serve a copy on all opposing parties within fifteen days of the date the Administrative Law Judge's notice is served. The filing of an election to participate by telephone will be deemed a waiver of the party's right to a full oral hearing on the parties' material disputes of fact. The Administrative Law Judge shall schedule a telephonic hearing only if all parties to the proceeding elect such a procedure. The Administrative Law Judge shall conduct such a hearing in accordance with § 12.209(b) of this chapter. Following the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge shall issue a written decision in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Determination by Administrative Law Judge—Standards of Proof.</E> The Administrative Law Judge's written determination shall specifically consider whether the Division of Enforcement has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the applicant or registrant is subject to the statutory disqualification set forth in the notice issued by the Commission and, where appropriate:</P>
            <P>(1) In actions involving statutory disqualifications set forth in section 8a(2) of the Act, whether the applicant or registrant has made a clear and convincing showing that full, conditioned or restricted registration would not pose a substantial risk to the public despite the existence of the statutory disqualification; or</P>
            <P>(2) In actions involving statutory disqualifications set forth in sections 8a(3) or 8a(4) of the Act, whether the applicant or registrant has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that full, conditioned or restricted registration would not pose a substantial risk to the public despite the existence of the statutory disqualification.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Determination of Administrative Law Judge—Findings.</E> In making his written determination, the Administrative Law Judge shall set forth the facts material to his conclusion and provide an explanation of his decision in light of the statutory disqualification set forth in the notice and, where appropriate, his findings regarding:</P>

            <P>(2) Evidence that the applicant or registrant has undergone rehabilitation since the time of the wrongdoing underlying the statutory disqualification; and</P>

            <P>(3) If the person is an associated person, a floor broker or a floor trader or an applicant for registration in any of those capacities, evidence that the applicant's or registrant's registration on a conditioned or restricted basis would be subject to supervisory controls likely both to detect future wrongdoing by the applicant or registrant and protect the public from any harm arising from future wrongdoing by the applicant or registrant. Any decision providing for a <PRTPAGE P="214"/>conditioned or restricted registration shall take into consideration the applicant's or registrant's statutory disqualification and the time period remaining on such statutory disqualification, and shall fix a time period after which the registrant and his or her sponsor, supervising employer or floor broker, or supervising registrant, principal, contract market, or swap execution facility may petition to lift or modify the conditions or restrictions in accordance with § 3.64.</P>

            <P>(3) <E T="03">Submission of offer.</E> Offers of settlement made by a respondent shall be submitted in writing to the Division of Enforcement, which shall present them to the Commission with the Division's recommendation. The respondent will be informed if the recommendation will be unfavorable, in which event the offer shall not be presented to the Commission unless the respondent so requests. Any offer of settlement not presented to the Commission shall be null and void with respect to any acknowledgment, admission, waiver, stipulation or consent contained in the offer and shall not be used in any manner in the proceeding by any party thereto.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Acceptance of offer.</E> The offer of settlement will only be deemed accepted upon issuance by the Commission of an opinion and order based on the offer. Upon issuance of the opinion and order, the proceeding shall be terminated as to the respondent involved and so noted on the docket by the Proceedings Clerk.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Rejection of offer.</E> When an offer of settlement is rejected, the party making the offer shall be notified by the Division of Enforcement and the offer of settlement shall be deemed withdrawn. A rejected offer of settlement and any documents relating thereto shall not constitute a part of the record in the proceeding; and the offer will be null and void with respect to any acknowledgment, admission, waiver, stipulation or consent contained in the offer and shall not be used in any manner in the proceeding by any party thereto.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Petition.</E> The registrant and his sponsor or supervising floor broker may file a petition with the Proceedings Clerk and serve a copy of the petition on the Division of Enforcement to lift or modify conditions or restrictions on the registrant's registration.</P>
            <P>(1) The petition may be filed after the period specified in the order imposing the conditioned or restricted registration.</P>
            <P>(2) In the petition, the registrant and his or her sponsor, supervising employer or floor broker, or supervising registrant, principal, contract market, or swap execution facility shall be limited to a showing, by affidavit, that the conditions or restrictions have been satisfied pursuant to the order which imposed them.

            <P>(2) If the Division of Enforcement agrees with the petitioner's request to lift or modify conditions or restrictions on the petitioner's registration, it shall so recommend to the Commission.

            <P>(1) If the Administrative Law Judge determines that an oral presentation is appropriate, he shall notify the parties of his determination and shall schedule and conduct an oral hearing in accordance with §§ 10.61 through 10.81 of this chapter.

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 3—Interpretative Statement With Respect to Section 8<E T="01">a</E>(2)(C) and (E) and Section 8<E T="01">a</E>(3)(J) and (M) of the Commodity Exchange Act</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 8a(2) (C) and (E)</HD>
            <P>The provisions of sections 8a(2)-8a(4) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”) establish a system of statutory disqualifications pursuant to which the Commission may find an applicant or registrant unfit for registration and vest the Commission with wide discretion to deny, condition, suspend, restrict or revoke the registration of any person subject to one or more of the disqualifications set forth therein. The Commission recognizes that the full exercise of its authority under these provisions of the Act may have unintended results. In particular, the exercise of such authority may, in certain cases, impede the efficient enforcement of the Act and the various federal and state securities acts.</P>
            <P>At this time, the Commission cannot anticipate all of the circumstances under which it may elect not to exercise its authority under sections 8a(2)-8a(4). Until the Commission has gained experience with these provisions of the Act, such determinations generally must be made on a case-by-case basis. Nonetheless, the Commission has identified two paragraphs of section 8a(2) of the Act which it has determined to interpret more narrowly than required.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 8a(2)(C).</E> Section 8a(2) of the Act authorizes the Commission to deny, condition, suspend or restrict the registration of any person “upon notice, but without a hearing” and to revoke the registration of any person “with such hearing as may be appropriate,” if such person is subject to one or more of the disqualifications described in paragraphs (A)-(H). Section 8a(2)(C) authorizes the Commission to affect the registration of any person:
            </P>

            <P>“if such person is permanently or temporarily enjoined by order, judgment, or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction * * * , including an order entered pursuant to an agreement of settlement to which the Commission or any Federal or State agency or other governmental body is a party, from (i) <PRTPAGE P="218"/>acting as a futures commission merchant, introducing broker, floor broker, floor trader, commodity trading advisor, commodity pool operator, associated person of any registrant under the Act, securities broker, securities dealer, municipal securities broker, municipal securities dealer, transfer agent, clearing agency, securities information processor, investment advisor, investment company, or affiliated person or employee of any of the foregoing or (ii) engaging in or continuing any activity involving any transaction in or advice concerning contracts of sale of a commodity for future delivery, concerning matters subject to Commission regulation under section 4c or 19 of the Act, or concerning securities;”
            </P>
            <P>The Commission believes that a person enjoined from acting in a certain capacity as described in section 8a(2)(C)(i), even if the order of injunction is entered into pursuant to an agreement of settlement, similarly should be prohibited from acting in any other capacity which requires registration with the Commission. Therefore, the Commission does not intend to limit its authority under section 8a(2)(C)(i) of the Act.</P>
            <P>However, the Commission is also aware that it has often initiated proceedings in which the sole relief sought was an injunction from engaging in certain conduct. In such circumstances, the Commission has accepted offers of settlement which provide that the findings set forth in the settlement will not form the sole basis for the denial, suspension or revocation of such person's registration with the Commission. The Commission does not wish to impede the resolution by negotiated settlement of such proceedings. Therefore, the Commission has determined that it will not exercise its authority under section 8a(2)(C)(ii) of the Act with respect to any person temporarily or permanently enjoined by agreement of settlement from engaging in any conduct described in that paragraph, if the agreement of settlement clearly restricts the use of such order of injunction or any findings set forth therein in subsequent or collateral proceedings.</P>

            <P>Thus, a provision in the agreement of settlement to the effect, <E T="03">inter alia,</E> that the findings set forth in the agreement will not form the <E T="03">sole basis</E> upon which the registration of such person may be affected will preclude a collateral proceeding under section 8a(2)(C)(ii) where the sole basis for such proceeding is the agreement of settlement. Unless otherwise precluded in the agreement of settlement, however, the person will be collaterally estopped from denying the findings set forth therein, whether or not admitted, in any other subsequent or collateral proceeding and such findings may, in conjunction with the findings in such subsequent or collateral proceeding, form a basis for affecting the registration of that person or imposing such other sanctions as may be deemed appropriate.</P>

            <P>Section 8a(2)(E) of the Act authorizes the Commission to affect the registration of any person:
            </P>

            <P>If such person, within ten years preceding the filing of the application or at any time thereafter, has been found in a proceeding brought by the Commission or any Federal or State agency or other governmental body, or by agreement of settlement to which the Commission or any Federal or State agency or other governmental body is a party, (i) to have violated any provision of this Act, [the securities acts], chapter 96 of title 18 of the United States Code, or any similar statute of a State or foreign jurisdiction, or any rule, regulation, or order under any such statutes, or the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board where such violation involves embezzlement, theft, extortion, fraud, fraudulent conversion, misappropriation of funds, securities or property, forgery, counterfeiting, false pretenses, bribery, or gambling, or (ii) to have willfully aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, or procured such violation by any other person;
            </P>

            <P>As in section 8a(2)(C)(ii), the Commission will not exercise its authority under section 8a(2)(E) of the Act with respect to any person subject to a statutory disqualification thereunder, if the findings are part of an agreement of settlement which clearly restricts the use of such findings by inclusion of a provision to the effect, <E T="03">inter alia,</E> that the findings set forth in the agreement will not form the <E T="03">sole basis</E> upon which the registration of such person may be affected.</P>
            <P>Section 2(a)(1)(A) of the Act, <E T="03">inter alia,</E> codifies the legal concept of <E T="03">respondant superior</E> by providing that a futures commission merchant, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, commodity pool operator or leverage transaction merchant may be held liable for the conduct of an associated person sponsored by such registrant. *<FTREF/> Thus, findings of the type described in paragraph (E) may be entered against a registrant solely because such registrant is responsible, under section 2(a)(1)(A) of the Act, for the conduct of its associated persons. As prescribed in § 3.57 of the Commission's regulations, however, the Commission will not exercise its authority under section 8a(2)(E) to affect the registration of such registrant, if <E T="03">respondant <PRTPAGE P="219"/>superior</E> is the sole basis for finding that the registrant is subject to a statutory disqualification.</P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>* Specifically, section 2(a)(1)(A)(iii) of the Act provides in part, that the “act, omission or failure of any official, agent, or other person acting for any individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust within the scope of his employment or office shall be deemed the act, omission, or failure of such individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust as well as of such official, agent, or other person.” 7 U.S.C. 4 (1982).</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>The Commission notes that section 8a(3)(C) and 8a(4) authorize the Commission to affect the registration of a person if it is found, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that such person “failed reasonably to supervise another person, who is subject to such person's supervision, with a view to preventing violations of this Act or [the securities acts], or of any of the rules, regulation or orders thereunder, and the person subject to supervision committed such a violation * * *” In this connection, the Commission believes that any proceeding to affect the registration of a registrant against which findings have been made solely pursuant to section 2(a)(1)(A) of the Act is more appropriately initiated under the provisions of section 8a(3)(C) and 8a(4).</P>
            <P>Section 8a(2)(E) may also be interpreted to authorize the Commission to affect the registration of any person if the findings described therein are made in a proceeding initiated by a private party either in a court of law or in a reparations proceeding under section 14 of the Act. At the present time, however, the Commission does not intend to exercise its authority under section 8a(2)(E) on the basis of such findings. The Commission believes that such proceedings are intended primarily to provide restitution to the customer and are not intended to be punitive in nature. Therefore, it may not be appropriate to use findings in such proceedings to affect the registration of any person under section 8a(2)(E).</P>
            <P>At the same time, however, such findings may form the basis of a proceeding against a person under the provisions of section 8a(3)(M) and 8a(4), which authorize the Commission, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, to deny, condition, suspend, restrict or revoke the registration of any person if “there is other good cause.” Similarly, such findings may form the basis for a proceeding against a registrant under sections 8a(3)(C) and 8a(4) for the failure of such registrant “reasonably to supervise another person, who is subject to such person's supervision, with a view to preventing violations of this Act * * * or of any of the rules, regulations or orders thereunder * * *” Moreover, because the Commission views actions by private parties as an important adjunct to the Commission's own enforcement proceedings, the Commission intends to monitor carefully decisions in such proceedings and may amend this interpretation if deemed appropriate.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 8a(3) (J) and (M)</HD>
            <P>Section 8a(3) authorizes the Commission to refuse to register an applicant for registration if, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, the applicant is found subject to one or more of the disqualifications described in paragraphs (A)-(M). Section 8a(4) authorizes the Commission, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, to condition, suspend, restrict, or revoke the registration of any person subject to a disqualification under section 8a(3).</P>

            <P>Section 8a(3)(J) authorizes the Commission to affect the registration of any person if:
            </P>

            <P>If such person is subject to an outstanding order denying, suspending, or expelling such person from membership in a contract market, a registered futures association, any other self-regulatory organization or any foreign regulatory body that the Commission recognizes as having a comparable regulatory program, or barring or suspending such person from being associated with any member or members of such contract market, association, self-regulatory organization, or foreign regulatory body.
            </P>
            <P>The Commission interprets the term “self-regulatory organization” to include, in addition to a contract market and a registered futures association, any self-regulatory organization as defined in section 3(a)(26) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Thus, a self-regulatory organization includes any national securities exchange, any registered securities association, any registered clearing agency and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section 8a(3)(M).</E> Section 8a(3)(M) authorizes the Commission to affect the registration of any person if “there is other good cause”. Specifically, the Commission interprets paragraph (M) to authorize the Commission to refuse to register such person in any new capacity, if such person, or any principal of such person, is the subject of an administrative proceeding brought by the Commission to revoke the existing registration of such person in any other capacity, pending a final decision in such administrative proceeding. The Commission believes it would be inconsistent to register a person in a new capacity, thereby determining that such person is qualified to be registered, while simultaneously seeking to revoke such person's registration in a different capacity because such person's conduct disqualifies him from registration.</P>

            <P>Similarly, the Commission interprets paragraph (M) to authorize the Commission to refuse to register, register conditionally or otherwise affect the registration of any person if such person has consented, in connection with an agreement of settlement with a contract market, a registered futures association, or any other self-regulatory organization, to comply with an undertaking to withdraw all forms of existing or pending registration and/or not to apply for registration with the National Futures Association or the Commission in any capacity. Such <PRTPAGE P="220"/>person's effort to violate his or her prior undertaking to withdraw from and/or not to apply for registration shall be considered to constitute “other good cause” under paragraph (M). The Commission believes that allowing such a person to be registered would be inappropriate and inconsistent with the intention of parties to the prior settlement agreement. The failure to withdraw or the attempt to register in the face of such an undertaking would indicate the lack of fair and honest dealing which the Commission believes constitutes “other good cause” for denying, revoking or conditioning registration under the Act. The Commission also believes that allowing registration in such a situation would be inconsistent with both Section 8a(2)(A), which authorizes the Commission to refuse to register, to register conditionally, or to revoke, suspend or place restrictions upon the registration of any person if such person's prior registration has been suspended (and the period of such suspension has not expired) or has been revoked, and Section 8a(3)(J), which authorizes the Commission to refuse to register or to register conditionally any person if he or she is subject to an outstanding order denying, suspending, or expelling such person from membership in a contract market, a registered futures association, or any other self-regulatory organization.</P>
            <P>Good cause to affect a person's registration also exists: (1) If the operations of such person disrupt or would tend to disrupt orderly market conditions, or cause or would tend to cause sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the price of commodities or contracts for future delivery of commodities or commodity options; (2) if such person has used or is using in its name a term such as “board of trade”, “clearing corporation” or “exchange” in a misleading context, or uses any terms in its representations to the public which may indicate that the person is a contract market or a member of a contract market when such is not the case, or has used or is using a misleading name which would tend to suggest to the public that the person is affiliated with another person when that is not the case or that the person is engaged in a commodity-related business when the person is not in fact substantially so engaged, or has failed to disclose to the public an agency relationship with another person when such failure could mislead the public; (3) if such person is subject to an outstanding order denying, suspending or revoking the license of such person by a licensing authority, such as a state real estate or insurance commission; and (4) if such person has failed to answer the inquiries or requests for further information concerning an application for registration filed with the Commission.</P>
            <P>This listing, of course, is not exclusive. In general, the Commission interprets paragraph (M) to authorize the Commission to affect the registration of any person if, as a result of any act or pattern of conduct attributable to such person, although never the subject of formal action or proceeding before either a court or governmental agency, such person's potential disregard of or inability to comply with the requirements of the Act or the rules, regulations or order thereunder, or such person's moral turpitude, or lack of honesty or financial responsibility is demonstrated to the Commission.</P>
            <P>Any inability to deal fairly with the public and consistent with just and equitable principles of trade may render an applicant or registrant unfit for registration, given the high ethical standards which must prevail in the industry.</P>

            <P>The Commission has further addressed “other good cause” under Section 8a(3)(M) of the Act in issuing guidance letters on assessing the fitness of floor brokers, floor traders or applicants in either category:

            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Re: Adverse Registration Actions with Respect to Floor Brokers, Floor Traders and Applicants for Registration in Either Category</FP>
            

            <P>Dear Mr. Wilmouth: As you know, the Commission on June 26, 1997, approved for publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a Notice and Order concerning adverse registration actions by the National Futures Association (“NFA”) with respect to registered floor brokers (“FBs”), registered floor traders (“FTs”) and applicants for registration in either category. 62 Fed. Reg. 36050 (July 3, 1997). The Notice and Order authorized NFA to grant or to maintain, either with or without conditions or restrictions, FB or FT registration where NFA previously would have forwarded the case to the Commission for review of disciplinary history. The Commission has worked with its staff to determine which of the pending matters could efficiently be returned to NFA for handling, and such matters have been forwarded to NFA. The Commission will continue to accept or to act upon requests for exemption, and the Commission staff will consider requests for “no-action” opinions with respect to applicable registration requirements.</P>

            <P>By this correspondence, the Commission is issuing guidance that provides NFA further direction on how it expects NFA to exercise its delegated power, based upon the experience of the Commission and the staff with the registration review process during the past three years. This guidance will help ensure that NFA exercises its delegated power <PRTPAGE P="221"/>in a manner consistent with Commission precedent.</P>
            <P>In exercising its delegated authority, NFA, of course, needs to apply all of the provisions of Sections 8a(2) and (3) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”). <SU>1</SU>
              <FTREF/> In that regard, NFA should consider the matters in which the Commission has taken action in the past and endeavor to seek similar registration restrictions, conditions, suspensions, denials, or revocations under similar circumstances.</P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>1</SU> 7 U.S.C. 12a(2) and (3) (1994). The letter is intended to supplement, not to supersede, other guidance provided in the past to NFA. In this regard, the NFA should continue to follow other guidance provided by the Commission or its staff.</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>One of the areas in which NFA appears to have had the most uncertainty is with regard to previous self-regulatory organization (“SRO”) disciplinary actions. Commission Rule 1.63 <SU>2</SU>
              <FTREF/> provides clear guidelines for determining whether a person's history of “disciplinary offenses” should preclude service on SRO governing boards or committees. <SU>3</SU>
              <FTREF/> In determining whether to grant or to maintain, either with or without conditions or restrictions, FB or FT registration, NFA should, as an initial matter, apply the Rule 1.63(a)(6) criteria to those registered FBs, registered FTs and applicants for registration in either category. However, NFA should be acting based upon any such offenses that occurred within the previous five years, rather than the three years provided for in Rule 1.63(c). NFA should consider disciplinary actions taken by an SRO as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 no differently from disciplinary actions taken by an SRO in the futures industry as defined in Rule 1.3(ee). <SU>4</SU>
              <FTREF/> Application of the Rule 1.63 criteria, as modified, to these matters will aid NFA in making registration determinations that are reasonably consonant with Commission views. <SU>5</SU>
              <FTREF/> NFA should focus on the nature of the underlying conduct rather than the sanction imposed by an SRO. Thus, if a disciplinary action would not come within the coverage of Rule 1.63 but for the imposition of a short suspension of trading privileges (such as for a matter involving fighting, use of profane language or minor recordkeeping violations), NFA could exercise discretion, as has the Commission, not to institute a statutory disqualification case. On the other hand, conduct that falls clearly within the terms of Rule 1.63, such as violations of rules involving potential harm to customers of the exchange, should not be exempt from review simply because the exchange imposed a relatively minor sanction.</P>

                <SU>3</SU> Rule 1.63(c) provides that a person is ineligible from serving on an SRO's disciplinary committees, arbitration panels, oversight panels or governing board if, as provided in Rule 1.63(b), the person, inter alia: (1) within the past three years has been found by a final decision of an SRO, an administrative law judge, a court of competent jurisdiction or the Commission to have committed a disciplinary offense; or (2) within the past three years has entered into a settlement agreement in which any of the findings or, in the absence of such findings, any of the acts charged included a disciplinary offense.</P>

              <P>
                <SU>4</SU> Thus, for example, a disciplinary action taken by the Chicago Board Options Exchange or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. should be considered in a manner similar to a disciplinary action of the Chicago Board of Trade or NFA.</P>

            <FTNT>
              <P>

                <SU>5</SU> In reviewing these matters, the NFA should bear in mind recent Commission precedent which allows for reliance on settled disciplinary proceedings in some circumstances. <E T="03">See In the Matter of Michael J. Clark,</E> [1996-1998 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) ¶ 27,032 (Apr. 22, 1997) (“other good cause” under Section 8a(3)(M) of the Act exists based upon a pattern of exchange disciplinary actions resulting in significant sanctions for serious rule violations—whether settlements or adjudications), <E T="03">aff'd sub nom., Clark</E> v. <E T="03">Commodity Futures Trading Commission,</E> No. 97-4228 (2d Cir. June 4, 1999) (unpublished).</P>
            </FTNT>

            <P>The Commission has treated the registration process and the SRO disciplinary process as separate matters involving separate considerations. The fact that the Commission has not pursued its own enforcement case in a particular situation does not necessarily mean that the Commission considers the situation to be a minor matter for which no registration sanctions are appropriate. Further, the Commission believes that it and NFA, entities with industry-wide perspective and responsibilities, are the appropriate bodies, rather than any individual exchange, to <PRTPAGE P="222"/>decide issues relating to registration status, which can affect a person's ability to function in the industry well beyond the jurisdiction of a particular exchange. Thus, NFA's role is in no way related to review of exchange sanctions for particular conduct, but rather it is the entirely separate task of determining whether an FB's or FT's conduct should impact his or her registration.</P>
            <P>NFA also should look to Commission precedent in selecting conditions or restrictions to be imposed, such as a dual trading ban where a person has been involved in disciplinary offenses involving customer abuse. Where conditions or restrictions are imposed, or agreed upon, NFA also should follow Commission precedent, under which such conditions or restrictions generally have been imposed for a two-year period.</P>
            <P>The Commission has required sponsorship for conditioned FBs and FTs when their disciplinary offenses have involved noncompetitive trading and fraud irrespective of the level of sanctions imposed by an SRO. Indeed, but for a sponsorship requirement there would be no one routinely watching and responsible for the activities of these registrants. Absent sponsorship, such FBs and FTs would only be subject to routine Commission and exchange surveillance. The Commission's rules are premised upon the judgment that requiring FTs and FBs to have sponsors to ensure their compliance with conditions is both appropriate and useful. See Rule 3.60(b)(2)(i).</P>
            <P>A question has arisen whether, if NFA is required to prove up the underlying facts of an SRO disciplinary action, the exchanges can provide information on exchange disciplinary proceedings directly to NFA. Although Section 8c(a)(2) of the Act states that an exchange shall not disclose the evidence for a disciplinary action except to the person disciplined and to the Commission, Section 8a(10) of the Act allows the Commission to authorize any person to perform any portion of the registration functions under the Act, notwithstanding any other provision of law. The effective discharge of the delegated registration function requires NFA to have access to the exchange evidence. Thus, the Commission believes that Section 8a(10) may reasonably be interpreted to allow the disclosure of information from exchange disciplinary proceedings directly to NFA despite the provisions of Section 8c(a)(2).</P>
            <P>Nothing in the Notice and Order affects the Commission's authority to review the granting of a registration application by NFA in the performance of Commission registration functions, including review of the sufficiency of conditions or restrictions imposed by NFA, to review the determination by NFA not to take action to affect an existing registration, or to take its own action to address a statutory disqualification. Moreover, the Commission Order contemplates that to allow for appropriate Commission oversight of NFA's exercise of this delegated authority, NFA will provide for the Commission's review quarterly schedules of all applicants cleared for registration and all registrants whose registrations are maintained without adverse action by NFA's Registration, Compliance, Legal Committee despite potential statutory disqualifications.</P>
            <P>The Commission will continue to monitor NFA activities through periodic rule enforcement reviews, and NFA remains subject to the present requirement that it monitor compliance with the conditions and restrictions imposed on conditioned and restricted registrants.</P>

            <P>Dear Mr. Wilmouth:</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. Introduction and Background</HD>
            <P>In July 1997, the Commission issued a Notice and Order authorizing the National Futures Association (“NFA”) to grant or to maintain, either with or without conditions or restrictions, floor broker (“FB”) or floor trader (“FT”) registration where NFA previously would have forwarded the case to the Commission for review of disciplinary history. <SU>1</SU>
              <FTREF/> By letter dated December 4, 1997 (“Guidance Letter”), the Commission provided further direction on how the Commission expected NFA to exercise its delegated power and to ensure that NFA exercised its delegated power in a manner consistent with Commission precedent.</P>

            <P>The Commission has determined to revise the Guidance Letter. Specifically, the Commission is revising the portion of the Guidance Letter that addresses the use of exchange disciplinary actions as “other good cause” to affect FB and FT registrations. The Commission has made this determination following its own reconsideration of the issue and at the urging of industry members. <SU>2</SU>

The JCC consists of senior compliance officials from all domestic futures exchanges and the NFA (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the domestic self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”)). In addition, staff from the Contract Markets Section of the Commission's Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight attend the JCC meetings as observers. The JCC was established to aid in the development of improved compliance systems through joint efforts and information-sharing among the SROs. Commission staff have also discussed this issue with SRO staff.</P>

            <P>The Guidance Letter pointed out that, in exercising its delegated authority, NFA must apply all of the provisions of Sections 8a(2) and (3) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”). <SU>3</SU>

              <FTREF/> In particular, Section 8a(3)(M) of the Act authorizes the Commission to refuse to register or to register conditionally any person if it is found, after opportunity for hearing, that there is other good cause for statutory disqualification from registration beyond the specifically listed grounds in Sections 8a(2) and 8a(3) of the Act. The Commission held in <E T="03">In the Matter of Clark</E> that statutory disqualification under the “other good cause” provision of Section 8a(3)(M) may arise on the basis of, among other things, a pattern of exchange disciplinary actions alleging serious rule violations that result in significant sanctions, and that it is immaterial whether the sanctions imposed resulted from a fully-adjudicated disciplinary action or an action that was taken following a settlement. <SU>4</SU>

              <FTREF/> The Guidance Letter also noted that NFA should consider disciplinary actions taken not only by futures industry SROs but also those taken by SROs as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“1934 Act”), including settled disciplinary actions.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Revised Guidance</HD>

            <P>As stated above, the Commission has determined to revise the Guidance Letter. From this point forward, NFA should cease using Rule 1.63 as the basis to evaluate the impact of an FB or FT applicant's or registrant's disciplinary history on his or her fitness to be registered. Instead, as <E T="03">Clark</E> stated, when reviewing disciplinary history to assess the fitness to be registered of an FB, FT, or applicant in either category, a pattern of exchange disciplinary actions alleging serious rule violations that result in significant sanctions will trigger the “other good cause” provision of Section 8a(3)(M). The “pattern” should consist of at least two final exchange disciplinary actions, whether settled or adjudicated.</P>
            <P>NFA also should consider initiating proceedings to affect the registration of the FB or FT, even if there is only a single exchange action against the FB or FT, if the exchange action was based on allegations of particularly egregious misconduct or involved numerous instances of misconduct occurring over a long period of time. If, however, a proceeding is initiated based on a single exchange action that was disposed of by settlement, NFA may have to prove up the underlying misconduct. Furthermore, traditional principles of collateral estoppel apply to adjudicated actions, whether they are being considered individually or as part of a pattern. <SU>7</SU>
              <FTREF/>

            </FTNT>

            <P>As provided by the Guidance Letter, “exchange disciplinary actions” would continue to include disciplinary actions taken by both futures industry SROs and SROs as defined <PRTPAGE P="224"/>in Section 3(a)(26) of the 1934 Exchange Act. Furthermore, NFA should review an applicant's or registrant's disciplinary history for the past five years. <SU>8</SU>

              <FTREF/> At least one of the actions forming the pattern, however, must have become final after <E T="03">Clark</E> was decided by the Commission on April 22, 1997. Finally, “serious rule violations” consist of, or are substantially related to, charges of fraud, customer abuse, other illicit trading practices, or the obstruction of an exchange investigation.</P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>

                <SU>8</SU> The Commission generally looked at a five-year period of disciplinary history. On occasion, however, the Commission examined a longer period of an applicant's or registrant's disciplinary history. For example, the Commission revoked the registration of one FB on the basis of exchange disciplinary cases that extended back six years, <E T="03">see Clark,</E> 2 Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) ¶ 27,032, and denied an application for registration as an FT on the basis of exchange disciplinary cases that extended back seven years, <E T="03">see In the Matter of Castellano,</E> [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) ¶ 24,360 (Nov. 23, 1988), <E T="03">summarily aff'd</E> (May 29, 1990), <E T="03">reh. denied</E> [1990-1992 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L.

            </FTNT>
            <P>Congress, the courts and the Commission have indicated the importance of considering an applicant's history of exchange disciplinary actions in assessing that person's fitness to register. <SU>9</SU>
              <FTREF/> Furthermore, NFA's review of exchange disciplinary actions within the context of the registration process should not simply mirror the disciplinary actions undertaken by the exchanges. The two processes are separate matters that involve separate considerations. As part of their ongoing self-regulatory obligations, exchanges must take disciplinary action <SU>10</SU>
              <FTREF/> and such disciplinary matters necessarily focus on the specific misconduct that forms the allegation. In a statutory disqualification action, however, NFA must determine whether the disciplinary history of an FB, FT or applicant over the preceding five years should impact his or her registration. Additionally, NFA possesses industry-wide perspective and responsibilities. As such, NFA, rather than an individual exchange, should decide registration status issues, since those issues affect an individual's status within the industry as a whole, well beyond the jurisdiction of a particular exchange.</P>

            <P>The Commission also wants to clarify to the fullest extent possible that its power to delegate the authority to deny or condition the registration of an FB, FT, or an applicant for registration in either category permits exchanges to disclose to NFA all evidence underlying exchange disciplinary actions, notwithstanding the language of Section 8c(a)(2) of the Act. <SU>11</SU>
              <FTREF/> The Commission's power to delegate stems from Section 8a(10) of the Act, which permits delegation of registration functions, including statutory disqualification actions, to any person in accordance with rules adopted by such person and submitted to the Commission for approval or for review under Section 17(j) of the Act, “notwithstanding any other provision of law.” Certainly, Section 8c(a)(2) qualifies as “any other provision of law.” Furthermore, the effective discharge of the delegated function requires NFA to have access to the exchange evidence. Thus, the exercise of the delegated authority pursuant to Section 8a(10) permits the exchanges to disclose all evidence underlying disciplinary actions to NFA. <SU>12</SU>

                <SU>12</SU> Of course, the Commission could request records from the exchange and forward them to NFA.

            </FTNT>
            <P>This letter supersedes the Guidance Letter to the extent discussed above. In all other aspects, the Guidance Letter and other guidance provided by the Commission or its staff remain in effect. Therefore, NFA should continue to follow Commission precedent when selecting conditions or restrictions to be imposed. For example, NFA should impose a dual trading ban where customer abuse is involved and any conditions or restrictions imposed should be for a two-year period. Furthermore, NFA should require sponsorship for conditioned FBs or FTs when their disciplinary offenses involve noncompetitive trading and fraud.</P>

            <P>Nothing in the Notice and Order or this letter affects the Commission's authority to review the granting of a registration application by NFA in the performance of Commission registration functions, including review of the sufficiency of conditions or restrictions imposed by NFA, to review the determination by NFA not to take action to affect an existing registration, or to take its <PRTPAGE P="225"/>own action to address a statutory disqualification. Moreover, the Commission Order contemplates that to allow for appropriate Commission oversight of NFA's exercise of this delegated authority, NFA will provide for the Commission's review quarterly schedules of all applicants cleared for registration and all registrants whose registrations are maintained without adverse action by NFA's Registration, Compliance, Legal Committee despite potential statutory disqualifications.</P>

            <EAR>Pt. 3, App. B</EAR>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix B to Part 3—Statement of Acceptable Practices With Respect to Ethics Training</HD>
            <P>(a) The provisions of Section 4p(b) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 6p(b) (1994)) set forth requirements regarding training of registrants as to their responsibilities to the public. This section requires the Commission to issue regulations requiring new registrants to attend ethics training sessions within six months of registration, and all registrants to attend such training on a periodic basis. The awareness and maintenance of professional ethical standards are essential elements of a registrant's fitness. Further, the use of ethics training programs is relevant to a registrant's maintenance of adequate supervision, a requirement under Rule 166.3.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) The Commission recognizes that technology has provided new, faster means of sharing and distributing information. In view of the foregoing, the Commission has chosen to allow registrants to develop their own ethics training programs. Nevertheless, futures industry professionals may want guidance as to the role of ethics training. Registrants may wish to consider what ethics training should be retained, its format, and how it might best be implemented. Therefore, the Commission finds it appropriate to issue this Statement of Acceptable Practices regarding appropriate training for registrants, as interpretative guidance for intermediaries on fitness and supervision. Commission registrants may look to this Statement of Acceptable Practices as a “safe harbor” concerning acceptable procedures in this area.</P>
            <P>(2) The Commission believes that section 4p(b) of the Act reflects an intent by Congress that industry professionals be aware, and remain abreast, of their continuing obligations to the public under the Act and the regulations thereunder. The text of the Act provides guidance as to the nature of these responsibilities. As expressed in section 4p(b) of the Act, personnel in the industry have an obligation to the public to observe the Act, the rules of the Commission, the rules of any appropriate self-regulatory organizations or contract markets (which would also include registered derivatives transaction execution facilities), or other applicable federal or state laws or regulations. Further, section 4p(b) acknowledges that registrants have an obligation to the public to observe “just and equitable principles of trade.”</P>
            <P>(3) Additionally, section 4p(b) reflects Congress' intent that registrants and their personnel retain an up-to-date knowledge of these requirements. The Act requires that registrants receive training on a periodic basis. Thus, it is the intent of Congress that Commission registrants remain current with regard to the ethical ramifications of new technology, commercial practices, regulations, or other changes.</P>
            <P>(c) The Commission believes that training should be focused to some extent on a person's registration category, although there will obviously be certain principles and issues common to all registrants and certain general subjects that should be taught. Topics to be addressed include:</P>
            <P>(1) An explanation of the applicable laws and regulations, and the rules of self-regulatory organizations or contract markets and registered derivatives transaction execution facilities;</P>
            <P>(2) The registrant's obligation to the public to observe just and equitable principles of trade;</P>
            <P>(3) How to act honestly and fairly and with due skill, care and diligence in the best interests of customers and the integrity of the market;</P>
            <P>(4) How to establish effective supervisory systems and internal controls;</P>
            <P>(5) Obtaining and assessing the financial situation and investment experience of customers;</P>
            <P>(6) Disclosure of material information to customers; and</P>
            <P>(7) Avoidance, proper disclosure and handling of conflicts of interest.</P>

            <P>(d) An acceptable ethics training program would apply to all of a firm's associated persons and its principals to the extent they are required to register as associated persons. Additionally, personnel of firms that rely on their registration with other regulators, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, should be provided with ethics training to the extent the Act and the Commission's regulations apply to their business.<PRTPAGE P="226"/>
            </P>
            <P>(e) As to the providers of such training, the Commission believes that classes sponsored by independent persons, firms, or industry associations would be acceptable. It would also be permissible to conduct in-house training programs. Further, registrants should ascertain the credentials of any ethics training providers they retain. Thus, persons who provide ethics training should be required to provide proof of satisfactory completion of the proficiency testing requirements applicable to the registrant and evidence of three years of relevant industry or pedagogical experience in the field. This industry experience might include the practice of law in the fields of futures or securities, or employment as a trader or risk manager at a brokerage or end-user firm. Likewise, the Commission believes that registrants should employ as ethics training providers only those persons they reasonably believe in good faith are not subject to any investigations or to bars to registration or to service on a self-regulatory organization governing board or disciplinary panel.</P>
            <P>(f)(1) With regard to the frequency and duration of ethics training, it is permissible for a firm to require training on whatever periodic basis and duration the registrant (and relevant self-regulatory organizations) deems appropriate. It may even be appropriate not to require any such specific requirements as, for example, where ethics training could be termed ongoing. For instance, a small entity, sole proprietorship, or even a small section in an otherwise large firm, might satisfy its obligation to remain current with regard to ethics obligations by distribution of periodicals, legal cases, or advisories. Use of the latest information technology, such as Internet websites, can be useful in this regard. In such a context, there would be no structured classes, but the goal should be a continuous awareness of changing industry standards. A corporate culture to maintain high ethical standards should be established on a continuing basis.</P>
            <P>(2) On the other hand, larger firms which transact business with a larger segment of the public may wish to implement a training program that requires periodic classwork. In such a situation, the Commission believes it appropriate for registrants to maintain such records as evidence of attendance and of the materials used for training. In the case of a floor broker or floor trader, the applicable contract market or registered derivatives transaction execution facility should maintain such evidence on behalf of its member. This evidence of ethics training could be offered to demonstrate fitness and overall compliance during audits by self-regulatory organizations, and during reviews of contract market or registered derivatives transaction execution facility operations.</P>
            <P>(g) The methodology of such training may also be flexible. Recent innovations in information technology have made possible new, fast, and cost-efficient ways for registrants to maintain their awareness of events and changes in the commodity interest markets. In this regard, the Commission recognizes that the needs of a firm will vary according to its size, personnel, and activities. No format of classes will be required. Rather, such training could be in the form of formal class lectures, video presentation, Internet transmission, or by simple distribution of written materials. These options should provide sufficiently flexible means for adherence to Congressional intent in this area.</P>
            <P>(h) Finally, it should be noted that self-regulatory organizations and industry associations will have a significant role in this area. Such organizations may have separate ethics and proficiency standards, including ethics training and testing programs, for their own members.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix C to Part 3—Guidance on the Application of § 3.3(e), Chief Compliance Officer Annual Report Form and Content</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Description of the Registrant's WPPs (§ 3.3(e)(1))</HD>
            <P>In acknowledgment of the large number of WPPs that a Registrant implements to comply with CFTC regulations, the Commission understands that for purposes of the CCO Annual Report, specific WPP descriptions may be appropriately brief while still identifying the basic purpose of the policy or procedure and how the policy or procedure operates to achieve that purpose. The CCO Annual Report should include a summary overview that describes the general forms and types of WPPs the Registrant has, such as a compliance manual specific to the Registrant, global corporate manuals or policies, and/or business-unit-specific WPPs that support the applicable regulatory requirements. This summary overview would provide a narrative of the Registrant's system or program of WPPs, how they work as a whole, and how the Registrant generally puts the WPPs into practice as part of its compliance activities. With respect to the COI policy, it is the Commission's view that the CCO should describe the COI policy specific to the Registrant, addressing the specific requirements of § 1.71 or § 23.605 of this chapter, as applicable.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Assessment of the Effectiveness of the Policies and Procedures (§ 3.3(e)(2))</HD>

            <P>The Commission expects a CCO Annual Report to contain a comprehensive discussion of: the assessment process; and the results of the effectiveness assessment. The regulation does not dictate the form or manner for the <PRTPAGE P="227"/>effectiveness assessment. Rather, the Commission would expect each Registrant to follow a process and present the resulting assessment in a form and manner that is appropriate for the size and complexity of the Registrant's applicable business activities and structure. While § 3.3(e)(2) no longer has a “requirement-by-requirement” standard, the CCO Annual Report should address all of the general areas of regulation applicable to the Registrant.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Areas for Improvement and Recommended Changes (§ 3.3(e)(3))</HD>
            <P>1. Section 3.3(e)(3) requires two components in the CCO Annual Report: an identification and discussion of each area that needs improvement; and a discussion of what changes are recommended to address each area needing improvement. In addressing these two elements, the CCO Annual Report should include, as applicable: A discussion of why the particular area needs improvement; a discussion of the proposed improvements and the time frame for their implementation; and a cross-reference to the regulation that a recommended change would address.</P>
            <P>2. In general, identifying areas in need of improvement and recommending steps to effect those improvements should be a core function of compliance. Accordingly, a CCO Annual Report that makes no recommendations for changes or improvements to the compliance program may raise concerns about the adequacy of the compliance program review intended by the CCO Annual Report process. Moreover, there should be continuity from one reporting cycle to the next, such that where a previous CCO Annual Report discussed future changes or improvements that were being considered or planned, subsequent CCO Annual Reports should discuss the outcomes of the changes that were implemented during the most recent scope period, any monitoring or testing of those changes, whether any compliance issues arose from the changes and, if there were any issues, how those issues were handled. While this section may address improvements to the compliance program that have already been completed, the Commission believes that this section primarily should discuss recommended improvements in process and/or future plans to improve the Registrant's compliance program or resources devoted to compliance.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Resources Set Aside for Compliance (§ 3.3(e)(4))</HD>

            <P>1. The resources description required by § 3.3(e)(4) should be appropriate for assisting the Registrant's senior management and the CFTC in assessing whether sufficient resources are dedicated to compliance. Accordingly, the description should include the following types of information: the budget allocated to the compliance department of the Registrant for compliance with the CEA and Commission regulations; full-time compliance staffing levels for such compliance activities; partially allocated staff counts (if applicable), with information on how much of such employees' time is devoted to the Registrant's compliance matters that are subject to CFTC oversight; an explanation of managerial resources (the explanation should clearly identify the division between staffing resources and management resources devoted to compliance); general infrastructure information (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> computers, compliance-oriented software, technology infrastructure, etc.); and if applicable, a description of the use of third party vendors or outsourcing for compliance activities. In most cases, to effectively inform the board of directors or senior officer and the Commission, the description should include quantifiable information for the financial, managerial, operational, and staffing resources allocated to compliance with the CEA and Commission regulations.</P>
            <P>2. The Commission understands that a discussion of specific compliance budget allocations may not be as straightforward as described above depending on the size and complexity of the Registrant's compliance program and the extent to which the Registrant's compliance resources may be shared for other non-CFTC regulated business activities. The purpose of the CCO Annual Report requirement is to convey to senior management and the CFTC a clear understanding of the resources the Registrant has set aside for compliance with the CEA and Commission regulations. While some of the compliance resources used in a Registrant's CFTC compliance-related program may be used for compliance activities in other parts of a larger corporate enterprise, this sharing of resources does not negate the Registrant's obligation to discuss how the Registrant's compliance program is being resourced. For those instances where compliance resources are shared, it is recognized that the description of the shared resources may reasonably be more general in nature, providing approximations and estimates based on expected needs. However, the Commission expects that the CCO Annual Report will still address shared resources in as much detail as is necessary to convey the information needed to assess the overall compliance activities of the Registrant.</P>

            <P>3. Section 3.3(e)(4) also requires that the CCO Annual Report include a discussion of any material deficiencies in compliance resources. If there have been reductions in the compliance program of the Registrant since the prior reporting period, for example, if there has been a reduction in compliance <PRTPAGE P="228"/>staff, a significant compliance budget decrease, or the Registrant initiated significant new business activities without a corresponding increase in compliance resources, the CCO Annual Report should include an explanation of why the compliance resources are not deficient in light of the changes. If there are no material deficiencies in the resources devoted to compliance, the Commission recommends that the CCO Annual Report contain an express statement to that effect so that the recipients of the report can see that the requirement was assessed.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Material Noncompliance Issues (§ 3.3(e)(5))</HD>
            <P>The CCO Annual Report should include an explanation of the standard the Registrant used to determine a non-compliance event's materiality. In addition, this section of the CCO Annual Report should contain a description of each material non-compliance issue identified either through self-assessment procedures conducted within the Registrant, or noted by any external entities which conducted a review of the Registrant (such as a designated self-regulatory organization). The description should also include the corresponding actions taken, described in reasonable detail, as well as specific references to the Commission regulation or regulations that are implicated by the non-compliance event. Specifically, the Commission recommends that the CCO Annual Report include a discussion of the Registrant's deliberations on a course of remediation, how the implementation of the remediation is being or was executed, any follow-up testing of the remediation, and any noteworthy results from such testing. Additionally, the Commission recommends that CCOs consider including an overview of how the CCO or compliance department handles and tracks non-compliance events in general.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Material Changes to WPPs (§ 3.3(e)(6))</HD>
            <P>When describing any material changes to the WPPs, a description of the standard of materiality used should be provided. This description will provide meaningful context for any reported changes to the WPPs.</P>

            <P>(i) Will disclose in writing to each participant, whether existing or prospective, that the qualifying entity is operated by a person who has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term “commodity pool operator” under the Act and, therefore, who is not subject to registration or regulation as a pool operator under the Act; <E T="03">Provided</E>, that such disclosure is made in accordance with the requirements of any other federal or state regulatory authority to which the qualifying entity is subject.

            <P>(B) The aggregate net notional value of commodity futures, commodity options contracts, or swaps positions not used solely for bona fide hedging purposes within the meaning and intent of the definition of bona fide hedging transactions and positions for excluded commodities in §§ 1.3 and 151.5 of this chapter determined at the time the most recent position was established, does not exceed 100 percent of the liquidation value of the pool's portfolio, after taking into account unrealized profits and unrealized losses on any such positions it has entered into. For purposes of this paragraph:</P>

            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The person may net futures contracts with the same underlying commodity across designated contract markets and foreign boards of trade; and swaps cleared on the same designated clearing organization where appropriate; and (C) Will not be, and has not been, marketing participations to the public as or in a commodity pool or otherwise as or in a vehicle for trading in the commodity futures, commodity options, or swaps markets.</P>
            <P>(3) The notice of eligibility must be filed with the National Futures Association prior to the date upon which such person intends to operate the qualifying entity pursuant to the exclusion provided by this section.</P>
            <P>(4) The notice of eligibility shall be effective upon filing.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Annual notice.</E> Each person who has filed a notice of exclusion under this section must affirm on an annual basis the notice of exemption from registration, withdraw such exemption due to the cessation of activities requiring registration or exemption therefrom, or withdraw such exemption and apply for registration within 60 days of the calendar year end through National Futures Association's electronic exemption filing system.</P>

            <P>(d)(1) Each person who has claimed an exclusion hereunder must, in the <PRTPAGE P="232"/>event that any of the information contained or representations made in the notice of eligibility becomes inaccurate or incomplete, amend the notice electronically through National Futures Association's electronic exemption filing system as may be necessary to render the notice of eligibility accurate and complete.</P>
            <P>(2) This amendment required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be filed within fifteen business days after the occurrence of such event.</P>
            <P>(e) An exclusion claimed hereunder shall cease to be effective upon any change which would render:</P>
            <P>(1) A person as to whom such exclusion has been claimed ineligible under paragraph (a) of this section;</P>
            <P>(2) The entity for which such exclusion has been claimed ineligible under paragraph (b) of this section; or</P>
            <P>(3) Either the representations made pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section inaccurate or the continuation of such representations false or misleading.</P>
            <P>(f) Any notice required to be filed hereunder must be filed by a representative duly authorized to bind the person specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(g) The filing of a notice of eligibility or the application of “non-pool status” under this section will not affect the ability of a person to qualify for an exemption from registration as a commodity pool operator under § 4.13 in connection with the operation of another trading vehicle that is not covered under this § 4.5.</P>

For the purpose of this paragraph:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The term “notional value” shall be calculated for each futures position by multiplying the number of contracts by the size of the contract, in contract units (taking into account any multiplier specified in the contract), by the current market price per unit, for each such option position by multiplying the number of contracts by the size of the contract, adjusted by its delta, in contract units (taking into account any multiplier specified in the contract), by the strike price per unit, for each such retail forex transaction, by calculating the value in U.S. Dollars of such transaction, at the time the transaction was established, excluding for this purpose the value in U.S. Dollars of offsetting long and short transactions, if any, and for any cleared swap by the value as determined consistent with the terms of 17 CFR part 45; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The person may net futures contracts with the same underlying commodity across designated contract markets and foreign boards of trade; and swaps cleared on the same derivatives clearing organization where appropriate; and</P>

            <P>(A) An “accredited investor,” as that term is defined in § 230.501 of this title;</P>
            <P>(B) A trust that is not an accredited investor but that was formed by an accredited investor for the benefit of a family member;</P>

            <P>(E) A person eligible to participate in a pool for which the pool operator can claim exemption from registration under paragraph (a)(4) of this section; and</P>

            <P>(ii) The person has no power or authority to manage or control the operations or activities of the pool except as necessary to comply with such requirement; and</P>

            <P>(5) Appropriate footnote disclosure and such further material information as may be necessary to make the required statements not misleading. For a pool that invests in other funds, this information must include, but is not limited to, separately disclosing the amounts of income, management and incentive fees associated with each investment in an investee fund that exceeds five percent of the pool's net assets. The management and incentive fees associated with an investment in an investee fund that is less than five percent of the pool's net assets may be combined and reported in the aggregate with the income, management and incentive fees of other investee funds that, individually, represent an investment of less than five percent of the pool's net assets. If the commodity pool operator is not able to obtain the specific amounts of management and incentive fees charged by an investee fund, the commodity pool operator must disclose the percentage amounts and computational basis for each such fee and include a statement that the CPO is not able to obtain the specific fee amounts for this fund;</P>
            <P>(6) Where the pool is comprised of more than one ownership class or series, information for the series or class on which the financial statements are reporting should be presented in addition to the information presented for the pool as a whole; except that, for a pool that is a series fund structured with a limitation on liability among the different series, the financial statements are not required to include consolidated information for all series.</P>

            <P>(i) Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets for the period between—</P>
            <P>(A) The later of:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The date of the most recent Statement of Financial Condition filed with the National Futures Association pursuant to this paragraph (c); or</P>

            <P>(B) The close of the pool's fiscal year or the date of the cessation of trading, whichever is earlier; and</P>
            <P>(ii)(A) An explanation of the winding down of the pool's operations and written disclosure that all interests in, and assets of, the pool have been redeemed, distributed or transferred on behalf of the participants;</P>

            <P>(C) If the commodity pool operator will not be able to liquidate the pool's assets in sufficient time to prepare, file and distribute the final annual report for the pool within 90 days of the permanent cessation of trading, the commodity pool operator must provide written notice to each participant and to National Futures Association disclosing:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The value of investments remaining to be liquidated, the timeframe within which liquidation is expected to occur, any impediments to liquidation, and the nature and amount of any fees and expenses that will be charged to the pool prior to the final distribution of the pool's funds;<PRTPAGE P="258"/>
            </P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Which financial reports the commodity pool operator will continue to provide to pool participants from the time that trading ceased until the final annual report is distributed, and the frequency with which such reports will be provided, pursuant to the pool's operative documents; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The timeframe within which the commodity pool operator will provide the final report.</P>
            <P>(iii) A report filed pursuant to paragraph (c)(7) of this section that would otherwise be required by paragraph (c) of this section is not required to be audited in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section if the commodity pool operator:</P>
            <P>(A) Obtains a written waiver of their right to receive an audited Annual Report from each participant other than the pool operator, the pool's commodity trading advisor, any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the pool operator or trading advisor, and any principal of the foregoing; and</P>

The commodity pool operator must maintain the waivers in accordance with § 4.23 and must make the waivers available to the Commission or National Futures Association upon request. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, the relief made available by this paragraph (c)(7)(iii) will not be available where the commodity pool operator has not previously distributed an audited Annual Report to pool participants and submitted an audited Annual Report to the National Futures Association.</P>

            <P>(8) For the purpose of the Annual Report distribution requirement, including any annual report distributed pursuant to § 4.7(b)(3) or 4.12(b)(2)(iii), the term “participant” does not include a commodity pool operated by a pool operator that is the same as, or that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the pool operator of a pool in which the commodity pool has invested; <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the Annual Report of such investing pool contain financial statements that include such information as the Commission may specify concerning the operations of the pool in which the commodity pool has invested.</P>

            <P>(2)(i) Where a commodity pool is organized in a jurisdiction other than the United States, the financial statements in the Annual Report required by this <PRTPAGE P="259"/>section or by § 4.7(b)(3) may be presented and computed in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles, standards or practices followed in such other jurisdiction; <E T="03">Provided,</E> That:</P>
            <P>(A) The other jurisdiction follows accounting principles, standards or practices set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section and the Annual Report presents and computes the financial statements of the pool in accordance with the applicable accounting principles, standards or practices followed by such other jurisdiction;</P>
            <P>(B) The Annual Report includes a condensed schedule of investments, or, if required by the applicable accounting principles, standards or practices followed by such other jurisdiction, a full schedule of investments;</P>
            <P>(C) The Annual Report reports special allocations of ownership equity in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section;</P>
            <P>(D) The Disclosure Document or offering memorandum for the pool identifies the accounting principles, standards or practices of the other jurisdiction pursuant to which the Annual Report presents and computes the financial statements of the pool; and</P>
            <P>(E) Where the accounting principles, standards or practices of the other jurisdiction require consolidated financial statements for the pool, such as a feeder fund consolidating with its master fund, all applicable disclosures required by United States generally accepted accounting principles for the feeder fund must be presented with the reporting pool's consolidated financial statements.</P>

            <P>(ii) For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the following alternative accounting principles, standards or practices may be employed in the preparation and computation of the financial statements in the Annual Report of the commodity pool; <E T="03">Provided,</E> That any such alternative accounting principles, standards or practices so employed are those followed by the jurisdiction other than the United States in which the commodity pool is organized:</P>
            <P>(A) International Financial Reporting Standards;</P>

            <P>(iii) To claim the relief available under this paragraph (d)(2), a commodity pool operator must file a notice with the National Futures Association within 90 calendar days after the end of the pool's first fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(A) The notice must contain: The name, main business address, main telephone number and National Futures Association registration identification number of the commodity pool operator; the name and identification number of the commodity pool for which the pool operator is claiming relief; and the alternative accounting principles, standards or practices pursuant to which the financial statements in the Annual Report will be presented and computed;</P>
            <P>(B) The notice must include a representation that the commodity pool operator complies with each of the conditions specified in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A) through (D) of this section and, if applicable, paragraph (d)(2)(i)(E) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(C) The notice must be signed by the commodity pool operator in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e)(1) The Statement of Operations required by this section must itemize brokerage commissions, management fees, advisory fees, incentive fees, interest income and expense, total realized net gain or loss from commodity interest trading, and change in unrealized net gain or loss on commodity interest positions during the pool's fiscal year. Gains and losses on commodity interests need not be itemized by commodity or by specific delivery or expiration date.</P>

            <P>(2)(i) Any share of a pool's profits or transfer of a pool's equity which exceeds the general partner's or any other class's share of profits computed on the general partner's or other class's pro rata capital contribution are “special allocations.” Special allocations of partnership equity or other interests must be recognized in the <PRTPAGE P="260"/>pool's Statement of Operations in the same period as the net income, interest income, or other basis of computation of the special allocation is recognized. Special allocations must be recognized and classified either as an expense of the pool or, if not recognized as an expense of the pool, presented in the Statement of Operations as a separate, itemized allocation of the pool's net income to arrive at net income available for pro rata distribution to all partners.</P>
            <P>(ii) Special allocations of ownership interest also must be reported separately in the Statement of Partners' Equity, in addition to the pro-rata allocations of net income, as to each class of ownership interest.</P>
            <P>(3) Realized gains or losses on regulated commodities transactions presented in the Statement of Operations of a commodity pool may be combined with realized gains or losses from trading in non-commodity interest transactions, provided that the gains or losses to be combined are part of a related trading strategy.

            <P>(B) State the reasons for the requested extension;</P>

            <P>(B) Do you have any indication from the part of your audit completed to date that would lead you to believe that the commodity pool operator was or is not meeting the recordkeeping requirements of this part 4 or was or is not complying with the § 4.20(c) prohibition on commingling of property of any pool with the property of any other person?</P>
            <P>(iii) Within ten calendar days after receipt of an application for an extension of time, the National Futures Association shall:</P>

            <P>(A) The pool for which the Annual Report is being prepared has investments in one or more collective investment vehicles (the “Investments”);</P>
            <P>(B) For all reports prepared under paragraph (c) of this section and for reports prepared under § 4.7(b)(3)(i) that are audited by an independent public accountant, the commodity pool operator has been informed by the independent public accountant engaged to audit the commodity pool's financial statements that specified information required to complete the pool's annual report is necessary in order for the accountant to render an opinion on the commodity pool's financial statements.

            <P>(2)(i) If a commodity pool operator elects a fiscal year other than the calendar year, it must give written notice of the election to all participants and must file the notice with the National Futures Association within 90 calendar days after the date of the pool's formation. If this notice is not given, the pool operator will be deemed to have elected the calendar year as the pool's fiscal year.</P>

              <P>THE RISK OF LOSS IN TRADING COMMODITY INTERESTS CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL. YOU SHOULD THEREFORE CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER SUCH TRADING IS SUITABLE FOR YOU IN LIGHT OF YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN CONSIDERING WHETHER TO TRADE OR TO AUTHORIZE SOMEONE ELSE TO TRADE FOR YOU, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING:</P>
              <P>IF YOU PURCHASE A COMMODITY OPTION YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE PREMIUM AND OF ALL TRANSACTION COSTS.</P>
              <P>IF YOU PURCHASE OR SELL A COMMODITY FUTURES CONTRACT OR SELL A COMMODITY OPTION OR ENGAGE IN OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRADING YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE INITIAL MARGIN FUNDS OR SECURITY DEPOSIT AND ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT YOU DEPOSIT WITH YOUR BROKER TO ESTABLISH OR MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION. IF THE MARKET MOVES AGAINST YOUR POSITION, YOU MAY BE CALLED UPON BY YOUR BROKER TO DEPOSIT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL MARGIN FUNDS, ON SHORT NOTICE, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION. IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE THE REQUESTED FUNDS WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED TIME, YOUR POSITION MAY BE LIQUIDATED AT A LOSS, AND YOU WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY RESULTING DEFICIT IN YOUR ACCOUNT.</P>
              <P>UNDER CERTAIN MARKET CONDITIONS, YOU MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO LIQUIDATE A POSITION. THIS CAN OCCUR, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THE MARKET MAKES A “LIMIT MOVE.”</P>
              <P>THE PLACEMENT OF CONTINGENT ORDERS BY YOU OR YOUR TRADING ADVISOR, SUCH AS A “STOP-LOSS” OR “STOP-LIMIT” ORDER, WILL NOT NECESSARILY LIMIT YOUR LOSSES TO THE INTENDED AMOUNTS, SINCE MARKET CONDITIONS MAY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO EXECUTE SUCH ORDERS.</P>
              <P>A “SPREAD” POSITION MAY NOT BE LESS RISKY THAN A SIMPLE “LONG” OR “SHORT” POSITION.</P>

              <P>THE HIGH DEGREE OF LEVERAGE THAT IS OFTEN OBTAINABLE IN COMMODITY INTEREST TRADING CAN WORK AGAINST YOU AS WELL AS FOR YOU. THE USE OF LEVERAGE CAN LEAD TO LARGE LOSSES AS WELL AS GAINS.<PRTPAGE P="281"/>
              </P>
              <P>IN SOME CASES, MANAGED COMMODITY ACCOUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL CHARGES FOR MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY FEES.

THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT CONTAINS, AT PAGE (insert page number), A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF EACH FEE TO BE CHARGED TO YOUR ACCOUNT BY THE COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR.</P>

            <EXTRACT>
              <P>YOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT THIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR MAY ENGAGE IN TRADING FOREIGN FUTURES OR OPTIONS CONTRACTS. TRANSACTIONS ON MARKETS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING MARKETS FORMALLY LINKED TO A UNITED STATES MARKET MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS WHICH OFFER DIFFERENT OR DIMINISHED PROTECTION. FURTHER, UNITED STATES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPEL THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OR MARKETS IN NON-UNITED STATES JURISDICTIONS WHERE YOUR TRANSACTIONS MAY BE EFFECTED. BEFORE YOU TRADE YOU SHOULD INQUIRE ABOUT ANY RULES RELEVANT TO YOUR PARTICULAR CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS AND ASK THE FIRM WITH WHICH YOU INTEND TO TRADE FOR DETAILS ABOUT THE TYPES OF REDRESS AVAILABLE IN BOTH YOUR LOCAL AND OTHER RELEVANT JURISDICTIONS.</P>

              <P>YOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT THIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR MAY ENGAGE IN OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRADING. SUCH TRADING IS NOT CONDUCTED IN THE INTERBANK MARKET.

IF THE COUNTERPARTY BECOMES INSOLVENT AND YOU HAVE A CLAIM FOR AMOUNTS DEPOSITED OR PROFITS EARNED ON TRANSACTIONS WITH THE COUNTERPARTY, YOUR CLAIM MAY NOT BE TREATED AS A COMMODITY CUSTOMER CLAIM FOR PURPOSES OF SUBCHAPTER IV OF CHAPTER 7 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE AND REGULATIONS THEREUNDER.

              <P>THIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR IS PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM ACCEPTING FUNDS IN THE TRADING ADVISOR'S NAME FROM A CLIENT FOR TRADING COMMODITY INTERESTS.

            <EXTRACT>

              <P>SWAPS TRANSACTIONS, LIKE OTHER FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS, INVOLVE A VARIETY OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS. THE SPECIFIC RISKS PRESENTED BY A PARTICULAR SWAP TRANSACTION NECESSARILY DEPEND UPON THE TERMS OF <PRTPAGE P="282"/>THE TRANSACTION AND YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES. IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, ALL SWAPS TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE SOME COMBINATION OF MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK, FUNDING RISK, AND OPERATIONAL RISK.</P>
              <P>HIGHLY CUSTOMIZED SWAPS TRANSACTIONS IN PARTICULAR MAY INCREASE LIQUIDITY RISK, WHICH MAY RESULT IN YOUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW YOUR FUNDS BEING LIMITED. HIGHLY LEVERAGED TRANSACTIONS MAY EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL GAINS OR LOSSES IN VALUE AS A RESULT OF RELATIVELY SMALL CHANGES IN THE VALUE OR LEVEL OF AN UNDERLYING OR RELATED MARKET FACTOR.</P>
              <P>IN EVALUATING THE RISKS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH A PARTICULAR SWAP TRANSACTION, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THAT A SWAP TRANSACTION MAY BE MODIFIED OR TERMINATED ONLY BY MUTUAL CONSENT OF THE ORIGINAL PARTIES AND SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED TERMS. THEREFORE, IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO MODIFY, TERMINATE, OR OFFSET YOUR OBLIGATIONS OR YOUR EXPOSURE TO THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH A TRANSACTION PRIOR TO ITS SCHEDULED TERMINATION DATE.</P>

            <P>(i) The following statement: “These results are based on simulated or hypothetical performance results that have certain inherent limitations. Unlike the results shown in an actual performance record, these results do not represent actual trading. Also, because these trades have not actually been executed, these results may have under-or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated or hypothetical trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made <PRTPAGE P="288"/>that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to these being shown.” ; or</P>
            <P>(ii) A statement prescribed pursuant to rules promulgated by a registered futures association pursuant to section 17(j) of the Act.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix B to Part 4—Adjustments for Additions and Withdrawals in the Computation of Rate of Return</HD>
            <P>This appendix provides guidance concerning alternate methods by which commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors may calculate the rate of return information required by Rules 4.25(a)(7)(i)(F) and 4.35(a)(6)(i)(F). The methods described herein are illustrative of calculation methods the Commission has reviewed and determined may be appropriate to address potential material distortions in the computation of rate of return due to additions and withdrawals that occur during a performance reporting period. A commodity pool operator or commodity trading advisor may present to the Commission proposals regarding any alternative method of addressing the effect of additions and withdrawals on the rate of return computation, including documentation supporting the rationale for use of that alternate method.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Compounded Rate of Return Method</HD>
            <P>Rate of return for a period may be calculated by computing the net performance divided by the beginning net asset value for each trading day in the period and compounding each daily rate of return to determine the rate of return for the period. If daily compounding is not practicable, the rate of return may be compounded on the basis of each sub-period within which an addition or withdrawal occurs during a month. For example:</P>

            <P>Time-weighting allows for adjustment to the denominator of the rate of return calculation for additions and withdrawals, weighted for the amount of time such funds were available during the period. Several methods exist for time-weighting, all of which will have the same arithmetic result. These methods include: dividing the net performance by the average weighted account <PRTPAGE P="340"/>sizes for the month; dividing the net performance by the arithmetic mean of the account sizes for each trading day during the period; and taking the number of days funds were available for trading divided by the total number of days in the period.</P>

          <EXTRACT>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">RISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT</HD>

            <P>OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE THE LEVERAGED TRADING OF CONTRACTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY CONDUCTED WITH A FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT OR A RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEALER AS YOUR <PRTPAGE P="348"/>COUNTERPARTY. BECAUSE OF THE LEVERAGE AND THE OTHER RISKS DISCLOSED HERE, YOU CAN RAPIDLY LOSE ALL OF THE FUNDS YOU DEPOSIT FOR SUCH TRADING AND YOU MAY LOSE MORE THAN YOU DEPOSIT.</P>
            <P>YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF AND CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING POINTS BEFORE DETERMINING WHETHER SUCH TRADING IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOU.</P>
            <P>(1) TRADING IS NOT ON A REGULATED MARKET OR EXCHANGE—YOUR DEALER IS YOUR TRADING PARTNER WHICH IS A DIRECT CONFLICT OF INTEREST. BEFORE YOU ENGAGE IN ANY RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING, YOU SHOULD CONFIRM THE REGISTRATION STATUS OF YOUR COUNTERPARTY.</P>
            <P>The off-exchange foreign currency trading you are entering into is not conducted on an interbank market, nor is it conducted on a futures exchange subject to regulation as a designated contract market by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The foreign currency trades you transact are trades with the futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer as your counterparty. WHEN YOU SELL, THE DEALER IS THE BUYER. WHEN YOU BUY, THE DEALER IS THE SELLER. As a result, when you lose money trading, your dealer is making money on such trades, in addition to any fees, commissions, or spreads the dealer may charge.</P>
            <P>(2) AN ELECTRONIC TRADING PLATFORM FOR RETAIL FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS IS NOT AN EXCHANGE. IT IS AN ELECTRONIC CONNECTION FOR ACCESSING YOUR DEALER. THE TERMS OF AVAILABILITY OF SUCH A PLATFORM ARE GOVERNED ONLY BY YOUR CONTRACT WITH YOUR DEALER.</P>
            <P>Any trading platform that you may use to enter off-exchange foreign currency transactions is only connected to your futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer. You are accessing that trading platform only to transact with your dealer. You are not trading with any other entities or customers of the dealer by accessing such platform. The availability and operation of any such platform, including the consequences of the unavailability of the trading platform for any reason, is governed only by the terms of your account agreement with the dealer.</P>
            <P>(3) YOUR DEPOSITS WITH THE DEALER HAVE NO REGULATORY PROTECTIONS.</P>
            <P>All of your rights associated with your retail forex trading, including the manner and denomination of any payments made to you, are governed by the contract terms established in your account agreement with the futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer. Funds deposited by you with a futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer for trading off-exchange foreign currency transactions are not subject to the customer funds protections provided to customers trading on a contract market that is designated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Your dealer may commingle your funds with its own operating funds or use them for other purposes. In the event your dealer becomes bankrupt, any funds the dealer is holding for you in addition to any amounts owed to you resulting from trading, whether or not any assets are maintained in separate deposit accounts by the dealer, may be treated as an unsecured creditor's claim.</P>
            <P>(4) YOU ARE LIMITED TO YOUR DEALER TO OFFSET OR LIQUIDATE ANY TRADING POSITIONS SINCE THE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT MADE ON AN EXCHANGE OR MARKET, AND YOUR DEALER MAY SET ITS OWN PRICES.</P>
            <P>Your ability to close your transactions or offset positions is limited to what your dealer will offer to you, as there is no other market for these transactions. Your dealer may offer any prices it wishes, and it may offer prices derived from outside sources or not in its discretion. Your dealer may establish its prices by offering spreads from third party prices, but it is under no obligation to do so or to continue to do so. Your dealer may offer different prices to different customers at any point in time on its own terms. The terms of your account agreement alone govern the obligations your dealer has to you to offer prices and offer offset or liquidating transactions in your account and make any payments to you. The prices offered by your dealer may or may not reflect prices available elsewhere at any exchange, interbank, or other market for foreign currency.</P>
            <P>(5) PAID SOLICITORS MAY HAVE UNDISCLOSED CONFLICTS</P>
            <P>The futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer may compensate introducing brokers for introducing your account in ways which are not disclosed to you. Such paid solicitors are not required to have, and may not have, any special expertise in trading, and may have conflicts of interest based on the method by which they are compensated. Solicitors working on behalf of futures commission merchants and retail foreign exchange dealers are required to register. You should confirm that they are, in fact registered. You should thoroughly investigate the manner in which all such solicitors are compensated and be very cautious in granting any person or entity authority to trade on your behalf. You should always consider obtaining dated written confirmation of any information you are relying on from your dealer or a solicitor in making any trading or account decisions.</P>

            <P>FINALLY, YOU SHOULD THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE ANY STATEMENTS BY <PRTPAGE P="349"/>ANY DEALERS OR SALES REPRESENTATIVES WHICH MINIMIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF, OR CONTRADICT, ANY OF THE TERMS OF THIS RISK DISCLOSURE. SUCH STATEMENTS MAY INDICATE POTENTIAL SALES FRAUD.</P>
            <P>THIS BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT, OF COURSE, DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF TRADING OFF-EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS WITH A FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT OR RETAIL FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEALER.</P>

            <P>I hereby acknowledge that I have received and understood this risk disclosure statement.

          <P>(iii) The percentage of such accounts that were not profitable during the quarter.</P>
          <P>(2) Identification of retail forex customer accounts for the purpose of this disclosure and the calculation in determining whether each such account was profitable or not profitable must be made in accordance with § 5.18(i) of this part. Such statement of profitable trades shall include the following legend: PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Each retail foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant shall provide, upon request, to any retail forex customer or prospective retail forex customer the total number of non discretionary retail forex accounts maintained by such foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant, the percentage of such accounts that were profitable and the percentage of such accounts that were not profitable, calculated in accordance with § 5.18(i) of this part, for each calendar quarter during the most recent five year period during which such retail foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant maintained non discretionary retail forex customer accounts.</P>

          <P>(2) Provide together with such notice documentation in such form as necessary to adequately reflect the applicant's or registrant's capital condition <PRTPAGE P="350"/>as of any date such person's adjusted net capital is less than the minimum required. The applicant or registrant must provide similar documentation for other days as the Commission may request.</P>
          <P>(b) Each applicant or registrant, who knows or should have known that its adjusted net capital at any time is less than the greatest of:</P>

          <P>(2) 110 percent of the amount required by § 5.7(a)(1)(i)(B) of this part; or</P>
          <P>(3) 110 percent of the amount of adjusted net capital required by a registered futures association of which the futures commission merchant or retail foreign exchange dealer is a member, must file written notice to that effect within 24 hours of such event.</P>
          <P>(c) If an applicant or registrant at any time fails to make or keep current the books and records required by these regulations, such applicant or registrant must, on the same day such event occurs, provide facsimile notice of such fact, specifying the books and records which have not been made or which are not current, and within 48 hours after giving such notice file a written report stating what steps have been and are being taken to correct the situation.</P>
          <P>(d) Whenever any applicant or registrant discovers or is notified by an independent public accountant, pursuant to § 1.16(e)(2) of this chapter, of the existence of any material inadequacy, as specified in § 1.16(d)(2) of this chapter, such applicant or registrant must give facsimile notice of such material inadequacy within 24 hours, and within 48 hours after giving such notice file a written report stating what steps have been and are being taken to correct the material inadequacy.</P>
          <P>(e) Whenever any self-regulatory organization learns that a member registrant has failed to file a notice or written report as required by § 5.6 of this part, that self-regulatory organization must immediately report this failure by telephone, confirmed in writing immediately by facsimile notice, as provided in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
          <P>(f) A retail foreign exchange dealer or a futures commission merchant offering or engaging in retail forex transactions shall provide written notice of a substantial reduction in capital as compared to that last reported in a financial report filed with the Commission pursuant to § 5.12 of this part. This notice shall be provided as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) If any event or series of events, including any withdrawal, advance, loan or loss cause, on a net basis, a reduction in net capital of 20 percent or more, notice must be provided within two business days of the event or series of events causing the reduction; and</P>
          <P>(2) If the equity capital of the retail foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant offering or engaging in retail forex transactions or the equity capital of a subsidiary or affiliate of the retail foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant offering or engaging in retail forex transactions consolidated pursuant to § 1.17(f) of this chapter would be withdrawn by action of a stockholder or a partner or a limited liability company member or by redemption or repurchase of shares of stock by any of the consolidated entities or through the payment of dividends or any similar distribution, or an unsecured advance or loan would be made to a stockholder, partner, sole proprietor, limited liability company member, employee or affiliate, such that the withdrawal, advance or loan would cause, on a net basis, a reduction in excess adjusted net capital of 30 percent or more, notice must be provided at least two business days prior to the withdrawal, advance or loan that would cause the reduction: Provided, however, That the provisions of paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section do not apply to any retail foreign exchange transaction in the ordinary course of business between a retail foreign exchange dealer and any affiliate where the retail foreign exchange dealer makes payment to or on behalf of such affiliate for such transaction and then receives payment from such affiliate for such transaction within two business days from the date of the transaction.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Time to file.</E> (1) Within ten days after the notice of the disciplinary or access denial action has been delivered in accordance with § 9.11 to a person disciplined or denied access, that person may petition the Commission to stay the disciplinary or access denial action pending consideration by the Commission of the notice of appeal and, if granted, the appeal underlying the notice of appeal. The petition for stay must be accompanied by the notice of appeal.</P>
            <P>(2) Within ten days after a notice of summary action has been delivered in accordance with § 9.12(b) to a person who is the subject of a summary action permitted by part 37, appendix B, Core Principle 2, paragraph (a)(14) of this chapter or part 38, appendix B, Core Principle 13, paragraph (a)(7) of this chapter (emergency disciplinary actions), that person may petition the Commission to stay the effectiveness of the summary action pending completion of the exchange proceeding.</P>
            <P>(3) The Commission may deny any petition for stay which is not timely filed or which is not otherwise in accord with these rules.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Contents of petition for stay.</E> A petition filed under this section must state the reasons that the stay is requested and the facts relied upon, as specified in § 9.20. Averments of the petition must be supported by affidavits, other sworn statements or copies thereof, or a stipulation as to those facts which are not in dispute. Based upon the petition, the Commission, in its discretion, may order a stay of the disciplinary action or access denial action.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Response to petition.</E> The exchange may serve and file a written response to any petition for a stay within five days after service of the petition.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Standards for granting petition for stay.</E> The Commission will promptly determine whether to grant or deny a <PRTPAGE P="383"/>petition for stay and may act upon a petition at any time, without waiting for a response thereto. In determining whether to grant or deny the petition for stay, the Commission will consider, among other things, whether the petitioner has established:</P>

            <P>(2) That denial of the stay would cause irreparable harm to the petitioner; and</P>
            <P>(3) That granting the stay would not endanger orderly trading or otherwise cause substantial harm to the exchange or market participants; and</P>
            <P>(4) That granting the stay would not be contrary to the Act, and the rules, regulations and orders of the Commission thereunder or otherwise contrary to the public interest.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Ex parte stays.</E> The Commission may act upon a petition for stay, without waiting for the exchange's response thereto only where petitioner:</P>

            <P>(2) Files a proof of service; and</P>
            <P>(3) Clearly establishes by affidavit that immediate and irreparable injury, loss or damage will result to the petitioner before the exchange can be heard in opposition.</P>
            <FP>Any order granting a stay prior to the filing of the exchange's reply will expire by its terms within such time after service of the Commission's ruling on the petition, not to exceed ten days, as the Commission fixes, unless within the time so fixed the order, for good cause shown, is extended for a like period or unless the exchange consents that it may be extended for a longer period. In any case, the exchange may move for dissolution or modification of the stay, and the Commission will proceed to determine such motion as expeditiously as the ends of justice require.</FP>

The exchange must promptly advise the person who is the subject of the disciplinary or access denial action of the Division's request. Within thirty days after service of the Division's request, the exchange must file the information requested with the Division in the manner requested by the Division and, upon request, deliver that information to the person who is the subject of the disciplinary or access denial action. Delivery to the person who is the subject of the disciplinary or access denial action must be in the manner prescribed by § 9.11(c).

When the investigation by the Division of Enforcement that led to the pending proceeding encompasses transactions, conduct or persons other than those involved in the proceeding, the requirements of (b)(1) of this section shall apply only to the particular transaction, conduct and persons involved in the proceeding.</P>

This index shall describe the nature of the withheld documents in a manner that, to the extent practicable without revealing any information that itself is privileged or protected from disclosure by law or these rules, will enable the other parties to assess the applicability of the privilege or protection claimed.<PRTPAGE P="398"/>
            </P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Arrangements for inspection and copying.</E> Upon request by the respondents, all documents subject to inspection and copying pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall be made available to the respondents at the Commission office nearest the location where the respondents or their counsel live or work. Otherwise, the documents shall be made available at the Commission office where they are ordinarily maintained or at any other location agreed upon by the parties in writing. Upon payment of the appropriate fees set forth in appendix B to part 145 of this chapter, any respondent may obtain a photocopy of any document made available for inspection. Without the prior written consent of the Division of Enforcement, no respondent shall have the right to take custody of any documents that are made available for inspection and copying, or to remove them from Commission premises.</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Witness statements</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Each party to an adjudicatory proceeding shall make available to the other parties any statement of any person whom the party calls, or expects to call, as a witness that relates to the anticipated testimony of the witness and is in the party's possession. Such statements shall include the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Transcripts of investigative, deposition, trial or similar testimony given by the witness,</P>
            <P>(ii) Written statements signed by the witness, and</P>
            <P>(iii) Substantially verbatim notes of interviews with the witness, and all exhibits to such transcripts, statements and notes. For purposes of this paragraph (c), “substantially verbatim notes” means notes that fairly record the exact words of the witness, subject to minor, inconsequential deviations. Such statements shall include memoranda and other writings authored by the witness that contain information relating to his anticipated testimony. The Division of Enforcement shall produce witness statements pursuant to this paragraph prior to the scheduled hearing date, at a time to be designated by the Administrative Law Judge. Respondents shall produce witness statements pursuant to this paragraph at the close of the Division's case in chief during the hearing. If necessary, the Administrative Law Judge shall, upon request, grant the Division a continuance of the hearing in order to review and analyze any witness statements produced by the respondents.</P>
            <P>(2) Nothing in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall limit the ability of a party to withhold documents or other information on the grounds of privilege, the work product doctrine or other protection from disclosure under applicable law.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Index of withheld documents.</E> When a party makes witness statements available pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, he or she shall furnish each of the other parties with an index of all documents that the party is withholding on the grounds of privilege or work product. This index shall describe the nature of the withheld documents in a manner that, to the extent practicable without revealing information that itself is privileged or protected from disclosure by law or these rules, will enable the other parties to assess the applicability of the privilege or protection claimed.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Failure to produce witness statements.</E> In the event that a party fails to <PRTPAGE P="399"/>make available witness statements subject to production pursuant to this section, no rehearing or reconsideration of a matter already heard or decided shall be required, unless another party demonstrates prejudice caused by the failure to make the witness statements available.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Modification of production requirements.</E> The Administrative Law Judge shall modify any of the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section that any party can show is unduly burdensome or is otherwise inappropriate under all the circumstances.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Admissions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Request for admissions.</E> Any party may serve upon any other party, with a copy to the Proceedings Clerk, a written request for admission of the truth of any facts relevant to the pending proceeding set forth in the request. Each matter of which an admission is requested shall be separately set forth. Unless prior written approval is obtained from the Administrative Law Judge, the number of requests shall not exceed 50 in number including all discrete parts and subparts.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Response.</E> A matter shall be considered to be admitted unless, within 15 days after service of the request, or within such other time as the Administrative Law Judge may allow, the party upon whom the request is directed serves upon the requesting party a sworn written answer or objection to the matter. If objection is made, the reasons therefor shall be stated. The response shall specifically deny the matter or set forth in detail the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter. A denial shall fairly meet the substance of the requested admission and when good faith requires that a party qualify his answer and deny only a part of the matter, he shall specify so much of it as is true and qualify or deny the remainder. An answering party may not give a lack of information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny unless he states that he has made reasonable inquiry and that the information known or reasonably available to him is insufficient to enable him to admit or deny. A party who considers that a matter of which an admission has been requested presents a genuine issue for trial may not, on that ground alone, object to the request; he may deny the matter or set forth reasons why he cannot admit or deny it.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Determining sufficiency of answers or objections.</E> The party who has requested the admissions may move to determine the sufficiency of the answers or objections. Unless the objecting party sustains his burden of showing that the objection is justified, the Administrative Law Judge shall order that an answer be served. If the Administrative Law Judge determines that an answer does not comply with the requirements of this rule, he may order either that the matter is admitted or that an amended answer be served.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Effect of admission.</E> Any matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established and may be used at a hearing as against the party who made the admission. However, the Administrative Law Judge may permit withdrawal or amendment when the presentation on the merits of the proceeding will be served thereby and the party who obtains the admission fails to satisfy the Administrative Law Judge that withdrawal or amendment will prejudice him in maintaining his action or defense on the merits.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Objections to authenticity or admissibility of documents</E>—(1) <E T="03">Identification of documents.</E> The Administrative Law Judge, acting on his or her own initiative or upon motion by any party, may direct each party to serve upon the other parties, with a copy to the Proceedings Clerk, a list identifying the documents that it intends to introduce at the hearing and requesting the other parties to file and serve a response disclosing any objection, together with the factual or legal grounds therefor, to the authenticity or admissibility of each document identified on the list. A copy of each document identified on the list shall be served with the request, unless the party being served already has the document in his possession or has reasonably ready access to it.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Objections to authenticity or admissibility.</E> Within 20 days after service or at such other time as may be designated by the Administrative Law Judge, each party upon whom the list <PRTPAGE P="400"/>described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section was served shall file a response disclosing any objection, together with the factual or legal grounds therefor, to the authenticity or admissibility of each document identified on the list. Except for relevance, waste of time or needless presentation of cumulative evidence, all objections not raised may be deemed waived.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Rulings on objections.</E> In his or her discretion, the Administrative Law Judge may treat as a motion in limine any list served by a party pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section, where any other party has filed a response objecting to the authenticity or the admissibility on any item listed. In that event, after affording the parties an opportunity to file briefs containing arguments on the motion to the degree necessary for a decision, the ALJ may rule on any objection to the authenticity or admissibility of any document identified on the list in advance of trial, to the extent appropriate.</P>

            <P>(3) During the taking of a deposition a party or deponent may request and obtain an adjournment to permit an application to be made to the Administrative Law Judge for an order suspending the deposition on grounds of bad faith in the conduct of the examination, annoyance, embarrassment, oppression of a deponent or party, or improper questions. An attorney who requests and obtains an adjournment for this purpose but fails, without good cause, promptly to apply for relief to the Administrative Law Judge may be found guilty of contemptuous conduct in accordance with § 10.11(b) of these rules.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Procedures for use of interrogatories.</E> (1) If depositions are to be taken and submitted on written interrogatories, the interrogatories shall be filed in triplicate with the application for deposition and served on the parties. Within ten days after service, any party may file, in triplicate, with the Proceedings Clerk, his objections, if any, to such interrogatories and may file such cross-interrogatories as he desires to submit. Other parties shall have ten days to file their objections to cross-interrogatories. Objections shall be settled by the Administrative Law Judge.</P>
            <P>(2) When a deposition is taken upon written interrogatories and cross-interrogatories, no party shall be present or represented and no person other than the witness, a stenographic reporter, and the officer shall be present. The officer shall propound the interrogatories and cross-interrogatories to the witness, and the interrogatories and responses thereto shall be transcribed and reduced to writing.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Use of depositions at hearing.</E> (1) Any part or all of a deposition, to the extent admissible under rules of evidence applied as though the witness were then present and testifying at the hearing, may be used against any party who had reasonable notice of the taking of the deposition, if the Administrative Law Judge finds that:</P>
            <P>(i) The witness is dead;</P>
            <P>(ii) The witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment;</P>
            <P>(iii) The witness is out of the United States at the time of the hearing, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition.</P>
            <P>(2) If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse party may require him to introduce any other part which ought in fairness to be considered with the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other parts.</P>
            <P>(3) Objection may be made at a hearing to receiving in evidence any deposition or part thereof for any reason which would require the exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then present and testifying.</P>

In the event that a party appears at the hearing and no party appears for the opposing side, the party who is present may present his evidence, in whole or in part, in the form of affidavits or by oral testimony, before the Administrative Law Judge.</P>
            <P>(2) A failure to appear at a hearing shall not constitute a waiver of a party's right to propose findings of fact based on the record in the proceeding, to propose conclusions of law or to submit briefs, in the manner provided in § 10.82, if the non-appearing party submits prior to the scheduled hearing or within three days thereafter, a notice of appearance indicating his intent to continue to participate in the proceeding.

Nothing in this paragraph limits the authority of the Commission or the Administrative Law Judge to exercise authority under other provisions of the Commission's rules, to enforce the requirement that evidence presented be relevant to the proceeding or to limit cross-examination to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Examination of witnesses.</E> All witnesses at a hearing for the purpose of taking evidence shall testify under oath or affirmation, which shall be administered by the Administrative Law Judge. A witness may be cross-examined by each adverse party and, in the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge, may be cross-examined, without regard to the scope of direct examination, as to any matter which is relevant to the issues in the proceeding.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Expert witnesses.</E> The Administrative Law Judge, at his discretion, may order that direct testimony of expert witnesses be made by verified written statement rather than presented orally at the hearing.

            <P>(ii) Any matter in the public official records of the Commission.</P>

If a party has had no opportunity to object to a ruling at the time it is made, he shall not thereafter be prejudiced by the absence of an objection.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> Formal exception to an adverse ruling is not required. It shall be sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling is sought or entered, makes known to the Administrative Law Judge the action he wishes the Administrative Law Judge to take or his objection to the action being taken and his grounds therefor.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Excluded evidence.</E> When an objection to a question propounded to a witness is sustained, the examining attorney may make a specific offer of what he expects to prove by the answer of the witness, or the Administrative Law Judge may, in his discretion, receive the evidence in full. Rejected exhibits, adequately marked for identification, shall be retained in the record so as to be available for consideration by any reviewing authority.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Affidavits.</E> Affidavits may be admitted by the Administrative Law Judge only if the evidence is otherwise admissible and the parties agree that affidavits may be used.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Official government records.</E> An official government record or any entry therein, when admissible for any purpose, may be evidenced by an official <PRTPAGE P="404"/>publication thereof or by a copy attested by the officer having legal custody of the record or by his deputy, accompanied by a certificate that such officer has custody. If the office in which the record is kept is within the United States the certificate may be made by a judge of a court of record in the district or political subdivision in which the record is kept, authenticated by the seal of his office. If the office in which the record is kept is in a foreign state or country, the certificate may be made by any officer in the Foreign Service of the United States stationed in the foreign state or country in which the record is kept and authenticated by the seal of his office. A written statement signed by an officer having custody of an official record or by his deputy, that after diligent search, no record or entry dealing with a specific matter is found to exist, accompanied by a certificate as provided above, is admissible as evidence that the records of his office contain no such record or entry.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Application for and issuance of subpoenas</E>—(1) <E T="03">Application for and issuance of subpoena ad testificandum.</E> Any party may apply to the Administrative Law Judge for the issuance of a subpoena requiring a person to appear and testify (subpoena ad testificandum) at the hearing. All requests for the issuance of a subpoena ad testificandum shall be submitted in duplicate and in writing and shall be served upon all other parties to the proceeding, unless the request is made on the record at the hearing or the requesting party can demonstrate why, in the interest of fairness or justice, the requirement of a written submission or service on one or more of the other parties is not appropriate. A subpoena ad testificandum shall be issued upon a showing by the requesting party of the general relevance of the testimony being sought and the tender of an original and two copies of the subpoena being requested, except in those situations described in paragraph (b) of this section, where additional requirements are set forth.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Application for subpoena duces tecum.</E> An application for a subpoena requiring a person to produce specified documentary or tangible evidence (subpoena duces tecum) at any designated time or place may be made by any party to the Administrative Law Judge. All requests for the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum shall be submitted in duplicate and in writing and shall be served upon all other parties to the proceeding, unless the request is made on the record at the hearing or the requesting party can demonstrate why, in the interest of fairness or justice, the requirement of a written submission or service on one or more of the other parties is not appropriate. Except in those situations described in paragraph (b) of this section, where additional requirements are set forth, each application for the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum shall contain a statement or showing of general relevance and reasonable scope of the evidence being sought and be accompanied by an original and two copies of the subpoena being requested, which shall describe the documentary or tangible evidence to be subpoenaed with as much particularity as is feasible.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Standards for issuance of subpoena duces tecum.</E> The Administrative Law Judge considering any application for a subpoena duces tecum shall issue the subpoena requested if he is satisfied the application complies with this section and the request is not unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope or unduly burdensome. No attempt shall be made to determine the admissibility of evidence in passing upon an application for a subpoena duces tecum and no detailed or burdensome showing shall be required as a condition to the issuance of any subpoena.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Denial of application.</E> In the event the Administrative Law Judge determines that a requested subpoena or any of its terms are unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he may refuse to issue the <PRTPAGE P="405"/>subpoena, or may issue it only upon such conditions as he determines fairness requires.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Special requirements relating to application for and issuance of subpoenas for commission records and for the appearance of commission employees or employees of other agencies</E>—(1) <E T="03">Form.</E> An application for the issuance of subpoena shall be made in the form of a written motion served upon all other parties, if the subpoena would require</P>
            <P>(i) The production of documents, papers, books, physical exhibits, or other material in the records of the Commission;</P>
            <P>(ii) The appearance of a Commissioner or an official or employee of the Commission;</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Content.</E> The motion shall specifically describe the material to be produced, the information to be disclosed, or the testimony to be elicited from the witness, and shall show</P>
            <P>(i) The relevance of the material, information, or testimony to the matters at issue in the proceeding;</P>
            <P>(ii) The reasonableness of the scope of the proposed subpoena; and</P>
            <P>(iii) That such material, information, or testimony is not available from other sources.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Rulings.</E> The motion shall be decided by the Administrative Law Judge and shall provide such terms or conditions for the production of the material, the disclosure of the information or the appearance of the witness as may appear necessary and appropriate for the protection of the public interest.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Commission review of rulings.</E> Interlocutory review by the Commission of a ruling made under this section may be sought in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 10.101 without certification by the Administrative Law Judge.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Motions to quash subpoenas; protective orders</E>—(1) <E T="03">Application.</E> Within 10 days after a subpoena has been served or at any time prior to the return date thereof, a motion to quash or modify the subpoena or for a protective order limiting the use or disclosure of any information, documents or testimony covered by the subpoena may be filed with the Administrative Law Judge who issued it. At the same time, a copy of the motion shall be served on the party who requested the subpoena and all other parties to the proceeding. The motion shall include a brief statement setting forth the basis for the requested relief. If the Administrative Law Judge to whom the motion has been directed has not acted upon the motion by the return date, the subpoena shall be stayed pending his or her final action.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Disposition.</E> After due notice to the person upon whose request the subpoena was issued, and after opportunity for response by that person, the Administrative Law Judge may (i) quash or modify the subpoena, or (ii) condition denial of the application to quash or modify the subpoena upon just and reasonable terms, including, in the case of a subpoena duces tecum, a requirement that the person in whose behalf the subpoena was issued shall advance the reasonable cost of producing documentary or other tangible evidence. The Administrative Law Judge may issue a protective order sought under paragraph (c)(1) of this section or under any other section of these rules upon a showing of good cause. In considering whether good cause exists to issue a protective order, the Administrative Law Judge shall weigh the harm resulting from disclosure against the benefits of disclosure. Good cause shall only be established upon a showing that the person seeking the protective order will suffer a clearly defined and serious injury if the order is not issued, provided, however, that any such injury shall be balanced against the public's right of access to judicial records. No protective order shall be granted that will prevent the Division of Enforcement or any respondent from adequate presenting its case.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Attendance and mileage fees.</E> Persons summoned to testify either by deposition or at a hearing under requirement of subpoena are entitled to the same fees and mileage as are paid to witnesses in the courts of the United States. Fees and mileage are paid by <PRTPAGE P="406"/>the party at whose instance the persons are called.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Service of subpoenas</E>—(1) <E T="03">How effected.</E> Service of a subpoena upon a party shall be made in accordance with § 10.12(a) of these rules except that only one copy of a subpoena need be served. Service of a subpoena upon any other person shall be made by delivering a copy of the subpoena to him as provided in paragraphs (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section, as applicable, and by tendering to him or her the fees for one day's attendance and mileage as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. When the subpoena is issued at the instance of the Commission, fees and mileage need not be tendered at the time of service.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Service upon a natural person.</E> Delivery of a copy of a subpoena and tender of the fees to a natural person may be effected by</P>
            <P>(i) Handing them to the person;</P>
            <P>(ii) Leaving them at his office with the person in charge thereof or, if there is no one in charge, by leaving them in a conspicuous place therein;</P>
            <P>(iii) Leaving them at his dwelling place or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein;</P>
            <P>(iv) Mailing them by registered or certified mail to him at his last known address; or</P>
            <P>(v) Any other method whereby actual notice is given to him and the fees and mileage are timely made available.</P>

            <P>(f) <E T="03">Enforcement of subpoenas.</E> Upon failure of any person to comply with a subpoena issued at the request of a party, that party may petition the Commission in its discretion to institute an action in an appropriate U.S. District Court for enforcement of that subpoena. When instituting an action to enforce a subpoena requested by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission, in its discretion, may delegate to the Director of the Division or any Commission employee designated by the Director and acting under his or her direction, or to any other employee of the Commission, authority to serve as the Commission's counsel in such subpoena enforcement action.</P>

Such motion shall be filed at or before the first prehearing conference or at such later time as may be allowed by the Administrative Law Judge. Any adverse party within 20 days after service of the motion, may serve opposing papers or may countermove for summary disposition.</P>

The motion may also be supported by briefs containing points and authorities in support of the contention of the party making the motion. When a motion is made and supported as provided in this section, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations, but shall serve and file in response a statement setting forth those material facts as to which he contends a genuine issue exists, supported by affidavits or otherwise. He may also submit a brief of points and authorities.</P>

Unless material facts are in dispute, oral hearing will not be held.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Subsequent procedure.</E> Post-hearing procedures shall be the same as those in proceedings in which the shortened procedures have not been followed.</P>

            <P>(i) A ruling sought to be appealed involves a controlling question of law or policy;</P>
            <P>(ii) An immediate appeal may materially advance the ultimate resolution of the issues in the proceeding; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Subsequent reversal of the ruling would cause unnecessary delay or expense to the parties.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedure to obtain interlocutory review</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> An application for interlocutory review may be filed within five days after notice of the Administrative Law Judge's ruling on a matter described in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this section, except if a request for certification under paragraph (a)(5) of this section has been filed with the Administrative Law Judge within five days after notice of the Administrative Law Judge's ruling on the matter.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Notice of appeal</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Any party to a proceeding may appeal to the Commission an initial decision or a dismissal or other final disposition of the proceeding by the Administrative Law Judge as to any party. The appeal shall be initiated by serving and filing with the Proceedings Clerk a notice of appeal within 15 days after service of the initial decision or other order terminating the proceeding; where service of the initial decision or other order terminating the proceeding is effected by mail or commercial carrier, the time within which the party served may file a notice of appeal shall be increased by 3 days.</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Answering brief.</E> Within 30 days after service of the appeal brief upon any other party that party may file an answering brief.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Reply brief.</E> Within 14 days after service of an answering brief, the party that filed the first brief may file a reply brief.</P>
            <P>(4) No further briefs shall be permitted, unless so ordered by the Commission on its own motion.</P>

            <FP>If the appeal brief is not filed within the time specified the opposing party may move for dismissal of the appeal.</FP>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Briefs.</E> An original of all briefs submitted under this section shall be filed with the Proceedings Clerk.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Briefs: Content and form.</E> (1) The appeal brief should include, in the order indicated:</P>
            <P>(i) A statement of the issues presented for review.</P>
            <P>(ii) A statement of the case. The statement shall first indicate briefly the nature of the case. There shall follow a statement of the facts relevant to the issues presented for review, with appropriate references to the record.</P>
            <P>(iii) An argument. The argument may be preceded by a summary. The argument shall contain the contentions of the party to the appeal with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor, and citations to supporting authorities, statutes and parts of the record.</P>
            <P>(iv) A conclusion stating the precise relief sought.</P>
            <P>(2) The answering brief generally shall follow the same style as prescribed for the appeal brief but may omit a statement of the issues or of the case if the party does not dispute the issues and statement of the case contained in the appeal brief. Any reply brief shall be confined to matters raised in the answering brief and shall be limited to 15 pages in length.</P>
            <P>(3) Any matter not briefed shall be deemed waived, and may not be argued before the Commission.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Appendix to briefs—</E>(1) <E T="03">Designation of contents of appendix.</E> At the time an appellant serves and files its appeal brief, it shall also serve and file a designation of those specific parts of the record to which it wishes to direct the particular attention of the Commission and that it wishes to have included in the appendix, including, but not necessarily limited to, particular pages of the transcript and portions of exhibits filed in the proceeding. The designation shall be set forth in a document wholly separate and apart from the brief, shall enumerate those specific parts of the record that the appellant wishes to have included in the appendix and shall not incorporate by reference citations to the record contained in its brief or in any other document. If an appellee deems it necessary to direct <PRTPAGE P="412"/>the particular attention of the Commission to specific parts of the record not designated by any appellant, it shall serve and file with its answering brief a designation of additional portions of the record for inclusion in the appendix. Any reply brief filed by the appellant may, if necessary, supplement the appellant's previous designation. In designating parts of the record for inclusion in the appendix, the principal parts of the record relied upon should be designated, but the parties shall have regard to the fact that the entire record is always available to the Commission for reference and examinations and shall not engage in unnecessary designation. The fact that a part of the record is not included in an appendix shall not prevent any party or the Commission from relying thereon.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Preparation of the appendix.</E> Within 15 days after the last answering brief or reply brief of a party was due to be filed, the Office of Proceedings shall prepare an appendix to the briefs which will contain a list of the relevant docket entries filed in the proceedings before the Administrative Law Judge, the initial decision and order of the Administrative Law Judge, the pleadings filed on behalf of the parties who are participating in the appeal and such other parts of the record designated by the parties to the appeal in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The Proceedings Clerk shall cause one copy of the appendix to be served on each of the parties to the appeal and shall cause ten copies of the appendix to be placed in the docket of the proceeding for the use of the Commission.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Objections to appendix.</E> Any party who believes that an error or omission has been made in the preparation of the appendix or that the appendix is misleading, prejudicial or otherwise inadequate may on that basis file a motion with the Commission to amend or supplement the appendix within 30 days of the date of the mailing of the appendix.</P>
            <FP>The Commission has determined that once an appeal goes to the Commission, it is in a better position than the Chief Administrative Law Judge to review motions objecting to the appendix or seeking to supplement the appendix. Consequently, upon the adoption of this amendment, the Commission and not the Chief Administrative Law Judge will consider any objection to the appendix pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section. As provided by the amendment, a motion raising objections to the appendix must be filed within 30 days after the date of the mailing of the appendix.</FP>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Effect of failure to file an appeal.</E> Timely appeal to the Commission for review of an initial decision is mandatory as a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of a final decision entered pursuant to these Rules of Practice.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Reconsideration.</E> Within 15 days after service of a Commission opinion and order any party may file with the Commission a petition for reconsideration of the opinion and order, setting forth the relief desired and the grounds in support thereof. Any petition filed under this section must be confined to new questions raised by the opinion or order and concerning which the petitioner had no opportunity to argue before the Commission. The filing of a petition for reconsideration shall not operate to stay the effective date of the Commission's order.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Stay pending judicial appeal—</E>(1) <E T="03">Application for stay.</E> Within 15 days after service of a Commission opinion and order imposing upon any party any of the sanctions listed in §§ 10.1(a) through 10.1(e), that party may file an application with the Commission requesting that the effective date of the order be stayed pending judicial review. The application shall state the reasons why a stay is warranted and the facts relied upon in support of the stay. Any averments contained in the application must be supported by affidavits or other sworn statements or <PRTPAGE P="414"/>verified statements made under penalty of perjury in accordance with the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 1746.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Standards for issuance of stay.</E> The Commission may grant an application for a stay pending judicial appeal upon a showing that:</P>
            <P>(i) The applicant is likely to succeed on the merits of his appeal;</P>
            <P>(ii) Denial of the stay would cause irreparable harm to the applicant; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Neither the public interest nor the interest of any other party will be adversely affected if the stay is granted.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Civil monetary penalties and restitution.</E> Nothwithstanding the requirements set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Commission shall grant any application to stay the imposition of a civil monetary penalty or an order to pay a specific sum as restitution if the applicant has filed with the Proceedings Clerk a surety bond guaranteeing full payment of the penalty or restitution plus interest in the event that the Commission's opinion and order is sustained or the applicant's appeal is not perfected or is dismissed for any reason and the Commission has determined that neither the public interest nor the interest of any other party will be affected by granting the application. The required surety bond shall be in the form of an undertaking by a surety company on the approved list of sureties issued by the Treasury Department of the United States, and the amount of interest shall be calculated in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1961(a) and (b), beginning on the date 30 days after the Commission's opinion and order was served on the applicant.

As necessary or appropriate, the Commission or the Administrative Law Judge may appoint any person, including an employee of the Commission, to administer, or assist in administering, such restitution procedure. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, all costs incurred in administering an order of restitution shall be paid from the restitution funds obtained from the party who was so sanctioned; provided, however, that if the administrator is a Commission employee, no fee shall be charged for his <PRTPAGE P="417"/>or her services or for services performed by any other Commission employee working under his or her direction.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 10—Commission Policy Relating to the Acceptance of Settlements in Administrative and Civil Proceedings</HD>
            <P>It is the policy of the Commission not to accept any offer of settlement submitted by any respondent or defendant in an administrative or civil proceeding, if the settling respondent or defendant wishes to continue to deny the allegations of the complaint or the findings of fact or conclusions of law to be made in the settlement order entered by the Commission or a court. In accepting a settlement and entering an order finding violations of the Act and/or regulations promulgated under the Act, the Commission makes uncontested findings of fact and conclusions of law. Similarly, in settling a civil proceeding with a defendant the Commission invites the federal court to make conclusions of law and, in some instances, findings of fact. The Commission does not believe it would be appropriate for it to be making or inviting a court to make such uncontested findings of violations if the party against whom the findings and conclusions are to be entered is continuing to deny the alleged misconduct.</P>
            <P>The refusal of a settling respondent or defendant to admit the allegations in a Commission-instituted complaint or the findings of fact or conclusions of law in the settlement order entered by the Commission or a court shall be treated as a denial, unless the party states that he or she neither admits nor denies the allegations or the findings and conclusions. In that event, the proposed offer of settlement, consent or consent order must include a provision stating that, by neither admitting nor denying the allegations, findings or conclusions, the settling respondent or defendant agrees that neither he or she nor any of his or her agents or employees under his authority or control shall take any action or make any public statement denying, directly or indirectly, any allegation in the complaint or findings or conclusions in the order, or creating, or tending to create, the impression that the complaint or the order is without a factual basis; provided, however, that nothing in this provision shall affect the settling respondent's or defendant's—</P>

            <P>ii. Right to take legal positions in other proceedings to which the Commission is not a party.</P>

Except as otherwise specified herein, the rules will apply to the conduct of investigation whether or not the Commission has authorized the use of subpoenas in the particular matter to compel the production of evidence.</P>

For this purpose, the Director may obtain evidence through voluntary statements and submissions, through exercise of inspection powers over boards of trade, reporting traders, and persons required by law to register with the Commission, or when authorized by order of the Commission, through the issuance of subpoenas. The Director shall report to the Commission the results of his investigations and recommend to the Commission such enforcement action as he deems appropriate.</P>

          <P>All information and documents obtained during the course of an investigation, whether or not obtained pursuant to subpoena, and all investigative proceedings shall be treated as non-public by the Commission and its staff except to the extent that (a) the Commission directs or authorizes the public disclosure of the investigation; (b) the information or documents are made a matter of public record during the course of an adjudicatory proceeding; or (c) disclosure is required by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and the rules adopted by the Commission thereunder, 17 CFR part 145. Procedures by which persons submitting information to the Commission during the course of an investigation may specifically seek confidential treatment of information for purposes of Freedom of Information Act disclosure are set forth in 17 CFR 145.9. A request for confidential treatment of information for purposes of the Freedom of Information Act shall not, however, prevent disclosure for law enforcement purposes or when disclosure is otherwise found appropriate in the public interest and permitted by law.</P>

          <P>(2) <E T="03">Service upon other persons.</E> When the person to be served is not a natural person, delivery of a copy of the subpoena may be effected by (i) handing it to a registered agent for service, or to any officer, director, or agent in charge of any office of such person; (ii) mailing it by registered or certified mail to any such representative at his last known address; or (iii) any other method whereby actual notice is given to any such representative.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Witness fees and mileage.</E> Witnesses appearing pursuant to subpoena shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid to witnesses in the courts of the United States.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Orders authorizing issuance of subpoenas.</E> Any person upon whom a subpoena has been served compelling him to furnish documentary evidence or testimony in an investigation shall, upon his request, be permitted to examine a copy of the Commission's order pursuant to which the subpoena has been issued. However, a copy of the order shall not be furnished for his retention except with the express approval of either the Director, a Deputy Director, the Program Coordinator, the Chief Counsel, an Associate Director, or a Regional Counsel of the Division of Enforcement, or a Regional Director of the Commission; approval shall not be given unless it has been shown by the person seeking to retain a copy that his retention of a copy would be consistent both with the protection of privacy of persons involved in the investigation and with the unimpeded conduct of the investigation.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Copies of testimony or data.</E> A person compelled to submit data or evidence in the course of an investigatory proceeding shall be entitled to retain or, upon payment of appropriate fees as set forth in the Schedule of Fees for records services, 17 CFR part 145b, procure a copy or transcript thereof, except that the witness may for good cause be limited to inspection of the official transcript of his testimony.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Right to counsel.</E> A person compelled to appear, or who appears in person by request or permission of the Commission or its staff during an investigation, may be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel. Subject to the provisions of § 11.8(b) of this part, he may be represented by any attorney-at-law who is admitted to practice before the highest court in any State or territory or the District of Columbia, who has not been suspended or disbarred from appearance and practice before the Commission in accordance with the provisions of part 14 of this title, and who has not been excluded from further participation in the particular investigatory proceeding for good cause established in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
          <P>(1) The right to be accompanied, represented and advised by counsel shall mean the right of a person testifying to have an attorney present with him during any aspect of an investigative proceeding and to have this attorney advise his client before, during and after the conclusion of such examination. At the conclusion of the examination, counsel may request the person presiding to permit the witness to clarify any of his answers which may need clarification in order that his answers not be left equivocal or incomplete on the record. For his use in protecting the interests of his client with respect to that examination counsel may make summary notes during the examination.</P>
          <P>(2) With due regard for the rights of a witness, the Commission may for good cause exclude a particular attorney from further participation in any investigation in which the Commission has found the attorney to have engaged in dilatory, obstructionist or contumacious conduct. The person conducting an investigation may report to the Commission instances of apparently dilatory, obstructionist or contumacious conduct on the part of an attorney. After due notice to the attorney, the Commission may take such action as the circumstances warrant based upon a written transcript evidencing the conduct of the attorney in that investigation or such other or additional written or oral presentation as the Commission may permit or direct.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Self-Incrimination; immunity—</E>(1) <E T="03">Self-Incrimination.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a witness testifying or otherwise giving <PRTPAGE P="421"/>information in an investigation may refuse to answer questions on the basis of the right against self-incrimination granted by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</P>

Whenever a witness refuses, on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or provide other information in an investigation under this part, and the person presiding over the investigation communicates to the witness an order issued by the Commission requiring the witness to give testimony or provide other information, the witness may not refuse to comply with the order on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination; but no testimony or other information compelled under the order (or any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or other information) may be used against the witness in any criminal case, except a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or otherwise failing to comply with the order.</P>

          <P>(b) <E T="03">Sequestration of counsel.</E> When a reasonable basis exists to believe that an investigation may be obstructed or impeded, directly or indirectly, by an attorney's representation of more than one witness during the course of an investigation, the member of the Commission or of the Commission's staff conducting the investigation may prohibit that attorney from being present during the testimony of any witness other than the witness in whose behalf counsel first appeared in the investigatory proceeding. To the extent practicable, consistent with the integrity of the investigation, the attorney will be advised of the reasons for his having been sequestered.</P>

          <P>The Division of Enforcement (“Division”), in its discretion, may inform persons who may be named in a proposed enforcement proceeding of the nature of the allegations pertaining to them. The Division, in its discretion, may advise such persons that they may submit a written statement prior to the consideration by the Commission of any staff recommendation for the commencement of such proceeding. Unless otherwise provided for by either the Director, a Deputy Director, the Program Coordinator, the Chief Counsel, an Associate Director, or a Regional Counsel of the Division, or a Regional Director of the Commission, such written statements shall be submitted within 14 days after persons are informed by the Division of Enforcement of the nature of the proposed allegations pertaining to them and shall be no more than 20 pages, double spaced on 8<FR>1/2</FR> by 11 inch paper, setting forth their views of factual, legal or policy matters relevant to the commencement of an enforcement proceeding. Any statement of fact included in the submission must be sworn to by a person with personal knowledge of such fact. Statements shall be forwarded to the Director, Division of Enforcement, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581, with copies to the staff conducting the investigation, shall clearly identify the specific investigation, and, if desired, may request that the statement be forwarded to the Commission. Similarly, persons who become involved in an investigation, and submit a written statement on their initiative, should follow the relevant procedures described <PRTPAGE P="422"/>herein. In the event the Division recommends the commencement of an enforcement proceeding to the Commission, any written statement will be forwarded to the Commission if so requested. The Commission may, in its discretion, consider all, any portion or none of the submission when it considers the staff recommendation to commence an enforcement proceeding.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Default order not final.</E> In order to prevent injustice or for good cause shown, and on such conditions as may be appropriate, a non-final default order (including any award therein) may be set aside by the official who issued the order.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Procedure for setting aside non-final default order.</E> Any party or person who is the subject of a default order issued pursuant to these rules may, at any time before the order becomes final pursuant to § 12.22(c), file and serve a motion to set aside the default, which shall set forth reasons why the act or omission for which the party was defaulted was not willful, why there is a reasonable likelihood of success for the party's claim or defense if heard on the merits, and why no prejudice will be sustained by other parties if the default is set aside. A motion to set aside a default order filed pursuant to this paragraph (a)(1) shall be decided, in the first instance, by the official who issued the default order.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Review.</E> A denial of a motion to set aside a non-final default order by the official who issued the order shall be treated as an initial decision, which may be appealed to the Commission in accordance with the requirements of § 12.401 of these rules.

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Default order final.</E> A default order that has become final pursuant to § 12.22(c) shall not be set aside except upon a motion filed and served by the defaulted party showing that he should be relieved from the default order because of fraud perpetrated on a decisionmaking official or the Commission, mistake, excusable neglect, or because the order is void for want of jurisdiction. Such a motion shall also show that, if the default order were set aside, there would be a reasonable likelihood of success for his claim or defense on the merits and that no party would be prejudiced thereby. Motions to set aside a final default order for fraud, mistake, or excusable neglect shall be filed within one year after the order was issued. All motions to set aside default orders shall be decided, in the first instance, by the official who issued the order. A denial of a motion to set aside a default order that has become final shall be treated as an initial decision, which may be appealed to the Commission in accordance with the requirements of § 12.401 of these rules. A grant of a motion to set aside a final default order shall be treated as a non-final order which may be appealed only in accordance with the requirements of § 12.309 of these rules.</P>

Tax returns and personal bank account records shall not be discoverable, except upon motion by the party seeking discovery showing the need for disclosure of information contained therein, and that the same information could not be obtained through other means.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Protective orders.</E> Upon motion by a party or the person from whom discovery is sought, filed within twenty days after the objectionable discovery notice or request is served, and for good cause shown, the official presiding over discovery may issue any order to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, or to prevent the raising of issues untimely or inappropriate to the proceeding, or the inappropriate disclosure of trade secrets or sensitive commercial or financial information. Relief through a protective order may include one or more of the following:</P>
            <P>(i) That discovery not be had;</P>
            <P>(ii) That discovery may be had only on specified terms and conditions;</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Sanctions for abuse of discovery.</E> If an Administrative Law Judge or a Judgement Officer finds that any party, without substanial justification, has necessitated the filing of a motion for a protective order or for an order compelling discovery, or any other discovery-related motions, that party shall, if the motion is granted, be ordered to pay, at the termination of the proceeding, the reasonable expenses of the moving party incurred in filing the motion, unless the decisionmaking official finds that circumstances exist which would make an award of such expenses unjust. If a decisionmaking official finds that any party, without substantial justification, has filed a motion for a protective order or for an order compelling discovery, or any discovery-related motions, that party shall, if the motion is denied, be ordered to pay, at the termination of the proceeding, the reasonable expenses of an adverse party incurred in opposing the motion, unless the decisionmaker finds that circumstances exist which would make an award of such expenses unjust.</P>

Copies of documents shall be served with the request unless they have been or are otherwise <PRTPAGE P="440"/>furnished or made available for inspection and copying. A copy of the request shall be filed with the Proceedings Clerk.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Reply.</E> Each matter of which an admission is requested shall be separately set forth. The matter is admitted unless within twenty (20) days after service of the request, the party upon whom the request is directed files and serves upon the party requesting the admission a verified written answer or objection to the matter. If objection is made, the reasons therefor shall be stated. The answer shall specifically deny the matter or set forth in detail the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter. A denial shall fairly meet the substance of the requested admission and when good faith requires that a party qualify his answer and deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is requested, he shall specify so much of it as is true and qualify or deny the remainder. An answering party may not give a lack of information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny unless he states that he has made reasonable inquiry and that the information known or reasonably available to him is insufficient to enable him to admit or deny. A party who considers that a matter of which an admission has been requested presents a genuine issue for trial may not, on that ground alone, object to the request; he may deny the matter or set forth reasons why he cannot admit or deny it.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Determining sufficiency of answers or objections.</E> The party who has requested the admissions may move to determine the sufficiency of the answers or objections. Unless the objecting party sustains his burden of showing that the objection is justified, the official presiding over discovery shall order that an answer be served.

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Production of documents and tangible things</E>—(1) <E T="03">Order for production.</E> A decisionmaking official may, upon his own motion, order a party or non-party to produce copies of specifically designated documents, papers, books, accounts, or tangible things (or categories of any of the foregoing) which are in the possession, custody or control of the party, non-party or agent thereof, against whom the order is directed. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a party or non-party ordered to produce documents or any of the above items under this rule shall file and serve the documents and items listed in the order within twenty (20) days from the date of service of the order, or within such period of time as the decisionmaking official may direct.

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Trade secrets, commercially sensitive or confidential information.</E> If any party or person against whom an order to produce has been directed acting in good faith has reason to believe that any documents or other tangible thing ordered to be produced contains a trade secret, or commercially sensitive or other confidential information, the party or person may, in lieu of serving any such document, in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, file and serve a written request for confidential treatment of such documents. Any <PRTPAGE P="441"/>such request for confidential treatment shall be accompanied by a verified statement identifying with particularity the information on those documents considered to be trade secrets, commercially sensitive or confidential information, with reasons therefor, and indicating which portions, if any, of those documents may be served on other parties without disclosure of such information. Upon considering a request for confidential treatment in accordance with this subsection, the decisionmaking official may, if he finds that the information identified in the request warrants confidential treatment and is not probative of any material fact in controversy, make copies of the documents produced, delete such information from the copies, and serve the copies as modified upon the other parties, with or without an appropriate protective order limiting dissemination to the parties and their counsel, if any.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Inability to produce.</E> Any party or person who cannot produce documents or other tangible things called for in an order for production, because those documents or things are not in his possession, custody or control, shall file and serve within the time provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section a verified statement identifying the documents which cannot be produced and setting forth with particularity the reasons for non-production.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Order for written testimony.</E> The decisionmaking official may, upon his own motion, order a party or non-party witness to submit verified statements or written responses to interrogatories, or both, as to all relevant matters within the party's personal knowledge which are required in response to the order. A party or person ordered to file affidavits and/or verified written responses to interrogatories shall file and serve the documents within such period of time as the decisionmaking official may direct. The official may issue subpoenas to compel the filing by parties or non-parties of such verified statements and written responses as are described in this subsection.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Filing of motions, answers.</E> Any party who believes that there is no genuine issue of material fact to be determined and that he is entitled to a decision as a matter of law concerning all issues of liability in the proceeding may file a motion for summary disposition at any time until the parties have concluded their submissions of proof. Any adverse party, within ten (10) days after service of the motion, may file and serve opposing papers or may countermove for summary disposition.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Supporting papers.</E> A motion for summary disposition shall include a statement of the material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue, supported by the pleadings, and by affidavits, other verified statements, admissions, stipulations, and interrogatories. The motion may also be supported by briefs containing points and authorities in support of the contention of the party making the motion. When a motion is made and supported as provided in this section, unless otherwise ordered by the Judgment Officer, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations, but shall serve and file in response a statement setting forth those material facts as to which he contends a genuine issue exists, supported by affidavits and other verified material. He may also submit a brief of points and authorities.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Summary disposition upon motion of the Judgment Officer.</E> If the Judgment Officer believes that there may be no genuine issue of material fact to be determined and that one of the parties may be entitled to a decision as a matter of law, he may direct the parties to submit papers in support of and in opposition to summary disposition, substantially as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Ruling on summary disposition.</E> The Judgment Officer may grant summary disposition if the undisputed pleaded facts, affidavits, other verified statements, admissions, stipulations, and matters of official notice show that (1) there is no genuine issue as to any material fact; (2) there is no necessity that further facts be developed in the record; and (3) a party is entitled to a decision in his favor as a matter of law.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Review of ruling; appeal.</E> An application for interlocutory review of an order denying a motion for summary disposition shall not be allowed. An order granting summary disposition as to all of the issues and all of the parties in the proceeding shall have the same effect as an initial decision (see § 12.210(d)), and may be appealed to the Commission, in accordance with § 12.401 of these rules.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Generally.</E> When the Judgment Officer determines that an oral hearing is necessary and appropriate, such oral hearing will be held either by telephone or in person in Washington, DC, as set forth below. The Judgment Officer, in his or her discretion with consideration for the convenience of the parties and their witnesses, will determine the time and date of such hearing. During an oral hearing, in his or her discretion, the Judgment Officer may regulate appropriately the course and sequence of testimony and examination of the parties and their witnesses and limit the issues.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Telephonic hearings.</E> When a Judgment Officer has determined to hold an oral hearing by telephone, an order to that effect will be issued at least 15 days prior to the hearing notifying the parties of the date and time of the hearing. The order will direct the parties to confirm, at least 48 hours in advance of the hearing, that the correct telephone numbers for the parties and their witnesses are on file with the Office of Proceedings, and warn that failure to provide correct telephone numbers may be deemed waiver of that party's right to participate in the hearing, to present evidence, or to cross-examine other witnesses. If a party is unavailable by telephone at the appointed time, any other party in attendance may present testimony, and the Judgment Officer also may impose any appropriate sanction listed in § 12.35. All telephonic hearings will be recorded electronically but will be transcribed only upon direction of the Judgment Officer (if necessary) or in the event of Commission review. The parties may secure a copy of the recording of the hearing from the Proceedings Clerk upon written request and payment of the cost of the recording.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Washington, DC hearings.</E> In exceptional circumstances and when an in-person hearing is determined to be necessary in resolving the issues, the Judgment Officer may order an in-person hearing in Washington, DC upon written request by a party and the agreement of at least one opposing party. The Judgment Officer will issue notice of the time, date, and location of an in-person hearing to the parties at least 30 days in advance of the hearing. Except as otherwise provided herein, an in-person hearing will be held and recorded in the manner prescribed in § 12.312(c) through (f) of these rules. A party not agreeing to appear at the hearing in Washington, DC, may be ordered to participate by telephone. Any party not appearing in person or by telephone will be deemed to have waived the right to participate in the hearing, to present evidence, or to cross-examine other witnesses; further, that party may be subject to such action under § 12.35 as the Judgment Officer may find appropriate. The Judgment Officer may order any party who requests or agrees to appear at a hearing in Washington, DC and fails to appear without good cause, to pay any reasonable costs unnecessarily incurred by parties appearing at such a hearing.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Compulsory process.</E> An application for a subpoena requiring a non-party to participate in a telephonic hearing or to appear at an in-person hearing in Washington, DC, may be made in writing to the Judgment Officer without notice to the other parties. The standards for issuance or denial of an application for a subpoena, the service and travel fee requirements, and the method for enforcing such subpoenas are set forth at § 12.313 of these rules.</P>

            <P>(4) Determine the amount of damages, if any, that the complainant has sustained as a result of respondent's violations, the amount of punitive damages, if any, for which respondent is liable to complainant, which shall not exceed $30,000, exclusive of interest and costs; and the amount, if any, for which complainant is liable to respondents based on counterclaims, which, in aggregate, shall not exceed $30,000, exclusive of interest and costs; and</P>
            <P>(5) Include an order directing either the respondent or the complainant, depending upon whose liability is greater, to pay an amount based on the difference in the amounts determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, on or before a date fixed in the order.</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Effect of initial decision.</E> The initial decision shall become the final decision and order of the Commission thirty (30) days after service thereof, except:</P>

            <P>(2) The initial decision shall not become final as to any party to the proceeding if, within thirty (30) days after service of the initial decision, the Commission itself shall have placed the case on its own docket for review or stayed the effective date of the initial decision.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Effect of failure to file and perfect an appeal to the Commission.</E> Unless the Commission takes review on its own motion, the timely filing and perfection of an appeal to the Commission of the initial decision is mandatory as a prerequisite to appellate judicial review of a final decision and order entered pursuant to these rules.</P>

            <P>(1) The appeal is from a ruling pursuant to § 12.102, § 12.202, or § 12.305 refusing to grant a motion to disqualify a Judgment Officer or Administrative Law Judge;</P>
            <P>(2) The appeal is from a ruling pursuant to § 12.9 suspending an attorney from participation in a reparation proceeding;</P>

            <P>(i) A ruling sought to be appealed involves a controlling question of law or policy;</P>
            <P>(ii) An immediate appeal may materially advance the ultimate resolution of the issues in the proceeding; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Subsequent reversal of the ruling would cause unnecessary delay or expense to the parties; or</P>
            <P>(4) The appeal is from a ruling which satisfies the conditions of paragraphs (a)(3) (i)-(iii) of this section, despite the absence of certification, and extraordinary circumstances are shown to exist.</P>

The application for interlocutory review shall contain:</P>
            <P>(1) A statement of the facts necessary to an understanding of the controlling questions determined by the Administrative Law Judge, and to an understanding of the extraordinary circumstances warranting interlocutory review by the Commission;</P>
            <P>(2) A statement of the question or issue involved in the ruling upon which the application for review is based;</P>
            <P>(3) A statement of the reasons why, in the opinion of the party requesting review, the ruling was erroneous and should be reversed or modified; and</P>

A Commission denial of an application for interlocutory review shall be without prejudice to the applying party's right to raise any argument made in the application as an issue in an appeal taken pursuant to subpart F of these rules.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Proceedings not stayed.</E> The filing of an application for interlocutory review and a grant of review shall not stay proceedings before an Administrative Law Judge (or a Judgment Officer, if applicable) unless that official or the Commission shall so order. The Commission will not consider a motion for a stay unless the motion shall have first been made to the Administrative Law Judge (or, if applicable, the Judgment Officer) and denied.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Interlocutory review by the Commission on its own motion.</E> Nothing in this rule should be construed as restricting the Commission from acting on its own motion to review on an interlocutory <PRTPAGE P="452"/>basis any ruling of an Administrative Law Judge, Proceedings Officer or a Judgment Officer in any proceeding commenced pursuant to § 12.26 of these rules.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Filing of motions, answers.</E> Any party who believes that there is no genuine issue of material fact to be determined and that he is entitled to a decision as a matter of law concerning all issues of liability in the proceeding may file a motion for summary disposition at any time before a determination is made by the Administrative Law Judge to order an oral hearing in the proceeding. Any adverse party, within ten (10) days after service of the motion, may file and serve opposing papers or may countermove for summary disposition.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Supporting papers.</E> A motion for summary disposition shall include a statement of all material facts as to which the moving party contends that there is no genuine issue, supported by the pleadings, and by affidavits, other verified statements, admissions, stipulations, and interrogatories. The motion may also be supported by briefs containing points and authorities in support of the contention of the party making the motion. When a motion is made and supported as provided in this section, unless otherwise ordered by the Administrative Law Judge, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations, but shall serve and file in response a statement setting forth those material facts as to which he contends a genuine issue exists, supported by affidavits and other verified material. He may also submit a brief of points and authorities.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Oral argument.</E> Oral argument may be heard at the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge and shall be heard in Washington, DC, or by telephonic conference call. Such argument shall be recorded, and written transcripts shall be made in the event that a grant or denial of summary disposition is reviewed by the Commission.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Summary disposition upon motion of the Administrative Law Judge.</E> If the Administrative Law Judge believes that there may be no genuine issue of material fact to be determined and that one of the parties may be entitled to a decision as a matter of law, he may direct the parties to submit papers in support of and in opposition to summary disposition, and may hear oral argument, substantially as provided in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Ruling on summary disposition.</E> The Administrative Law Judge shall grant summary disposition if the undisputed pleaded facts, affidavits, other verified statements, admissions, stipulations, and matters of official notice, show that (1) there is no genuine issue as to any material fact; (2) there is no necessity that further facts be developed in the record; and (3) a party is entitled to a decision as a matter of law.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Review of ruling; appeal.</E> An application for interlocutory review of an order denying a motion for summary disposition shall not be allowed. Interlocutory review of an order granting summary disposition which disposes of less than all of the issues in the proceeding may be sought only in accordance with § 12.309 of these rules. An order granting summary disposition which is dispositive of all issues, and as to all parties, in the proceeding may be appealed to the Commission in accordance with the requirements set forth in § 12.401 of these rules.</P>

            <P>If the Administrative Law Judge determines that the documentary proof and other tangible forms of proof submitted by the parties are sufficient to permit resolution of some or all of the factual issues in the proceeding without the need for oral testimony, he may order that all proof relating to such issues be submitted in documentary and tangible form, and dispose of such issues without an oral hearing. In such an event, proof in support of the complaint, answer, and reply, may be found in those verified documents, in depositions on written interrogatories, in admissible documents obtained through discovery, in other verified statements of fact, documents and tangible evidence.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Oral hearing.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Notification; prehearing order.</E> If and when the proceeding has reached <PRTPAGE P="453"/>the stage of an oral hearing, the Administrative Law Judge, giving due regard for the convenience of the parties, shall set a time for hearing, as well as a location prescribed by paragraph (b) of this section, and shall file with the Proceedings Clerk, for immediate service upon the parties:</P>
            <P>(1) An order requiring the parties to file and serve, within fifteen days after service of the order, a prehearing memorandum setting forth briefly:</P>
            <P>(i) A statement of all issues to be tried at the hearing;</P>
            <P>(ii) An identification of each witness expected to be called by that party;</P>
            <P>(iii) A summary of the testimony each witness is expected to provide; and</P>
            <P>(2) A notice stating the time and location of the hearing.</P>
            <FP>Prior to the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge may issue an order based on the contents of the parties' memoranda filed pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, which, unless modified to prevent injustice, shall control the scope of matters to be tried at the oral hearing. If any change in the time or place of the hearing becomes necessary, it shall be made by the Administrative Law Judge, who, in such event, shall file with the Proceedings Clerk a notice of the change. Such notice shall be served upon the parties, unless it is made during the course of an oral hearing and made a part of the transcript. Hearings shall proceed expeditiously and, absent extraordinary circumstances, shall be held in one location and shall continue, without suspension, until concluded.</FP>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Location of hearing.</E> Unless the Director of the Office of Proceedings for reasons of administrative economy or practical necessity determines otherwise, and except as provided in this subparagraph, the location of an oral hearing shall be in one of the following cities: Albuquerque, N.M.; Atlanta, Ga.; Boston, Mass.; Chicago, Ill.; Cincinnati, Ohio; Columbia, S.C.; Denver, Colo.; Houston, Tex.; Kansas City, Mo.; Los Angeles, Cal.; Minneapolis, Minn.; New Orleans, La.; New York, N.Y.; Oklahoma City, Okla.; Phoenix, Ariz.; San Diego, Cal.; San Francisco, Cal.; Seattle, Wash.; St. Petersburg, Fla.; and Washington, DC. The Administrative Law Judge may, in any case where a party avers, in an affidavit, that none of the foregoing cities is located within 300 miles of his principal residence, waive this paragraph and, upon giving due regard for the convenience of all of the parties, order that the hearing be held in a more convenient locale.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Who may appear.</E> The parties may appear in person, by counsel, or by other representatives of their choosing, subject to the provisions of § 12.9 of these rules concerning practice before the Commission.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Effect of failure to appear.</E> If any party to the proceeding fails to appear at the hearing, or at any part thereof, he shall to that extent be deemed to have waived the opportunity for an oral hearing in the proceeding. The Administrative Law Judge, for just cause, may take such action as is appropriate pursuant to § 12.35 of these rules against a party who fails to appear at the hearing. In the event that a party appears at the hearing and no party appears for the opposing side, the party who is present may present his evidence, in whole or in part, in the form of affidavits or by oral testimony, before the Administrative Law Judge.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Public hearings.</E> All oral hearings shall be public except that upon application of a party or affected witness the Administrative Law Judge may direct that specific documents or testimony be received and retained non-publicly in order to prevent unwarranted disclosure of trade secrets or sensitive commercial or financial information or an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Conduct of the hearing.</E> Subject to paragraph (e) of this section, and except as otherwise provided, at an oral hearing every party shall be entitled to:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Conduct direct and cross-examination of parties and witnesses.</E> All witnesses at a hearing for the purpose of taking evidence shall testify under oath or affirmation, which shall be administered by the Administrative Law Judge. Unless otherwise ordered by the Administrative Law Judge, parties shall be entitled to present oral direct testimony and other documentary proof, and to conduct direct examination and cross examine adverse parties <PRTPAGE P="454"/>and witnesses. To expedite the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge may, in his discretion, order that the direct testimony of the parties and their witnesses be presented in documentary form, by affidavit, interrogatory, and other documents. In any event, the Administrative Law Judge, in his discretion, may permit cross examination, without regard to the scope of direct testimony, as to any matter which is relevant to the issues in the proceeding;</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Introduce exhibits.</E> The original of each exhibit introduced in evidence or marked for identification shall be filed unless the Administrative Law Judge permits the substitution of copies for the original documents. A copy of each exhibit introduced by a party or marked for identification at his request shall be supplied by him to the Administrative Law Judge and to each other party to the proceeding. Exhibits shall be maintained by the reporter who shall serve as custodian of the exhibits until they are transmitted to the Proceedings Clerk pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section;</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Make objections.</E> A party shall timely and briefly state the grounds relied upon for any objection made to the introduction of evidence. Formal exception to an adverse ruling shall not be required; and</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Make offers of proof.</E> When an objection to a question propounded to a witness is sustained, the examiner may make a specific offer of what he expects to prove by the answer of the witness. Rejected exhibits, adequately marked for identification, shall be retained in the record so as to be available for consideration by any reviewing authority.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Admissibility of evidence.</E> Relevant, material and reliable evidence shall be admitted. Irrelevant, immaterial, unreliable and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Record of an oral hearing.</E> Oral hearings for the purpose of taking evidence shall be recorded and shall be transcribed in written form under the supervision of the Administrative Law Judge by a reporter employed by the Commission for that purpose. The original transcript shall be a part of the record and shall be the sole official transcript. Copies of transcripts, except those portions granted non-public treatment, shall be available from the reporter at rates not to exceed the maximum rates fixed by the contract between the Commission and the reporter. As soon as practicable after the close of the hearing, the reporter shall transmit to the Proceedings Clerk the transcript of the testimony and the exhibits introduced in evidence at the hearing, except such portions of the transcript and exhibits as shall have already been delivered to the Administrative Law Judge.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Proposed findings of fact and conclusions law; briefs.</E> An Administrative Law Judge, upon his own motion or upon motion of a party, may permit the filing of post-hearing proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Absent an order permitting such findings and conclusions, none shall be allowed. Unless otherwise ordered by the Administrative Law Judge and for good cause shown, the proposed findings and conclusions (including briefs in support thereof), shall not exceed twenty-five (25) pages and shall be filed not later than forty-five (45) days after the close of the oral hearing.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general—</E>(1) <E T="03">Application for issuance of subpoenas.</E> An application for a subpoena requiring a party or other person to appear and testify at an oral hearing (subpoena <E T="03">ad testificandum</E>) or to appear and testify and to produce specified documentary or tangible evidence at the hearing (subpoena <E T="03">duces tecum</E>), shall (unless made orally at a hearing) be filed in writing and in duplicate, but need not be served upon other parties. The application shall be accompanied by the original and one copy of the subpoena.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Standards for issuance or denial of subpoenas.</E> The Administrative Law Judge considering any application for a subpoena shall issue the subpoena if he is satisfied the application complies with this rule and the request is not unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope or unduly burdensome. In the <PRTPAGE P="455"/>event the Adminstrative Law Judge determines that a requested subpoena or any of its terms is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he may refuse to issue the subpoena, or may issue it only upon such conditions as he determines fairness requires.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Special requirements relating to application for an issuance of subpoenas for the appearance of commission employees—</E>(1) <E T="03">Form.</E> An application for the issuance of a subpoena shall be made in the form of a written motion served upon all other parties, if the subpoena would require the appearance of a Commissioner or an official or employee of the Commission.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Content.</E> The motion shall specifically describe the material to be produced, the information to be disclosed, or the testimony to be elicited from the witness, and shall show</P>
            <P>(i) The relevance of the material, information, or testimony to the matters at issue in the proceeding;</P>
            <P>(ii) The reasonableness of the scope of the proposed subpoena; and</P>

            <P>(3) <E T="03">Rulings.</E> The motion shall be decided by the Administrative Law Judge and his order shall provide such terms and conditions for the production of the material, the disclosure of the information, or the appearance of the witnesses as may appear necessary and appropriate for the protection of the public interest.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Service of subpoenas—</E>(1) <E T="03">How effected.</E> Service of a subpoena upon a party shall be made in accordance with § 12.10 of these rules. Service of a subpoena upon any other person shall be made by delivering a copy of the subpoena to him as provided in paragraph (c) (2) or (3) of this section, and by tendering to him the fees for one day's attendance and the mileage as specified in paragraph (e) of this section. When the subpoena is issued at the instance of any officer or agency of the United States, fees and mileage need not be tendered at the time of service.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Service upon a natural person.</E> Delivery of a copy of a subpoena and tender of fees and mileage to a natural person may be effected by (i) handing them to the person; (ii) leaving them at his office with the person in charge thereof or, if there is no one in charge, by leaving the subpoena in a conspicuous place therein; (iii) leaving them at his dwelling place or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein; (iv) mailing them by registered or certified mail to him at his last known address; or (v) any other method whereby actual notice is given to him and the fees and mileage are timely made available.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Service upon other persons.</E> When the person to be served is not a natural person, delivery of a copy of the subpoena and tender of the fees and mileage may be effected by</P>
            <P>(i) Handing them to a registered agent for service, or to any officer, director, or agent in charge of any office of such person;</P>
            <P>(ii) Mailing them by registered or certified mail to any such representative at his last known address; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Any other method whereby actual notice is given to any such representative and the fees and mileage are timely made available.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Motion to quash subpoena.</E> At or any time before the time specified in the subpoena for compliance therewith, a person upon whom a subpoena has been served may file a motion to quash or modify the subpoena with the Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoena, and serve a copy of the motion on the party who requested the subpoena. Such motion shall include a brief statement of the reasons therefor. After due notice to the person upon whose request the subpoena was issued, and an opportunity for that person to respond, the Administrative Law Judge may (1) quash or modify the subpoena, or (2) condition denial of the application to quash or modify the subpoena upon just and reasonable terms, including, on the case of a subpoena <E T="03">duces tecum,</E> a requirement that the person on whose behalf the subpoena was issued shall advance the reasonable cost of producing documentary or other tangible evidence.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Attendance and mileage fees.</E> Persons summoned to testify at a hearing under requirement of subpoenas are entitled to the same fees and mileage as <PRTPAGE P="456"/>are paid to witnesses in the courts of the United States. Fees and mileage shall be paid by the party at whose instance the persons are subpoenaed or called.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Enforcement of subpoenas.</E> Upon failure of any person to comply with a subpoena issued at the request of a party, that party may petition the Commission, in its discretion, to institute an action in an appropriate U.S. District Court for enforcement of the subpoena.</P>

The Proceedings Clerk shall also serve a notice, to accompany the initial decision, of the effect of a party's failure timely to appeal to the Commission the initial decision, as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, and the effect of a failure of a party who has been ordered to pay a reparation award timely to file the documents required by § 12.407(c).</P>

            <P>(4) Determine the amount of damages, if any, that the complainant has sustained as a result of respondent's violations, the amount of punitive damages if warranted, and the amount, if any, for which complainant is liable to a respondent based on a counterclaim; and</P>
            <P>(5) Include an order directing either the respondent or the complainant, depending upon whose liability is greater, to pay an amount based on the difference in the amounts determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, on or before a date fixed in the order.</P>

            <P>(1) The initial decision shall not become the final decision as to a party who shall have timely filed and perfected an appeal thereof to the Commission, in accordance with § 12.401 of these rules; and</P>

The notice need consist only of a brief statement indicating the filing party's intent to appeal the initial decision, and shall include the date upon which the initial decision was rendered, the names of all parties, and the docket number of the proceeding. A non-refundable appellate filing fee in the amount of $50 shall be paid at the time of filing a notice of appeal. The failure of a party timely to file and serve a notice of appeal, and to pay the appellate filing fee, in accordance with this paragraph, or to perfect the appeal in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, shall constitute a voluntary waiver of any objection to the initial decision, or other order disposing of the proceeding, and of all further administrative or judicial review under these rules and the Commodity Exchange Act.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Perfecting the appeal; appeal brief.</E> An appeal shall be perfected by the appealing party by timely filing with the Proceedings Clerk an appeal brief which meets the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section. An original and one copy of the appeal brief shall be filed within thirty (30) days after filing of the notice of appeal. By motion of the appealing party, the Commission may, for good cause shown, extend the time for filing the appeal brief. If the appeal brief is not filed within the time prescribed in this subparagraph, the Commission may, upon its own motion or upon motion by a party, dismiss the appeal, in which event the initial decision shall become the final decision and order of the Commission, effective upon service of the order of dismissal.</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Briefs.</E> Parties filing an appeal brief or answering brief pursuant to this section shall meet the requirements of § 12.11 of these rules as to form.

In the event the Commission affords the parties the opportunity to present oral argument before the Commission, the oral argument shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of § 10.103 of the Commission's regulations, 17 CFR 10.103.</P>

            <P>Any time prior to issuance of its final decision pursuant to § 12.406, the Commission may, after notice to the parties and an opportunity for them to present their views, reopen the hearing to receive further evidence.

On review, the Commission may affirm, reverse, modify, set aside or remand for further proceedings, in whole or in part, the initial decision and make any findings or conclusions which in its judgment are warranted based on the record in the proceeding.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Order on summary affirmance.</E> If the Commission, in its opinion, finds that the result reached in the initial decision is substantially correct and that none of the arguments on appeal made by the appealing party raise any important question of law or policy, the Commission may, by appropriate order, summarily affirm the initial decision and order without opinion, which shall constitute the Commission's final decision, effective upon service. Unless the Commission expressly indicates otherwise in its order, an order of summary affirmance does not reflect a Commission determination to adopt the initial decision, including any rationale contained therein, as its opinion and order, and neither initial decision nor the Commission's order of summary affirmance shall serve as a Commission precedent in other proceedings.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Filing and service of final decision.</E> The Commission shall, upon issuance of a final decision pursuant to this § 12.406, file the final decision with the Proceeding's Clerk, who shall forthwith serve upon each of the parties a copy of the final decision as well as notice of the effect of a party's failure to pay a reparation award as provided in § 12.407 of these rules, and of an aggrieved party's right to obtain judicial review of the final decision pursuant to section 14(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 18(e).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Date of the reparation order.</E> For purposes of computing the 30-day period for filing the appeal bond required by section 14(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 18(e), “the date of the reparation order” shall be the date that the Commission's opinion and order (or order of summary affirmance, as the case may be) is filed with the Proceedings Clerk.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Satisfaction of reparation award</E>—(1) <E T="03">Where initial decision has become the final decision.</E> Any reparation award ordered in an initial decision, or similar dispositive order (but not a final decision issued pursuant to § 12.106 of these rules), shall be satisfied in full within forty-five (45) days after service of the initial decision, unless a timely appeal thereof has been perfected pursuant to § 12.401, or unless the Commission, pursuant to § 12.403(a), has stayed the effective date of the initial decision.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Final decision pursuant to § 12.406.</E> Any reparation award ordered in a final decision of the Commission issued pursuant to § 12.406 of these rules shall be satisfied in full within fifteen (15) days after service of the final decision, or such other longer period of time as may be specified in the final decision, unless a petition for review is filed in <PRTPAGE P="460"/>accordance with section 14(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 18(e).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Enforcement of reparation award.</E> If any person against whom a reparation award has been made does not timely comply with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the party in whose favor the award is made is entitled to seek enforcement of award in accordance with the procedure prescribed in section 14(d) of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 18(d).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Automatic suspension.</E> A person required to pay a reparation award shall be prohibited from trading on all contract markets and if such person is registered, his registration shall be suspended automatically, without further notice, unless such person shall, within fifteen (15) days after the time limit for satisfaction of an award (as prescribed in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section) expires, file with the Proceedings Clerk and serve on the other parties:</P>

(This paragraph is applicable only in proceedings commenced pursuant to § 12.26 (b) or (c), and only if the person has timely filed and perfected an appeal to the Commission as prescribed in § 12.401.)</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Reinstatement.</E> The sanctions imposed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section shall remain in effect until the person required to pay the reparation award demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commission that he has paid the amount required in full including prejudgment interest if awarded and post-judgment interest at the prevailing rate computed in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1961 from the date directed in the final order to the date of payment, compounded annually. In the event an award of post-judgment interest is inadvertently omitted, such interest nevertheless shall run as calculated in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1961 and the part 12 Rules.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Automatic suspension after appeal.</E> If on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals the appellee prevails, or if the appeal is dismissed, the automatic prohibition against trading and suspension of registration shall become effective at the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date of judgment on the appeal, but if the judgment is stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the suspension shall become effective ten (10) days after the expiration of such stay, unless prior thereto the judgment of the court or the final order of the Commission has been satisfied.</P>

          <P>(1) Permanently enjoined by reason of his misconduct by any court of competent jurisdiction (i) whether by consent, default, upon summary judgment or after trial, in any action brought by the Commission based upon violations of any provision of the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, or of the rules and regulations adopted thereunder, or (ii) after trial or upon summary judgment in any action brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission based upon any violation of the federal securities laws (15 U.S.C. 77a to 80b-20) or of rules and regulations adopted thereunder;</P>
          <P>(2) Found by any court of competent jurisdiction (whether by consent, default, upon summary judgment or after trial) in any action brought by the Commission to which he is a party, or found by the Commission (whether by consent, default, upon summary disposition or after hearing) in any administrative proceeding in which the Commission is a complainant and to which he is a party, to have committed, caused, or aided and abetted a violation of any provision of the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, or of the rules and regulations promulgated under any of those statutes;</P>
          <P>(3) Found upon summary judgment or after trial by any court of competent jurisdiction in any action brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to which he is a party, or found by the Securities and Exchange Commission, upon summary disposition or after hearing, in any administrative proceeding in which the Securities and Exchange Commission is a complainant and to which he is a party, to have committed, caused, or aided or abetted a violation of any provision of the federal securities laws (15 U.S.C. 77a to 80b-20) or of the rules and regulations adopted thereunder.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Petition to lift suspension.</E> Any person temporarily suspended from appearing and practicing before the Commission in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section may, within 30 days after service upon him of temporary suspension, petition the Commission to lift the temporary suspension.

After opportunity for hearing, the Commission may censure the petitioner or may disqualify the petitioner from appearing or practicing before the Commission for a period of time or permanently or may determine that no action is appropriate.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Hearing.</E> A showing that the petitioner has been enjoined or has been found to have committed, caused or aided or abetted violations as described in paragraph (a) of this section, without more, may be a basis for censure or disqualification; that showing having been made, the burden shall then be on the petitioner to show why he should not be censured or disqualified. A petitioner will not be heard to contest any findings against him or admissions made by him in the judicial or administrative proceedings upon which the proposed censure or disqualification is based. A petitioner who has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section without admitting the facts set forth in the complaint shall nevertheless be presumed for all purposes under this section to have been enjoined by reason of the misconduct alleged in the complaint.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Designation of agent for foreign persons.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) For purposes of this section, the term “futures contract” means any <PRTPAGE P="470"/>contract for the purchase or sale of any commodity for future delivery, traded or executed on or subject to the rules of any designated contract market, or for the purposes of paragraph (i) of this section, a reporting market (including all agreements, contracts and transactions that are treated by a clearing organization as fungible with such contracts); the term “option contract” means any contract for the purchase or sale of a commodity option, or as applicable, any other instrument subject to the Act, traded or executed on or subject to the rules of any designated contract market, or for the purposes of paragraph (i) of this section, a reporting market (including all agreements, contracts and transactions that are treated by a clearing organization as fungible with such contracts); the term “customer” means any person for whose benefit a foreign broker makes or causes to be made any futures contract or option contract; and the term “communication” means any summons, complaint, order, subpoena, special call, request for information, or notice, as well as any other written document or correspondence.</P>
          <P>(b) Any futures commission merchant who makes or causes to be made any futures contract or option contract for the account of any foreign broker or foreign trader, and any introducing broker who introduces such an account to a futures commission merchant, shall thereupon be deemed to be the agent of the foreign broker or the foreign trader for purposes of accepting delivery and service of any communication issued by or on behalf of the Commission to the foreign broker or the foreign trader with respect to any futures or option contracts which are or have been maintained in such accounts carried by the futures commission merchant. In the case of a futures commission merchant who makes or causes to be made any futures or option contract for the account of a foreign broker, the futures commission merchant and the introducing broker, if any, shall also be the agent of the customers of the foreign broker (including any customer who is also a foreign broker and its customers) who have positions in the foreign broker's futures or option contract account carried by the futures commission merchant for purposes of accepting delivery and service of any communication issued by or on behalf of the Commission to the customer with respect to any futures or option contracts which are or have been maintained in such accounts carried by the futures commission merchant. Service or delivery of any communication issued by or on behalf of the Commission to a futures commission merchant or to an introducing broker pursuant to such agency shall constitute valid and effective service or delivery upon the foreign broker, a customer of the foreign broker or the foreign trader. A futures commission merchant or an introducing broker who has been served with, or to whom there has been delivered, a communication issued by or on behalf of the Commission to a foreign broker, a customer of the foreign broker or the foreign trader shall transmit the communication promptly and in a manner which is reasonable under the circumstances, or in a manner specified by the Commission in the communication, to the foreign broker, a customer of the foreign broker or the foreign trader.</P>
          <P>(c) It shall be unlawful for any futures commission merchant and for any introducing broker to open or cause to be opened a futures or options contract account for, or to effect or cause to be effected transactions in futures contracts or option contracts for an existing account of, a foreign broker or foreign trader unless the futures commission merchant or introducing broker informs the foreign broker or foreign trader prior thereto, in any reasonable manner which the futures commission merchant or introducing broker deems to be appropriate, of the requirements of this section.</P>

          <P>(d) The requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall not apply to any account carried by a futures commission merchant or introduced by an introducing broker if the foreign broker, customer of a foreign broker, or foreign trader for whose benefit such account is carried or introduced has duly executed and maintains in effect a written agency agreement in compliance with this paragraph with a person domiciled in the United States <PRTPAGE P="471"/>and has provided a copy of the agreement to the futures commission merchant and to the introducing broker, if any, prior to the opening of an account, or placing orders for transactions in futures contracts or option contracts of an existing account, with the futures commission merchant or introducing broker. This agreement must authorize the person domiciled in the United States to serve as the agent of the foreign broker and customers of the foreign broker or the foreign trader for purposes of accepting delivery and service of all communications issued by or on behalf of the Commission to the foreign broker, customers of the foreign broker, or foreign trader and must provide an address in the United States where the agent will accept delivery and service of communications from the Commission. This agreement must be filed with the Commission by the futures commission merchant or introducing broker prior to the opening of an account for the foreign broker or foreign trader or the effecting of a transaction in futures or option contracts for an existing account of a foreign broker or foreign trader. Unless otherwise specified by the Commission, the agreements required to be filed with the Commission shall be filed with the Secretary of the Commission at Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581. A foreign broker, customer of a foreign broker, or foreign trader shall notify the Commission immediately if the written agency agreement is terminated, revoked or is otherwise no longer in effect. If a futures commission merchant carrying, or an introducing broker introducing, an account for a foreign broker or foreign trader knows or should know that the agreement has expired, has been terminated or is otherwise no longer in effect, the futures commission merchant or introducing broker shall notify the Secretary of the Commission immediately. If the written agency agreement expires, terminates or is not in effect, the futures commission merchant, introducing broker, and the foreign broker, customers of the foreign broker, or foreign trader are subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
          <P>(e) Any designated contract market that permits a foreign broker to intermediate contracts, agreements or transactions, or permits a foreign trader to effect contracts, agreements or transactions on the facility or exchange, shall be deemed to be the agent of the foreign broker and any of its customers for whom the transactions were executed, or the foreign trader, for purposes of accepting delivery and service of any communication issued by or on behalf of the Commission to the foreign broker, any of its customers or the foreign trader with respect to any contracts, agreements or transactions executed by the foreign broker or the foreign trader on the designated contract market. Service or delivery of any communication issued by or on behalf of the Commission to a designated contract market shall constitute valid and effective service upon the foreign broker, any of its customers, or the foreign trader. A designated contract market which has been served with, or to which there has been delivered, a communication issued by or on behalf of the Commission to a foreign broker, any of its customers, or a foreign trader shall transmit the communication promptly and in a manner which is reasonable under the circumstances, or in a manner specified by the Commission in the communication, to the foreign broker, any of its customers or the foreign trader.</P>
          <P>(f) It shall be unlawful for any designated contract market to permit a foreign broker, any of its customers or a foreign trader to effect contracts, agreements or transactions on the facility unless the designated contract market prior thereto informs the foreign broker, any of its customers or the foreign trader, in any reasonable manner the facility deems to be appropriate, of the requirements of this section.</P>

          <P>(g) The requirements of paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section shall not apply to any contracts, transactions or agreements traded on any designated contract market if the foreign broker, any of its customers or the foreign trader has duly executed and maintains in effect a written agency agreement in compliance with this paragraph with a <PRTPAGE P="472"/>person domiciled in the United States and has provided a copy of the agreement to the designated contract market prior to effecting any contract, agreement or transaction on the facility. This agreement must authorize the person domiciled in the United States to serve as the agent of the foreign broker, any of its customers or the foreign trader for purposes of accepting delivery and service of all communications issued by or on behalf of the Commission to the foreign broker, any of its customers or the foreign trader and must provide an address in the United States where the agent will accept delivery and service of communications from the Commission. This agreement must be filed with the Commission by the designated contract market prior to permitting the foreign broker, any of its customers or the foreign trader to effect any transactions in futures or option contracts. Unless otherwise specified by the Commission, the agreements required to be filed with the Commission shall be filed with the Secretary of the Commission at Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street NW., Washington, DC 20581. A foreign broker, any of its customers or a foreign trader shall notify the Commission immediately if the written agency agreement is terminated, revoked, or is otherwise no longer in effect.

          <P>(1) It shall be unlawful for any such reporting market to permit a foreign clearing member or a foreign trader to clear or effect contracts, agreements or transactions on the facility or its clearing organization unless the reporting market prior thereto informs the foreign clearing member or foreign trader of the requirements of this section.</P>

Unless otherwise specified by the Commission, the agreements required to be filed with the Commission shall be filed with the Secretary of the Commission at Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581.</P>

          <P>(i) <E T="03">Report type.</E> This report format will be used to report three types of data: long and short futures and options positions, futures delivery notices issued and stopped, and exchanges of futures for a commodity or for a derivatives position bought and sold. Valid values for the report type are “RP” for reporting positions, “DN” for reporting notices, and “EP” for reporting exchanges of futures for a commodity or for a derivatives position.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Reporting firm.</E> The clearing member number assigned by an exchange or clearing house to identify reporting firms. If a firm is not a clearing member, a three-character alpha-numeric identifier assigned by the Commission.</P>
          <P>(iii) <E T="03">Account Number.</E> A unique identifier assigned by the reporting firm to each special account. The field is zero filled with the account number right-justified. Assignment of the account number is subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section and appendix A of this part (Form 102).</P>
          <P>(iv) <E T="03">Report date.</E> The format is YYYYMMDD, where YYYY is the year, MM is the month, and DD is the day of the month.</P>
          <P>(v) <E T="03">Exchange.</E> This is a two-character field approved by the Commission to identify the exchange on which a position is held.</P>
          <P>(vi) <E T="03">Put or Call.</E> Valid values for this field are “C” for a call option and “P” for a put option. For futures, the field is blank.</P>
          <P>(vii) <E T="03">Commodity</E> (1). An exchange-assigned commodity code for the futures or options contract.</P>
          <P>(viii) <E T="03">Expiration date</E> (1). The date format is YYYYMMDD and represents the expiration date or delivery date of the <PRTPAGE P="479"/>reported futures or options contract. For date-specific instruments such as flexible products, the full date must be reported. For other options and futures, this field is used to report the expiration year and month for an options contract or a delivery year and month for a futures contract. The day portion of the field for these contracts contains spaces.</P>
          <P>(ix) <E T="03">Strike price.</E> This is a signed numeric field for reporting options strike prices. The strike prices should be right-justified and the field zero-filled. Strike prices must be reported in the same formats that are used by an exchange. For futures, the field is left blank.</P>
          <P>(x) <E T="03">Exercise style.</E> Valid values for this field are “A” for American style options, i.e., those that can be exercised at any time during the life of the options; and “E” for European, i.e., those that can be exercised only at the end of an option's life. This field is required only for flexible instruments or as otherwise specified by the Commission.</P>
          <P>(xi) <E T="03">Long-Buy-Stopped (Short-Sell-Issued).</E> When report type is “RP”, report long (short) positions open at the end of a trading day. When report is “DN”, report delivery notices stopped (issued) on behalf of the account. When report type is “EP”, report purchases (sales) of futures for a commodity or for a derivatives position for the account. Report all information in contracts. Position data are reported on a net or gross basis in accordance with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.</P>
          <P>(xii) <E T="03">Commodity</E> (2). The exchange assigned commodity code for a futures contract or other instrument that a position is exercised into from a date-specific or flexible option.</P>
          <P>(xiii) <E T="03">Expiration date</E> (2). Similar to other dates, the format is YYYYMMDD and represents the expiration date or delivery month and year of the future or other instrument that a position is exercised into from a date-specific or flexible option.</P>
          <P>(xiv) <E T="03">Record type</E> (1). Record type is used to correct errors or delete records that have previously been submitted. Valid values are “A”, “C”, “D” or “blank”. An A or “blank” is used in this field for all new records. If the record corrects information for a previously provided record, this field must contain a “C” or “blank” and the record must contain all information on the previously transmitted record. If the record deletes information on a previously provided record, this field must contain a “D” and all information on the previously transmitted record.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Correction of errors and omissions.</E> Unless otherwise approved by the Commission or its designee, corrections to errors and omissions in data provided pursuant to § 17.00(a) shall be filed on series ‘01 forms or in the format, coding structure and data transmission procedures approved in writing by the Commission or its designee.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Exclusively self-cleared contracts.</E> Unless determined otherwise by the Commission, reporting markets that list exclusively self-cleared contracts shall meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section, as they apply to trading in such contracts by all clearing members, on behalf of all clearing members.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Supplemental List III: Business Purposes of Commodity Derivatives Trading</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Business Purpose</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Definition</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Example</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">
            <E T="03">Offsetting Cash or Spot Market Input Price Risk</E>
          </HD>
          <P>Using derivative markets for commodities that are direct inputs or purchases for your business so as to offset price risk associated with your purchase of these inputs.</P>
          <P>E.g. You are a grain processor, so you use wheat futures to offset the price risk incidental to your cash purchases of wheat.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">
            <E T="03">Offsetting Cash or Spot Market Output Price Risk</E>
          </HD>
          <P>Using derivative markets for commodities that are direct outputs or sales of your business so as to offset price risk associated with your sale of these outputs.</P>
          <P>E.g. You are a gasoline refiner, so you use gasoline futures to offset price risk associated with your production of gasoline.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">
            <E T="03">Offsetting Other Cash or Spot Market Price Risks (Cross Price Risk)</E>
          </HD>
          <P>Using derivative markets for a commodity that is not a direct input or output of your business, but which has significant price correlations with the direct inputs or outputs of your business.</P>
          <P>E.g. You manufacture ethanol which is used as an additive in and competitor for gasoline as a combustive fuel. While you neither directly consume nor produce gasoline, you may find that the price you receive for your ethanol product is highly correlated with the price of gasoline, and therefore you reduce ethanol price risk by using gasoline futures contracts.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">
            <E T="03">Other Physical Risk Management Strategies</E>
          </HD>
          <P>Managing other price risks incidental to the operation of your business or physical assets through the use of commodity derivative markets.</P>
          <P>E.g. You are a manufacturer with significant international sales, so you use foreign currency futures to offset risks associated with changes in the competitiveness of your exports and therefore the value of your physical assets such as production plants, land, machinery, etc.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">
            <E T="03">Client Futures/Options on Futures Trading</E>
          </HD>
          <P>Fulfilling customer/client desire for portfolio diversification or exposure to various asset classes through your activity as a Commodity Pool Operator, Commodity Trading Advisor, or other similar role.</P>
          <P>E.g. You collect funds and execute trading strategies through the use of futures/options on futures markets at the expressed intent and for the sole benefit of clients.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">
            <E T="03">Managing Client Swaps Exposure</E>
          </HD>
          <P>Reducing risk stemming from holding or executing swaps contracts on behalf of clients or customers through the use of futures/options on futures markets.</P>

          <P>E.g. You sell crude oil swaps to a client and agree to accept the risk inherent in the index price. You offset this risk through purchases of crude oil futures, in effect transferring price risk from the client to another market participant.<PRTPAGE P="521"/>
          </P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">
            <E T="03">Making Markets/Providing Liquidity</E>
          </HD>
          <P>Engaging in derivatives transactions to assume risk and help transfer ownership of derivative positions from one market participant to another, realizing the bid-ask spread as the return.</P>
          <P>E.g. You accept risk by buying and selling futures/options on futures contracts so that other traders can move into and out of positions when they wish. You then find other traders willing to take the other side of those transactions.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">
            <E T="03">Arbitrage</E>
          </HD>
          <P>Using derivative markets as part of a strategy designed to realize risk-free profit from pricing anomalies.</P>
          <P>E.g. You realize that the wheat futures contract is trading at a discount (even after considering storage, transport, etc.) relative to the wheat cash price, and therefore find it profitable to purchase the wheat futures contract, take delivery, and then resell the wheat in the cash market for a risk-free profit.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">
            <E T="03">Establishing Price Exposure</E>
          </HD>
          <P>Using derivative markets as a way to express your belief in the future movement of market prices. This strategy does not involve offsetting risks incidental to your business, but instead involves directional trading.</P>
          <P>E.g. You conduct research and believe that crude oil prices are due to rise, so you take long futures positions in crude oil to profit from your predictions.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">
            <E T="03">Financial Asset Management</E>
          </HD>
          <P>Using derivatives to diversify, rebalance, or otherwise allocate financial assets so that risks to the value of the investment portfolio are reduced. This strategy is used by entities such as pension funds and endowments to manage overall risk to their financial portfolios.</P>
          <P>E.g. You hold Treasury bonds as a component of your investment portfolio, and use futures contracts to reduce overall portfolio risk that would result from falling bond prices.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">
            <E T="03">Managing Proprietary Swaps Exposure</E>
          </HD>
          <P>Reducing risk stemming from your proprietary holding or execution of swaps contracts through the use of futures/options on futures markets.</P>
          <P>E.g. You trade interest rate swaps as part of your business or investment strategy, and offset some of the risk inherent in those swaps through your use of Eurodollar futures markets.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">
            <E T="03">Other: Specify</E>
          </HD>
          <P>List and explain your business purpose if the above categories do not adequately describe the reason you trade in a particular commodity derivative market.</P>

          <P>The following examples illustrate how swaps should be converted into futures equivalents. In general the total notional quantity for each swap should be apportioned to referent futures months based on <PRTPAGE P="529"/>the fraction of days remaining in the life of the swap during each referent futures month to the total duration of the swap, measured in days. The terms used in the examples are to be understood in a manner that is consistent with industry practice.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix B to Part 20—Explanatory Guidance on Data Record Layouts</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Record Layout Examples for § 20.3</HD>
          <P>The following example (in Tables 1, 2 and 3) covers reporting for a particular clearing organization. “Clearing Organization One” would report, for the 27th of September 2010, the following eleven unique data record submissions. Each data record submission represents a unique position, as indicated by § 20.3, held by a clearing member of Clearing Organization One. Paragraph (a) of § 20.3 broadly outlines the data elements that determine unique positions for reports on clearing member positions. Paragraphs (b) of § 20.3 present all of the data elements that should be submitted in reference to a particular data record for a particular clearing member (in Table 1). Paragraph (c) identifies data elements that would comprise end of day record data on cleared products (in Tables 2 and 3). Therefore, paragraphs (b) and (c) of § 20.3 present all of the data elements that should be submitted in reference to a particular data record.</P>
          <P>Because CFTC designated Clearing Organization One (in this example) currently has two clearing members, “Clearing Member One” and “Clearing Member Two,” positions cleared for these two distinct clearing members would be subdivided.</P>
          <P>In the following example it is assumed that the clearing member accounts are either proprietary or customer (but not both) and therefore data record submissions do not have to be delineated by these account types. However, if clearing members did have both proprietary and customer accounts, then a clearing organization would have to further subdivide these clearing member data records by these two account types.</P>
          <P>Clearing Member One currently has five positions with multiple cleared product IDs and futures equivalent months/years, and therefore these positions also constitute separate data records.</P>
          <P>Clearing Member Two currently has six positions with the following varying characteristics: Cleared product IDs; futures equivalent months/years; commodity reference prices; swaption positions that involve both puts and calls; and multiple strike prices. Accordingly, these positions must be reported in separate data records. An illustration of how these records would appear is included in Table 1 below. Clearing Organization One would also have to report the corresponding swaption position deltas, strike prices, expiration dates, and settlement prices and swap settlement prices. An illustration of these submissions is included in Tables 2 and 3 below.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">First Record Layout Example for § 20.4:</HD>
          <P>This first example shows the data records generated under § 20.4 by a single reporting firm for report date September 27, 2011. Each data record represents a unique part of a reportable position in heating oil and natural gas by the reporting entity and its counterparties. Paragraph (b) of § 20.4 outlines the data elements that determine unique positions.</P>
          <P>In this example, the reporting entity clears with one clearing organization and therefore the data records do not have to be delineated by clearing organization (there is a reportable position stemming from an uncleared transaction included as well). However, if the reporting entity in this example used multiple clearing organizations, then it would have to further subdivide its data submissions by each clearing organization.</P>
          <P>The reporting entity reports fifteen records; six principal positions and nine counterparty positions. The reported positions constitute separate data records because they vary by the following characteristics: swap counterparties; futures equivalent months/years; clearing organization cleared products; swaptions that were either cleared or uncleared; commodity reference prices; and whether the trade was entered into on or off execution facilities. An illustration of how these records would be reported is included in Table 4 below.</P>

          <P>For the calculation of notional values, assume for simplicity that the price of heating oil, for all contract months and for both reference prices, is $3/gal. Similarly, assume that the price of natural gas for all contract months is $4.25/MMBtu.
          </P>
          <NOTE>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
            <P>The bottom two rows in Table 4 indicate whether, for uncleared and cleared swaps and swaptions, data elements for which any difference in one of the elements constitutes a reason for a new data record (NDR).</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Second Record Layout Example for § 20.4:</HD>
          <P>In this second example, the data records generated by § 20.4(c) are displayed for a hypothetical swap, as detailed in Example 1 of appendix A. In contrast to the above example, this second example of a § 20.4(c) data record is simplistic in that it displays a situation where the position records arise from a single swap transaction, in one commodity, with a single counterparty.</P>

          <P>For the sake of this example, assume the swap dealer gained long exposure from the swap, and that the swap was cleared. The price of crude is assumed to be $100/bbl for all contract months on January 1 and $95/bbl for all contract months on January 2. An illustration of the data records generated for January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2011 as a result of this hypothetical swap can be found in Tables 5 and 6, respectively.<PRTPAGE P="540"/>

          <SUBJECT>Selected special calls-duties of foreign brokers, domestic and foreign traders, futures commission merchants, clearing members, introducing brokers, and reporting markets.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) For purposes of this section, the term “accounts of a futures commission merchant, clearing member or foreign broker” means all open contracts and transactions in futures and options on the records of the futures commission merchant, clearing member or foreign broker; the term “beneficial interest” means having or sharing in any rights, obligations or financial interest in any futures or options account; the term “customer” means any futures commission merchant, clearing member, introducing broker, foreign broker, or trader for whom a futures commission merchant, clearing member or reporting market that is a registered entity under section 1a(29) of the Act makes or causes to be made a futures or options contract. Paragraphs (e), (g) and (h) of this section shall not apply to any futures commission merchant, clearing member or customer whose books and records are open at all times to inspection in the United States by any representative of the Commission.</P>
          <P>(b) It shall be unlawful for a futures commission merchant to open a futures or options account or to effect transactions in futures or options contracts for an existing account, or for an introducing broker to introduce such an account, for any customer for whom the futures commission merchant or introducing broker is required to provide the explanation provided for in § 15.05(c) of this chapter, or for a reporting market that is a registered entity under section 1a(40)(F) of the Act, to cause to open an account, or to cause transactions to be effected, in a contract traded in reliance on a Commission grandfather relief order issued pursuant to Section 723(c)(2)(B) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Pub. L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010)), for an existing account for any person that is a foreign clearing member or foreign trader, until the futures commission merchant, introducing broker, clearing member or reporting market has explained fully to the customer, in any manner that such person deems appropriate, the provisions of this section.</P>
          <P>(c) Upon a determination by the Commission that information concerning accounts may be relevant information in enabling the Commission to determine whether the threat of a market manipulation, corner, squeeze, or other market disorder exists on any reporting market, the Commission may issue a call for information from a futures commission merchant, clearing member, introducing broker or customer pursuant to the provisions of this section.</P>

          <P>(d) In the event the call is issued to a foreign broker, foreign clearing member or foreign trader, its agent, designated pursuant to § 15.05 of this chapter, shall, if directed, promptly transmit calls made by the Commission pursuant to this section by electronic mail or a similarly expeditious means of communication.<PRTPAGE P="546"/>
          </P>
          <P>(e) The futures commission merchant, clearing member, introducing broker, or customer to whom the special call is issued must provide to the Commission the information specified below for the commodity, reporting market and delivery months or option expiration dates named in the call. Such information shall be filed at the place and within the time specified by the Commission.</P>
          <P>(1) For each account of a futures commission merchant, clearing member, introducing broker, or foreign broker, including those accounts in the name of the futures commission merchant, clearing member or foreign broker, on the dates specified in the call issued pursuant to this section, such persons shall provide the Commission with the following information:</P>
          <P>(i) The name and address of the person in whose name the account is carried or introduced and, if the person is not an individual, the name of the individual to contact regarding the account;</P>
          <P>(ii) The total open futures and options contracts in the account;</P>
          <P>(iii) The number of futures contracts against which delivery notices have been issued or received and the number against which exchanges of futures for cash have been transacted during the period of time specified in the call;</P>
          <P>(iv) Whether the account is carried for and in the name of another futures commission merchant, clearing member, introducing broker, or foreign broker; and</P>
          <P>(v) For the accounts which are not carried for and in the name of another futures commission merchant, clearing member, introducing broker, or foreign broker, the name and address of any other person who controls the trading of the account, and the name and address of any person who has a ten percent or more beneficial interest in the account.</P>
          <P>(2) Each trader shall provide the Commission with the following information:</P>
          <P>(i) The total open futures and options contracts owned or controlled on the dates specified in the call;</P>
          <P>(ii) The name and address of any person having a ten percent or more beneficial interest in the open futures or options contracts reported pursuant to this paragraph;</P>
          <P>(iii) The name and address of any other person who controls the trading of the open futures or options contracts reported pursuant to this paragraph; and</P>
          <P>(iv) The cash commodity transaction and position information required to be maintained pursuant to § 18.05 of this chapter as specified in the call which relates to futures or options positions of the trader in the United States.</P>
          <P>(f) If the Commission has reason to believe that any person has not responded as required to a call made pursuant to this section, the Commission in writing may inform the reporting market specified in the call and that reporting market shall prohibit the execution of, and no futures commission merchant, clearing member, introducing broker, or foreign broker shall effect a transaction in connection with trades on the reporting market and in the months or expiration dates specified in the call for or on behalf of the futures commission merchant or customer named in the call, unless such trades offset existing open contracts of such futures commission merchant or customer.</P>

          <P>(g) Any person named in a special call that believes he or she is or may be adversely affected or aggrieved by action taken by the Commission under paragraph (f) of this section shall have the opportunity for a prompt hearing after the Commission acts. That person may immediately present in writing to the Commission for its consideration any comments or arguments concerning the Commission's action and may present for Commission consideration any documentary or other evidence that person deems appropriate. Upon request, the Commission may, in its discretion, determine that an oral hearing be conducted to permit the further presentation of information and views concerning any matters by any or all such persons. The oral hearing may be held before the Commission or any person designated by the Commission, which person shall cause all evidence to be reduced to writing and forthwith transmit the same and a recommended decision to the Commission. The Commission's directive under <PRTPAGE P="547"/>paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect unless and until modified or withdrawn by the Commission.</P>
          <P>(h) If, during the course of or after the Commission acts pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, the Commission determines that it is appropriate to undertake a proceeding pursuant to section 6(c) of the Act, the Commission shall issue a complaint in accordance with the requirements of section 6(c), and, upon further determination by the Commission that the conditions described in paragraph (c) of this section still exist, a hearing pursuant to section 6(c) of the Act shall commence no later than five business days after service of the complaint. In the event the person served with the complaint under section 6(c) of the Act has, prior to the commencement of the hearing under section 6(c) of the Act, sought a hearing pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section and the Commission has determined to accord him such a hearing, the two hearings shall be conducted simultaneously. Nothing in this section shall preclude the Commission from taking other appropriate action under the Act or the Commission's regulations thereunder, including action under section 6(c) of the Act, regardless of whether the conditions described in paragraph (c) of this section still exist, and no ruling issued in the course of a hearing pursuant to paragraph (g) or this paragraph shall constitute an estoppel against the Commission in any other action.</P>

          <P>(3) <E T="03">Deposits of own money, securities, or other property.</E> (i) In order to ensure that it is always in compliance with paragraph (f) of this section, a futures commission merchant may place in an FCM Physical Location or deposit in a Cleared Swaps Customer Account its own money, securities, or other property (<E T="03">provided, that</E> such securities or other property are unencumbered and are of the types specified in § 1.25 of this chapter).</P>
          <P>(ii) Money, securities, or other property deposited by a futures commission merchant pursuant to 22.13(b) and available to a derivatives clearing organization or Collecting Futures Commission Merchant to meet the obligations of the futures commission merchant's Cleared Swaps Customers collectively, shall be maintained in an account separate from the Cleared Swaps Customer Account.</P>

          <P>(ii) The futures commission merchant shall have a residual financial interest in any portion of such money, securities, or other property in excess of that necessary for compliance with paragraph (f)(4) of this section.</P>

          <P>(iii) The futures commission merchant may withdraw money, securities, or other property from the FCM Physical Location or Cleared Swaps Customer Account, to the extent of its residual financial interest therein. At the time of such withdrawal, the futures commission merchant shall ensure that <PRTPAGE P="552"/>the withdrawal does not cause its residual financial interest to become less than zero.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Requirements as to amount.</E> (1) For purposes of this § 22.2(f), the term “account” shall reference the entries on the books and records of a futures commission merchant pertaining to the Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral of a particular Cleared Swaps Customer.</P>
          <P>(2) The futures commission merchant must reflect in the account that it maintains for each Cleared Swaps Customer, the net liquidating equity for each such Cleared Swaps Customer, calculated as follows: The market value of any Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral that it receives from such customer, as adjusted by:</P>
          <P>(i) Any uses permitted under paragraph (d) of this section;</P>
          <P>(ii) Any accruals on permitted investments of such collateral under paragraph (e) of this section that, pursuant to the futures commission merchant's customer agreement with that customer, are creditable to such customer;</P>
          <P>(iii) Any gains and losses with respect to Cleared Swaps;</P>
          <P>(iv) Any charges lawfully accruing to the Cleared Swaps Customer, including any commission, brokerage fee, interest, tax, or storage fee; and</P>
          <P>(v) Any appropriately authorized distribution or transfer of such collateral.</P>
          <P>(3) If the market value of Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral in the account of a Cleared Swaps Customer is positive after adjustments, then that account has a credit balance. If the market value of Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral in the account of a Cleared Swaps Customer is negative after adjustments, then that account has a debit balance.</P>
          <P>(4) The futures commission merchant must, at all times, maintain in segregation, in its FCM Physical Locations and/or its Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts at Permitted Depositories, an amount equal to the sum of any credit balances that the Cleared Swaps Customers of the futures commission merchant have in their accounts. This balance may not be reduced by any debit balances that the Cleared Swaps Customers of the futures commission merchants have in their accounts.</P>
          <P>(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the futures commission merchant must include, in calculating the sum referenced in paragraph (f)(4) of this section, any debit balance that a Cleared Swaps Customer may have in its account, to the extent that such balance is secured by “readily marketable securities” that the Cleared Swaps Customer deposited with the futures commission merchant.</P>
          <P>(i) For purposes of this section, “readily marketable” shall be defined as having a “ready market” as such latter term is defined in Rule 15c3-1(c)(11) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (§ 241.15c3-1(c)(11) of this title).</P>
          <P>(ii) In order for a debit balance to be deemed secured by “readily marketable securities,” the futures commission merchant must maintain a security interest in such securities, and must hold a written authorization to liquidate the securities at the discretion of the futures commission merchant.</P>
          <P>(iii) To determine the amount secured by “readily marketable securities,” the futures commission merchant shall:</P>
          <P>(A) Determine the market value of such securities; and</P>

          <P>(B) Reduce such market value by applicable percentage deductions (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> “securities haircuts”) as set forth in Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (§ 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi) of this title). Futures commission merchants that establish and enforce written policies and procedures to assess the credit risk of commercial paper, convertible debt instruments, or nonconvertible debt instruments in accordance with Rule 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (§ 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi) of this title) may apply the lower haircut percentages specified in Rule 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi) for such commercial paper, convertible debt instruments and nonconvertible debt instruments. The portion of the debit balance, not exceeding 100 percent, that is secured by the reduced market value of such readily marketable securities shall be included in calculating the sum referred to in paragraph (f)(4) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="553"/>
          </P>
          <P>(6)(i) The undermargined amount for a Cleared Swaps Customer Account is the amount, if any, by which:</P>

          <P>(ii) Each futures commission merchant must compute, based on the information available to the futures commission merchant as of the close of each business day,</P>

          <P>(B) A futures commission merchant may reduce the amount of residual interest required in paragraph (f)(6)(iii)(A) of this section to account for payments received from or on behalf of undermargined Cleared Swaps Customers (less the sum of any disbursements made to or on behalf of such customers) between the close of the previous business day and the time of settlement.</P>
          <P>(iv) For purposes of paragraph (f)(6)(ii) of this section, a Depositing Futures Commission Merchant should include, as clearing initial margin, customer initial margin that the Depositing Futures Commission Merchant will be required to maintain, for that Depositing Futures Commission Merchant's Cleared Swaps Customers, at a Collecting Futures Commission Merchant, and, for purposes of paragraph (f)(6)(iii) of this section, must do so prior to the time it must settle with that Collecting Futures Commission Merchant.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Policies and procedures governing disbursements of Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral from Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The provision in section 4d(f)(2) of the Act that prohibits the commingling of Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral with the funds of a futures commission merchant, shall not be construed to prevent a futures commission merchant from having a residual financial interest in the funds segregated as required by the Act and the regulations in this part and set apart for the benefit of Cleared Swaps Customers; nor shall such provisions be construed to prevent a futures commission merchant from adding to such segregated funds such amount or amounts of money, from its own funds or unencumbered securities from its own inventory, of the type set forth in § 1.25 of this chapter, as it may deem necessary to ensure any and all Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts are not undersegregated at any time.</P>

          <P>(b) A futures commission merchant may not withdraw funds, except withdrawals that are made to or for the benefit of Cleared Swaps Customers, from a Cleared Swaps Customer Account unless the futures commission merchant has prepared the daily segregation calculation required by § 22.2 <PRTPAGE P="562"/>as of the close of business on the previous business day. A futures commission merchant that has completed its daily segregation calculation may make withdrawals, in addition to withdrawals that are made to or for the benefit of Cleared Swaps Customers, to the extent of its actual residual financial interest in funds held in segregated accounts, including the withdrawal of securities held in segregated safekeeping accounts held by a bank, trust company, derivatives clearing organization or other futures commission merchant. Such withdrawal(s) shall not result in the funds of one Cleared Swaps Customer being used to purchase, margin or carry the trades, contracts or swaps positions, or extend the credit of any other Cleared Swaps Customer or other person.</P>
          <P>(c) A futures commission merchant may not withdraw funds, in a single transaction or a series of transactions, that are not made to or for the benefit of Cleared Swaps Customers from Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts if such withdrawal(s) would exceed 25 percent of the futures commission merchant's residual interest in such accounts as reported on the daily segregation calculation required by § 22.2 and computed as of the close of business on the previous business day, unless:</P>
          <P>(1) The futures commission merchant's chief executive officer, chief finance officer or other senior official that is listed as a principal of the futures commission merchant on its Form 7-R and is knowledgeable about the futures commission merchant's financial requirements and financial position pre-approves in writing the withdrawal, or series of withdrawals;</P>
          <P>(2) The futures commission merchant files written notice of the withdrawal or series of withdrawals, with the Commission and with its designated self-regulatory organization immediately after the chief executive officer, chief finance officer or other senior official pre-approves the withdrawal or series of withdrawals. The written notice must:</P>
          <P>(i) Be signed by the chief executive officer, chief finance officer or other senior official that pre-approved the withdrawal, and give notice that the futures commission merchant has withdrawn or intends to withdraw more than 25 percent of its residual interest in such accounts holding Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts funds;</P>
          <P>(ii) Include a description of the reasons for the withdrawal or series of withdrawals;</P>
          <P>(iii) List the amount of funds provided to each recipient and the name of each recipient;</P>
          <P>(iv) Include the current estimate of the amount of the futures commission merchant's residual interest in the swaps customer funds after the withdrawal;</P>
          <P>(v) Contain a representation by the chief executive officer, chief finance officer or other senior official that pre-approved the withdrawal, or series of withdrawals, that, after due diligence, to such person's knowledge and reasonable belief, the futures commission merchant remains in compliance with the segregation requirements after the withdrawal. The chief executive officer, chief finance officer or other senior official must consider the daily segregation calculation as of the close of business on the previous business day and any other factors that may cause a material change in the futures commission's residual interest since the close of business the previous business day, including known unsecured customer debits or deficits, current day market activity and any other withdrawals made from the Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts; and</P>

          <P>(vi) Any such written notice filed with the Commission must be filed via electronic transmission using a form of user authentication assigned in accordance with procedures established by or approved by the Commission, and otherwise in accordance with instruction issued by or approved by the Commission. Any such electronic submission must clearly indicate the registrant on whose behalf such filing is made and the use of such user authentication in submitting such filing will constitute and become a substitute for the manual signature of the authorized signer. Any written notice filed must be followed up with direct communication to the Regional office of Commission which has supervisory authority over the futures commission merchant <PRTPAGE P="563"/>whereby the Commission acknowledges receipt of the notice; and</P>
          <P>(3) After making a withdrawal requiring the approval and notice required in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, and before the next daily segregated funds calculation, no futures commission merchant may make any further withdrawals from accounts holding Cleared Swaps Customer Account funds, except to or for the benefit of Cleared Swaps Customers, without complying with paragraph (c)(1) of this section and filing a written notice with the Commission under paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section and its designated self-regulatory organization signed by the chief executive officer, chief finance officer, or other senior official. The written notice must:</P>
          <P>(i) List the amount of funds provided to each recipient and each recipient's name;</P>
          <P>(ii) Disclose the reason for each withdrawal;</P>
          <P>(iii) Confirm that the chief executive officer, chief finance officer, or other senior official (and identify of the person if different from the person who signed the notice) pre-approved the withdrawal in writing;</P>
          <P>(iv) Disclose the current estimate of the futures commission merchant's remaining total residual interest in the segregated accounts holding Cleared Swaps Customer Account funds after the withdrawal; and</P>
          <P>(v) Include a representation that to the best of the notice signatory's knowledge and reasonable belief the futures commission merchant remains in compliance with the segregation requirements after the withdrawal.</P>
          <P>(d) If a futures commission merchant withdraws funds that are not for the benefit of Cleared Swaps Customers from Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts, and the withdrawal causes the futures commission merchant to not hold sufficient funds in Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts to meet its targeted residual interest, as required to be computed under § 1.11 of this chapter, the futures commission merchant must deposit its own funds into the Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts to restore the targeted amount of residual interest on the next business day, or, if appropriate, revise the futures commission merchant's targeted amount of residual interest pursuant to the policies and procedures required by § 1.11 of this chapter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the futures commission merchant's residual interest in Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts is less than the amount required to be maintained by § 22.2 at any particular point in time, the futures commission merchant must immediately restore the residual interest to exceed the sum of such amounts. Any proprietary funds deposited in Cleared Swaps Customer Accounts must be unencumbered and otherwise compliant with § 1.25 of this chapter, as applicable.</P>
          <P>(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, a futures commission merchant may not withdraw funds that are not for the benefit of Cleared Swaps Customers from a Cleared Swaps Customer Account unless the futures commission merchant follows its policies and procedures required by § 1.11 of this chapter.</P>

            <P>(ii) A covered swap entity shall demonstrate that the model satisfies all of the requirements of this section on an ongoing basis.</P>
            <P>(iii) A covered swap entity shall notify the Commission and the registered futures association in writing 60 days prior to:</P>
            <P>(A) Extending the use of an initial margin model that has been approved to an additional product type;</P>
            <P>(B) Making any change to any initial margin model that has been approved that would result in a material change in the covered swap entity's assessment of initial margin requirements; or</P>
            <P>(C) Making any material change to modeling assumptions used by the initial margin model.</P>
            <P>(iv) The Commission or the registered futures association may rescind approval of the use of any initial margin model, in whole or in part, or may impose additional conditions or requirements if the Commission or the registered futures association determines, in its discretion, that the model no longer complies with this section.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Elements of the model.</E> (i) The initial margin model shall calculate an amount of initial margin that is equal to the potential future exposure of the uncleared swap or netting portfolio of uncleared swaps covered by an eligible master netting agreement. Potential future exposure is an estimate of the one-tailed 99 percent confidence interval for an increase in the value of the uncleared swap or netting portfolio of uncleared swaps due to an instantaneous price shock that is equivalent to a movement in all material underlying risk factors, including prices, rates, and spreads, over a holding period equal to the shorter of ten business days or the maturity of the swap or netting portfolio.</P>
            <P>(ii) All data used to calibrate the initial margin model shall be based on an equally weighted historical observation period of at least one year and not more than five years and must incorporate a period of significant financial stress for each broad asset class that is appropriate to the uncleared swaps to which the initial margin model is applied.</P>
            <P>(iii) The initial margin model shall use risk factors sufficient to measure all material price risks inherent in the transactions for which initial margin is being calculated. The risk categories shall include, but should not be limited to, foreign exchange or interest rate risk, credit risk, equity risk, and commodity risk, as appropriate. For material exposures in significant currencies and markets, modeling techniques shall capture spread and basis risk and shall incorporate a sufficient number of segments of the yield curve to capture differences in volatility and imperfect correlation of rates along the yield curve.</P>
            <P>(iv) In the case of an uncleared cross-currency swap, the initial margin model need not recognize any risks or risk factors associated with the fixed, physically-settled foreign exchange transactions associated with the exchange of principal embedded in the uncleared cross-currency swap. The initial margin model must recognize all material risks and risk factors associated with all other payments and cash flows that occur during the life of the uncleared cross-currency swap.</P>

            <P>(v) The initial margin model may calculate initial margin for an uncleared swap or netting portfolio of uncleared swaps covered by an eligible master netting agreement. It may reflect offsetting exposures, diversification, and other hedging benefits for uncleared swaps that are governed by <PRTPAGE P="574"/>the same eligible master netting agreement by incorporating empirical correlations within the following broad risk categories, provided the covered swap entity validates and demonstrates the reasonableness of its process for modeling and measuring hedging benefits: Commodity, credit, equity, and foreign exchange or interest rate. Empirical correlations under an eligible master netting agreement may be recognized by the model within each broad risk category, but not across broad risk categories.</P>
            <P>(vi) If the initial margin model does not explicitly reflect offsetting exposures, diversification, and hedging benefits between subsets of uncleared swaps within a broad risk category, the covered swap entity shall calculate an amount of initial margin separately for each subset of uncleared swaps for which such relationships are explicitly recognized by the model. The sum of the initial margin amounts calculated for each subset of uncleared swaps within a broad risk category will be used to determine the aggregate initial margin due from the counterparty for the portfolio of uncleared swaps within the broad risk category.</P>
            <P>(vii) The sum of the initial margin calculated for each broad risk category shall be used to determine the aggregate initial margin due from the counterparty.</P>
            <P>(viii) The initial margin model shall not permit the calculation of any initial margin to be offset by, or otherwise take into account, any initial margin that may be owed or otherwise payable by the covered swap entity to the counterparty.</P>
            <P>(ix) The initial margin model shall include all material risks arising from the nonlinear price characteristics of option positions or positions with embedded optionality and the sensitivity of the market value of the positions to changes in the volatility of the underlying rates, prices, or other material risk factors.</P>
            <P>(x) The covered swap entity shall not omit any risk factor from the calculation of its initial margin that the covered swap entity uses in its model unless it has first demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commission or the registered futures association that such omission is appropriate.</P>
            <P>(xi) The covered swap entity shall not incorporate any proxy or approximation used to capture the risks of the covered swap entity's uncleared swaps unless it has first demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commission or the registered futures association that such proxy or approximation is appropriate.</P>
            <P>(xii) The covered swap entity shall have a rigorous and well-defined process for re-estimating, re-evaluating, and updating its internal margin models to ensure continued applicability and relevance.</P>
            <P>(xiii) The covered swap entity shall review and, as necessary, revise the data used to calibrate the initial margin model at least annually, and more frequently as market conditions warrant, to ensure that the data incorporate a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the uncleared swaps to which the initial margin model is applied.</P>
            <P>(xiv) The level of sophistication of the initial margin model shall be commensurate with the complexity of the swaps to which it is applied. In calculating an initial margin amount, the initial margin model may make use of any of the generally accepted approaches for modeling the risk of a single instrument or portfolio of instruments.</P>
            <P>(xv) The Commission or the registered futures association may in its discretion require a covered swap entity using an initial margin model to collect a greater amount of initial margin than that determined by the covered swap entity's initial margin model if the Commission or the registered futures association determines that the additional collateral is appropriate due to the nature, structure, or characteristics of the covered swap entity's transaction(s) or is commensurate with the risks associated with the transaction(s).</P>
            <P>(3) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Periodic review.</E> A covered swap entity shall periodically, but no less frequently than annually, review its initial margin model in light of developments in financial markets and modeling technologies, and enhance the <PRTPAGE P="575"/>initial margin model as appropriate to ensure that it continues to meet the requirements for approval in this section.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Control, oversight, and validation mechanisms.</E> (i) The covered swap entity shall maintain a risk management unit in accordance with § 23.600(c)(4)(i) that is independent from the business trading unit (as defined in § 23.600).</P>
            <P>(ii) The covered swap entity's risk control unit shall validate its initial margin model prior to implementation and on an ongoing basis. The covered swap entity's validation process shall be independent of the development, implementation, and operation of the initial margin model, or the validation process shall be subject to an independent review of its adequacy and effectiveness. The validation process shall include:</P>
            <P>(A) An evaluation of the conceptual soundness of (including developmental evidence supporting) the initial margin model;</P>
            <P>(B) An ongoing monitoring process that includes verification of processes and benchmarking by comparing the covered swap entity's initial margin model outputs (estimation of initial margin) with relevant alternative internal and external data sources or estimation techniques. The benchmark(s) must address the model's limitations. When applicable the covered swap entity should consider benchmarks that allow for non-normal distributions such as historical and Monte Carlo simulations. When applicable validation shall include benchmarking against observable margin standards to ensure that the initial margin required is not less than what a derivatives clearing organization would require for similar cleared transactions; and</P>
            <P>(C) An outcomes analysis process that includes back testing the model. This analysis shall recognize and compensate for the challenges inherent in back testing over periods that do not contain significant financial stress.</P>
            <P>(iii) If the validation process reveals any material problems with the model, the covered swap entity must promptly notify the Commission and the registered futures association of the problems, describe to the Commission and the registered futures association any remedial actions being taken, and adjust the model to ensure an appropriately conservative amount of required initial margin is being calculated.</P>
            <P>(iv) In accordance with § 23.600(e)(2), the covered swap entity shall have an internal audit function independent of the business trading unit and the risk management unit that at least annually assesses the effectiveness of the controls supporting the initial margin model measurement systems, including the activities of the business trading units and risk control unit, compliance with policies and procedures, and calculation of the covered swap entity's initial margin requirements under this part. At least annually, the internal audit function shall report its findings to the covered swap entity's governing body, senior management, and chief compliance officer.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Documentation.</E> The covered swap entity shall adequately document all material aspects of its model, including management and valuation of uncleared swaps to which it applies, the control, oversight, and validation of the initial margin model, any review processes and the results of such processes.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Escalation procedures.</E> The covered swap entity must adequately document—</P>
            <P>(i) Internal authorization procedures, including escalation procedures, that require review and approval of any change to the initial margin calculation under the initial margin model;</P>
            <P>(ii) Demonstrable analysis that any basis for any such change is consistent with the requirements of this section; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Independent review of such demonstrable analysis and approval.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Table-based method.</E> If a model meeting the standards set forth in paragraph (b) of this section is not used, initial margin shall be calculated in accordance with this paragraph.</P>

            <P>(ii) Whether the relevant foreign jurisdiction's margin requirements achieve comparable outcomes to the Commission's corresponding margin requirements;</P>
            <P>(iii) The ability of the relevant regulatory authority or authorities to supervise and enforce compliance with the relevant foreign jurisdiction's margin requirements; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Any other facts and circumstances the Commission deems relevant.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Reliance.</E> Any covered swap entity that, in accordance with a Comparability Determination, complies with a foreign jurisdiction's margin requirements, would be deemed to be in compliance with the Commission's corresponding margin requirements. Accordingly, if the Commission determines that a covered swap entity has failed to comply with the foreign jurisdiction's margin requirements, it could initiate an action for a violation of the Commission's margin requirements. All covered swap entities, regardless of whether they rely on a Comparability Determination, remain subject to the Commission's examination and enforcement authority.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Conditions.</E> In issuing a Comparability Determination, the Commission may impose any terms and conditions it deems appropriate.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Modifications.</E> The Commission reserves the right to further condition, modify, suspend, terminate or otherwise restrict a Comparability Determination in the Commission's discretion.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Delegation of authority.</E> The Commission hereby delegates to the Director of the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight, or such other employee or employees as the Director may designate from time to time, the authority to request information and/or documentation in connection with the Commission's issuance of a Comparability Determination.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Non-netting jurisdiction requirements.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, if a CSE cannot conclude after sufficient legal review with a well-founded basis that the netting agreement described in § 23.152(c) meets the definition of “eligible master netting agreement” set forth in § 23.151, the CSE must treat the uncleared swaps covered by the agreement on a gross basis for the purposes of calculating and complying with the requirements of § 23.152(a) and § 23.153(a) to collect margin, but the CSE may net those uncleared swaps in accordance with § 23.152(c) and § 23.153(d) for the purposes of calculating and complying with the requirements of this part to post margin. A CSE that relies on this paragraph (d) must have policies and procedures ensuring that it is in compliance with the requirements of this paragraph, and maintain books and records properly documenting that all of the requirements of this paragraph (d) are satisfied.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Jurisdictions Where Compliance with Custodial Arrangement Requirements is Unavailable.</E> Sections 23.152(b), 23.157(b), and paragraph (d) of this section do not apply to an uncleared swap entered into by a Foreign Consolidated Subsidiary or a foreign branch of a U.S. CSE if:<PRTPAGE P="585"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) Inherent limitations in the legal or operational infrastructure in the applicable foreign jurisdiction make it impracticable for the CSE and its counterparty to post any form of eligible initial margin collateral recognized pursuant to § 23.156 in compliance with the custodial arrangement requirements of § 23.157;</P>
            <P>(2) The CSE is subject to foreign regulatory restrictions that require the CSE to transact in uncleared swaps with the counterparty through an establishment within the foreign jurisdiction and do not accommodate the posting of collateral for the uncleared swap in compliance with the custodial arrangements of § 23.157 in the United States or a jurisdiction for which the Commission has issued a comparability determination under paragraph (c) of this section with respect to § 23.157;</P>
            <P>(3) The counterparty to the uncleared swap is a non-U.S. person that is not a CSE, and the counterparty's obligations under the uncleared swap are not guaranteed by a U.S. person;</P>
            <P>(4) The CSE collects initial margin for the uncleared swap in accordance with § 23.152(a) in the form of cash pursuant to § 23.156(a)(1)(i), and posts and collects variation margin in accordance with § 23.153(a) in the form of cash pursuant to § 23.156(a)(1)(i);</P>
            <P>(5) For each broad risk category, as set out in § 23.154(b)(2)(v), the total outstanding notional value of all uncleared swaps in that broad risk category, as to which the CSE is relying on this paragraph (e), may not exceed 5% of the CSE's total outstanding notional value for all uncleared swaps in the same broad risk category;</P>
            <P>(6) The CSE has policies and procedures ensuring that it is in compliance with the requirements of this paragraph (e); and</P>
            <P>(7) The CSE maintains books and records properly documenting that all of the requirements of this paragraph (e) are satisfied.</P>

            <P>(b) Once a covered swap entity and its counterparty must comply with the margin requirements for uncleared swaps based on the compliance dates in paragraph (a) of this section, the covered swap entity and its counterparty shall remain subject to the requirements of §§ 23.150 through 23.161 with respect to that counterparty.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) If a covered swap entity's counterparty changes its status such that an uncleared swap with that counterparty becomes subject to a stricter margin requirement under §§ 23.150 through 23.161 (for example, if the counterparty's status changes from a financial end user without material swaps exposure to a financial end user with material swaps exposure), then the covered swap entity shall comply with the stricter margin requirements for any uncleared swaps entered into with that counterparty after the counterparty changes its status.</P>
            <P>(2) If a covered swap entity's counterparty changes its status such that an uncleared swap with that counterparty becomes subject to less strict margin requirement under §§ 23.150 through 23.161 (for example, if the counterparty's status changes from a financial end user with material swaps exposure to a financial end user without material swaps exposure), then the covered swap entity may comply with the less strict margin requirements for any uncleared swaps entered into with that counterparty after the counterparty changes its status as well as for any outstanding uncleared swap entered into after the applicable compliance date under paragraph (a) of this section and before the counterparty changed its status.</P>

            <P>(d) For purposes of determining whether an uncleared swap was entered into prior to the applicable compliance <PRTPAGE P="587"/>date under this section, a covered swap entity may disregard:</P>
            <P>(1) Amendments to the uncleared swap that were entered into solely to comply with the requirements of 12 CFR part 47; 12 CFR part 252, subpart I; or 12 CFR part 382, as applicable; or</P>

            <P>(ii) Solely in connection with a party to the swap's planning for or response to the event described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, one or both parties to the swap transfers the swap to its margin affiliate, or a branch or other authorized form of establishment of the transferor, and the parties make no other transfers of the swap; and</P>
            <P>(A) A covered swap entity is a transferee from a party to the swap; or</P>
            <P>(B) A covered swap entity is a remaining party to the swap, and the transferor represents to the covered swap entity that the transferee is a margin affiliate, or a branch or other authorized form of establishment of the transferor, and the transfer was made solely in connection with the transferor's planning for or response to the event described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The amendments do not modify any of the following: the payment amount calculation methods, the maturity date, or the notional amount of the swap; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The amendments take effect no earlier than the date of the event described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section transpires; and</P>
            <P>(v) The amendments take effect no later than:</P>
            <P>(A) The date that is one year after the date of the event described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section; or</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Subpart H of Part 23— Guidance on the Application of §§ 23.434 and 23.440 for Swap Dealers That Make Recommendations to Counterparties or Special Entities</HD>
            <P>The following provides guidance on the application of §§ 23.434 and 23.440 to swap dealers that make recommendations to counterparties or Special Entities.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 23.434—Recommendations to Counterparties—Institutional Suitability</HD>
            <P>A swap dealer that recommends a swap or trading strategy involving a swap to a counterparty, other than a swap dealer, major swap participant, security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, must undertake reasonable diligence to understand the potential risks and rewards associated with the recommended swap or trading strategy involving a swap—general suitability (§ 23.434(a)(1))—and have a reasonable basis to believe that the recommended swap or trading strategy involving a swap is suitable for the counterparty—specific suitability (§ 23.434(a)(2)). To satisfy the general suitability obligation, a swap dealer must undertake reasonable diligence that will vary depending on, among other things, the complexity of and risks associated with the swap or swap trading strategy and the swap dealer's familiarity with the swap or swap trading strategy. At a minimum, a swap dealer's reasonable diligence must provide it with an understanding of the potential risks and rewards associated with the recommended swap or swap trading strategy.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Recommendation.</E> Whether a communication between a swap dealer and a counterparty is a recommendation will turn on the facts and circumstances of the particular situation. There are, however, certain factors the Commission will consider in reaching such a determination. The facts and circumstances determination of whether a communication is a “recommendation” requires an analysis of the content, context, and presentation of the particular communication or set of communications. The determination of whether a “recommendation” has been made, moreover, is an objective rather than a subjective inquiry. An important factor in this regard is whether, given <PRTPAGE P="603"/>its content, context, and manner of presentation, a particular communication from a swap dealer to a counterparty reasonably would be viewed as a “call to action,” or suggestion that the counterparty enter into a swap. An analysis of the content, context, and manner of presentation of a communication requires examination of the underlying substantive information transmitted to the counterparty and consideration of any other facts and circumstances, such as any accompanying explanatory message from the swap dealer. Additionally, the more individually tailored the communication to a specific counterparty or a targeted group of counterparties about a swap, group of swaps or trading strategy involving the use of a swap, the greater the likelihood that the communication may be viewed as a “recommendation.”</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Safe harbor.</E> A swap dealer may satisfy the safe harbor requirements of § 23.434(b) to fulfill its counterparty-specific suitability duty under § 23.434(a)(2) if: (1) The swap dealer reasonably determines that the counterparty, or an agent to which the counterparty has delegated decision-making authority, is capable of independently evaluating investment risks with regard to the relevant swap or trading strategy involving a swap; (2) the counterparty or its agent represents in writing that it is exercising independent judgment in evaluating the recommendations of the swap dealer; (3) the swap dealer discloses in writing that it is acting in its capacity as a counterparty and is not undertaking to assess the suitability of the recommendation; and (4) in the case of a counterparty that is a Special Entity, the swap dealer complies with § 23.440 where the recommendation would cause the swap dealer to act as an advisor to a Special Entity within the meaning of § 23.440(a).</P>
            <P>To reasonably determine that the counterparty, or an agent to which the counterparty has delegated decision-making authority, is capable of independently evaluating investment risks of a recommendation, the swap dealer can rely on the written representations of the counterparty, as provided in § 23.434(c). Section 23.434(c)(1) provides that a swap dealer will satisfy § 23.434(b)(1)'s requirement with respect to a counterparty other than a Special Entity if it receives representations that the counterparty has complied in good faith with the counterparty's policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the persons responsible for evaluating the recommendation and making trading decisions on behalf of the counterparty are capable of doing so. Section § 23.434(c)(2) provides that a swap dealer will satisfy § 23.434(b)(1)'s requirement with respect to a Special Entity if it receives representations that satisfy the terms of § 23.450(d) regarding a Special Entity's qualified independent representative.</P>
            <P>Prong (4) of the safe harbor clarifies that § 23.434's application is broader than § 23.440—Requirements for Swap Dealers Acting as Advisors to Special Entities. Section 23.434 is triggered when a swap dealer recommends any swap or trading strategy that involves a swap to any counterparty. However, § 23.440 is limited to a swap dealer's recommendations (1) to a Special Entity (2) of swaps that are tailored to the particular needs or characteristics of the Special Entity. Thus, a swap dealer that recommends a swap to a Special Entity that is tailored to the particular needs or characteristics of the Special Entity may comply with its suitability obligation by satisfying the safe harbor in § 23.434(b); however, the swap dealer must also comply with § 23.440 in such circumstances.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 23.440—Requirements for Swap Dealers Acting as Advisors to Special Entities</HD>
            <P>A swap dealer “acts as an advisor to a Special Entity” under § 23.440 when the swap dealer recommends a swap or trading strategy involving a swap that is tailored to the particular needs or characteristics of the Special Entity. A swap dealer that “acts as an advisor to a Special Entity” has a duty to make a reasonable determination that a recommendation is in the “best interests” of the Special Entities and must undertake “reasonable efforts” to obtain information necessary to make such a determination.</P>
            <P>Whether a swap dealer “acts as an advisor to a Special Entity” will depend on: (1) Whether the swap dealer has made a recommendation to a Special Entity; and (2) whether the recommendation concerns a swap or trading strategy involving a swap that is tailored to the particular needs or characteristics of the Special Entity. To determine whether a communication between a swap dealer and counterparty is a recommendation, the Commission will apply the same factors as under § 23.434, the suitability rule. However, unlike the suitability rule, which covers recommendations regarding any type of swap or trading strategy involving a swap, the “acts as an advisor rule” and “best interests” duty will be triggered only if the recommendation is of a swap or trading strategy involving a swap that is “tailored to the particular needs or characteristics of the Special Entity.”</P>

            <P>Whether a swap is tailored to the particular needs or characteristics of the Special Entity will depend on the facts and circumstances. Swaps with terms that are tailored or customized to a specific Special Entity's needs or objectives, or swaps with terms that are designed for a targeted group of Special Entities that share common characteristics, e.g., school districts, are likely to be viewed as tailored to the particular <PRTPAGE P="604"/>needs or characteristics of the Special Entity. Generally, however, the Commission would not view a swap that is “made available for trading” on a designated contract market or swap execution facility, as provided in Section 2(h)(8) of the Act, as tailored to the particular needs or characteristics of the Special Entity.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Safe harbor.</E> Under § 23.440(b)(2), when dealing with a Special Entity (including a Special Entity that is an employee benefit plan as defined in § 23.401(c)(3)), <SU>1</SU>
              <FTREF/> a swap dealer will not “act as an advisor to a Special Entity” if: (1) The swap dealer does not express an opinion as to whether the Special Entity should enter into a recommended swap or swap trading strategy that is tailored to the particular needs or characteristics of the Special Entity; (2) the Special Entity represents in writing, in accordance with § 23.402(d), that it will not rely on the swap dealer's recommendations and will rely on advice from a qualified independent representative within the meaning of § 23.450; and (3) the swap dealer discloses that it is not undertaking to act in the best interests of the Special Entity.</P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>1</SU> The guidance in this appendix regarding the safe harbor to § 23.440 is limited to the safe harbor for any Special Entity under § 23.440(b)(2). A swap dealer may separately comply with the safe harbor under § 23.440(b)(1) for its communications to a Special Entity that is an employee benefit plan as defined in § 23.401(c)(3).</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>A swap dealer that elects to communicate within the safe harbor to avoid triggering the “best interests” duty must appropriately manage its communications. To clarify the type of communications that they will make under the safe harbor, the Commission expects that swap dealers may specifically represent that they will not express an opinion as to whether the Special Entity should enter into a recommended swap or trading strategy, and that for such advice the Special Entity should consult its own advisor. Nothing in the final rule would preclude such a representation from being included in counterparty relationship documentation. However, such a representation would not act as a safe harbor under the rule where, contrary to the representation, the swap dealer does express an opinion to the Special Entity as to whether it should enter into a recommended swap or trading strategy.</P>
            <P>If a swap dealer complies with the terms of the safe harbor, the following types of communications would not be subject to the “best interests” duty: <SU>2</SU>
              <FTREF/> (1) Providing information that is general transaction, financial, educational, or market information; (2) offering a swap or trading strategy involving a swap, including swaps that are tailored to the needs or characteristics of a Special Entity; (3) providing a term sheet, including terms for swaps that are tailored to the needs or characteristics of a Special Entity; (4) responding to a request for a quote from a Special Entity; (5) providing trading ideas for swaps or swap trading strategies, including swaps that are tailored to the needs or characteristics of a Special Entity; and (6) providing marketing materials upon request or on an unsolicited basis about swaps or swap trading strategies, including swaps that are tailored to the needs or characteristics of a Special Entity. This list of communications is not exclusive and should not create a negative implication that other types of communications are subject to a “best interests” duty.</P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>2</SU> Communications on the list that are not within the meaning of the term “acts as an advisor to a Special Entity” are outside the requirements of § 23.440. By including such communications on the list, the Commission does not intend to suggest that they are “recommendations.” Thus, a swap dealer that does not “act as an advisor to a Special Entity” within the meaning of § 23.440(a) is not required to comply with the safe harbor to avoid the “best interests” duty with respect to its communications.</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>The safe harbor in § 23.440(b)(2) allows a wide range of communications and interactions between swap dealers and Special Entities without invoking the “best interests” duty, including discussions of the advantages or disadvantages of different swaps or trading strategies. The Commission notes, however, that depending on the facts and circumstances, some of the examples on the list could be “recommendations” that would trigger a suitability obligation under § 23.434. However, the Commission has determined that such activities would not, by themselves, prompt the “best interests” duty in § 23.440, provided that the parties comply with the other requirements of § 23.440(b)(2). All of the swap dealer's communications, however, must be made in a fair and balanced manner based on principles of fair dealing and good faith in compliance with § 23.433.</P>

            <P>Swap dealers engage in a wide variety of communications with counterparties in the normal course of business, including but not limited to the six types of communications listed above. Whether any particular communication will be deemed to be a “recommendation” within the meaning of §§ 23.434 or 23.440 will depend on the facts and circumstances of the particular communication considered in light of the guidance in this appendix with respect to the meaning of the term “recommendation.” Swap dealers that choose to manage their communications to comply with the safe harbors provided in §§ 23.434 and 23.440 will be able to <PRTPAGE P="605"/>limit the duty they owe to counterparties, including Special Entities, provided that the parties exchange the appropriate representations.</P>

A person who receives confirmation of an exemption pursuant to this section must engage in all transactions subject to regulation under part 30 through a registered futures commission merchant or a foreign broker who has received confirmation of an exemption pursuant to § 30.10 in accordance with the provisions of § 30.3(b).</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Agent for service of process.</E> Any person who seeks exemption from registration under this part shall enter into a written agency agreement with the futures commission merchant located in the United States through which business is done, with any registered futures association, or any other person located in the United States in the business of providing services as an agent for service of process, pursuant to which agreement such futures commission merchant or other person is authorized to serve as the agent of such person for purposes of accepting delivery and service of communications issued by or on behalf of the Commission, U.S. Department of Justice, any self-regulatory organization, or any foreign futures or foreign options customer. If the written agency agreement is entered into with any person other than the futures commission merchant through which business is done, the futures commission merchant or foreign broker who has received confirmation of an exemption pursuant to § 30.10 with whom business is conducted must be expressly identified in such agency agreement. Service or delivery of any communication issued by or on behalf of the Commission, U.S. Department of Justice, any self-regulatory organization or any foreign futures or foreign options customer, pursuant to such agreement, shall constitute valid and effective service or delivery upon such person. Unless otherwise specified by the Commission, the agreement required by this section shall be filed with the National Futures Association.

Upon notice, a futures commission merchant shall not accept from the person that has entered into such agreement any order, other than liquidating order(s), for, or on behalf of a foreign futures or foreign options customer. Notwithstanding the termination of the agreement referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, service or delivery of any communication issued by or on behalf of the Commission, U.S. Department of Justice, any self-regulatory organization, or any foreign futures or foreign options customer pursuant to the agreement shall nonetheless constitute valid and effective service or delivery upon such person with respect to any transaction entered into on or before the date of the termination of the agreement.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Applicability of other rules.</E> Any person who is located outside of the United States, its territories or possessions, and who, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, is exempt from registration as an introducing broker, commodity pool operator or commodity trading advisor under this part, shall nonetheless comply with the provisions of § 30.6 of this part and §§ 1.37 and 1.57 of this chapter as if registered in such capacity.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Treatment of foreign futures or foreign options secured amount.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Except as provided in this section, a futures commission merchant must at all times maintain in a separate account or accounts money, securities and property in an amount at least sufficient to cover or satisfy all of its obligations to 30.7 customers denominated as the foreign futures or foreign options secured amount. In computing the foreign futures or foreign options secured amount, a futures commission merchant may offset any net deficit in a particular 30.7 customer's account against the current market value of readily marketable securities held for the same particular 30.7 customer's account as provided for in paragraph (l) of this section. The amount that must be deposited in such separate account or accounts for 30.7 customers must be no less than the amount required to be held in a separate account or accounts for or on behalf of 30.7 customers pursuant to any law, or rule, regulation or order thereunder, or any rule of any self-regulatory organization authorized thereunder, in the jurisdiction in which the depository or the 30.7 customer, as appropriate, is located.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Location of 30.7 customer funds.</E> A futures commission merchant shall deposit the foreign futures or foreign options secured amount under an account name that clearly identifies the funds as belonging to 30.7 customers and shows that the foreign futures or foreign options secured amount is set aside as required by this part. A futures commission merchant may deposit funds set aside as the foreign futures or foreign options secured amount with the following depositories:</P>
          <P>(1) A bank or trust company located in the United States;</P>

          <P>(2) A bank or trust company located outside the United States that has in excess of $1 billion of regulatory capital;<PRTPAGE P="635"/>
          </P>
          <P>(3) A futures commission merchant registered as such with the Commission;</P>
          <P>(4) A derivatives clearing organization;</P>
          <P>(5) The clearing organization of any foreign board of trade;</P>
          <P>(6) A member of any foreign board of trade; or</P>

          <P>(c) <E T="03">Limitation on holding foreign futures or foreign options secured amount outside of the United States.</E> A futures commission merchant may not deposit or hold the foreign futures or foreign options secured amount in accounts maintained outside of the United States with any of the depositories listed in paragraph (b) of this section except to meet margin requirements, including prefunding margin requirements, established by rule, regulation, or order of foreign boards of trade or foreign clearing organizations, or to meet margin calls issued by foreign brokers carrying the 30.7 customers' foreign futures and foreign option positions; <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> that a futures commission merchant may deposit an additional amount of up to 20 percent of the total amount of funds necessary to meet margin and prefunding margin requirements to avoid daily transfers of funds between the futures commission merchant's 30.7 accounts maintained in the United States and those maintained outside of the United States. A futures commission merchant must deposit 30.7 customer funds under the laws and regulations of the foreign jurisdiction that provide the greatest degree of protection to such funds. A futures commission merchant may not by contract or otherwise waive any of the protections afforded customer funds under the laws of the foreign jurisdiction.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Written acknowledgment from depositories.</E> (1) A futures commission merchant must obtain a written acknowledgment from each depository prior to or contemporaneously with the opening of an account by the futures commission merchant with such depository; <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> that a written acknowledgment need not be obtained from a derivatives clearing organization that has adopted and submitted to the Commission rules that provide for the separate holding of foreign futures or foreign options secured amount, in accordance with all relevant provisions of the Act, this part and the regulations and orders promulgated thereunder, of all funds held on behalf of 30.7 customers and all instruments purchased with funds set aside as the foreign futures or foreign options secured amount as provided for under paragraph (h) of this section.</P>

          <P>(2) The written acknowledgment must be in the form as set out in appendix E to this part; <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> that if the futures commission merchant invests funds set aside as the foreign futures or foreign options secured amount in money market mutual funds as a permitted investment under paragraph (h) of this section and in accordance with the terms and conditions of § 1.25(c) of this chapter, the written acknowledgment with respect to such investment must be in the form as set out in appendix F to this part.</P>
          <P>(3)(i) A futures commission merchant shall deposit 30.7 customer funds only with a depository that agrees to provide the director of the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight, or any successor division, or such director's designees, with direct, read-only electronic access to transaction and account balance information for 30.7 customer accounts.</P>

          <P>(5) A futures commission merchant shall deposit 30.7 customer funds only with a depository that agrees that accounts containing 30.7 customer funds may be examined at any reasonable time by the director of the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight or the director of the Division of Clearing and Risk, or any successor divisions, or such directors' designees, or an appropriate officer, agent or employee of the futures commission merchant's designated self-regulatory organization. The written acknowledgment must contain the futures commission merchant's authorization to the depository to permit any such examination to take place without further notice to or consent from the futures commission merchant.</P>
          <P>(6) A futures commission merchant shall deposit 30.7 customer funds only with a depository that agrees to reply promptly and directly to any request from the director of the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight or the director of the Division of Clearing and Risk, or any successor divisions, or such directors' designees, or an appropriate officer, agent or employee of the futures commission merchant's designated self-regulatory organization for confirmation of account balances or provision of any other information regarding or related to an account.

          <P>(7) A futures commission merchant shall promptly file a copy of the written acknowledgment with the Commission in the format and manner specified by the Commission no later than three business days after the opening of the account or the execution of a new written acknowledgment for an existing account, as applicable.</P>
          <P>(8) A futures commission merchant shall obtain a new written acknowledgment within 120 days of any changes in the following:</P>
          <P>(i) The name or business address of the futures commission merchant;</P>
          <P>(ii) The name or business address of the depository; or</P>
          <P>(iii) The account number(s) under which the foreign futures or foreign options secured amount are held.</P>
          <P>(9) A futures commission merchant shall maintain each written acknowledgment readily accessible in its files in accordance with § 1.31 of this chapter, for as long as the account remains open, and thereafter for the period provided in § 1.31 of this chapter.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Commingling.</E> (1) A futures commission merchant may commingle the funds set aside as the foreign futures or foreign options secured amount that it receives from, or on behalf of, multiple 30.7 customers in a single account or multiple accounts with one or more of the depositories listed in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

          <P>(2) A futures commission merchant may not commingle the funds set aside as the foreign futures or foreign options secured amount held for 30.7 customers with the money, securities or property of such futures commission merchant, with any proprietary account of such futures commission merchant, or use such funds to secure or guarantee the obligations of, or extend credit to, such futures commission merchant or any proprietary account of such futures commission merchant; <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> a futures commission merchant may deposit proprietary funds into 30.7 customer accounts as permitted under paragraph (g) of this section.</P>

          <P>(3) A futures commission merchant may not commingle 30.7 customer funds with funds deposited by futures customers as defined in § 1.3 of this chapter and held in segregated accounts pursuant to section 4d(a) and 4d(b) of the Act or with funds deposited by Cleared Swap Customers as defined <PRTPAGE P="637"/>in § 22.1 of this chapter and held in segregated accounts pursuant to section 4d(f) of the Act, or with funds of any account holders of the futures commission merchant unrelated to trading foreign futures or foreign options; <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> that a futures commission merchant may commingle 30.7 customer funds with funds deposited by futures customers or Cleared Swaps Customers pursuant to the terms of a Commission regulation or order authorizing such commingling.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Limitations on use of 30.7 customer funds.</E> (1)(i) A futures commission merchant shall not use, or permit the use of, the funds of one 30.7 customer to purchase, margin or settle the trades, contracts, or commodity options of, or to secure or extend credit to, any person other than such 30.7 customer.</P>
          <P>(ii)(A) The undermargined amount for a 30.7 customer's account is the amount, if any, by which</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The total amount of collateral required for that 30.7 customer's positions in that account, at the time or times referred to in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, exceeds</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The value of the 30.7 customer funds for that account, as calculated in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
          <P>(B) Each futures commission merchant must compute, based on the information available to the futures commission merchant as of the close of each business day,</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The undermargined amounts, based on the clearing initial margin that will be required to be maintained by that futures commission merchant for its 30.7 customers, at each clearing organization of which the futures commission merchant is a member, at 6:00 p.m. Eastern on the following business day for each such clearing organization less</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Any debit balances referred to in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section included in such undermargined amounts.</P>
          <P>(C)(<E T="03">1</E>) Prior to 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the date of the settlement referenced in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section, such futures commission merchant must maintain residual interest in segregated funds that is at least equal to the computation set forth in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A futures commission merchant may reduce the amount of residual interest required in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(C)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section to account for payments received from or on behalf of undermargined 30.7 customers (less the sum of any disbursements made to or on behalf of such customers) between the close of the previous business day and 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the following business day.</P>

          <P>(D) For purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, a futures commission merchant should include, as clearing initial margin, customer initial margin that the futures commission merchant will be required to maintain, for that futures commission merchant's 30.7 customers, at a foreign broker, and, for purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(C) of this section, must do so prior to 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the date referenced in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Requirements as to amount.</E> (i) For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2), the term “account” shall mean the entries on the books and records of a futures commission merchant pertaining to the 30.7 customer funds of a particular 30.7 customer.</P>
          <P>(ii) The futures commission merchant must reflect in the account that it maintains for each 30.7 customer the net liquidating equity for each such customer, calculated as follows: The market value of any 30.7 customer funds it receives from such customer, as adjusted by:</P>
          <P>(A) Any uses permitted under paragraph (e) of this section;</P>
          <P>(B) Any accruals on permitted investments of such collateral under § 1.25 of this chapter that, pursuant to the futures commission merchant's customer agreement with that customer, are creditable to such customer;</P>
          <P>(C) Any gains and losses with respect to contracts for the purchase or sale of foreign futures or foreign option positions;</P>

          <P>(D) Any charges lawfully accruing to the 30.7 customer, including any commission, brokerage fee, interest, tax, or storage fee; and<PRTPAGE P="638"/>
          </P>
          <P>(E) Any appropriately authorized distribution or transfer of such collateral.</P>
          <P>(iii) If the market value of 30.7 customer funds in the account of a 30.7 customer is positive after adjustments, then that account has a credit balance. If the market value of 30.7 customer funds in the account of a 30.7 customer is negative after adjustments, then that account has a debit balance.</P>
          <P>(iv) The futures commission merchant must maintain in segregation an amount equal to the sum of any credit balances that 30.7 customers of the futures commission merchant have in their accounts. This balance may not be reduced by any debit balances that the 30.7 customers of the futures commission merchants have in their accounts.</P>
          <P>(3) A futures commission merchant may not impose or permit the imposition of a lien on any funds set aside as the foreign futures or foreign options secured amount, including any residual financial interest of the futures commission merchant in such funds.</P>
          <P>(4) A futures commission merchant may not include in funds set aside as the foreign futures or foreign options secured amount any money invested in securities, memberships, or obligations of any clearing organization or board of trade. A futures commission merchant may not include in funds set aside as the foreign futures or foreign options secured amount any other money, securities, or property held by a member of a foreign board of trade, board of trade, or clearing organization, except if the funds are deposited to margin, secure, or guarantee 30.7 customers' foreign futures or foreign options positions and the futures commission merchant obtains the written acknowledgment from the member of the foreign board of trade, board of trade, or clearing organization as required by paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Futures commission merchant's residual financial interest and withdrawal of funds.</E> (1) The provision in paragraph (e) of this section, which prohibits the commingling of funds set aside as the foreign futures or foreign options secured amount with the funds of a futures commission merchant, shall not be construed to prevent a futures commission merchant from having a residual financial interest in the funds set aside as required by the regulations in this part for the benefit of 30.7 customers; nor shall such provisions be construed to prevent a futures commission merchant from adding to such set aside funds such amount or amounts of money, from its own funds or unencumbered securities from its own inventory, of the type set forth in § 1.25 of this chapter, as it may deem necessary to ensure any and all 30.7 accounts from becoming undersecured at any time.</P>
          <P>(2) A futures commission merchant may not withdraw funds, except withdrawals that are made to or for the benefit of 30.7 customers, from an account or accounts holding the foreign futures and foreign options secured amount unless the futures commission merchant has prepared the daily 30.7 calculation required by paragraph (l) of this section as of the close of business on the previous business day. A futures commission merchant that has completed its daily 30.7 calculation may make withdrawals, in addition to withdrawals that are made to or for the benefit of 30.7 customers, to the extent of its actual residual financial interest in funds held in 30.7 accounts, including the withdrawal of securities held in secured amount safekeeping accounts held by a bank, trust company, contract market, clearing organization, member of a foreign board of trade, or other futures commission merchant. Such withdrawal(s) shall not result in the funds of one 30.7 customer being used to purchase, margin or guarantee the foreign futures or foreign options positions, or extend the credit of any other 30.7 customer or other person.</P>

          <P>(3) A futures commission merchant may not withdraw funds, in a single transaction or a series of transactions, that are not made for the benefit of 30.7 customers from an account or accounts holding 30.7 customer funds if such withdrawal(s) would exceed 25 percent of the futures commission merchant's residual interest in such accounts as reported on the daily secured amount calculation required by paragraph (l) of this section and computed as of the close of business on the previous business day, unless the futures commission merchant's chief executive officer, <PRTPAGE P="639"/>chief finance officer or other senior official that is listed as a principal of the futures commission merchant on its Form 7-R and is knowledgeable about the futures commission merchant's financial requirements and financial position pre-approves in writing the withdrawal, or series of withdrawals.</P>
          <P>(4) A futures commission merchant must file written notice of the withdrawal or series of withdrawals that exceed 25 percent of the futures commission merchant's residual interest in 30.7 customer funds as computed under paragraph (l) of this section with the Commission and with its designated self-regulatory organization immediately after the chief executive officer, chief finance officer or other senior official as described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section pre-approves the withdrawal or series of withdrawals. The written notice must:</P>
          <P>(i) Be signed by the chief executive officer, chief finance officer or other senior official that pre-approved the withdrawal, and give notice that the futures commission merchant has withdrawn or intends to withdraw more than 25 percent of its residual interest in accounts holding 30.7 customer funds;</P>
          <P>(ii) Include a description of the reasons for the withdrawal or series of withdrawals;</P>
          <P>(iii) List the amount of funds provided to each recipient and the name of each recipient;</P>
          <P>(iv) Include the current estimate of the amount of the futures commission merchant's residual interest in the 30.7 customer funds after the withdrawal;</P>
          <P>(v) Contain a representation by the chief executive officer, chief finance officer or other senior official as described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section that pre-approved the withdrawal, or series of withdrawals, that to such person's knowledge and reasonable belief, the futures commission merchant remains in compliance with the secured amount requirements after the withdrawal. The chief executive officer, chief finance officer or other appropriate senior official as described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section must consider the daily 30.7 calculation as of the close of business on the previous business day and any other factors that may cause a material change in the futures commission's residual interest since the close of business the previous business day, including known unsecured customer debits or deficits, current day market activity and any other withdrawals made from the 30.7 customer accounts; and</P>
          <P>(vi) Any such written notice filed with the Commission must be filed via electronic transmission using a form of user authentication assigned in accordance with procedures established by or approved by the Commission, and otherwise in accordance with instruction issued by or approved by the Commission. Any such electronic submission must clearly indicate the registrant on whose behalf such filing is made and the use of such user authentication in submitting such filing will constitute and become a substitute for the manual signature of the authorized signer. Any written notice filed must be followed up with direct communication to the regional office of Commission which has supervisory authority over the futures commission merchant whereby the Commission acknowledges receipt of the notice.</P>
          <P>(5) After making a withdrawal requiring the approval and notice required in paragraphs (g)(3) and (4) of this section, and before the next daily secured amount calculation, no futures commission merchant may make any further withdrawals from accounts holding 30.7 customer funds, except to or for the benefit of 30.7 customers, without, for each withdrawal, obtaining the approval required under paragraph (g)(3) of this section and filing a written notice with the Commission under paragraph (g)(4)(vi) of this section and its designated self-regulatory organization signed by the chief executive officer, chief finance officer, or other senior official. The written notice must:</P>
          <P>(i) List the amount of funds provided to each recipient and each recipient's name;</P>
          <P>(ii) Disclose the reason for each withdrawal;</P>

          <P>(iii) Confirm that the chief executive officer, chief finance officer, or other senior official (and the identity of the person if different from the person who signed the notice) pre-approved the withdrawal in writing;<PRTPAGE P="640"/>
          </P>
          <P>(iv) Disclose the current estimate of the futures commission merchant's remaining total residual interest in the secured accounts holding 30.7 customer funds after the withdrawal; and</P>
          <P>(v) Include a representation that to the best of the notice signatory's knowledge and reasonable belief the futures commission merchant remains in compliance with the secured amount requirements after the withdrawal.</P>
          <P>(6) If a futures commission merchant withdraws funds that are not for the benefit of 30.7 customers from the separate accounts holding 30.7 customer funds, and the withdrawal causes the futures commission merchant to not hold sufficient funds in the separate accounts for the benefit of the 30.7 customers to meet its targeted residual interest, as required to be computed under § 1.11 of this chapter, the futures commission merchant must deposit its own funds into the separate accounts for the benefit of 30.7 customers to restore the account balance to the targeted residual interest amount on the next business day, or, if appropriate, revise the futures commission merchant's targeted amount of residual interest pursuant to the policies and procedures required by § 1.11 of this chapter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the futures commission merchant's residual interest in separate accounts for the benefit of 30.7 customers is less than the amount required to be maintained by paragraph (f) of this section at any particular point in time, the futures commission merchant must immediately restore the residual interest to exceed the sum of such amounts. Any proprietary funds deposited in the 30.7 customer accounts must be unencumbered and otherwise compliant with § 1.25 of this chapter, as applicable.</P>
          <P>(7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, a futures commission merchant may not withdraw funds from 30.7 accounts, except withdrawals that are made for the benefit of 30.7 customers, unless the futures commission merchant follows its policies and procedures required by § 1.11 of this chapter.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Permitted investments and deposits of 30.7 customer funds.</E> (1) A futures commission merchant may invest 30.7 customer funds subject to, and in compliance with, the terms and conditions of § 1.25 of this chapter. Regulation 1.25 of this chapter shall apply to the investment of 30.7 customer funds as if such funds comprised customer funds or customer money subject to segregation pursuant to section 4d of the Act and the regulations thereunder.</P>
          <P>(2) Each futures commission merchant that invests money, securities or property on behalf of 30.7 customers must keep a record showing the following:</P>
          <P>(i) The date on which such investments were made;</P>
          <P>(ii) The name of the person through whom such investments were made;</P>
          <P>(iii) The amount of money or current market value of securities so invested;</P>
          <P>(iv) A description of the obligations in which such investments were made, including CUSIP or ISIN numbers;</P>
          <P>(v) The identity of the depositories or other places where such investments are maintained;</P>
          <P>(vi) The date on which such investments were liquidated or otherwise disposed of and the amount of money received or current market value of securities received as a result of such disposition;</P>
          <P>(vii) The name of the person to or through whom such investments were disposed of; and</P>
          <P>(viii) A daily valuation for each instrument and readily available documentation supporting the daily valuation for each instrument. Such supporting documentation must be sufficient to enable third parties to verify the valuations and the accuracy of any information from external sources used in those valuations.</P>
          <P>(3) Any 30.7 customer funds deposited in a bank or trust company located in the United States or in a foreign jurisdiction must be available for immediate withdrawal upon the demand of the futures commission merchant.</P>

          <P>(4) Futures commission merchants that invest 30.7 customer funds in instruments described in § 1.25 of this chapter shall include such instruments in the computation of its secured amount requirements, required under paragraph (l) of this section, at values that at no time exceed current market value, determined as of the close of the <PRTPAGE P="641"/>market on the date for which such computation is made.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Responsibility for § 1.25 investment losses.</E> A futures commission merchant shall bear sole financial responsibility for any losses resulting from the investment of 30.7 customer funds in instruments described in § 1.25 of this chapter. No investment losses shall be borne or otherwise allocated to the 30.7 customers of the futures commission merchant.</P>
          <P>(j) <E T="03">Loans by futures commission merchants; treatment of proceeds.</E> A futures commission merchant may lend its own funds to 30.7 customers on securities and property pledged, or from repledging or selling such securities and property pursuant to specific written agreement with such 30.7 customers. The proceeds of such loans used to purchase, margin, guarantee, or secure the trades, contracts, or commodity options of 30.7 customers shall be treated and dealt with by a futures commission merchant as belonging to such 30.7 customers. A futures commission merchant may not loan funds on an unsecured basis to finance a 30.7 customer's foreign futures and foreign options trading, nor may a futures commission merchant loan funds to a 30.7 customer secured by the 30.7 customer's trading account.</P>
          <P>(k) <E T="03">Permitted withdrawals.</E> A futures commission merchant may withdraw funds from 30.7 customer accounts in an amount necessary in the normal course of business to margin, guarantee, secure, transfer, or settle 30.7 customers' foreign futures or foreign option positions with a foreign broker or clearing organization.

            <P>Please be aware of the following should you be permitted to place the type of orders specified above.</P>
            <P>• The orders you place with an Executing Firm are for [FCM's] foreign futures and options customer omnibus account maintained with a foreign clearing firm. Consequently, [FCM] may limit or otherwise condition the orders you place with the Executing Firm.</P>
            <P>• You should be aware of the relationship of the Executing Firm and [FCM]. [FCM] may not be responsible for the acts, omissions, or errors of the Executing Firm, or its representatives, with which you place your orders. In addition, the Executing Firm may not be affiliated with [FCM]. If you choose to place orders directly with an Executing Firm, you may be doing so at your own risk.</P>
            <P>• It is your responsibility to inquire about the applicable laws and regulations that govern the foreign exchanges on which transactions will be executed on your behalf. Any orders placed by you for execution on that exchange will be subject to such rules and regulations, its customs and usages, as well as any local laws that may govern transactions on that exchange. These laws, rules, regulations, customs and usages may offer different or diminished protection from those that govern transactions on US exchanges. In particular, funds received from customers to margin foreign futures transactions may not be provided the same protections as funds received to margin futures transactions on domestic exchanges. Before you trade, you should familiarize yourself with the foreign rules which will apply to your particular transaction. United States regulatory authorities may be unable to compel the enforcement of the rules of regulatory authorities or markets in non-US jurisdictions where transactions may be effected.</P>
            <P>• It is your responsibility to determine whether the Executing Firm has consented to the jurisdiction of the courts in the United States. In general, neither the Executing Firm nor any individuals associated with the Executing Firm will be registered in any capacity with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Similarly, your contacts with the Executing Firm may not be sufficient to subject the Executing Firm to the jurisdiction of courts in the United States in the absence of the Executing Firm's consent. Accordingly, neither the courts of the United States nor the Commission's reparations program may be available as a forum for resolution of any disagreements you may have with the Executing Firm, and your recourse may be limited to actions outside the United States.</P>
            <P>• Unless you object within five (5) days, by giving notice as provided in your customer agreement after receipt of this disclosure, [FCM] will assume your consent to the aforementioned conditions.</P>

        <APPENDIX>
          <EAR>Pt. 30, App. A</EAR>
          <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 30—Interpretative Statement With Respect to the Commission's Exemptive Authority Under § 30.10 of Its Rules</HD>
          <P>Part 30 of the Commission's regulations establishes the regulatory structure governing the offer and sale in the United States of futures and options contracts made or to be made on or subject to the rules of a foreign board of trade. Section 30.10 of these regulations provides that, upon petition, the Commission may exempt any person from any requirement of this part. Specifically, section 30.10 states:</P>
          <P>Any person adversely affected by any requirement of this part may file a petition with the Secretary of the Commission, which petition must set forth with particularity the reasons why that person believes that he should be exempt from such requirement. The Commission may, in its discretion, grant such an exemption if that person demonstrates to the Commission's satisfaction that the exemption is not otherwise contrary to the public interest or to the purposes of the provision from which exemption is sought. The petition will be granted or denied on the basis of the papers filed. The petition may be granted subject to such terms and conditions as the Commission may find appropriate.</P>
          <P>As the provisions of this section make clear, any person subject to regulation under part 30 may petition the Commission for an exemption. In adopting these regulations, however, the Commission noted in particular that persons located outside the United States that solicit or accept orders directly from United States customers for foreign futures or options transactions and that are subject to a comparable regulatory scheme in the country in which they are located may apply under section 30.10 for exemption from some or all of the requirements that would otherwise be applicable to such persons. This interpretative statement sets forth the elements that the Commission intends to evaluate in determining whether a particular regulatory program may be found to be comparable to the Commission's program.</P>

          <P>The Commission wishes to emphasize, however, that this interpretative statement is not all inclusive, and that information with respect to other aspects of a particular regulatory program may be submitted by a petitioner or requested by the Commission. In this connection, the Commission would have broad discretion to determine that the policies of any program element generally are met, notwithstanding the fact that the offshore program does not contain an element identical to that of the Commission's regulatory program and conversely may assess <PRTPAGE P="650"/>how particular elements are in fact applied by offshore authorities. Thus, for example, in order to find that a particular program is comparable, the regulations thereunder would have to be applicable to all United States customers, notwithstanding any exemptions that might otherwise be available to particular classes of customer located offshore. A petitioner, therefore, must set forth with particularity the factual basis for a finding of comparability and the reasons why such policies and purposes are met, notwithstanding differences of degree and kind in its regulatory program.</P>
          <P>No exemptions of a general nature will be granted unless the persons to which the exemption is to be applied consent to submit to jurisdiction in the United States by designating an agent for service of process pursuant to the provisions of rule 30.5 with respect to any activities of such persons otherwise subject to regulation under this part and to notify the National Futures Association of the commencement or termination of business in the United States. In this connection, to be exempted, such person must further agree to respond to a request to confirm that it continues to do business in the United States.</P>
          <P>Persons located outside the United States may seek an exemption on their own behalf or an exemption may be sought on a general basis through the governmental agency responsible for the implementation and enforcement of the regulatory program in question, or the self-regulatory organizations of which such persons are members. The appropriate petitioner is a matter of judgment and may be determined by the parties seeking the exemption. The Commission, however, notes that it will be able to address petitions more efficiently if they are filed by the governmental agency or self-regulatory organization responsible for the regulatory program.</P>
          <P>In this connection, as will be discussed in more detail below, any exemption of a general nature based on comparability will be conditioned upon appropriate information sharing arrangements between the Commission and the relevant governmental agency and/or self-regulatory organization. Representations from the appropriate governmental agency with respect to the applicability of any blocking statutes that may prevent the sharing of information requested under private arrangements would also be considered. Finally, in considering an exemption request, the Commission will take into account the extent to which United States persons or contracts regulated by the Commission are permitted to engage in futures-related activities or be offered in the country from which an exemption is sought.</P>
          <P>In the Commission's review, the minimum elements of a comparable regulatory program would include: (1) Registration, authorization or other form of licensing, fitness review or qualification of persons through which customer orders are solicited and accepted; (2) minimum financial requirements for those persons that accept customer funds; (3) protection of customer funds from misapplication; (4) recordkeeping and reporting requirements; (5) minimum sales practice standards, including disclosure of the risks of futures and opotions transactions and, in particular, the risk of transactions undertaken outside the jurisdiction of domestic law; and (6) compliance.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Qualification.</E> Under domestic law, registration identifies to the Commission, the public and other governmental agencies the individuals and entities that are properly authorized to solicit and accept customer orders and are in good standing. Equally important, the procedure provides the Commission, through the National Futures Association, the opportunity to determine whether applicants are unfit to deal with the public. In this connection, the standards for determining whether a person through its principals is fit for registration with the Commission are set forth in section 8a(2)-8a(4) of the Act. Timely access to information as to a firm's good standing and the application by relevant authorities of membership and licensing criteria, as well as the criteria themselves, will be considered by the Commission in assessing comparability.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Minimum Financial Requirements.</E> Minimum financial requirements for persons that handle customer funds serve at least three critical functions. First, they provide a cushion together with margin such that in the event of a default of a customer, the losses of that customer need not adversely affect the funds held on behalf of other customers. Second, they help ensure that the person has sufficient funds to operate its business and, therefore, is less likely to be tempted to misapply customer funds for its own purposes. Third, they ensure that the person holding customer funds has some financial stake in its business and, therefore, is serious in its intent. In assessing comparability, capital rules or their equivalent will be considered together with any provisions made for insuring customer losses, the scope of clearing guarantees and segregation or customer trust calculation and accounting requirements which, to the extent they cover undermargined accounts, can provide significant protection of one customer from another customer's losses.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Customer Funds.</E> The Act requires the strict segregation of customer funds from those of the person holding such funds. One of the primary purposes of this requirement is to prevent the misapplication of those funds for purposes other than those intended by the <PRTPAGE P="651"/>customer, which may affect not only the customer but the market as a whole. The purpose of segregation is also to identify customer deposits as assets of the customer, rather than the firm, in order that in bankruptcy such funds are payable only to satisfy the carrying firm's obligations to such customers and not other obligations of the firm. In assessing comparability of protection of customer funds, the Commission will consider protections accorded customer funds in a bankruptcy under applicable law, as well as protection from fraud.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Recordkeeping and Reporting.</E> Recordkeeping requirements have long been recognized as the linchpin of the Commission's regulatory scheme. Reporting and recordkeeping requirements assist in determining that a registrant is acting in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the rules, regulations and orders of the Commission thereunder. Similarly, reporting requirements ensure that customers are timely advised of the transactions that have been executed on their behalf, thus ensuring that they are aware of their positions in the markets and may object to any transactions that they believe are in error. The Commission will consider the types of records maintained, the ability through those records to trace funds and transactions, and the period of retention and accessibility of records under the information sharing arrangements discussed below in considering comparability.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Sales Practice Standards.</E> In 1982, Congress reaffirmed the importance of minimum sales practice standards to protect customers from fraud or misrepresentation by requiring any futures association registered by the Commission to adopt and enforce rules governing the sales practices of its members. The Commission has consistently provided that written disclosure of the risks of futures and options trading is essential to ensure that potential customers are aware of these risks and are not otherwise misled and that other appropriate disclosure is made. The Commission will review the type and manner of disclosure given and the mechanisms for assuring the disclosure requirements are met and, in particular, the treatment of discretionary accounts for which, for example, Commission rule 166.2 requires particularized documentation of intent to confer discretion in the case of foreign futures and options transactions.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Compliance.</E> Finally, in assessing comparability of a program, the Commission will examine the procedures employed by the governmental authority or the appropriate self-regulatory organization to audit for compliance with, and to take action as appropriate against those persons that violate, the requirements of that program.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Information Sharing.</E> As noted above, any exemption of a general nature would also require an information sharing arrangement between the Commission and the appropriate governmental or self-regulatory organization to ensure Commission access to information on an as needed basis as may be necessary to fulfill its regulatory responsibilities. The information subject to these arrangements generally would be of a type necessary in the first instance to monitor domestic markets and to protect domestic customers trading on foreign markets.</P>
          <P>Firm-specific information that is potentially relevant to protection of domestic customers engaged in foreign transactions could include the following: (1) Registration qualification status; (2) names of principals; (3) current capital; (4) location of customer funds; (5) address of main office and branches; (6) exchange and self-regulatory organization memberships; (7) the existence of any derogatory information such as that required to be disclosed on the Commission's Form 7-R; (8) notice of limitations imposed on activities; (9) notice of undersegregation or undercapitalization; (10) notice of misuse of customer funds; and (11) notice of sanctions or of expulsion from exchange or self-regulatory organization membership. The Commission believes that much of the above information would be public in the ordinary course in most jurisdictions. From time to time, the Commission also may need immediate access to financial information concerning risks posed to domestic firms by the carrying of foreign positions.</P>
          <P>In addition to information that relates to the financial stability and creditworthiness of the firm, the Commission should have access to transaction-specific information that confirms the execution of orders and prices and facilitates tracing of customer funds. Such data could include records reflecting: (1) That an order has been received by a firm on behalf of one or more United States customers; (2) that an order has been executed on an exchange on behalf of one or more United States customers; (3) that funds to margin, guarantee or secure United States customer transactions have been received by a firm and deposited in an appropriate depository; and (4) the price at which a transaction was executed and general access to pricing information.</P>
          <P>Again, such information is likely to be maintained in the ordinary course of business. Tracing of customer funds would be most essential in cases of insolvency where repatriation of funds is at issue.</P>

          <P>The Commission may also seek relevant position data information, including the identity of the position holder and related positions, in connection with surveillance of a potential “market disruption.” This is particularly true in the case of integrated markets.<PRTPAGE P="652"/>
          </P>
          <P>The Commission wishes to emphasize that the information sharing arrangements discussed herein are not necessarily a substitute for, nor would they preclude, a more formal agreement or arrangement with respect to the sharing of information.</P>

          <P>1. Rule 30.7 requires FCMs who accept money, securities or property from foreign futures and foreign options customers to maintain in a separate account or accounts such money, securities and property in an amount at least sufficient to cover or satisfy all of its current obligations to those customers. <SU>1</SU>
            <FTREF/> This amount is denominated as the “foreign futures or foreign options secured amount” and that term is defined in § 1.3. The separate accounts must be maintained under an account name that clearly identifies the funds as belonging to foreign futures and foreign options customers at a depository that meets the requirements of Rule 30.7(c). Further, each FCM must obtain and retain in its files for the period provided in Rule 1.31 an acknowledgment from the depository that the depository was informed that such money, securities or property are held for or on behalf of foreign futures and foreign options customers and are being held in accordance with the provisions of these regulations.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>1</SU> “Foreign futures or foreign options customer” means “any person located in the United States, its territories or possessions who trades in foreign futures or foreign options: Provided, That an owner or holder of a proprietary account as defined in § 1.3 shall not be deemed to be a foreign futures or foreign options customer within the meaning of [Rules 30.6 and 30.7].” Rule 30.1(c). “Foreign futures” means “any contract for the purchase or sale of any commodity for future delivery made, or to be made, on or subject to the rules of any foreign board of trade.” Rule 30.1(a). “Foreign option” means “any transaction or agreement which is or is held out to be of the character of, or is commonly known to the trade as, an ‘option,’ ‘privilege,’ ‘indemnity,’ ‘bid,’ ‘offer,’ ‘put,’ ‘call,’ ‘advance guaranty,’ or ‘decline guaranty,’ made or to be made on or subject to the rules of any foreign board of trade.” Rule 30.1(b).</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>2. In a series of orders issued pursuant to Rule 30.10, the Commission required that certain foreign firms exempt from registration as FCMs essentially comply with the standards of Rule 30.7. <SU>2</SU>

            <FTREF/> Specifically, the Commission stated that “[the secured amount] requirement is intended to ensure that funds provided by U.S. customers for foreign futures and options transactions, whether held at a U.S. FCM under Rule 30.7(c) or a firm exempted from registration as an FCM under CFTC Rule 30.10, will receive equivalent protection at <E T="03">all</E> intermediaries and exchange clearing organizations.” <SU>3</SU>

            <FTREF/> The Commission further interpreted Rule 30.7 to require each FCM and Rule 30.10 firm to take appropriate action (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, set aside funds in a “mirror” account) in the event that it becomes aware of <PRTPAGE P="653"/>facts leading it to conclude that foreign futures and foreign options customer funds are not being handled consistent with the requirements of Commission rules or relevant order for relief by any subsequent intermediary or exchange clearing organization.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>2</SU> Under Rule 30.10, the Commission may exempt a foreign firm acting in the capacity of an FCM from registration under the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”) and compliance with certain Commission rules based upon the firm's compliance with comparable regulatory requirements imposed by the firm's home-country regulator or self-regulatory organization (“SRO”). Once the Commission determines that the foreign jurisdiction's regulatory structure offers comparable regulatory oversight, the Commission may issue an Order granting general relief subject to certain conditions. Firms seeking confirmation of relief (referred to herein as “Rule 30.10 firms”) must make certain representations set forth in the Rule 30.10 order issued to the regulator or SRO from the firm's home country. For a list of those foreign regulators and SROs that have been issued a Rule 30.10 order, see appendix C to part 30. In certain cases, where a foreign regulator or SRO has requested that firms subject to its jurisdiction be granted broader relief to engage in transactions on exchanges other than in its home jurisdiction (referred to herein as “expanded relief”), the relief has been granted where the relevant authority has represented that it will monitor its firms for compliance with the terms of the order in connection with such offshore transactions. Although Rule 30.10 orders generally exempt foreign intermediaries from compliance with the secured amount requirement under Rule 30.7, firms seeking confirmation of the expanded relief must represent that, with respect to transactions entered into on behalf of U.S. customers on any non-U.S. exchange located outside their home country, they will treat U.S. customer funds in a manner consistent with the provisions of Rule 30.7. For the most recent order granting expanded relief, see 64 FR 50248 (September 16, 1999) (Singapore Exchange Derivatives Trading Limited).</P>

          </FTNT>
          <P>3. Upon further analysis and reconsideration of this matter, the Commission has determined to revise its prior interpretation of the Rule 30.7 secured amount requirement. The Commission notes that the initial depository's ability to identify customer funds affords foreign futures and foreign options customers a measure of protection in the event that the intermediating FMC or foreign firm becomes insolvent. Moreover, Rule 30.6(a) requires that foreign futures and foreign options customers receive a Rule 1.55 written disclosure explaining that the treatment of customer funds outside the U.S. may not afford the same level of protection offered in the U.S. These protections exist whetehr the intermediating firm is a U.S. FCM or a firm exempt from such registration under Rule 30.10. <SU>4</SU>

          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>4</SU> Although orders for expanded relief exempt foreign firms from compliance with Rule 1.55, sales practice standards and the treatment of customer funds constitute two of the specific elements examined in evaluating whether the particular foreign regulatory program provides a basis for permitting substituted compliance for purposes of exemptive relief pursuant to Rule 30.10. appendix A to part 30.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>4. The Commission further notes, however, that, in February 1998, Rule 30.6 was amended to permit an FCM to open a commodity account for a foreign futures or foreign options customer without providing the Rule 1.55 risk disclosure statement or obtaining an acknowledgment of receipt of such statement, provided that the customer is, at the time at which the account is opened, one of several types of sophisticated customers enumerated in Rule 1.55(f) (“Rule 1.55(f) customers”). <SU>5</SU>
            <FTREF/> While the amendment to Rule 30.6(a) extinguished the obligation to provide a standardized risk disclosure statement to Rule 1.55(f) customers at the time of the account opening, the Commission stated that FCMs have obligations to these customers independent of such a duty that would be material in the circumstances of a given transactions. <SU>6</SU>

          <P>5. After careful consideration of the issue, the Commission has determined that intermediaries should advise all customers (regardless of their level of sophistication) to consider making appropriate inquiries relating to the treatment of customer funds by depositories located outside the jurisdiction of the intermediating firm. Accordingly, the Commission has determined that an FCM, at a minimum, must provide each foreign futures or foreign option customer with a written disclosure tracking the language in either: (1) Rule 1.55(b)(7), <SU>7</SU>
            <FTREF/> or (2) Paragraphs 6 and 8 of appendix A to Rule 1.55(c). <SU>8</SU>
            <FTREF/> Rule <PRTPAGE P="654"/>30.10 firms must provide each foreign futures or foreign options customer with a written disclosure tracking the language in either Rule 1.55(b)(7) or paragraphs 6 and 8 of appendix A to Rule 1.55(c), or a comparable disclosure statement prescribed by the firm's home country regulator. The Commission further encourages all firms, whether domestic or foreign, to provide a Rule 1.55 written risk disclosure to all customers, regardless of each customer's respective level of experience. The Commission notes that, in any instance where a firm provides a Rule 1.55(f) customer with a written disclosure, it is not necessary for the firm to obtain an acknowledgment of receipt. In addition, those FCMs that already have provided customers with a disclosure tracking either Rule 1.55(b)(7) or paragraphs 6 and 8 of appendix A to Rule 1.55(c) (or in the case of Rule 30.10 firm, a comparable disclosure statement prescribed by its home country regulatory) need not provide those same customers with an additional written disclosure.</P>

            <P>
              <SU>7</SU> Rule 1.55(b)(7) reads as follows: Foreign futures transactions involve executing and clearing trades on a foreign exchange. This is the case even if the foreign exchange is formally “linked” to a domestic exchange whereby a trade executed on one exchange liquidates or establishes a position on the other exchange. No domestic organization regulates the activities of a foreign exchange, including the execution, delivery and clearing of transactions on such exchange, and no domestic regulator has the power to compel enforcement of the rules of the foreign exchange or the laws of the foreign country. Moreover, such laws or regulations will vary depending on the foreign country in which the transaction occurs. For these reasons, customers who trade on foreign exchanges may not be afforded certain of the protections which apply to domestic transactions, including the right to use alternative dispute resolution. In particular, funds received from customers to margin foreign futures transactions may not be provided the same protections as funds received to margin futures transactions on domestic exchanges. Before you trade, you should familiarize yourself with the foreign rules which will apply to your particular transaction.</P>

            <P>You should familiarize yourself with the protections accorded money or property you deposit for domestic and foreign transactions, particularly in the event of a firm insolvency or bankruptcy. The extent to which you may recover your money or property may be governed by specified legislation or local rules. In some jurisdictions, property which has been specifically identifiable as your own will be pro-rated in the same manner as cash for purposes of distribution in the event of a shortfall.</P>
            <P>8. Transactions in other jurisdictions.<PRTPAGE/>
            </P>
            <P>Transactions on markets in other jurisdictions, including markets formally linked to a domestic market, may expose you to additional risk. Such markets may be subject to regulation which may offer different or diminished investor protection. Before you trade you should enquire about any rules relevant to your particular transactions. Your local regulatory authority will be unable to compel the enforcement of the rules of the regulatory authorities or markets in other jurisdictions where your transactions have been effected. You should ask the firm with which you deal for details about the types of redress available in both your home jurisdiction and other relevant jurisdictions before you start to trade.</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>6. For the reasons set forth above, the Commission is revising its interpretation of the secured amount requirement set forth in Rule 30.7. The Commission believes that the Rule 30.7 acknowledgment required of FCMs, or other appropriate acknowledgment required by Rule 30.10 firms, only applies to the maintenance of the account or accounts containing foreign futures and foreign options customer funds by the initial depository, and not to the manner in which any subsequent depository holds or subsequently transmits those funds. If an FCM receives from the initial depository the acknowledgment described in Rule 30,7, furnishes to each foreign futures or foreign options customer a written disclosure statement tracking the language set forth in Rule 1.55(b)(7) or paragraphs 6 and 8 of appendix A of Rule 1.55(c) and otherwise complies with the provisions of Rule 30.7, then it may include all funds maintained in the separate account or accounts in calculating its secured amount requirement. A Rule 30.10 firm must satisfy the same requirements, except that it may provide each foreign futures or foreign options customer with a comparable disclosure statement prescribed by is home regulator.</P>
          <P>7. IF an FCM or Rule 30.10 firm fails to receive the required acknowledgment from the initial depository or provide the above written disclosure statement (and in certain circumstances, receive from customers and acknowledgment of receipt), then it must set aside funds with an acceptable depository and receive from such depository the required acknowledgment.</P>
          <P>8. The Commission's interpretation of the Rule 30.7 secured amount requirement will apply to all regulated activities with all new and existing foreign futures and foreign options customers as of October 11, 2000. The Commission's interpretation does not alter any other requirement set forth in Rule 30.7 or any other section of part 30.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix D to Part 30—Commission Certification With Respect to Foreign Futures and Options Contracts on a Non-Narrow-Based Security Index</HD>
          <P>In its analysis of a request for certification by a foreign board of trade relating to a security index futures contract traded on that foreign board of trade pursuant to § 30.13, the Commission will evaluate the contract to ensure that it complies with the three criteria of section 2(a)(1)(C)(ii) of the Act.</P>
          <P>(1) Because security index futures contracts are cash settled, the Commission also evaluates the contract terms and conditions relating to cash settlement. In that regard, the Commission examines, among other things, whether the cash price series is reliable, acceptable, publicly available and timely; that the cash settlement price is reflective of the underlying cash market; and that the cash settlement price is not readily susceptible to manipulation. In making its determination, the Commission considers the design and maintenance of the index, the method of index calculation, the nature of the component security prices used to calculate the index, the breadth and frequency of index dissemination, and any other relevant factors.</P>
          <P>(2) In considering the susceptibility of an index to manipulation, the Commission examines several factors, including the structure of the primary and secondary markets for the component equities, the liquidity of the component stocks, the method of index calculation, the total capitalization of stocks underlying the index, the number, weighting and capitalization of individual stocks in the index, and the existence of surveillance sharing agreements between the board of trade and the securities exchange(s) on which the underlying securities are traded.</P>
          <P>(3) To verify that the index is not narrow-based, the Commission considers the number and weighting of the component securities and the aggregate value of average daily trading volume of the lowest weighted quartile of securities. Under the Act, a security index is narrow-based if it meets any one of the following criteria:</P>
          <P>(i) The index is composed of fewer than 10 securities;</P>
          <P>(ii) Any single security comprises more than 30% of the total index weight;</P>
          <P>(iii) The five largest securities comprise more than 60% of the total index weight; or</P>
          <P>(iv) The lowest-weighted securities that together account for 25% of the total weight of the index have an aggregate dollar value of average daily trading volume of less than US$30 million (or US$50 million if the index includes fewer than 15 securities).</P>

            <P>YOU SHOULD ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHARGES FOR SIMILAR LEVERAGE CONTRACTS WHICH ARE REFLECTED ON THE FILLED-IN CONFIRMATION STATEMENT AS ESTIMATED MAY VARY AMONG LEVERAGE FIRMS, AND THAT SUCH FIRMS HAVE COMPLETE DISCRETION IN SETTING THEIR CHARGES AND THE PRICE OF THE LEVERAGE CONTRACTS THEY OFFER. PRIOR TO ENTERING INTO ANY LEVERAGE CONTRACT A PROSPECTIVE LEVERAGE CUSTOMER SHOULD COMPARE THE CHARGES AND PRICES OF SUCH FIRMS WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH THE COMMISSIONS FOR AND PRICES OF FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADED ON DESIGNATED EXCHANGES.</P>

            <P>YOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT YOU ARE SUBJECT TO MARGIN CALLS. THE LEVERAGE FIRM RESERVES THE RIGHT TO LIQUIDATE YOUR POSITION IF <PRTPAGE P="672"/>YOU DO NOT RESPOND TO A MARGIN CALL WITHIN THE TIME SPECIFIED IN YOUR LEVERAGE AGREEMENT. IN ANY EVENT, IF THE EQUITY IN YOUR CONTRACT AT ANY TIME FALLS BELOW 50% OF THE MINIMUM MARGIN, YOUR CONTRACT MAY BE LIQUIDATED WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE. YOU MUST, HOWEVER, BE NOTIFIED OF LIQUIDATION WITHIN NO MORE THAN 24 HOURS THEREAFTER AND PERMITTED TO REESTABLISH YOUR CONTRACT FOR A PERIOD OF 5 BUSINESS DAYS. LEVERAGE CONTRACTS PURCHASED FROM A LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT ARE RE-ESTABLISHED AT THE THEN PREVAILING BID PRICE AND LEVERAGE CONTRACTS SOLD TO A LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT ARE RE-ESTABLISHED AT THE THEN PREVAILING ASK PRICE WITHOUT COMMISSIONS, FEES OR OTHER MARK-UPS OR CHARGES UNDER RULES SET BY THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION, AS MORE COMPLETELY DESCRIBED IN THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT. IN CASE OF LIQUIDATION, ALL OF YOUR FUNDS MAY BE USED TO SETTLE THE DEFICIT IN THE ACCOUNT, AND YOU MAY BE LIABLE FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO SETTLE IN FULL.</P>
            <P>IF YOU ARE A FIRST-TIME LEVERAGE CUSTOMER, YOU MAY RESCIND YOUR FIRST LEVERAGE TRANSACTION SUBJECT ONLY TO ACTUAL PRICE LOSSES BUT OTHERWISE WITHOUT PENALTY FOR THREE BUSINESS DAYS FOLLOWING AND INCLUDING THE DAY OF RECEIPT OF THE CONFIRMATION.</P>
            <P>YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IN ORDER TO REALIZE ANY VALUE FROM A LONG LEVERAGE CONTRACT, THE LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT WHICH SOLD YOU THE LEVERAGE CONTRACT MUST REPURCHASE IT, OR YOU MUST PAY THE LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT THE FULL PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE LEVERAGE CONTRACT, TAKE DELIVERY OF THE LEVERAGE COMMODITY, AND THEN SELL THE LEVERAGE COMMODITY, POSSIBLY AT A LOWER PRICE THAN THE PRICE PAID TO PURCHASE THE LEVERAGE COMMODITY FROM THE LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT. YOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT IN ORDER TO REALIZE ANY VALUE FROM A SHORT LEVERAGE CONTRACT, THE LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT TO WHICH YOU SOLD THE LEVERAGE CONTRACT MUST RESELL IT TO YOU, OR YOU MUST ACQUIRE THE LEVERAGE COMMODITY IN ORDER TO MAKE DELIVERY TO THE LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT, POSSIBLY AT A HIGHER PRICE THAN THE PRICE YOU WILL RECEIVE FROM THE LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT.</P>
            <P>THERE IS NO MARKET FOR THE LEVERAGE CONTRACT ITSELF OTHER THAN TO HAVE IT REPURCHASED BY OR RESOLD TO THE LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT. A LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO OFFER TO REPURCHASE OR RESELL A LEVERAGE CONTRACT AT ALL TIMES, ALTHOUGH THE LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT MUST OFFER TO REPURCHASE ANY LONG LEVERAGE CONTRACT PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED BY A LEVERAGE CUSTOMER AND MUST ALSO OFFER TO RESELL ANY SHORT LEVERAGE CONTRACT PREVIOUSLY SOLD BY A LEVERAGE CUSTOMER AT ANY TIME DURING WHICH THE LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT IS OFFERING TO ENTER INTO NEW LONG OR SHORT LEVERAGE CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS INVOLVING THE SAME LEVERAGE COMMODITY. AS NOTED ABOVE, HOWEVER, A LEVERAGE TRANSACTION MERCHANT HAS COMPLETE DISCRETION IN SETTING THE PRICE AND ANY CHARGES RELATED THERETO.</P>
            <P>THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION HAS NOT PASSED UPON THE MERITS OF THESE LEVERAGE CONTRACTS AS AN INVESTMENT VEHICLE NOR UPON THE ACCURACY OR ADEQUACY OF THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A VIOLATION OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT AND THE REGULATIONS THEREUNDER.</P>

          <P>(a) Any person that accepts leverage customer funds from a leverage customer to enter into or maintain a leverage contract shall treat and deal with such leverage customer funds as belonging to that leverage customer. Such leverage customer funds: (1) Shall be separately accounted for and segregated as belonging to the leverage customer, (2) shall be kept in the United States, (3) shall not be commingled with the funds of any other person, and (4) shall not be used to secure or extend the credit of any leverage customer or person other than the one for whom the leverage customer funds are held: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That the leverage customer funds treated as belonging to a leverage customer may for convenience be commingled with other leverage customer funds and deposited in the same account or accounts with a futures commission merchant or with a bank or trust company located in the United States under conditions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Any leverage customer funds when so deposited with a futures commission merchant, bank or trust company, shall be deposited under an account name which clearly indicates that the account contains leverage customer funds that are segregated as required by this section. Each person so depositing any leverage customer funds shall obtain and retain in its files for the period provided in § 1.31 of this chapter an acknowledgment from the futures commission merchant, bank or trust company wherein the leverage customer funds have been deposited that the futures commission merchant, bank or trust company has been informed that the leverage customer funds deposited with it are being treated by the depositing person as belonging to leverage customers and are being held in accordance with the provisions of this section. The futures commission merchant, bank or trust company shall allow inspection of such segregated accounts, including all documents pertaining thereto, at any reasonable time by any representative of the Commission or designated self-regulatory organization, if any. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a leverage transaction merchant may exclude from its segregation requirements commissions and other charges lawfully accruing in connection with leverage contracts provided such charges have actually been made to leverage customers' accounts and are shown on the customers' statements.</P>

          <P>(i) Attached to each Form 2-FR filed pursuant to this section must be an oath or affirmation that to the best knowledge and belief of the individual making such oath or affirmation the information contained in the Form 2-FR is true and correct.

          <P>(v) Be accompanied by the latest available computation of required cover and by a computation of cover provided pursuant to § 31.8 as of the date of the latest available computation;</P>
          <P>(vi) Contain an agreement to file the report on or before the date specified by the leverage transaction merchant in the application;</P>
          <P>(vii) Be received by the designated self-regulatory organization prior to the date on which the report is due; and</P>
          <P>(viii) Be accompanied by a letter from the independent public accountant answering the following questions:</P>
          <P>(A) What specifically are the reasons for the extension request?</P>
          <P>(B) On the basis of that part of your audit to date, do you have any indication that may cause you to consider commenting on any material inadequacies in the accounting system, internal accounting controls or procedures for safeguarding customer or firm assets?</P>
          <P>(C) Do you have any indication from the part of your audit completed to date that would lead you to believe that the firm was or is not meeting the minimum capital requirements specified in § 31.9 or the cover or segregation requirements of these regulations, or has any significant financial or recordkeeping problems?</P>
          <P>(2) Within 10 calendar days after receipt of an application for extension of time, the designated self-regulatory organization shall:</P>
          <P>(i) Notify the leverage transaction merchant of the grant or denial of the requested extension; or</P>
          <P>(ii) Indicate that additional time is required to analyze the request, in which case the amount of time needed will be specified.</P>
          <P>(3) On the written request of a leverage transaction merchant, or on its own motion, the designated self-regulatory organization may grant an extension of time or an exemption from any of the certified financial reporting requirements of this section either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions.</P>

All information on such other statements, footnote disclosures <PRTPAGE P="684"/>and schedules will, however, be available for official use by any official or employee of the United States or any State, by any self-regulatory organization of which the person filing such report is a member, by the National Futures Association in the case of an applicant, and by any other person to whom the Commission believes disclosure of such information is in the public interest. The independent public accountant's opinion filed pursuant to this section will be deemed to be public information.</P>

          <P>(a) A leverage customer who is entering a leverage contract or contracts for the first time with a particular leverage transaction merchant may rescind such contract or contracts during a period of not less than three business days from and including the day on which the leverage customer receives the Confirmation Statement pursuant to the following provisions:</P>
          <P>(1) Such customer may be assessed actual price losses accruing to the customer's position from the time at which the customer entered into a leverage contract to the time that the leverage contract was rescinded. Such losses do not extend to any other charges or fees, such as account initiation, carrying, margin or account termination;</P>

          <P>(2) In the case of a leverage customer whose initial leverage transaction was a purchase of a leverage contract from a leverage transaction merchant (long <PRTPAGE P="689"/>leverage contract), actual losses accruing to the position may be calculated only by subtracting the ask price of the leverage contract offered by the leverage transaction merchant at the time when the leverage contract was rescinded from the ask price at which the leverage contract was purchased by the leverage customer and which appears on the Confirmation Statement. In the case of a leverage customer whose initial leverage transaction was a sale of a leverage contract to a leverage transaction merchant (short leverage contract), actual losses are calculated by subtracting the bid price at which the leverage contract was sold by the leverage customer and which appears on the Confirmation Statement from the bid price of the leverage contract offered by the leverage transaction merchant at the time when the leverage contract was rescinded.</P>
          <P>(3) Such customer may rescind the contract by telegram sent to the leverage transaction merchant at the address provided on the confirmation statement, or by telephone to a telephone number provided by the leverage transaction merchant on the Confirmation Statement with immediate written affirmation of rescission by telegram, certified letter or at least equivalent means.</P>
          <P>(b) A leverage transaction merchant must make complete refund of all monies received except for actual price losses as calculated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, to the leverage customer who has rescinded a contract pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section within 24 hours of notification of rescission.</P>

          <P>(b) A leverage transaction merchant must apply a carrying charge rate on a short leverage contract that is within one percent per annum of the carrying charge rate that it applies to a long leverage contract. In the case of a short leverage contract, the leverage customer must be credited with carrying charges computed on the total initial value of the contract, using the bid price when the contract was executed, plus any margin deposits made by the leverage customer in connection with the contract, and the same carrying charge rate must be applied to the total initial value of the contract and to the margin deposits. In the case of a long leverage contract, the leverage customer must be assessed carrying charges only on the unpaid balance of the contract, which is the total initial value of the contract, using the ask price when the contract was executed, minus any margin deposits made in connection with the contract: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That in the case of a long leverage contract, interest on unpaid carrying charges may be assessed at the same rate as the interest rate component of the carrying charges and, if such an assessment were made and if the leverage transaction merchant offers short leverage contracts, payment of interest on carrying charges that have been credited to the leverage customer's account and not withdrawn must be made at the same rate as the interest rate component of the carrying charges.</P>

          <P>(l) The profit or loss incurred by the leverage customer on the contract. In the case of a long leverage contract, profit or loss shall be determined by subtracting, from the total value of the contract based on the leverage transaction merchant's bid price at the time of repurchase or liquidation, the total value of the contract based on the ask price at which the contract was entered into, minus any amounts paid or owed by the leverage customer to the leverage transaction merchant, including initial, carrying and termination charges, plus any amounts paid or credited by the leverage transaction merchant to the leverage customer, in connection with the leverage contract. In the case of a short leverage contract, profit or loss shall be determined by subtracting, from the total value of the contract based on the bid price at which the contract was entered into, the total value of the contract based on the leverage transaction merchant's ask price at the time of resale or liquidation, minus any amounts paid or owed by the leverage customer to the leverage transaction merchant, including initial and termination charges, plus any amounts paid or credited by the leverage transaction merchant to the leverage customer, including carrying charges, in connection with the leverage contract.</P>

Each self-regulatory organization shall submit for Commission approval any modification or other amendments to such rules. Such requirements must be the same as, or more stringent than, those contained in this part 31 and the definition of adjusted net capital must be the same as <PRTPAGE P="691"/>that prescribed in § 31.9(b)(4) of this part.</P>

          <P>(1) Monitoring and auditing for compliance with the minimum financial, cover, segregation and sales practice, and related reporting requirements adopted by such self-regulatory organizations in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section; and</P>
          <P>(2) Receiving the reports necessitated by such minimum financial, cover, segregation and sales practice, and related reporting requirements.</P>
          <P>(d) Any plan filed under this section may contain provisions for the allocation of expenses reasonably incurred by the designated self-regulatory organization among the self-regulatory organizations participating in such a plan.</P>
          <P>(e) A plan's designated self-regulatory organization must report to that plan's other self-regulatory organizations any violation of such other self-regulatory organizations' rules and regulations for which the responsibility to monitor, audit or examine has been delegated to such designated self-regulatory organization under this section.</P>
          <P>(f) The self-regulatory organizations may, among themselves, establish programs to provide access to any necessary information.</P>

          <P>(1) Is necessary or appropriate to serve the public interest;</P>
          <P>(2) Is for the protection and in the interest of leverage customers;</P>
          <P>(3) Reduces multiple monitoring and auditing for compliance with the minimum financial, cover, segregation and sales practice, and related reporting requirements of the self-regulatory organizations submitting the plan for any leverage transaction merchant which is a member of more than one self-regulatory organization;</P>
          <P>(4) Reduces multiple reporting of the information necessitated by such minimum financial, cover, segregation and sales practice, and related reporting requirements by any leverage transaction merchant which is a member of more than one self-regulatory organization;</P>
          <P>(5) Fosters cooperation and coordination among the self-regulatory organizations; and</P>
          <P>(6) Does not hinder the development of a registered futures association under section 17 of the Act.</P>
          <P>(h) After the Commission has approved a plan or part of one under paragraph (g) of this section, a self-regulatory organization relieved of responsibility must notify each of its members which is subject to such a plan:</P>
          <P>(1) Of the limited nature of its responsibility for such a member's compliance with its minimum financial, cover, segregation and sales practice, and related reporting requirements; and</P>

          <P>(i) The Commission may at any time, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, withdraw its approval of any plan or part of one established under this section, if such plan or part of one ceases to effectuate adequately the purposes of section 19 of the Act or of this section.</P>

          <P>(j) Whenever a registered leverage transaction merchant holding membership in a self-regulatory organization ceases to be a member in good standing of that self-regulatory organization, such self-regulatory organization must, on the same day that event takes place, give telegraphic notice of that event to the principal office of the Commission in Washington, DC and send a copy of that notification to such leverage transaction merchant.<PRTPAGE P="692"/>

          <P>(b) Such board of trade adopts rules which:</P>
          <P>(1) Prescribe in regard to strike prices:</P>

          <P>(2) Prescribe an expiration date of the option that is not less than one business day before the earlier of the last trading day or the first notice day of any futures contract on the same or a related commodity; <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That where the underlying futures contract is cash-settled, the option may expire simultaneously with the expiration of the futures contract.<PRTPAGE P="697"/>
          </P>
          <P>(3) Require that upon exercise of each option, notification thereof be given to the option grantor.</P>
          <P>(4) Require, with respect to all written option customer complaints, that each member futures commission merchant which engages in the offer or sale of commodity options regulated under this part:</P>
          <P>(i) Retain all such complaints;</P>
          <P>(ii) Make and retain a record of the date the complaint was received, the associated person who serviced, or the introducing broker who introduced, the account, a general description of the matter complained of, and what, if any, action was taken by the futures commission merchant in regard to the complaint; and</P>

          <P>(5) Require each member futures commission merchant which engages in the offer or sale of option contracts regulated under this part to adopt and enforce written procedures pursuant to which it will be able to supervise adequately each option customer's account, including but not limited to, the solicitation of any such account: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That as used in this paragraph (b)(5), the term “option customer” does not include another futures commission merchant.</P>

          <P>(c) Such board of trade establishes procedures and conducts sales practice audits of member futures commission merchants which engage in the offer or sale of option contracts regulated under this part.

            <P>BECAUSE OF THE VOLATILE NATURE OF THE COMMODITIES MARKETS, THE PURCHASE AND GRANTING OF COMMODITY OPTIONS INVOLVE A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. COMMODITY OPTION TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR MANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. SUCH TRANSACTIONS SHOULD BE ENTERED INTO ONLY BY PERSONS WHO HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT AND WHO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THEIR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS AND OF THE RISKS INVOLVED IN THE OPTION TRANSACTIONS COVERED BY THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT.</P>
            <FP>BOTH THE PURCHASER AND THE GRANTOR SHOULD KNOW THAT THE OPTION IF EXERCISED, RESULTS IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A FUTURES CONTRACT (AN “OPTION ON A FUTURES CONTRACT”).</FP>
            <P>BOTH THE PURCHASER AND THE GRANTOR SHOULD KNOW WHETHER THE PARTICULAR OPTION IN WHICH THEY CONTEMPLATE TRADING IS SUBJECT TO A “STOCK-STYLE” OR “FUTURES-STYLE” SYSTEM OF MARGINING. UNDER A STOCK-STYLE MARGINING SYSTEM, A PURCHASER IS REQUIRED TO PAY THE FULL PURCHASE PRICE OF THE OPTION AT THE INITIATION OF THE TRANSACTION. THE PURCHASER HAS NO FURTHER OBLIGATION ON THE OPTION POSITION. UNDER A FUTURES-STYLE MARGINING SYSTEM, THE PURCHASER DEPOSITS INITIAL MARGIN AND MAY BE REQUIRED TO DEPOSIT ADDITIONAL MARGIN IF THE MARKET MOVES AGAINST THE OPTION POSITION. THE PURCHASER'S TOTAL SETTLEMENT VARIATION MARGIN OBLIGATION OVER THE LIFE OF THE OPTION, HOWEVER, WILL NOT EXCEED THE ORIGINAL OPTION PREMIUM, ALTHOUGH SOME INDIVIDUAL PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS AND/OR RISK MARGIN REQUIREMENTS MAY AT TIMES EXCEED THE ORIGINAL OPTION PREMIUM. IF THE PURCHASER OR GRANTOR DOES NOT UNDERSTAND HOW OPTIONS ARE MARGINED UNDER A STOCK-STYLE OR FUTURES-STYLE MARGINING SYSTEM, HE OR SHE SHOULD REQUEST AN EXPLANATION FROM THE FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT (“FCM”) OR INTRODUCING BROKER (“IB”).</P>
            <P>A PERSON SHOULD NOT PURCHASE ANY COMMODITY OPTION UNLESS HE OR SHE IS ABLE TO SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE PREMIUM AND TRANSACTION COSTS OF PURCHASING THE OPTION. A PERSON SHOULD NOT GRANT ANY COMMODITY OPTION UNLESS HE OR SHE IS ABLE TO MEET ADDITIONAL CALLS FOR MARGIN WHEN THE MARKET MOVES AGAINST HIS OR HER POSITION AND, IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, TO SUSTAIN A VERY LARGE FINANCIAL LOSS.</P>
            <P>A PERSON WHO PURCHASES AN OPTION SUBJECT TO STOCK-STYLE MARGINING SHOULD BE AWARE THAT, IN ORDER TO REALIZE ANY VALUE FROM THE OPTION, IT WILL BE NECESSARY EITHER TO OFFSET THE OPTION POSITION OR TO EXERCISE THE OPTION. OPTIONS SUBJECT TO FUTURES-STYLE MARGINING ARE MARKED TO MARKET, AND GAINS AND LOSSES ARE PAID AND COLLECTED DAILY. IF AN OPTION PURCHASER DOES NOT UNDERSTAND HOW TO OFFSET OR EXERCISE AN OPTION, THE PURCHASER SHOULD REQUEST AN EXPLANATION FROM THE FCM OR IB. CUSTOMERS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IN A NUMBER OF CIRCUMSTANCES, SOME OF WHICH WILL BE DESCRIBED IN THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO OFFSET AN EXISTING OPTION POSITION ON AN EXCHANGE.</P>
            <P>THE GRANTOR OF AN OPTION SHOULD BE AWARE THAT, IN MOST CASES, A COMMODITY OPTION MAY BE EXERCISED AT ANY TIME FROM THE TIME IT IS GRANTED UNTIL IT EXPIRES. THE PURCHASER OF AN OPTION SHOULD BE AWARE THAT SOME OPTION CONTRACTS MAY PROVIDE ONLY A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME FOR EXERCISE OF THE OPTION.</P>
            <P>THE PURCHASER OF A PUT OR CALL SUBJECT TO STOCK-STYLE OR FUTURES-STYLE MARGINING IS SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF LOSING THE ENTIRE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE OPTION—THAT IS, THE PREMIUM CHARGED FOR THE OPTION PLUS ALL TRANSACTION COSTS.</P>

            <P>THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION REQUIRES THAT ALL CUSTOMERS RECEIVE AND ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF A COPY OF THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT BUT DOES NOT INTEND THIS STATEMENT AS A RECOMMENDATION OR ENDORSEMENT OF <PRTPAGE P="700"/>EXCHANGE-TRADED COMMODITY OPTIONS.
            </P>
            <P>(1) Some of the risks of option trading.</P>
            <P>Specific market movements of the underlying future cannot be predicted accurately.</P>
            <P>The grantor of a call option who does not have a long position in the underlying futures contract is subject to risk of loss should the price of the underlying futures contract be higher than the strike price upon exercise or expiration of the option by an amount greater than the premium received for granting the call option.</P>
            <P>The grantor of a call option who has a long position in the underlying futures contract is subject to the full risk of a decline in price of the underlying position reduced by the premium received for granting the call. In exchange for the premium received for granting a call option, the option grantor gives up all of the potential gain resulting from an increase in the price of the underlying futures contract above the option strike price upon exercise or expiration of the option.</P>
            <P>The grantor of a put option who does not have a short position in the underlying futures contract is subject to risk of loss should the price of the underlying futures contract decrease below the strike price upon exercise or expiration of the option by an amount in excess of the premium received for granting the put option.</P>
            <P>The grantor of a put option on a futures contract who has a short position in the underlying futures contract is subject to the full risk of a rise in the price in the underlying position reduced by the premium received for granting the put. In exchange for the premium received for granting a put option on a futures contract, the option grantor gives up all of the potential gain resulting from a decrease in the price of the underlying futures contract below the option strike price upon exercise or expiration of the option.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Description of commodity options.</E> Prior to entering into any transaction involving a commodity option, an individual should thoroughly understand the nature and type of option involved and the underlying futures contract. The futures commission merchant or introducing broker is required to provide, and the individual contemplating an option transaction should obtain:</P>
            <P>(i) An identification of the futures contract underlying the option and which may be purchased or sold upon exercise of the option or, if applicable, whether exercise of the option will be settled in cash;</P>
            <P>(ii) The procedure for exercise of the option contract, including the expiration date and latest time on that date for exercise. (The latest time on an expiration date when an option may be exercised may vary; therefore, option market participants should ascertain from their futures commission merchant or their introducing broker the latest time the firm accepts exercise instructions with respect to a particular option.);</P>
            <P>(iii) A description of the purchase price of the option including the premium, commissions, costs, fees and other charges. (Since commissions and other charges may vary widely among futures commission merchants and among introducing brokers, option customers may find it advisable to consult more than one firm when opening an option account.);</P>
            <P>(iv) A description of all costs in addition to the purchase price which may be incurred if the commodity option is exercised, including the amount of commissions (whether termed sales commissions or otherwise), storage, interest, and all similar fees and charges which may be incurred;</P>
            <P>(v) An explanation and understanding of the option margining system;</P>
            <P>(vi) A clear explanation and understanding of any clauses in the option contract and of any items included in the option contract explicitly or by reference which might affect the customer's obligations under the contract. This would include any policy of the futures commission merchant or the introducing broker or rule of the exchange on which the option is traded that might affect the customer's ability to fulfill the option contract or to offset the option position in a closing purchase or closing sale transaction (for example, due to unforeseen circumstances that require suspension or termination of trading); and</P>
            <P>(vii) If applicable, a description of the effect upon the value of the option position that could result from limit moves in the underlying futures contract.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">The mechanics of option trading.</E> Before entering into any exchange-traded option transaction, an individual should obtain a description of how commodity options are traded.</P>
            <P>Option customers should clearly understand that there is no guarantee that option positions may be offset by either a closing purchase or closing sale transaction on an exchange. In this circumstance, option grantors could be subject to the full risk of their positions until the option position expires, and the purchaser of a profitable option might have to exercise the option to realize a profit.</P>

            <P>For an option on a futures contract, an individual should clearly understand the relationship between exchange rules governing option transactions and exchange rules governing the underlying futures contract. For example, an individual should understand what action, if any, the exchange will take in the option market if trading in the underlying futures market is restricted or the futures prices have made a “limit move.”<PRTPAGE P="701"/>
            </P>
            <P>The individual should understand that the option may not be subject to daily price fluctuation limits while the underlying futures may have such limits, and, as a result, normal pricing relationships between options and the underlying future may not exist when the future is trading at its price limit. Also, underlying futures positions resulting from exercise of options may not be capable of being offset if the underlying future is at a price limit.</P>
            <P>(4) Margin requirements. An individual should know and understand whether the option he or she is contemplating trading is subject to a stock-style or futures-style system of margining. Stock-style margining requires the purchaser to pay the full option premium at the time of purchase. The purchaser has no further financial obligations, and the risk of loss is limited to the purchase price and transaction costs. Futures-style margining requires the purchaser to pay initial margin only at the time of purchase. The option position is marked to market, and gains and losses are collected and paid daily. The purchaser's risk of loss is limited to the initial option premium and transaction costs.</P>
            <P>An individual granting options under either a stock-style or futures-style system of margining should understand that he or she may be required to pay additional margin in the case of adverse market movements.</P>
            <P>(5) Profit potential of an option position. An option customer should carefully calculate the price which the underlying futures contract would have to reach for the option position to become profitable. Under a stock-style margining system, this price would include the amount by which the underlying futures contract would have to rise above or fall below the strike price to cover the sum of the premium and all other costs incurred in entering into and exercising or closing (offsetting) the commodity option position. Under a future-style margining system, option positions would be marked to market, and gains and losses would be paid and collected daily, and an option position would become profitable once the variation margin collected exceeded the cost of entering the contract position.</P>
            <P>Also, an option customer should be aware of the risk that the futures price prevailing at the opening of the next trading day may be substantially different from the futures price which prevailed when the option was exercised.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Deep-out-of-the-money options.</E> A person contemplating purchasing a deep-out-of-the-money option (that is, an option with a strike price significantly above, in the case of a call, or significantly below, in the case of a put, the current price of the underlying futures contract) should be aware that the chance of such an option becoming profitable is ordinarily remote.</P>
            <P>On the other hand, a potential grantor of a deep-out-of-the-money option should be aware that such options normally provide small premiums while exposing the grantor to all of the potential losses described in section (1) of this disclosure statement.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Glossary of terms</E>—(i) <E T="03">Contract market.</E> Any board of trade (exchange) located in the United States which has been designated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to list a futures contract or commodity option for trading.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Exchange-traded option; put option; call option.</E> The options discussed in this disclosure statement are limited to those which may be traded on a contract market. These options (subject to certain exceptions) give an option purchaser the right to buy in the case of a call option, or to sell in the case of a put option, a futures contract underlying the option at the stated strike price prior to the expiration date of the option. Each exchange-traded option is distinguished by the underlying futures contract, strike price, expiration date, and whether the option is a put or a call.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Underlying futures contract.</E> The futures contract which may be purchased or sold upon the exercise of an option on a futures contract.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Scope.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The provisions of this part shall apply to any hybrid instrument which may be subject to the Act, and which has been entered into on or after October 23, 1974.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Hybrid instruments.</E> Hybrid instrument means an equity or debt security or depository instrument as defined in § 34.3(a)(1) with one or more commodity-dependent components that have payment features similar to commodity futures or commodity option contracts or combinations thereof.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Commodity-independent component.</E> Commodity-independent component means the component of a hybrid instrument, the payments of which do not result from indexing to, or calculation by reference to, the price of a commodity.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Commodity-independent value.</E> Commodity-independent value means the present value of the payments attributable to the commodity-independent component calculated as of the time of issuance of the hybrid instrument.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Commodity-dependent component.</E> A commodity-dependent component means a component of a hybrid instrument, the payment of which results from indexing to, or calculation by reference to, the price of a commodity.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Commodity-dependent value.</E> For purposes of application of Rule 34.3(a)(2), a commodity-dependent value means the value of a commodity dependent-component, which when decomposed into an option payout or payouts, is measured by the absolute net value of the put option premia with strike prices less than or equal to the reference price plus the absolute net value of the call option premia with strike prices greater than or equal to the reference price, calculated as of the time of issuance of the hybrid instrument.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Option premium.</E> Option premium means the value of an option on the referenced commodity of the hybrid instrument, and calculated using the <PRTPAGE P="704"/>same method as that used to determine the issue price of the instrument, or where such premia are not explicitly calculated in determining the issue price of the instrument, the value of such options calculated using a commercially reasonable method appropriate to the instrument being priced.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Reference price.</E> A reference price means a price nearest the current spot or forward price, whichever is used to price instrument, at which a commodity-dependent payment becomes non-zero, or, in the case where two potential reference prices exist, the price that results in the greatest commodity-dependent value.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 34.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Hybrid instrument exemption.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) A hybrid instrument is exempt from all provisions of the Act and any person or class of persons offering, entering into, rendering advice or rendering other services with respect to such exempt hybrid instrument is exempt for such activity from all provisions of the Act (except in each case section 2(a)(1)(B)), provided the following terms and conditions are met:</P>
          <P>(1) The instrument is:</P>
          <P>(i) An equity or debt security within the meaning of section 2(1) of the Securities Act of 1933; or</P>
          <P>(ii) A demand deposit, time deposit or transaction account within the meaning of 12 CFR 204.2 (b)(1), (c)(1) and (e), respectively, offered by an insured depository institution as defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act; an insured credit union as defined in section 101 of the Federal Credit Union Act; or a Federal or State branch or agency of a foreign bank as defined in section 1 of the International Banking Act;</P>
          <P>(2) The sum of the commodity-dependent values of the commodity-dependent components is less than the commodity-independent value of the commodity-independent component;</P>
          <P>(3) Provided that:</P>
          <P>(i) An issuer must receive full payment of the hybrid instrument's purchase price, and a purchaser or holder of a hybrid instrument may not be required to make additional out-of-pocket payments to the issuer during the life of the instrument or at maturity; and</P>
          <P>(ii) The instrument is not marketed as a futures contract or a commodity option, or, except to the extent necessary to describe the functioning of the instrument or to comply with applicable disclosure requirements, as having the characteristics of a futures contract or a commodity option; and</P>
          <P>(iii) The instrument does not provide for settlement in the form of a delivery instrument that is specified as such in the rules of a designed contract market;</P>
          <P>(4) The instrument is initially issued or sold subject to applicable federal or state securities or banking laws to persons permitted thereunder to purchase or enter into the hybrid instrument.</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Adjustment of time delay requirement.</E> A swap execution facility may adjust the time period of the 15 second time delay requirement described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, based upon a swap's liquidity or other product-specific considerations; however, the time delay shall be set for a sufficient period of time so that an order is exposed to the market and other market participants have a meaningful opportunity to execute against such order.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Rule enforcement program.</SUBJECT>
            <P>A swap execution facility shall establish and enforce trading, trade processing, and participation rules that will deter abuses and it shall have the capacity to detect, investigate, and enforce those rules.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Abusive trading practices prohibited.</E> A swap execution facility shall prohibit abusive trading practices on its markets by members and market participants. Swap execution facilities that permit intermediation shall prohibit customer-related abuses including, but not limited to, trading ahead of customer orders, trading against customer orders, accommodation trading, and improper cross trading. Specific trading practices that shall be prohibited include front-running, wash trading, pre-arranged trading (except for block trades permitted by part 43 of this chapter or other types of transactions certified to or approved by the Commission pursuant to the procedures under part 40 of this chapter), fraudulent trading, money passes, and any other trading practices that a swap execution facility deems to be abusive. A swap execution facility shall also prohibit any other manipulative or disruptive trading practices prohibited by the Act or by the Commission pursuant to Commission regulation.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Capacity to detect and investigate rule violations.</E> A swap execution facility shall have arrangements and resources for effective enforcement of its rules. Such arrangements shall include the authority to collect information <PRTPAGE P="715"/>and documents on both a routine and non-routine basis, including the authority to examine books and records kept by the swap execution facility's members and by persons under investigation. A swap execution facility's arrangements and resources shall also facilitate the direct supervision of the market and the analysis of data collected to determine whether a rule violation has occurred.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Compliance staff and resources.</E> A swap execution facility shall establish and maintain sufficient compliance staff and resources to ensure that it can conduct effective audit trail reviews, trade practice surveillance, market surveillance, and real-time market monitoring. The swap execution facility's compliance staff shall also be sufficient to address unusual market or trading events as they arise, and to conduct and complete investigations in a timely manner, as set forth in § 37.203(f).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Automated trade surveillance system.</E> A swap execution facility shall maintain an automated trade surveillance system capable of detecting potential trade practice violations. The automated trade surveillance system shall load and process daily orders and trades no later than 24 hours after the completion of the trading day. The automated trade surveillance system shall have the capability to detect and flag specific trade execution patterns and trade anomalies; compute, retain, and compare trading statistics; compute trade gains, losses, and swap-equivalent positions; reconstruct the sequence of market activity; perform market analyses; and support system users to perform in-depth analyses and ad hoc queries of trade-related data.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Real-time market monitoring.</E> A swap execution facility shall conduct real-time market monitoring of all trading activity on its system(s) or platform(s) to identify disorderly trading and any market or system anomalies. A swap execution facility shall have the authority to adjust trade prices or cancel trades when necessary to mitigate market disrupting events caused by malfunctions in its system(s) or platform(s) or errors in orders submitted by members and market participants. Any trade price adjustments or trade cancellations shall be transparent to the market and subject to standards that are clear, fair, and publicly available.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Investigations and investigation reports</E>—(1) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> A swap execution facility shall establish and maintain procedures that require its compliance staff to conduct investigations of possible rule violations.

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Timeliness.</E> Each compliance staff investigation shall be completed in a timely manner. Absent mitigating factors, a timely manner is no later than 12 months after the date that an investigation is opened. Mitigating factors that may reasonably justify an investigation taking longer than 12 months to complete include the complexity of the investigation, the number of firms or individuals involved as potential wrongdoers, the number of potential violations to be investigated, and the volume of documents and data to be examined and analyzed by compliance staff.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Investigation reports when a reasonable basis exists for finding a violation.</E> Compliance staff shall submit a written investigation report for disciplinary action in every instance in which compliance staff determines from surveillance or from an investigation that a reasonable basis exists for finding a rule violation. The investigation report shall include the reason the investigation was initiated; a summary of the complaint, if any; the relevant facts; compliance staff's analysis and conclusions; and a recommendation as to whether disciplinary action should be pursued.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Investigation reports when no reasonable basis exists for finding a violation.</E> If after conducting an investigation, compliance staff determines that no reasonable basis exists for finding a rule violation, it shall prepare a written report including the reason the investigation was initiated; a summary of the complaint, if any; the relevant <PRTPAGE P="716"/>facts; and compliance staff's analysis and conclusions.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Warning letters.</E> No more than one warning letter may be issued to the same person or entity found to have committed the same rule violation within a rolling twelve month period.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Use of regulatory service provider permitted.</E> A swap execution facility may choose to contract with a registered futures association or another registered entity, as such terms are defined under the Act, or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (collectively, “regulatory service providers”), for the provision of services to assist in complying with the Act and Commission regulations thereunder, as approved by the Commission. Any swap execution facility that chooses to contract with a regulatory service provider shall ensure that such provider has the capacity and resources necessary to provide timely and effective regulatory services, including adequate staff and automated surveillance systems. A swap execution facility shall at all times remain responsible for the performance of any regulatory services received, for compliance with the swap execution facility's obligations under the Act and Commission regulations, and for the regulatory service provider's performance on its behalf.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Duty to supervise regulatory service provider.</E> A swap execution facility that elects to use the service of a regulatory service provider shall retain sufficient compliance staff to supervise the quality and effectiveness of the regulatory services provided on its behalf. Compliance staff of the swap execution facility shall hold regular meetings with the regulatory service provider to discuss ongoing investigations, trading patterns, market participants, and any other matters of regulatory concern. A swap execution facility shall also conduct periodic reviews of the adequacy and effectiveness of services provided on its behalf. Such reviews shall be documented carefully and made available to the Commission upon request.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Regulatory decisions required from the swap execution facility.</E> A swap execution facility that elects to use the service of a regulatory service provider shall retain exclusive authority in all substantive decisions made by its regulatory service provider, including, but not limited to, decisions involving the cancellation of trades, the issuance of disciplinary charges against members or market participants, and denials of access to the trading platform for disciplinary reasons. A swap execution facility shall document any instances where its actions differ from those recommended by its regulatory service provider, including the reasons for the course of action recommended by the regulatory service provider and the reasons why the swap execution facility chose a different course of action.</P>

Such data shall be sufficient to reconstruct all indications of interest, requests for quotes, orders, and trades within a reasonable period of time and to provide evidence of any violations of the rules of the swap execution facility. An acceptable audit trail shall also permit the swap execution facility to track a customer order from the time of receipt through fill, allocation, or other disposition, and shall include both order and trade data.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Elements of an acceptable audit trail program</E>—(1) <E T="03">Original source documents.</E> A swap execution facility's audit trail shall include original source documents. Original source documents include unalterable, sequentially-identified records on which trade execution information is originally recorded, whether recorded manually or electronically. Records for customer orders (whether filled, unfilled, or cancelled, <PRTPAGE P="717"/>each of which shall be retained or electronically captured) shall reflect the terms of the order, an account identifier that relates back to the account(s) owner(s), the time of order entry, and the time of trade execution. Swap execution facilities shall require that all orders, indications of interest, and requests for quotes be immediately captured in the audit trail.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Transaction history database.</E> A swap execution facility's audit trail program shall include an electronic transaction history database. An adequate transaction history database includes a history of all indications of interest, requests for quotes, orders, and trades entered into a swap execution facility's trading system or platform, including all order modifications and cancellations. An adequate transaction history database also includes:</P>
            <P>(i) All data that are input into the trade entry or matching system for the transaction to match and clear;</P>
            <P>(ii) The customer type indicator code;</P>

            <P>(3) <E T="03">Electronic analysis capability.</E> A swap execution facility's audit trail program shall include electronic analysis capability with respect to all audit trail data in the transaction history database. Such electronic analysis capability shall ensure that the swap execution facility has the ability to reconstruct indications of interest, requests for quotes, orders, and trades, and identify possible trading violations with respect to both customer and market abuse.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Safe storage capability.</E> A swap execution facility's audit trail program shall include the capability to safely store all audit trail data retained in its transaction history database. Such safe storage capability shall include the capability to store all data in the database in a manner that protects it from unauthorized alteration, as well as from accidental erasure or other loss. Data shall be retained in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements of Core Principle 10 for swap execution facilities and the associated regulations in subpart K of this part.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Enforcement of audit trail requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Annual audit trail and recordkeeping reviews.</E> A swap execution facility shall enforce its audit trail and recordkeeping requirements through at least annual reviews of all members and persons and firms subject to the swap execution facility's recordkeeping rules to verify their compliance with the swap execution facility's audit trail and recordkeeping requirements. Such reviews shall include, but are not limited to, reviews of randomly selected samples of front-end audit trail data for order routing systems; a review of the process by which user identifications are assigned and user identification records are maintained; a review of usage patterns associated with user identifications to monitor for violations of user identification rules; and reviews of account numbers and customer type indicator codes in trade records to test for accuracy and improper use.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Enforcement program required.</E> A swap execution facility shall establish a program for effective enforcement of its audit trail and recordkeeping requirements. An effective program shall identify members and persons and firms subject to the swap execution facility's recordkeeping rules that have failed to maintain high levels of compliance with such requirements, and impose meaningful sanctions when deficiencies are found. Sanctions shall be sufficient to deter recidivist behavior. No more than one warning letter shall be issued to the same person or entity found to have committed the same violation of audit trail or recordkeeping requirements within a rolling twelve month period.</P>

Disciplinary panels shall meet the composition requirements of part 40 of this chapter, and shall not include any members of the swap execution facility's compliance staff or any person involved in adjudicating any other stage of the same proceeding.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Hearings.</E> A swap execution facility shall adopt rules that provide for the following minimum requirements for any hearing:</P>

            <P>(i) The transcript is requested by Commission staff or the respondent;</P>
            <P>(ii) The decision is appealed pursuant to the rules of the swap execution facility; or</P>
            <P>(iii) The decision is reviewed by the Commission pursuant to section 8c of the Act or part 9 of this chapter. In all other instances, a summary record of a hearing is permitted.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Decisions.</E> Promptly following a hearing conducted in accordance with the rules of the swap execution facility, the disciplinary panel shall render a written decision based upon the weight of the evidence contained in the record of the proceeding and shall provide a copy to the respondent.

            <P>(4) A statement of findings and conclusions with respect to each charge, and a complete explanation of the evidentiary and other basis for such findings and conclusions with respect to each charge;</P>
            <P>(5) An indication of each specific rule that the respondent was found to have violated; and</P>
            <P>(6) A declaration of all sanctions imposed against the respondent, including the basis for such sanctions and the effective date of such sanctions.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Disciplinary sanctions.</E> All disciplinary sanctions imposed by a swap execution facility or its disciplinary panels shall be commensurate with the violations committed and shall be clearly sufficient to deter recidivism or similar violations by other market participants. All disciplinary sanctions, including sanctions imposed pursuant to an accepted settlement offer, shall take into account the respondent's disciplinary history. In the event of demonstrated customer harm, any disciplinary sanction shall also include full customer restitution, except where the amount of restitution or to whom it should be provided cannot be reasonably determined.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Warning letters.</E> Where a rule violation is found to have occurred, no more than one warning letter may be issued per rolling twelve month period for the same violation.</P>

            <EAR>Pt. 37, App. B</EAR>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix B to Part 37—Guidance on, and Acceptable Practices in, Compliance with Core Principles</HD>
            <P>1. This appendix provides guidance on complying with core principles, both initially and on an ongoing basis, to maintain registration under section 5h of the Act and this part 37. Where provided, guidance is set forth in paragraph (a) following the relevant heading and can be used to demonstrate to the Commission compliance with the selected requirements of a core principle of this part 37. The guidance for the core principle is illustrative only of the types of matters a swap execution facility may address, as applicable, and is not intended to be used as a mandatory checklist. Addressing the issues set forth in this appendix would help the Commission in its consideration of whether the swap execution facility is in compliance with the selected requirements of a core principle; provided however, that the guidance is not intended to diminish or replace, in any event, the obligations and requirements of applicants and swap execution facilities to comply with the regulations provided under this part 37.</P>
            <P>2. Where provided, acceptable practices meeting selected requirements of core principles are set forth in paragraph (b) following the guidance. Swap execution facilities that follow specific practices outlined in the acceptable practices for a core principle in this appendix will meet the selected requirements of the applicable core principle; provided however, that the acceptable practice is not intended to diminish or replace, in any event, the obligations and requirements of applicants and swap execution facilities to comply with the regulations provided under this part 37. The acceptable practices are for illustrative purposes only and do not state the exclusive means for satisfying a core principle.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Core Principle 2 of Section 5h of the Act—Compliance With Rules</HD>
            <P>A swap execution facility shall:</P>
            <P>(A) Establish and enforce compliance with any rule of the swap execution facility, including the terms and conditions of the swaps traded or processed on or through the swap execution facility and any limitation on access to the swap execution facility;</P>
            <P>(B) Establish and enforce trading, trade processing, and participation rules that will deter abuses and have the capacity to detect, investigate, and enforce those rules, including means to provide market participants with impartial access to the market and to capture information that may be used in establishing whether rule violations have occurred;</P>
            <P>(C) Establish rules governing the operation of the facility, including rules specifying trading procedures to be used in entering and executing orders traded or posted on the facility, including block trades; and</P>
            <P>(D) Provide by its rules that when a swap dealer or major swap participant enters into or facilitates a swap that is subject to the mandatory clearing requirement of section 2(h) of the Act, the swap dealer or major swap participant shall be responsible for compliance with the mandatory trading requirement under section 2(h)(8) of the Act.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Guidance.</E> (1) <E T="03">Investigations and investigation reports—Warning letters.</E> The rules of a swap execution facility may authorize its compliance staff to issue a warning letter to a person or entity under investigation or to recommend that a disciplinary panel take such an action.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Additional rules required.</E> A swap execution facility should adopt and enforce any additional rules that it believes are necessary to comply with the requirements of § 37.203.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Enforcement staff.</E> A swap execution facility's enforcement staff should not include either members of the swap execution facility or persons whose interests conflict with their enforcement duties. A member of the enforcement staff should not operate under the direction or control of any person or persons with trading privileges at the swap execution facility. A swap execution facility's enforcement staff may operate as part of the swap execution facility's compliance department.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Notice of charges.</E> If compliance staff authorized by a swap execution facility or a swap execution facility disciplinary panel determines, based upon reviewing an investigation report pursuant to § 37.203(f)(3), that a reasonable basis exists for finding a violation and adjudication is warranted, it should direct that the person or entity alleged to have committed the violation be served with a notice of charges and should proceed in accordance with this guidance. A notice of charges should adequately state the acts, conduct, or practices in which the respondent is alleged to have engaged; state the rule, or rules, alleged to have been violated (or about to be violated); advise the respondent that it is entitled, upon request, to a hearing on the charges; and prescribe the period within which a hearing on the charges may be requested. If the rules of the swap execution facility so provide, a notice may also advise:</P>
            <P>(i) That failure to request a hearing within the period prescribed in the notice, except for good cause, may be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing; and</P>
            <P>(ii) That failure to answer or to deny expressly a charge may be deemed to be an admission of such charge.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Right to representation.</E> Upon being served with a notice of charges, a respondent should have the right to be represented by legal counsel or any other representative of its choosing in all succeeding stages of the disciplinary process, except by any member of the swap execution facility's board of directors or disciplinary panel, any employee of the swap execution facility, or any person substantially related to the underlying investigations, such as a material witness or respondent.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Answer to charges.</E> A respondent should be given a reasonable period of time to file an answer to a notice of charges. The rules of a swap execution facility governing the requirements and timeliness of a respondent's answer to a notice of charges should be fair, equitable, and publicly available.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Admission or failure to deny charges.</E> The rules of a swap execution facility may provide that if a respondent admits or fails to deny any of the charges, a disciplinary panel may find that the violations alleged in the notice of charges for which the respondent admitted or failed to deny any of the charges have been committed. If the swap execution facility's rules so provide, then:</P>
            <P>(i) The disciplinary panel should impose a sanction for each violation found to have been committed;</P>
            <P>(ii) The disciplinary panel should promptly notify the respondent in writing of any sanction to be imposed pursuant to paragraph (7)(i) of this guidance and shall advise the respondent that it may request a hearing on such sanction within the period of time, which shall be stated in the notice;</P>
            <P>(iii) The rules of a swap execution facility may provide that if a respondent fails to request a hearing within the period of time stated in the notice, the respondent will be deemed to have accepted the sanction.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Denial of charges and right to hearing.</E> In every instance where a respondent has requested a hearing on a charge that is denied, or on a sanction set by the disciplinary <PRTPAGE P="739"/>panel, the respondent should be given an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the rules of the swap execution facility.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Settlement offers.</E> (i) The rules of a swap execution facility may permit a respondent to submit a written offer of settlement at any time after an investigation report is completed. The disciplinary panel presiding over the matter may accept the offer of settlement, but may not alter the terms of a settlement offer unless the respondent agrees.</P>
            <P>(ii) The rules of a swap execution facility may provide that, in its discretion, a disciplinary panel may permit the respondent to accept a sanction without either admitting or denying the rule violations upon which the sanction is based.</P>
            <P>(iii) If an offer of settlement is accepted, the panel accepting the offer should issue a written decision specifying the rule violations it has reason to believe were committed, including the basis or reasons for the panel's conclusions, and any sanction to be imposed, which should include full customer restitution where customer harm is demonstrated, except where the amount of restitution or to whom it should be provided cannot be reasonably determined. If an offer of settlement is accepted without the agreement of the enforcement staff, the decision should adequately support the disciplinary panel's acceptance of the settlement. Where applicable, the decision should also include a statement that the respondent has accepted the sanctions imposed without either admitting or denying the rule violations.</P>
            <P>(iv) The respondent may withdraw his or her offer of settlement at any time before final acceptance by a disciplinary panel. If an offer is withdrawn after submission, or is rejected by a disciplinary panel, the respondent should not be deemed to have made any admissions by reason of the offer of settlement and should not be otherwise prejudiced by having submitted the offer of settlement.</P>
            <P>(10) <E T="03">Hearings.</E> (i) The swap execution facility need not apply the formal rules of evidence for a hearing; nevertheless, the procedures for the hearing may not be so informal as to deny a fair hearing. No member of the disciplinary panel for the matter may have a financial, personal, or other direct interest in the matter under consideration.</P>
            <P>(ii) In advance of the hearing, the respondent should be entitled to examine all books, documents, or other evidence in the possession or under the control of the swap execution facility. The swap execution facility may withhold documents that: Are privileged or constitute attorney work product; were prepared by an employee of the swap execution facility but will not be offered in evidence in the disciplinary proceedings; may disclose a technique or guideline used in examinations, investigations, or enforcement proceedings; or disclose the identity of a confidential source.</P>
            <P>(iii) The swap execution facility's enforcement and compliance staffs should be parties to the hearing, and the enforcement staff should present their case on those charges and sanctions that are the subject of the hearing.</P>
            <P>(iv) The respondent should be entitled to appear personally at the hearing, should be entitled to cross-examine any persons appearing as witnesses at the hearing, and should be entitled to call witnesses and to present such evidence as may be relevant to the charges.</P>
            <P>(v) The swap execution facility should require persons within its jurisdiction who are called as witnesses to participate in the hearing and produce evidence. The swap execution facility should make reasonable efforts to secure the presence of all other persons called as witnesses whose testimony would be relevant.</P>
            <P>(vi) The rules of a swap execution facility may provide that a sanction may be summarily imposed upon any person within its jurisdiction whose actions impede the progress of a hearing.</P>
            <P>(11) <E T="03">Right to appeal.</E> The rules of a swap execution facility may permit the parties to a proceeding to appeal promptly an adverse decision of a disciplinary panel in all or in certain classes of cases. Such rules may require a party's notice of appeal to be in writing and to specify the findings, conclusions, or sanctions to which objection are taken. If the rules of a swap execution facility permit appeals, then both the respondent and the enforcement staff should have the opportunity to appeal and the swap execution facility should provide for the following:</P>
            <P>(i) The swap execution facility should establish an appellate panel that should be authorized to hear appeals of respondents. In addition, the rules of a swap execution facility may provide that the appellate panel may, on its own initiative, order review of a decision by a disciplinary panel within a reasonable period of time after the decision has been rendered.</P>
            <P>(ii) The composition of the appellate panel should be consistent with part 40 of this chapter, and should not include any members of the swap execution facility's compliance staff or any person involved in adjudicating any other stage of the same proceeding. The rules of a swap execution facility should provide for the appeal proceeding to be conducted before all of the members of the appellate panel or a panel thereof.</P>
            <P>(iii) Except for good cause shown, the appeal or review should be conducted solely on the record before the disciplinary panel, the written exceptions filed by the parties, and the oral or written arguments of the parties.</P>

            <P>(iv) Promptly following the appeal or review proceeding, the appellate panel should <PRTPAGE P="740"/>issue a written decision and should provide a copy to the respondent. The decision issued by the appellate panel should adhere to all the requirements of § 37.206(d) to the extent that a different conclusion is reached from that issued by the disciplinary panel.</P>
            <P>(12) <E T="03">Final decisions.</E> Each swap execution facility should establish rules setting forth when a decision rendered pursuant to its rules will become the final decision of such swap execution facility.</P>
            <P>(13) <E T="03">Summary fines for violations of rules regarding timely submission of records.</E> A swap execution facility may adopt a summary fine schedule for violations of rules relating to the failure to timely submit accurate records required for clearing or verifying each day's transactions. A swap execution facility may permit its compliance staff, or a designated panel of swap execution facility officials, to summarily impose minor sanctions against persons within the swap execution facility's jurisdiction for violating such rules. A swap execution facility's summary fine schedule may allow for warning letters to be issued for first-time violations or violators. If adopted, a summary fine schedule should provide for progressively larger fines for recurring violations.</P>
            <P>(14) <E T="03">Emergency disciplinary actions.</E> (i) A swap execution facility may impose a sanction, including suspension, or take other summary action against a person or entity subject to its jurisdiction upon a reasonable belief that such immediate action is necessary to protect the best interest of the marketplace.</P>
            <P>(ii) Any emergency disciplinary action should be taken in accordance with a swap execution facility's procedures that provide for the following:</P>
            <P>(A) If practicable, a respondent should be served with a notice before the action is taken, or otherwise at the earliest possible opportunity. The notice should state the action, briefly state the reasons for the action, and state the effective time and date, and the duration of the action.</P>
            <P>(B) The respondent should have the right to be represented by legal counsel or any other representative of its choosing in all proceedings subsequent to the emergency action taken. The respondent should be given the opportunity for a hearing as soon as reasonably practicable and the hearing should be conducted before the disciplinary panel pursuant to the rules of the swap execution facility.</P>
            <P>(C) Promptly following the hearing provided for in paragraph (14)(ii)(B) of this guidance, the swap execution facility should render a written decision based upon the weight of the evidence contained in the record of the proceeding and should provide a copy to the respondent. The decision should include a description of the summary action taken; the reasons for the summary action; a summary of the evidence produced at the hearing; a statement of findings and conclusions; a determination that the summary action should be affirmed, modified, or reversed; and a declaration of any action to be taken pursuant to the determination, and the effective date and duration of such action.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Core Principle 3 of Section 5h of the Act—Swaps Not Readily Susceptible to Manipulation</HD>
            <P>The swap execution facility shall permit trading only in swaps that are not readily susceptible to manipulation.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Guidance.</E> (1) In general, a swap contract is an agreement to exchange a series of cash flows over a period of time based on some reference price, which could be a single price, such as an absolute level or a differential, or a price index calculated based on multiple observations. Moreover, such a reference price may be reported by the swap execution facility itself or by an independent third party. When listing a swap for trading, a swap execution facility shall ensure a swap's compliance with Core Principle 3, paying special attention to the reference price used to determine the cash flow exchanges. Specifically, Core Principle 3 requires that the reference price used by a swap not be readily susceptible to manipulation. As a result, when identifying a reference price, a swap execution facility should either: Calculate its own reference price using suitable and well-established acceptable methods or carefully select a reliable third-party index.</P>
            <P>(2) The importance of the reference price's suitability for a given swap is similar to that of the final settlement price for a cash-settled futures contract. If the final settlement price is manipulated, then the futures contract does not serve its intended price discovery and risk management functions. Similarly, inappropriate reference prices cause the cash flows between the buyer and seller to differ from the proper amounts, thus benefitting one party and disadvantaging the other. Thus, careful consideration should be given to the potential for manipulation or distortion of the reference price.</P>
            <P>(3) For swaps that are settled by physical delivery or by cash settlement refer to the guidance in appendix C to part 38 of this chapter—Demonstration of Compliance That a Contract is not Readily Susceptible to Manipulation, section b(2) and section c(4), respectively.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Core Principle 4 of Section 5h of the Act—Monitoring of Trading and Trade Processing</HD>
            <P>The swap execution facility shall:</P>
            <P>(A) Establish and enforce rules or terms and conditions defining, or specifications detailing:</P>
            <P>(1) Trading procedures to be used in entering and executing orders traded on or through the facilities of the swap execution facility; and</P>
            <P>(2) Procedures for trade processing of swaps on or through the facilities of the swap execution facility; and</P>
            <P>(B) Monitor trading in swaps to prevent manipulation, price distortion, and disruptions of the delivery or cash settlement process through surveillance, compliance, and disciplinary practices and procedures, including methods for conducting real-time monitoring of trading and comprehensive and accurate trade reconstructions.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Guidance.</E> The monitoring of trading activity in listed swaps should be designed to prevent manipulation, price distortion, and disruptions of the physical-delivery and cash settlement processes. The swap execution facility should have rules in place that allow it to intervene to prevent or reduce such market disruptions. Once a threatened or actual disruption is detected, the swap execution facility should take steps to prevent the market disruption or reduce its severity.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> Real-time monitoring for market anomalies is the most effective, but the swap execution facility may also demonstrate that it has an acceptable program if some of the monitoring is accomplished on a T+1 basis. The monitoring of trading should use automated alerts to detect abnormal price movements and unusual trading volumes in real-time and instances or threats of manipulation, price distortion, and disruptions on at least a T+1 basis. The T+1 detection and analysis should incorporate any additional data that becomes available on a T+1 basis, including the trade reconstruction data. In some cases, a swap execution facility may demonstrate that its manual processes are effective. The swap execution facility should continually monitor the appropriateness of its swaps' terms and conditions, including the physical-delivery requirements or reference prices used to determine cash flows or settlement. The swap execution facility should act promptly to address the conditions that are causing price distortions or market disruptions, including, when appropriate, changes to contract terms. The swap execution facility should be mindful that changes to contract terms may affect whether a product is subject to the trade execution and clearing requirements of the Act.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Physical-delivery swaps.</E> For physical-delivery swaps, the swap execution facility should monitor for conditions that may cause the swap to become susceptible to price manipulation or distortion, including: The general availability of the commodity specified by the swap, the commodity's characteristics, and the delivery locations; and if available, information related to the size and ownership of deliverable supplies.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Cash-settled swaps.</E> For cash-settled swaps, the swap execution facility should monitor for pricing abnormalities in the index or instrument used to calculate the reference price. If the swap execution facility computes its own reference price used for cash flows or settlement, it should promptly amend any methodologies that result, or are likely to result, in manipulation, price distortions, or market disruptions, or impose new methodologies to resolve the threat of disruptions or distortions. If the swap execution facility relies upon a third-party index or instrument, including an index or instrument traded on another venue for the swap reference price, it should conduct due diligence to ensure that the reference price is not susceptible to manipulation and that the terms and conditions of the swap continue to comply with § 37.300.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Ability to obtain information.</E> The swap execution facility shall demonstrate that it has access to sufficient information to assess whether trading in swaps listed on its market, in the index or instrument used as a reference price, or the underlying commodity for its listed swaps is being used to affect prices on its market. The swap execution facility should demonstrate that it can obtain position and trading information directly from the market participants that conduct substantial trading on its facility or through an information sharing agreement with other venues or a third-party regulatory service provider. If the position and trading information is not available directly from the market participants in its markets, but is available through information sharing agreements with other trading venues or a third-party regulatory service provider, the swap execution facility should cooperate in such information sharing agreements. The swap execution facility may limit the application of the requirement for market participants to keep and provide records of their activity in the index or instrument used as a reference price, the underlying commodity, and related derivatives markets, to only those market participants that conduct substantial trading on its facility.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Risk controls for trading.</E> An acceptable program for preventing market disruptions shall demonstrate appropriate trading risk controls, in addition to pauses and halts. Risk controls should be adapted to the unique characteristics of the trading platform and of the markets to which they apply and should be designed to avoid market disruptions without unduly interfering with <PRTPAGE P="742"/>that market's price discovery function. The swap execution facility may choose from among controls that include: pre-trade limits on order size, price collars or bands around the current price, message throttles, daily price limits, and intraday position limits related to financial risk to the clearing member, or design other types of controls, as well as clear error-trade and order-cancellation policies. Within the specific array of controls that are selected, the swap execution facility should set the parameters for those controls, so that the specific parameters are reasonably likely to serve the purpose of preventing market disruptions and price distortions. If a swap is fungible with, linked to, or a substitute for other swaps on the swap execution facility or on other trading venues, such risk controls should, to the extent practicable, be coordinated with any similar controls placed on those other swaps. If a swap is based on the level of an equity index, such risk controls should, to the extent practicable, be coordinated with any similar controls placed on national security exchanges.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Core Principle 8 of Section 5h of the Act—Emergency Authority</HD>
            <P>The swap execution facility shall adopt rules to provide for the exercise of emergency authority, in consultation or cooperation with the Commission, as is necessary and appropriate, including the authority to liquidate or transfer open positions in any swap or to suspend or curtail trading in a swap.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Guidance.</E> (1) A swap execution facility should have rules that authorize it to take certain actions in the event of an emergency, as defined in § 40.1(h) of this chapter. A swap execution facility should have the authority to intervene as necessary to maintain markets with fair and orderly trading and to prevent or address manipulation or disruptive trading practices, whether the need for intervention arises exclusively from the swap execution facility's market or as part of a coordinated, cross-market intervention. A swap execution facility should have the flexibility and independence to address market emergencies in an effective and timely manner consistent with the nature of the emergency, as long as all such actions taken by the swap execution facility are made in good faith to protect the integrity of the markets. However, the swap execution facility should also have rules that allow it to take market actions as may be directed by the Commission. Additionally, in situations where a swap is traded on more than one platform, emergency action to liquidate or transfer open interest shall be as directed, or <PRTPAGE P="743"/>agreed to, by the Commission or the Commission's staff. Swap execution facility rules should include procedures and guidelines for decision-making and implementation of emergency intervention that avoid conflicts of interest in accordance with the provisions of section 40.9 of this chapter, and include alternate lines of communication and approval procedures to address emergencies associated with real time events. To address perceived market threats, the swap execution facility should have rules that allow it to take emergency actions, including imposing or modifying position limits, imposing or modifying price limits, imposing or modifying intraday market restrictions, imposing special margin requirements, ordering the liquidation or transfer of open positions in any contract, ordering the fixing of a settlement price, extending or shortening the expiration date or the trading hours, suspending or curtailing trading in any contract, transferring customer contracts and the margin, or altering any contract's settlement terms or conditions, or, if applicable, providing for the carrying out of such actions through its agreements with its third-party provider of clearing or regulatory services.</P>
            <P>(2) A swap execution facility should promptly notify the Commission of its exercise of emergency action, explaining its decision-making process, the reasons for using its emergency authority, and how conflicts of interest were minimized, including the extent to which the swap execution facility considered the effect of its emergency action on the underlying markets and on markets that are linked or referenced to the contracts traded on its facility, including similar markets on other trading venues. Information on all regulatory actions carried out pursuant to a swap execution facility's emergency authority should be included in a timely submission of a certified rule pursuant to part 40 of this chapter.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedures for designation.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Application procedures.</E> (1) A board of trade seeking designation as a contract market must file electronically, in a format and manner specified by the Secretary of the Commission, the Form DCM provided in appendix A of this part, with the Secretary of the Commission at its Washington, DC headquarters at <E T="03">submissions@cftc.gov</E> and the Division of Market Oversight at <E T="03">DMOSubmissions@cftc.gov.</E> The Commission will review the application for designation as a contract market pursuant to the 180-day timeframe and procedures specified in section 6(a) of the Act. The Commission shall approve or deny the application or, if deemed appropriate, designate the applicant as a contract market subject to conditions.</P>
            <P>(2) The application must include information sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the core principles specified in section 5(d) of the Act. Form DCM consists of instructions, general questions and a list of exhibits (documents, information and evidence) required by the Commission in order to determine whether an applicant is able to comply with the core principles. An application will not be considered to be materially complete unless the applicant has submitted, at a minimum, the exhibits required in Form DCM. If the application is not materially complete, the Commission shall notify the applicant that the application will not be deemed to have been submitted for purposes of starting the 180-day review period set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) The applicant must identify with particularity any information in the application that will be subject to a request for confidential treatment pursuant to § 145.9 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(4) Section 40.8 of this chapter sets forth those sections of the application that will be made publicly available, notwithstanding a request for confidential treatment pursuant to § 145.9 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(5) If any information contained in the application or in any exhibit is or becomes inaccurate for any reason, an amendment to the application or a submission filed under part 40 of this chapter must be filed promptly correcting such information.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Reinstatement of dormant designation.</E> Before listing or relisting products for trading, a dormant designated <PRTPAGE P="747"/>contract market as defined in § 40.1 of this chapter must reinstate its designation under the procedures of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section; provided, however, that an application for reinstatement may rely upon previously submitted materials that still pertain to, and accurately describe, current conditions.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Delegation of authority.</E> (1) The Commission hereby delegates, until it orders otherwise, to the Director of the Division of Market Oversight or such other employee or employees as the Director may designate from time to time, upon consultation with the General Counsel or the General Counsel's designee, authority to notify the applicant seeking designation under section 6(a) of the Act that the application is materially incomplete and the running of the 180-day period is stayed.</P>
            <P>(2) The Director may submit to the Commission for its consideration any matter that has been delegated in this paragraph.</P>
            <P>(3) Nothing in this paragraph prohibits the Commission, at its election, from exercising the authority delegated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Request for transfer of designation</E>—(1) <E T="03">Request for transfer of designation, listed contracts and open interest.</E> A designated contract market that wants to request the transfer of its designation from its current legal entity to a new legal entity, as a result of a corporate reorganization or otherwise, must file a request with the Commission for approval to transfer the designation, listed contracts and positions comprising all associated open interest. Such request must be filed electronically, in a format and manner specified by the Secretary of the Commission, with the Secretary of the Commission at its Washington, DC headquarters at <E T="03">submissions@cftc.gov</E> and the Division of Market Oversight at <E T="03">DMOSubmissions@cftc.gov.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Timing of submission.</E> The request must be filed no later than three months prior to the anticipated corporate change; provided that the designated contract market may file a request with the Commission later than three months prior to the anticipated corporate change if the designated contract market does not know and reasonably could not have known of the anticipated change three months prior to the anticipated corporate change. In such event, the designated contract market shall be required to immediately file the request with the Commission as soon as it knows of such change, with an explanation as to the timing of the request.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Required information.</E> The request shall include the following:</P>
            <P>(i) The underlying agreement that governs the corporate change;</P>
            <P>(ii) A narrative description of the corporate change, including the reason for the change and its impact on the designated contract market, including its governance and operations, and its impact on the rights and obligations of market participants holding the open interest positions;</P>
            <P>(iii) A discussion of the transferee's ability to comply with the Act, including the core principles applicable to designated contract markets, and the Commission's regulations thereunder;</P>
            <P>(iv) The governing documents of the transferee including, but not limited to, articles of incorporation and bylaws;</P>
            <P>(v) The transferee's rules marked to show changes from the current rules of the designated contract market;</P>
            <P>(vi) A list of contracts, agreements, transactions or swaps for which the designated contract market requests transfer of open interest;</P>
            <P>(vii) A representation by the transferee that it:</P>
            <P>(A) Will be the surviving legal entity and successor-in-interest to the transferor designated contract market and will retain and assume, without limitation, all the assets and liabilities of the transferor;</P>
            <P>(B) Will assume responsibility for complying with all applicable provisions of the Act and the Commission's regulations thereunder, including part 38 and Appendices thereto;</P>

            <P>(C) Will assume, maintain and enforce all rules implementing and complying with these core principles, including the adoption of the transferor's rulebook, as amended in the request, and that any such amendments will be submitted to the Commission pursuant <PRTPAGE P="748"/>to section 5c(c) of the Act and part 40 of the Commission's regulations; and</P>
            <P>(D) Will comply with all self-regulatory responsibilities except if otherwise indicated in the request, and will maintain and enforce all self-regulatory programs.</P>
            <P>(viii) A representation by the transferee that upon the transfer:</P>
            <P>(A) All open interest in all contracts listed on the transferor will be transferred to and represent equivalent open interest in all such contracts listed on the transferee;</P>
            <P>(B) It will assume responsibility for and maintain compliance with the core principles for all contracts previously listed for trading through the transferor, whether by certification or approval; and</P>
            <P>(C) That none of the proposed rule changes will affect the rights and obligations of any market participant with open positions transferred to it and that the proposed rule changes do not modify the manner in which such contracts are settled or cleared.</P>
            <P>(ix) A representation by the transferee that market participants will be notified of all changes to the transferor's rulebook prior to the transfer and will be further notified of the concurrent transfer of the contract market designation, and the related transfer of all listed contracts and all associated open interest, to the transferee upon Commission approval and issuance of an order permitting this transfer.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Commission determination.</E> The Commission will review a request as soon as practicable and such request will be approved or denied pursuant to a Commission order and based on the Commission's determination as to the transferee's ability to continue to operate the designated contract market in compliance with the Act and the Commission's regulations thereunder.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Request for withdrawal of application for designation.</E> An applicant for designation may withdraw its application submitted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section by filing such a request with the Commission. Such request must be filed electronically, in a format and manner specified by the Secretary of the Commission, with the Secretary of the Commission at its Washington, DC headquarters, at <E T="03">submissions@cftc.gov,</E> and the Division of Market Oversight, at <E T="03">DMOSubmissions@cftc.gov.</E> Withdrawal of an application for designation shall not affect any action taken or to be taken by the Commission based upon actions, activities or events occurring during the time that the application for designation was pending with the Commission.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Request for vacation of designation.</E> A designated contract market may vacate its designation under section 7 of the Act by filing a request electronically, in a format and manner specified by the Secretary of the Commission, with the Secretary of the Commission at its Washington, DC headquarters at <E T="03">submissions@cftc.gov</E> and the Division of Market Oversight at <E T="03">DMOSubmissions@cftc.gov.</E> Vacation of designation shall not affect any action taken or to be taken by the Commission based upon actions, activities or events occurring during the time that the facility was designated by the Commission.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Request for Commission approval of rules and products.</E> (1) An applicant for designation, or a designated contract market, may request that the Commission approve under section 5c(c) of the Act, any or all of its rules and contract terms and conditions, and subsequent amendments thereto, prior to their implementation or, notwithstanding the provisions of section 5c(c)(4) of the Act, at any time thereafter, under the procedures of § 40.3 or § 40.5 of this chapter, as applicable. A designated contract market may label a future, swap or options product in its rules as “Listed for trading pursuant to Commission approval,” if the future, swap or options product and its terms or conditions have been approved by the Commission, and it may label as “Approved by the Commission” only those rules that have been so approved.</P>

            <P>(2) Notwithstanding the timeline under §§ 40.3(c) and 40.5(c) of this chapter, the operating rules, and terms and conditions of futures, swaps and option <PRTPAGE P="749"/>products that have been submitted for Commission approval at the same time as an application for contract market designation or an application under § 38.3(b) of this part to reinstate the designation of a dormant designated contract market, as defined in § 40.1 of this chapter, or while one of the foregoing is pending, will be deemed approved by the Commission no earlier than when the facility is deemed to be designated or reinstated.</P>

Provided, however, any rule or rule amendment that would, for a delivery month having open interest, materially change a term or condition of a swap or a contract for future delivery in an agricultural commodity enumerated in section 1a(9) of the Act, or of an option on such contract or commodity, must be submitted to the Commission prior to its implementation for review and approval under § 40.4 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(c) An applicant for designation, or a designated contract market, may request that the Commission consider under the provisions of section 15(b) of the Act any of the contract market's rules or policies, including both operational rules and the terms or conditions of products listed for trading.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Use of third-party provider permitted.</E> A designated contract market may choose to utilize a registered futures association or another registered entity, as such terms are defined under the Act, (collectively, “regulatory service provider”), for the provision of services to assist in complying with the core principles, as approved by the Commission. Any designated contract market that chooses to utilize a regulatory service provider must ensure that its regulatory service provider has the capacity and resources necessary to provide timely and effective regulatory services, including adequate staff and automated surveillance systems. A designated contract market will at all times remain responsible for the performance of any regulatory services received, for compliance with the designated contract market's obligations under the Act and Commission regulations, and for the regulatory service provider's performance on its behalf.</P>

The automated system must load and process daily orders and trades no later than 24 hours after the completion of the trading day. In addition, the automated trade surveillance system must have the capability to detect and flag specific trade execution patterns and trade anomalies; compute, retain, and compare trading statistics; compute trade gains, losses, and futures-equivalent positions; reconstruct the sequence of market activity; perform market analyses; and support system users to perform in-depth analyses and ad hoc queries of trade-related data.</P>

Absent mitigating factors, a timely manner is no later than 12 months after the date that an investigation is opened. Mitigating factors that may reasonably justify an investigation taking longer than 12 months to complete include the complexity of the investigation, the number of firms or individuals involved as potential wrongdoers, the number of potential violations to be investigated, and the volume of documents and data to be examined and analyzed by compliance staff.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Investigation reports when a reasonable basis exists for finding a violation.</E> Compliance staff must submit a written investigation report for disciplinary action in every instance in which compliance staff determines from surveillance or from an investigation that a reasonable basis exists for finding a rule violation.

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Investigation reports when no reasonable basis exists for finding a violation.</E> If after conducting an investigation, compliance staff determines that no reasonable basis exists for finding a violation, it must prepare a written report including the reason(s) the investigation was initiated; a summary of the complaint, if any; the relevant facts; and compliance staff's analysis and conclusions.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Warning letters.</E> No more than one warning letter may be issued to the same person or entity found to have committed the same rule violation within a rolling twelve month period.</P>

Such data must be sufficient to reconstruct all transactions within a reasonable period of time and to provide evidence of any violations of the rules of the designated contract market.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Original source documents.</E> A designated contract market's audit trail must include original source documents. Original source documents include unalterable, sequentially identified records on which trade execution information is originally recorded, whether recorded manually or electronically. Records for customer orders (whether filled, unfilled, or cancelled, each of which shall be retained or electronically captured) must reflect the terms of the order, an account identifier that relates back to the account(s) owner(s), and the time of order entry. For open-outcry trades, the time of report of execution of the order shall also be captured.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Transaction history database.</E> A designated contract market's audit trail program must include an electronic transaction history database. <PRTPAGE P="759"/>An adequate transaction history database includes a history of all trades executed via open outcry or via entry into an electronic trading system, and all orders entered into an electronic trading system, including all order modifications and cancellations. An adequate transaction history database also includes:</P>
            <P>(1) All data that are input into the trade entry or matching system for the transaction to match and clear;</P>
            <P>(2) The customer type indicator code;</P>
            <P>(3) Timing and sequencing data adequate to reconstruct trading; and</P>
            <P>(4) Identification of each account to which fills are allocated.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Electronic analysis capability.</E> A designated contract market's audit trail program must include electronic analysis capability with respect to all audit trail data in the transaction history database. Such electronic analysis capability must ensure that the designated contract market has the ability to reconstruct trading and identify possible trading violations with respect to both customer and market abuse.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Safe storage capability.</E> A designated contract market's audit trail program must include the capability to safely store all audit trail data retained in its transaction history database. Such safe storage capability must include the capability to store all data in the database in a manner that protects it from unauthorized alteration, as well as from accidental erasure or other loss. Data must be retained in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements of Core Principle 18 and the associated regulations in subpart S of this part.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Annual audit trail and recordkeeping reviews.</E> A designated contract market must enforce its audit trail and recordkeeping requirements through at least annual reviews of all members and persons and firms subject to designated contract market recordkeeping rules to verify their compliance with the contract market's audit trail and recordkeeping requirements. Such reviews must include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(1) For electronic trading, audit trail and recordkeeping reviews must include reviews of randomly selected samples of front-end audit trail data for order routing systems; a review of the process by which user identifications are assigned and user identification records are maintained; a review of usage patterns associated with user identifications to monitor for violations of user identification rules; and reviews of account numbers and customer type indicator codes in trade records to test for accuracy and improper use.</P>
            <P>(2) For open outcry trading, audit trail and recordkeeping reviews must include reviews of members' and market participants' compliance with the designated contract market's trade timing, order ticket, and trading card requirements.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Enforcement program required.</E> A designated contract market must establish a program for effective enforcement of its audit trail and recordkeeping requirements for both electronic and open-outcry trading, as applicable. An effective program must identify members and persons and firms subject to designated contract market recordkeeping rules that have failed to maintain high levels of compliance with such requirements, and levy meaningful sanctions when deficiencies are found. Sanctions must be sufficient to deter recidivist behavior. No more than one warning letter may be issued to the same person or entity found to have committed the same rule violation within a rolling twelve month period.</P>

            <P>(a) A designated contract market must adopt rules that provide for the following minimum requirements for any hearing conducted pursuant to a notice of charges:</P>
            <P>(1) The hearing must be fair, must be conducted before members of the disciplinary panel, and must be promptly convened after reasonable notice to the respondent. The formal rules of evidence need not apply; nevertheless, the procedures for the hearing may not be so informal as to deny a fair hearing. No member of the disciplinary panel for the matter may have a financial, personal, or other direct interest in the matter under consideration.</P>
            <P>(2) In advance of the hearing, the respondent must be entitled to examine all books, documents, or other evidence in the possession or under the control of the designated contract market. The designated contract market may withhold documents that are privileged or constitute attorney work product, documents that were prepared by an employee of the designated contract market but will not be offered in evidence in the disciplinary proceedings, documents that may disclose a technique or guideline used in examinations, investigations, or enforcements proceedings, and documents that disclose the identity of a confidential source.</P>

            <P>(3) The designated contract market's enforcement and compliance staffs must be parties to the hearing, and the enforcement staff must present their <PRTPAGE P="763"/>case on those charges and sanctions that are the subject of the hearing.</P>
            <P>(4) The respondent must be entitled to appear personally at the hearing, must be entitled to cross-examine any persons appearing as witnesses at the hearing, and must be entitled to call witnesses and to present such evidence as may be relevant to the charges.</P>
            <P>(5) The designated contract market must require persons within its jurisdiction who are called as witnesses to participate in the hearing and to produce evidence. It must make reasonable efforts to secure the presence of all other persons called as witnesses whose testimony would be relevant.</P>
            <P>(6) If the respondent has requested a hearing, a copy of the hearing must be made and must become a part of the record of the proceeding. The record must be one that is capable of being accurately transcribed; however, it need not be transcribed unless the transcript is requested by Commission staff or the respondent, the decision is appealed pursuant to the rules of the designated contract market, or is reviewed by the Commission pursuant to section 8c of the Act or part 9 of this chapter. In all other instances a summary record of a hearing is permitted.</P>

            <P>(b) The answer, if any, or a summary of the answer;</P>
            <P>(c) A summary of the evidence produced at the hearing or, where appropriate, incorporation by reference of the investigation report;</P>
            <P>(d) A statement of findings and conclusions with respect to each charge, and a complete explanation of the evidentiary and other basis for such findings and conclusions with respect to each charge;</P>
            <P>(e) An indication of each specific rule that the respondent was found to have violated; and</P>

            <P>(a) A designated contract market's program of risk analysis and oversight with respect to its operations and automated systems shall address each of the following categories of risk analysis and oversight:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Enterprise risk management and governance.</E> This category includes, but is not limited to: Assessment, mitigation, and monitoring of security and technology risk; security and technology capital planning and investment; board of directors and management oversight of technology and security; information technology audit and controls assessments; remediation of deficiencies; and any other elements of enterprise risk management and governance included in generally accepted best practices.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Information security.</E> This category includes, but is not limited to, controls relating to: Access to systems and data (including least privilege, separation of duties, account monitoring and control); user and device identification and authentication; security awareness training; audit log maintenance, monitoring, and analysis; media protection; personnel security and screening; automated system and communications protection (including network port control, boundary defenses, encryption); system and information integrity (including malware defenses, software integrity monitoring); vulnerability management; penetration testing; security incident response and management; and any other elements of information security included in generally accepted best practices.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Business continuity-disaster recovery planning and resources.</E> This category includes, but is not limited to: Regular, periodic testing and review of business continuity-disaster recovery capabilities, the controls and capabilities described in paragraphs (c), (d), (j), and (k) of this section; and any other elements of business continuity-disaster recovery planning and resources included in generally accepted best practices.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Capacity and performance planning.</E> This category includes, but is not limited to: Controls for monitoring the designated contract market's systems to ensure adequate scalable capacity (including testing, monitoring, and analysis of current and projected future capacity and performance, and of possible capacity degradation due to planned automated system changes); and any other elements of capacity and performance planning included in generally accepted best practices.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Systems operations.</E> This category includes, but is not limited to: System <PRTPAGE P="766"/>maintenance; configuration management (including baseline configuration, configuration change and patch management, least functionality, inventory of authorized and unauthorized devices and software); event and problem response and management; and any other elements of system operations included in generally accepted best practices.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Systems development and quality assurance.</E> This category includes, but is not limited to: Requirements development; pre-production and regression testing; change management procedures and approvals; outsourcing and vendor management; training in secure coding practices; and any other elements of systems development and quality assurance included in generally accepted best practices.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Physical security and environmental controls.</E> This category includes, but is not limited to: Physical access and monitoring; power, telecommunication, and environmental controls; fire protection; and any other elements of physical security and environmental controls included in generally accepted best practices.</P>
            <P>(b) In addressing the categories of risk analysis and oversight required under paragraph (a) of this section, a designated contract market shall follow generally accepted standards and best practices with respect to the development, operation, reliability, security, and capacity of automated systems.</P>
            <P>(c) A designated contract market shall maintain a business continuity-disaster recovery plan and business continuity-disaster recovery resources, emergency procedures, and backup facilities sufficient to enable timely recovery and resumption of its operations and resumption of its ongoing fulfillment of its responsibilities and obligations as a designated contract market following any disruption of its operations. Such responsibilities and obligations include, without limitation: Order processing and trade matching; transmission of matched orders to a designated clearing organization for clearing; price reporting; market surveillance; and maintenance of a comprehensive audit trail. The designated contract market's business continuity-disaster recovery plan and resources generally should enable resumption of trading and clearing of the designated contract market's products during the next business day following the disruption. Designated contract markets determined by the Commission to be critical financial markets are subject to more stringent requirements in this regard, set forth in § 40.9 of this chapter. Electronic trading is an acceptable backup for open outcry trading in the event of a disruption. A designated contract market shall update its business continuity-disaster recovery plan and emergency procedures at a frequency determined by an appropriate risk analysis, but at a minimum no less frequently than annually.</P>
            <P>(d) A designated contract market that is not determined by the Commission to be a critical financial market satisfies the requirement to be able to resume trading and clearing during the next business day following a disruption by maintaining either:</P>
            <P>(1) Infrastructure and personnel resources of its own that are sufficient to ensure timely recovery and resumption of its operations and resumption of its ongoing fulfillment of its responsibilities and obligations as a designated contract market following any disruption of its operations; or</P>
            <P>(2) Contractual arrangements with other designated contract markets or disaster recovery service providers, as appropriate, that are sufficient to ensure continued trading and clearing of the designated contract market's products, and ongoing fulfillment of all of the designated contract market's responsibilities and obligations with respect to those products, in the event that a disruption renders the designated contract market temporarily or permanently unable to satisfy this requirement on its own behalf.</P>
            <P>(e) A designated contract market must notify Commission staff promptly of all:</P>
            <P>(1) Electronic trading halts and significant systems malfunctions;</P>

            <P>(2) Cyber security incidents or targeted threats that actually or potentially jeopardize automated system operation, reliability, security, or capacity; and<PRTPAGE P="767"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) Activation of the designated contract market's business continuity-disaster recovery plan.</P>
            <P>(f) A designated contract market must give Commission staff timely advance notice of all material:</P>
            <P>(1) Planned changes to automated systems that may impact the reliability, security, or adequate scalable capacity of such systems; and</P>
            <P>(2) Planned changes to the designated contract market's program of risk analysis and oversight.</P>
            <P>(g) As part of a designated contract market's obligation to produce books and records in accordance with § 1.31 of this chapter, Core Principle 18 (Recordkeeping), and §§ 38.950 and 38.951, a designated contract market shall provide to the Commission the following system safeguards-related books and records, promptly upon the request of any Commission representative:</P>
            <P>(1) Current copies of its business continuity-disaster recovery plans and other emergency procedures;</P>
            <P>(2) All assessments of its operational risks or system safeguards-related controls;</P>
            <P>(3) All reports concerning system safeguards testing and assessment required by this chapter, whether performed by independent contractors or by employees of the designated contract market; and</P>
            <P>(4) All other books and records requested by Commission staff in connection with Commission oversight of system safeguards pursuant to the Act or Commission regulations, or in connection with Commission maintenance of a current profile of the designated contract market's automated systems.</P>
            <P>(5) Nothing in this paragraph (g) shall be interpreted as reducing or limiting in any way a designated contract market's obligation to comply with Core Principle 18 (Recordkeeping) or with § 1.31 of this chapter, or with § 38.950 or § 38.951.</P>
            <P>(h) A designated contract market shall conduct regular, periodic, objective testing and review of its automated systems to ensure that they are reliable, secure, and have adequate scalable capacity. It shall also conduct regular, periodic testing and review of its business continuity-disaster recovery capabilities. Such testing and review shall include, without limitation, all of the types of testing set forth in this paragraph (h). A covered designated contract market, as defined in this section, shall be subject to the additional requirements regarding minimum testing frequency and independent contractor testing set forth in this paragraph (h).</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in paragraph (h) of this section:</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Controls</E> means the safeguards or countermeasures employed by the designated contract market in order to protect the reliability, security, or capacity of its automated systems or the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its data and information, and in order to enable the designated contract market to fulfill its statutory and regulatory responsibilities.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Controls testing</E> means assessment of the designated contract market's controls to determine whether such controls are implemented correctly, are operating as intended, and are enabling the designated contract market to meet the requirements established by this section.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Covered designated contract market</E> means a designated contract market whose annual total trading volume in calendar year 2015, or in any subsequent calendar year, is five percent (5%) or more of the combined annual total trading volume of all designated contract markets regulated by the Commission for the year in question, based on annual total trading volume information provided to the Commission by each designated contract market pursuant to the procedure set forth in this chapter. A covered designated contract market that has annual total trading volume of less than five percent (5%) of the combined annual total trading volume of all designated contract markets regulated by the Commission for three consecutive calendar years ceases to be a covered designated contract market as of March 1 of the calendar year following such three consecutive calendar years.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Enterprise technology risk assessment</E> means a written assessment that includes, but is not limited to, an analysis of threats and vulnerabilities in the context of mitigating controls. An enterprise technology risk assessment <PRTPAGE P="768"/>identifies, estimates, and prioritizes risks to designated contract market operations or assets, or to market participants, individuals, or other entities, resulting from impairment of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and information or the reliability, security, or capacity of automated systems.</P>

            <P>1. This appendix provides guidance on complying with core principles, both initially and on an ongoing basis, to obtain and maintain designation under section 5(d) of the Act and this part 38. Where provided, guidance is set forth in paragraph (a) following the relevant heading and can be used to demonstrate to the Commission compliance with the selected requirements of a core principle, under §§ 38.3 and 38.5 of this part. The guidance for the core principle is illustrative only of the types of matters a designated contract market may address, as applicable, and is not intended to be used as a mandatory checklist. Addressing the issues set forth in this appendix would help the Commission in its consideration of whether the designated contract market is in compliance with the selected requirements of a core principle; provided however, that the guidance is not intended to diminish or replace, in any event, the obligations and requirements of applicants and designated contract markets to comply with the regulations provided under this part.</P>
            <P>2. Where provided, acceptable practices meeting selected requirements of core principles are set forth in paragraph (b) following guidance. Designated contract markets that follow specific practices outlined in the acceptable practices for a core principle in this appendix will meet the selected requirements of the applicable core principle; provided however, that the acceptable practice is not intended to diminish or replace, in any event, the obligations and requirements of applicants and designated contract markets to comply with the regulations provided under this part 38. The acceptable practices are for illustrative purposes only and do not state the exclusive means for satisfying a core principle.</P>

              <E T="03">Core Principle 4 of section 5(d) of the Act:</E> PREVENTION OF MARKET DISRUPTION.—The board of trade shall have the capacity and responsibility to prevent manipulation, price distortion, and disruptions of the delivery or cash-settlement process through market surveillance, compliance, and enforcement practices and procedures, including—</P>
            <P>(A) Methods for conducting real-time monitoring of trading; and</P>
            <P>(B) Comprehensive and accurate trade reconstructions.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Guidance.</E> The detection and prevention of market manipulation, disruptions, and distortions should be incorporated into the design of programs for monitoring trading activity. Monitoring of intraday trading should include the capacity to detect developing market anomalies, including abnormal price movements and unusual trading volumes, and position-limit violations. The designated contract market should have rules in place that allow it broad powers to intervene to prevent or reduce market disruptions. Once a threatened or actual disruption is detected, the designated contract market should take steps to prevent the disruption or reduce its severity.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Additional rules required.</E> A designated contract market should adopt and enforce any additional rules that it believes are necessary to comply with the requirements of subpart E of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Acceptable Practices</E>—(1) <E T="03">General Requirements.</E> Real-time monitoring for market anomalies and position-limit violations are the most effective, but the designated contract market may also demonstrate that it has an acceptable program if some of the monitoring is accomplished on a T+1 basis. An acceptable program must include automated trading alerts to detect market anomalies and position-limit violations as they develop and before market disruptions occur or become more serious. In some cases, a designated contract market may demonstrate that its manual processes are effective.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Physical-delivery contracts.</E> For physical-delivery contracts, the designated contract market must demonstrate that it is monitoring the adequacy and availability of the deliverable supply, which, if such information is available, includes the size and ownership of those supplies and whether such supplies are likely to be available to short traders and saleable by long traders at the market value of those supplies under normal cash marketing conditions. Further, for physical-delivery contracts, the designated contract market must continually monitor the appropriateness of a contract's terms and conditions, including the delivery instrument, the delivery locations and location differentials, and the commodity characteristics and related differentials. The designated contract market must demonstrate that it is making a good-faith effort to resolve conditions that are interfering with convergence of its physical-delivery contract to the price of the underlying commodity or causing price distortions or market disruptions, including, when appropriate, changes to contract terms.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Cash-settled contracts.</E> At a minimum, an acceptable program for monitoring cash-settled contracts must include access, either directly or through an information-sharing agreement, to traders' positions and transactions in the reference market for traders of a significant size in the designated contract market near the settlement of the contract.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Ability to obtain information.</E> With respect to the designated contract market's ability to obtain information, a designated contract market may limit the application of the requirement to keep and provide such records only to those that are reportable under its large-trader reporting system or otherwise hold substantial positions.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Risk controls for trading.</E> An acceptable program for preventing market disruptions must demonstrate appropriate trade risk controls, in addition to pauses and halts. Such controls must be adapted to the unique characteristics of the markets to which they apply and must be designed to avoid market disruptions without unduly interfering with that market's price discovery function. The designated contract market may choose from among controls that include: pre-trade limits on order size, price collars or bands around the current price, message throttles, and daily price limits, or design other types <PRTPAGE P="783"/>of controls. Within the specific array of controls that are selected, the designated contract market also must set the parameters for those controls, so long as the types of controls and their specific parameters are reasonably likely to serve the purpose of preventing market disruptions and price distortions. If a contract is linked to, or is a substitute for, other contracts, either listed on its market or on other trading venues, the designated contract market must, to the extent practicable, coordinate its risk controls with any similar controls placed on those other contracts. If a contract is based on the price of an equity security or the level of an equity index, such risk controls must, to the extent practicable, be coordinated with any similar controls placed on national security exchanges.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Guidance.</E> In consultation and cooperation with the Commission, a designated contract market should have the authority to intervene as necessary to maintain markets with fair and orderly trading and to prevent or address manipulation or disruptive trading practices, whether the need for intervention arises exclusively from the DCM's market or as part of a coordinated, cross-market intervention. DCM rules should include procedures and guidelines to avoid conflicts of interest in accordance with the provisions of § 40.9 of this chapter, and include alternate lines of communication and approval procedures to address emergencies associated with real-time events. To address perceived market threats, the designated contract market should have rules that allow it to take certain actions in the event of an emergency, as defined in § 40.1(h) of this chapter, including: imposing or modifying position limits, price limits, and intraday market restrictions; imposing special margin requirements; ordering the liquidation or transfer of open positions in any contract; ordering the fixing of a settlement price; extending or shortening the expiration date or the trading hours; suspending or curtailing trading in any contract; transferring customer contracts and the margin or altering any contract's settlement terms or conditions; and, where applicable, providing for the carrying out of such actions through its agreements with its third-party provider of clearing or regulatory services. In situations where a contract is fungible with a contract on another platform, emergency action to liquidate or transfer open interest must be as directed, or agreed to, by the Commission or the Commission's staff. The DCM has the authority to independently respond to emergencies in an effective and timely manner consistent with the nature of the emergency, as long as all such actions taken by the DCM are made in good faith to protect the integrity of the markets. The Commission should be notified promptly of the DCM's exercise of emergency action, explaining how conflicts of interest were minimized, including the extent to which the DCM considered the effect of its emergency action on the underlying markets and on markets that are linked or referenced to the contract market and similar markets on other trading venues. Information on all regulatory actions carried out pursuant to a DCM's emergency authority should be included in a timely submission of a certified rule pursuant to part 40 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Acceptable Practices.</E> A designated contract market must have procedures and guidelines for decision-making and implementation of emergency intervention in the market. At a minimum, the DCM must have the authority to liquidate or transfer open positions in the market, suspend or curtail trading in any contract, and require market participants in any contract to meet special margin requirements. In situations where a contract is fungible with a contract on another platform, emergency action to liquidate or transfer open interest must be directed, or agreed to, by the Commission or the Commission's staff. The DCM must promptly notify the Commission of the exercise of its emergency authority, documenting its decision-making process, including how conflicts of interest were minimized, and the reasons for using its emergency authority. The DCM must also have rules that allow it to take such market actions as may be directed by the Commission.<PRTPAGE P="784"/>

Such rules may require a party's notice of appeal to be in writing and to specify the findings, conclusions, or sanctions to which objection are taken. If the rules of a designated contract market permit appeals, then both the respondent and the enforcement staff should have the opportunity to appeal and the designated contract market should provide for the following:</P>
            <P>(i) The designated contract market should establish an appellate panel that should be authorized to hear appeals of respondents. In addition, the rules of a designated contract market may provide that the appellate panel may, on its own initiative, order review of a decision by a disciplinary panel within a reasonable period of time after the decision has been rendered.</P>
            <P>(ii) The composition of the appellate panel should be consistent with the requirements set forth in part 40 of this chapter and paragraph (4) of the acceptable practices for Core Principle 16, and should not include any members of the designated contract market's compliance staff, or any person involved in adjudicating any other stage of the same proceeding. The rules of a designated contract market should provide for the appeal proceeding to be conducted before all of the members of the appellate panel or a panel thereof.</P>
            <P>(iii) Except for good cause shown, the appeal or review should be conducted solely on the record before the disciplinary panel, the written exceptions filed by the parties, and the oral or written arguments of the parties.</P>

A designated contract market may permit its compliance staff, or a designated panel of contract market officials, to summarily impose minor sanctions against persons within the designated contract market's jurisdiction for violating such rules. A designated contract market's summary fine schedule may allow for warning letters to be issued for first-time violations or violators.

            <P>(C) Promptly following the hearing provided for in this rule, the designated contract market should render a written decision based upon the weight of the evidence contained in the record of the proceeding and should provide a copy to the respondent. The decision should include a description of the summary action taken; the reasons for the summary action; a summary of the evidence produced at the hearing; a statement of findings and conclusions; a determination that the summary action should be affirmed, modified, or reversed; and a declaration of any action to be taken pursuant to the determination, and the effective date and duration of such action.</P>

              <E T="03">Core Principle 15 of section 5(d) of the Act:</E> GOVERNANCE FITNESS STANDARDS.—The board of trade shall establish and enforce appropriate fitness standards for directors, members of any disciplinary committee, members of the contract market, and any other person with direct access to the facility (including any party affiliated with any person described in this paragraph).</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Guidance.</E> (1) A designated contract market should have appropriate eligibility criteria for the categories of persons set forth in the Core Principle that should include standards for fitness and for the collection and verification of information supporting compliance with such standards. Minimum standards of fitness for persons who have member voting privileges, governing obligations or responsibilities, or who exercise disciplinary authority are those bases for refusal to register a person under section 8a(2) of the Act. In addition, persons who have governing obligations or responsibilities, or who exercise disciplinary authority, should not have a significant history of serious disciplinary offenses, such as those that would be disqualifying under § 1.63 of this chapter. Members with trading privileges but having no, or only nominal, equity, <PRTPAGE P="787"/>in the facility and non-member market participants who are not intermediated and do not have these privileges, obligations, responsibilities or disciplinary authority could satisfy minimum fitness standards by meeting the standards that they must meet to qualify as a “market participant.” Natural persons who directly or indirectly have greater than a ten percent ownership interest in a designated contract market should meet the fitness standards applicable to members with voting rights.</P>
            <P>(2) The Commission believes that such standards should include providing the Commission with fitness information for such persons, whether registration information, certification to the fitness of such persons, an affidavit of such persons' fitness by the contract market's counsel or other information substantiating the fitness of such persons. If a contract market provides certification of the fitness of such a person, the Commission believes that such certification should be based on verified information that the person is fit to be in his or her position.</P>

              <E T="03">Core Principle 16 of section 5(d) of the Act:</E> CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.—The board of trade shall establish and enforce rules—</P>
            <P>(A) to minimize conflicts of interest in the decisionmaking process of the contract market; and</P>
            <P>(B) to establish a process for resolving conflicts of interest described in subparagraph (A).</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Guidance.</E> The means to address conflicts of interest in decisionmaking of a contract market should include methods to ascertain the presence of conflicts of interest and to make decisions in the event of such a conflict. In addition, the Commission believes that the contract market should provide for appropriate limitations on the use or disclosure of material non-public information gained through the performance of official duties by board members, committee members and contract market employees or gained through an ownership interest in the contract market.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Acceptable Practices.</E> All designated contract markets (“DCMs” or “contract markets”) bear special responsibility to regulate effectively, impartially, and with due consideration of the public interest, as provided for in section 3 of the Act. Under Core Principle 15, they are also required to minimize conflicts of interest in their decisionmaking processes. To comply with this Core Principle, contract markets should be particularly vigilant for such conflicts between and among any of their self-regulatory responsibilities, their commercial interests, and the several interests of their management, members, owners, customers and market participants, other industry participants, and other constituencies. Acceptable practices for minimizing conflicts of interest shall include the following elements:</P>
            <P>(1) Board composition for contract markets</P>
            <P>(i) At least thirty-five percent of the directors on a contract market's board of directors shall be public directors; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The executive committees (or similarly empowered bodies) shall be at least thirty-five percent public.</P>
            <P>(2) Public director</P>
            <P>(i) To qualify as a public director of a contract market, an individual must first be found, by the board of directors, on the record, to have no material relationship with the contract market. A “material relationship” is one that reasonably could affect the independent judgment or decisionmaking of the director.</P>
            <P>(ii) In addition, a director shall be considered to have a “material relationship” with the contract market if any of the following circumstances exist:</P>
            <P>(A) The director is an officer or employee of the contract market or an officer or employee of its affiliate. In this context, “affiliate” includes parents or subsidiaries of the contract market or entities that share a common parent with the contract market;</P>
            <P>(B) The director is a member of the contract market, or an officer or director of a member. “Member” is defined according to section 1a(34) of the Commodity Exchange Act and Commission Regulation 1.3;</P>
            <P>(C) The director, or a firm with which the director is an officer, director, or partner, receives more than $100,000 in combined annual payments from the contract market, or any affiliate of the contract market (as defined in subsection (2)(ii)(A)), for legal, accounting, or consulting services. Compensation for services as a director of the contract market or as a director of an affiliate of the contract market does not count toward the $100,000 payment limit, nor does deferred compensation for services prior to becoming a director, so long as such compensation is in no way contingent, conditioned, or revocable;</P>
            <P>(D) Any of the relationships above apply to a member of the director's “immediate family,” i.e., spouse, parents, children and siblings.</P>
            <P>(iii) All of the disqualifying circumstances described in subsection (2)(ii) shall be subject to a one-year look back.</P>
            <P>(iv) A contract market's public directors may also serve as directors of the contract market's affiliate (as defined in subsection (2)(ii)(A)) if they otherwise meet the definition of public director in this section (2).</P>
            <P>(v) A contract market shall disclose to the Commission which members of its board are public directors, and the basis for those determinations.</P>
            <P>(3) Regulatory oversight committee<PRTPAGE P="788"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) A board of directors of any contract market shall establish a Regulatory Oversight Committee (“ROC”) as a standing committee, consisting of only public directors as defined in section (2), to assist it in minimizing actual and potential conflicts of interest. The ROC shall oversee the contract market's regulatory program on behalf of the board. The board shall delegate sufficient authority, dedicate sufficient resources, and allow sufficient time for the ROC to fulfill its mandate.</P>
            <P>(ii) The ROC shall:</P>
            <P>(A) Monitor the contract market's regulatory program for sufficiency, effectiveness, and independence;</P>
            <P>(B) Oversee all facets of the program, including trade practice and market surveillance; audits, examinations, and other regulatory responsibilities with respect to member firms (including ensuring compliance with financial integrity, financial reporting, sales practice, recordkeeping, and other requirements); and the conduct of investigations;</P>
            <P>(C) Review the size and allocation of the regulatory budget and resources; and the number, hiring and termination, and compensation of regulatory personnel;</P>
            <P>(D) Supervise the contract market's chief regulatory officer, who will report directly to the ROC;</P>
            <P>(E) Prepare an annual report assessing the contract market's self-regulatory program for the board of directors and the Commission, which sets forth the regulatory program's expenses, describes its staffing and structure, catalogues disciplinary actions taken during the year, and reviews the performance of disciplinary committees and panels;</P>
            <P>(F) Recommend changes that would ensure fair, vigorous, and effective regulation; and</P>
            <P>(G) Review regulatory proposals and advise the board as to whether and how such changes may impact regulation.</P>
            <P>(4) Disciplinary panels</P>
            <P>All contract markets shall minimize conflicts of interest in their disciplinary processes through disciplinary panel composition rules that preclude any group or class of industry participants from dominating or exercising disproportionate influence on such panels. Contract markets can further minimize conflicts of interest by including in all disciplinary panels at least one person who would qualify as a public director, as defined in subsections (2)(ii) and (2)(iii) above, except in cases limited to decorum, attire, or the timely submission of accurate records required for clearing or verifying each day's transactions. If contract market rules provide for appeal to the board of directors, or to a committee of the board, then that appellate body shall also include at least one person who would qualify as a public director as defined in subsections (2)(ii) and (2)(iii) above.</P>

            <EAR>Pt. 38, App. C</EAR>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix C to Part 38—Demonstration of Compliance That a Contract Is Not Readily Susceptible to Manipulation</HD>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Futures Contracts</E>—<E T="03">General Information.</E> When a designated contract market certifies or submits for approval contract terms and conditions for a new futures contract, that submission should include the following information:</P>
            <P>(1) A narrative describing the contract, including data and information to support the contract's terms and conditions, as set by the designated contract market. When designing a futures contract, the designated contract market should conduct market research so that the contract design meets the risk management needs of prospective users and promotes price discovery of the underlying commodity. The designated contract market should consult with market users to obtain their views and opinions during the contract design process to ensure the contract's term and conditions reflect the underlying cash market and that the futures contract will perform the intended risk management and/or price discovery functions. A designated contract market should provide a statement indicating that it took such steps to ensure the usefulness of the submitted contract.</P>

            <P>(2) A detailed cash market description for physical and cash-settled contracts. Such descriptions should be based on government and/or other publicly-available data whenever possible and be formulated for both the national and regional/local market relevant to the underlying commodity. For tangible commodities, the cash market descriptions for the relevant market (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, national and regional/local) should incorporate at least three full years of data that may include, among other factors, production, consumption, stocks, imports, exports, and prices. Each of those cash market variables should be fully defined and the data sources should be fully specified and documented to permit Commission staff to replicate the estimates of deliverable supply (defined in paragraph (b)(1)(A) of this appendix C). Whenever possible, the Commission requests that monthly or daily prices (depending on the contract) underlying the cash settlement index be submitted for the most recent three full calendar years and for as many of the current year's months for which data are available. For contracts that are cash settled to an index, the index's methodology should be provided along with supporting information showing how the index is reflective of the underlying cash market, is not readily subject to manipulation or distortion, and is based on a cash price series that is reliable, acceptable, publicly available and timely (defined in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this appendix C). The Commission recognizes that the data necessary for accurate and cogent cash market analyses for an underlying commodity vary with the nature of the underlying commodity. The Commission may require that the designated contract market submit a detailed report on commodity definitions and uses.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Futures Contracts Settled by Physical Delivery.</E> (1) For listed contracts that are settled by physical delivery, the terms and conditions of the contract should conform to the most common commercial practices and conditions in the cash market for the commodity underlying the futures contract. The terms and conditions should be designed to avoid any impediments to the delivery of the commodity so as to promote convergence between the price of the futures contract and the cash market value of the commodity at the expiration of a futures contract.<PRTPAGE P="790"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) Estimating Deliverable Supplies.</P>
            <P>(A) <E T="03">General definition.</E> The specified terms and conditions, considered as a whole, should result in a “deliverable supply” that is sufficient to ensure that the contract is not susceptible to price manipulation or distortion. In general, the term “deliverable supply” means the quantity of the commodity meeting the contract's delivery specifications that reasonably can be expected to be readily available to short traders and salable by long traders at its market value in normal cash marketing channels at the contract's delivery points during the specified delivery period, barring abnormal movement in interstate commerce. Typically, deliverable supply reflects the quantity of the commodity that potentially could be made available for sale on a spot basis at current prices at the contract's delivery points. For a non-financial physical-delivery commodity contract, this estimate might represent product which is in storage at the delivery point(s) specified in the futures contract or can be moved economically into or through such points consistent with the delivery procedures set forth in the contract and which is available for sale on a spot basis within the marketing channels that normally are tributary to the delivery point(s). Furthermore, an estimate of deliverable supply would not include supply that is committed for long-term agreements (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the amount of deliverable supply that would not be available to fulfill the delivery obligations arising from current trading). The size of commodity supplies that are committed to long-term agreements may be estimated by consulting with market participants. However, if the estimated deliverable supply that is committed for long-term agreements, or significant portion thereof, can be demonstrated by the designated contract market to be consistently and regularly made available to the spot market for shorts to acquire at prevailing economic values, then those “available” supplies committed for long-term contracts may be included in the designated contract market's estimate of deliverable supply for that commodity. An adequate measure of deliverable supply would be an amount of the commodity that would meet the normal or expected range of delivery demand without causing futures prices to become distorted relative to cash market prices. Given the availability of acceptable data, deliverable supply should be estimated on a monthly basis for at least the most recent three years for which data are available. To the extent possible and that data resources permit, deliverable supply estimates should be constructed such that the data reflect, as close as possible, the market defined by the contract's terms and conditions, and should be formulated, whenever possible, with government or publicly available data. All deliverable supply estimates should be fully defined, have all underlying assumptions explicitly stated, and have documentation of all data/information sources in order to permit estimate replication by Commission staff.</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Accounting for variations in deliverable supplies.</E> To assure the availability of adequate deliverable supplies and acceptable levels of commercial risk management utility, contract terms and conditions should account for variations in the patterns of production, consumption and supply over a period of years of sufficient length to assess adequately the potential range of deliverable supplies. This assessment also should consider seasonality, growth, and market concentration in the production/consumption of the underlying cash commodity. Deliverable supply implications of seasonal effects are more straightforwardly delineated when deliverable supply estimates are calculated on a monthly basis and when such monthly estimates are provided for at least the most recent three years for which data resources permit. In addition, consideration should be given to the relative roles of producers, merchants, and consumers in the production, distribution, and consumption of the cash commodity and whether the underlying commodity exhibits a domestic or international export focus. Careful consideration also should be given to the quality of the cash commodity and to the movement or flow of the cash commodity in normal commercial channels and whether there exist external factors or regulatory controls that could affect the price or supply of the cash commodity.</P>
            <P>(C) <E T="03">Calculation of deliverable supplies.</E> Designated contract markets should derive a quantitative estimate of the deliverable supplies for the delivery period specified in the proposed contract. For commodities with seasonal supply or demand characteristics, the deliverable supply analysis should include that period when potential supplies typically are at their lowest levels. The estimate should be based on statistical data, when reasonably available, covering a period of time that is representative of the underlying commodity's actual patterns of production, patterns of consumption, and patterns of seasonal effects (if relevant). Often, such a relevant time period should include at least three years of monthly deliverable supply estimates permitted by available data resources. Deliverable supply estimates should also exclude the amount of the commodity that would not be otherwise deliverable on the futures contract. For example, deliverable supplies should exclude quantities that at current price levels are not economically obtainable or deliverable or were previously committed for long-term agreements.</P>

            <P>(2) Contract terms and conditions requirements for futures contracts settled by physical delivery.<PRTPAGE P="791"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) For physical delivery contracts, an acceptable specification of terms and conditions would include, but may not be limited to, rules that address, as appropriate, the following criteria and comply with the associated standards:</P>
            <P>(A) <E T="03">Quality Standards.</E> The terms and conditions of a commodity contract should describe or define all of the economically significant characteristics or attributes of the commodity underlying the contract. In particular, the quality standards should be described or defined so that such standards reflect those used in transactions in the commodity in normal cash marketing channels. Documentation establishing that the quality standards of the contract's underlying commodity comply with those accepted/established by the industry, by government regulations, and/or by relevant laws should also be submitted. For any particular commodity contract, the specific attributes that should be enumerated depend upon the individual characteristics of the underlying commodity. These may include, for example, the following items: grade, quality, purity, weight, class, origin, growth, issuer, originator, maturity window, coupon rate, source, hours of trading, etc. If the terms of the contract provide for the delivery of multiple qualities of a specific attribute of the commodity having different cash market values, then a “par” quality should be specified with price differentials applicable to the “non-par” qualities that reflect discounts or premiums commonly observed or expected to occur in the cash market for that commodity.</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Delivery Points and Facilities.</E> Delivery point/area specifications should provide for futures delivery at a single location or at multiple locations where the underlying cash commodity is normally transacted or stored and where there exists a viable cash market(s). If multiple delivery points are specified and the value of the commodity differs between these locations, contract terms should include price differentials that reflect usual differences in value between the different delivery locations. If the price relationships among the delivery points are unstable and a designated contract market chooses to adopt fixed locational price differentials, such differentials should fall within the range of commonly observed or expected commercial price differences. In this regard, any price differentials should be supported with cash price data for the delivery location(s). The terms and conditions of the contracts also should specify, as appropriate, any conditions the delivery facilities and/or delivery facility operators should meet in order to be eligible for delivery. Specification of any requirements for delivery facilities also should consider the extent to which ownership of such facilities is concentrated and whether the level of concentration would be susceptible to manipulation of the futures contract's prices. Commodity contracts also should specify appropriately detailed delivery procedures that describe the responsibilities of deliverers, receivers and any required third parties in carrying out the delivery process. Such responsibilities could include allocation between buyer and seller of all associated costs such as load-out, document preparation, sampling, grading, weighing, storage, taxes, duties, fees, drayage, stevedoring, demurrage, dispatch, etc. Required accreditation for third-parties also should be detailed. These procedures should seek to minimize or eliminate any impediments to making or taking delivery by both deliverers and takers of delivery to help ensure convergence of cash and futures at the expiration of a futures delivery month.</P>
            <P>(C) <E T="03">Delivery Period and Last Trading Day.</E> An acceptable specification of the delivery period would allow for sufficient time for deliverers to acquire the deliverable commodity and make it available for delivery, considering any restrictions or requirements imposed by the designated contract market. Specification of the last trading day for expiring contracts should consider whether adequate time remains after the last trading day to allow for delivery on the contract.</P>
            <P>(D) <E T="03">Contract Size and Trading Unit.</E> An acceptable specification of the delivery unit and/or trading unit would be a contract size that is consistent with customary transactions, transportation or storage amounts in the cash market (e.g., the contract size may be reflective of the amount of the commodity that represents a pipeline, truckload or railcar shipment). For purposes of increasing market liquidity, a designated contract market may elect to specify a contract size that is smaller than the typical commercial transaction size, storage unit or transportation size. In such cases, the commodity contract should include procedures that allow futures traders to easily take or make delivery on such a contract with a smaller size, or, alternatively, the designated contract market may adopt special provisions requiring that delivery be made only in multiple contracts to accommodate reselling the commodity in the cash market. If the latter provision is adopted, contract terms should be adopted to minimize the potential for default in the delivery process by ensuring that all contracts remaining open at the close of trading in expiring delivery months can be combined to meet the required delivery unit size. Generally, contract sizes and trading units should be determined after a careful analysis of relevant cash market trading practices, conditions and deliverable supply estimates, so as to ensure that the underlying market commodity market and available supply sources are able to support the contract sizes and trading units at all times.<PRTPAGE P="792"/>
            </P>
            <P>(E) <E T="03">Delivery Pack.</E> The term “delivery pack” refers to the packaging standards (e.g., product may be delivered in burlap or polyethylene bags stacked on wooden pallets) or non-quality related standards regarding the composition of commodity within a delivery unit (e.g., product must all be imported from the same country or origin). An acceptable specification of the delivery pack or composition of a contract's delivery unit should reflect, to the extent possible, specifications commonly applied to the commodity traded or transacted in the cash market.</P>
            <P>(F) <E T="03">Delivery Instrument.</E> An acceptable specification of the delivery instrument (e.g., warehouse receipt, depository certificate or receipt, shipping certificate, bill of lading, in-line transfer, book transfer of securities, etc.) would provide for its conversion into the cash commodity at a commercially-reasonable cost. Transportation terms (e.g., FOB, CIF, freight prepaid to destination) as well as any limits on storage or certificate daily premium fees should be specified. These terms should reflect cash market practices and the customary provision for allocating delivery costs between buyer and seller.</P>
            <P>(G) <E T="03">Inspection Provisions.</E> Any inspection/certification procedures for verifying compliance with quality requirements or any other related delivery requirements (e.g., discounts relating to the age of the commodity, etc.) should be specified in the contract rules. An acceptable specification of inspection procedures would include the establishment of formal procedures that are consistent with procedures used in the cash market. To the extent that formal inspection procedures are not used in the cash market, an acceptable specification would contain provisions that assure accuracy in assessing the commodity, that are available at a low cost, that do not pose an obstacle to delivery on the contract and that are performed by a reputable, disinterested third party or by qualified designated contract market employees. Inspection terms also should detail which party pays for the service, particularly in light of the possibility of varying inspection results.</P>
            <P>(H) <E T="03">Delivery (Trading) Months.</E> Delivery months should be established based on the risk management needs of commercial entities as well as the availability of deliverable supplies in the specified months.</P>
            <P>(I) <E T="03">Minimum Price Fluctuation (Minimum Tick).</E> The minimum price increment (tick) should be set at a level that is equal to, or less than, the minimum price increment commonly observed in cash market transactions for the underlying commodity. Specifying a futures' minimum tick that is greater than the minimum price increment in the cash market can undermine the risk management utility of the futures contract by preventing hedgers from efficiently establishing and liquidating futures positions that are used to hedge anticipated cash market transactions or cash market positions.</P>
            <P>(J) <E T="03">Maximum Price Fluctuation Limits.</E> Designated contract markets may adopt price limits to: (<E T="03">1</E>) Reduce or constrain price movements in a trading day that may not be reflective of true market conditions but might be caused by traders overreacting to news; (<E T="03">2</E>) Allow additional time for the collection of margins in times of large price movements; and (<E T="03">3</E>) Provide a “cooling-off” period for futures market participants to respond to bona fide changes in market supply and demand fundamentals that would lead to large cash and futures price changes. If price limit provisions are adopted, the limits should be set at levels that are not overly restrictive in relation to price movements in the cash market for the commodity underlying the futures contract.</P>
            <P>(K) <E T="03">Speculative Limits.</E> Specific information regarding the establishment of speculative position limits are set forth in part 150, and/or part 151, as applicable, of the Commission's regulations.</P>
            <P>(L) <E T="03">Reportable Levels.</E> Refer to § 15.03 of the Commission's regulations.</P>
            <P>(M) <E T="03">Trading Hours.</E> Should be set by the designated contract market to delineate each trading day.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Futures Contracts Settled by Cash Settlement.</E> (1) Cash settlement is a method of settling certain futures or option contracts whereby, at contract expiration, the contract is settled by cash payment in lieu of physical delivery of the commodity or instrument underlying the contract. An acceptable specification of the cash settlement price for commodity futures and option contracts would include rules that fully describe the essential economic characteristics of the underlying commodity (e.g., grade, quality, weight, class, growth, issuer, maturity, source, rating, description of the underlying index and index's calculation methodology, etc.), as well as how the final settlement price is calculated. In addition, the rules should clearly specify the trading months and hours of trading, the last trading day, contract size, minimum price change (tick size) and any limitations on price movements (e.g., price limits or trading halts).</P>

            <P>(2) Cash settled contracts may be susceptible to manipulation or price distortion. In evaluating the susceptibility of a cash-settled contract to manipulation, a designated contract market should consider the size and liquidity of the cash market that underlies the listed contract in a manner that follows the determination of deliverable supply as noted above in (b)(1). In particular, situations susceptible to manipulation include those in which the volume of cash market <PRTPAGE P="793"/>transactions and/or the number of participants contacted in determining the cash-settlement price are very low. Cash-settled contracts may create an incentive to manipulate or artificially influence the data from which the cash-settlement price is derived or to exert undue influence on the cash-settlement price's computation in order to profit on a futures position in that commodity. The utility of a cash-settled contract for risk management and price discovery would be significantly impaired if the cash settlement price is not a reliable or robust indicator of the value of the underlying commodity or instrument. Accordingly, careful consideration should be given to the potential for manipulation or distortion of the cash settlement price, as well as the reliability of that price as an indicator of cash market values. Appropriate consideration also should be given to the commercial acceptability, public availability, and timeliness of the price series that is used to calculate the cash settlement price. Documentation demonstrating that the settlement price index is a reliable indicator of market values and conditions and is commonly used as a reference index by industry/market agents should be provided. Such documentation may take on various forms, including carefully documented interview results with knowledgeable agents.</P>
            <P>(3) Where an independent, private-sector third party calculates the cash settlement price series, a designated contract market should consider the need for a licensing agreement that will ensure the designated contract market's rights to the use of the price series to settle the listed contract.</P>
            <P>(i) Where an independent, private-sector third party calculates the cash settlement price series, the designated contract market should verify that the third party utilizes business practices that minimize the opportunity or incentive to manipulate the cash-settlement price series. Such safeguards may include lock-downs, prohibitions against derivatives trading by employees, or public dissemination of the names of sources and the price quotes they provide. Because a cash-settled contract may create an incentive to manipulate or artificially influence the underlying market from which the cash-settlement price is derived or to exert undue influence on the cash-settlement computation in order to profit on a futures position in that commodity, a designated contract market should, whenever practicable, enter into an information-sharing agreement with the third-party provider which would enable the designated contract market to better detect and prevent manipulative behavior.</P>
            <P>(ii) Where a designated contract market itself generates the cash settlement price series, the designated contract market should establish calculation procedures that safeguard against potential attempts to artificially influence the price. For example, if the cash settlement price is derived by the designated contract market based on a survey of cash market sources, the designated contract market should maintain a list of such entities which all should be reputable sources with knowledge of the cash market. In addition, the sample of sources polled should be representative of the cash market, and the poll should be conducted at a time when trading in the cash market is active.</P>
            <P>(iii) The cash-settlement calculation should involve computational procedures that eliminate or reduce the impact of potentially unrepresentative data.</P>
            <P>(iv) The cash settlement price should be an accurate and reliable indicator of prices in the underlying cash market. The cash settlement price also should be acceptable to commercial users of the commodity contract. The registered entity should fully document that the settlement price is accurate, reliable, highly regarded by industry/market agents, and fully reflects the economic and commercial conditions of the relevant designated contract market.</P>
            <P>(v) To the extent possible, the cash settlement price should be based on cash price series that are publicly available and available on a timely basis for purposes of calculating the cash settlement price at the expiration of a commodity contract. A designated contract market should make the final cash settlement price and any other supporting information that is appropriate for release to the public, available to the public when cash settlement is accomplished by the derivatives clearing organization. If the cash settlement price is based on cash prices that are obtained from non-public sources (e.g., cash market surveys conducted by the designated contract market or by third parties on behalf of the designated contract market), a designated contract market should make available to the public as soon as possible after a contract month's expiration the final cash settlement price as well as any other supporting information that is appropriate or feasible to make available to the public.</P>
            <P>(4) Contract terms and conditions requirements for futures contracts settled by cash settlement.</P>
            <P>(i) An acceptable specification of the terms and conditions of a cash-settled commodity contract will also set forth the trading months, last trading day, contract size, minimum price change (tick size) and daily price limits, if any.</P>
            <P>(A) <E T="03">Commodity Characteristics:</E> The terms and conditions of a commodity contract should describe the commodity underlying the contract.</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Contract Size and Trading Unit:</E> An acceptable specification of the trading unit would be a contract size that is consistent with customary transactions in the cash market. A designated contract market may <PRTPAGE P="794"/>opt to set the contract size smaller than that of standard cash market transactions.</P>
            <P>(C) <E T="03">Cash Settlement Procedure:</E> The cash settlement price should be reliable, acceptable, publicly available, and reported in a timely manner as described in paragraphs (c)(3)(iv) and (c)(3)(v) of this appendix C.</P>
            <P>(D) <E T="03">Pricing Basis and Minimum Price Fluctuation (Minimum Tick):</E> The minimum price increment (tick) should be set a level that is equal to, or less than, the minimum price increment commonly observed in cash market transactions for the underlying commodity. Specifying a futures' minimum tick that is greater than the minimum price increment in the cash market can undermine the risk management utility of the futures contract by preventing hedgers from efficiently establishing and liquidating futures positions that are used to hedge anticipated cash market transactions or cash market positions.</P>
            <P>(E) <E T="03">Maximum Price Fluctuation Limits:</E> Designated contract markets may adopt price limits to: (1) Reduce or constrain price movements in a trading day that may not be reflective of true market conditions but might be caused by traders overreacting to news; (2) Allow additional time for the collection of margins in times of large price movements; and (3) Provide a “cooling-off” period for futures market participants to respond to bona fide changes in market supply and demand fundamentals that would lead to large cash and futures price changes. If price-limit provisions are adopted, the limits should be set at levels that are not overly restrictive in relation to price movements in the cash market for the commodity underlying the futures contract. For broad-based stock index futures contracts, rules should be adopted that coordinate with New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) declared Circuit Breaker Trading Halts (or other market coordinated Circuit Breaker mechanism) and would recommence trading in the futures contract only after trading in the majority of the stocks underlying the index has recommenced.</P>
            <P>(F) <E T="03">Last Trading Day:</E> Specification of the last trading day for expiring contracts should be established such that it occurs before publication of the underlying third-party price index or determination of the final settlement price. If the designated contract market chooses to allow trading to occur through the determination of the final settlement price, then the designated contract market should show that futures trading would not distort the final settlement price calculation.</P>
            <P>(G) <E T="03">Trading Months:</E> Trading months should be established based on the risk management needs of commercial entities as well as the availability of price and other data needed to calculate the cash settlement price in the specified months. Specification of the last trading day should take into consideration whether the volume of transactions underlying the cash settlement price would be unduly limited by occurrence of holidays or traditional holiday periods in the cash market. Moreover, a contract should not be listed past the date for which the designated contract market has access to use a proprietary price index for cash settlement.</P>
            <P>(H) <E T="03">Speculative Limits:</E> Specific rules and policies for speculative position limits are set forth in part 150 and/or part 151, as applicable, of the Commission's regulations.</P>
            <P>(I) <E T="03">Reportable Levels:</E> Refer to § 15.03 of the Commission's regulations.</P>
            <P>(J) <E T="03">Trading Hours:</E> Should be set by the designated contract market to delineate each trading day.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Options on a Futures Contract.</E> (1) The Commission's experience with the oversight of trading in futures option contracts indicates that most of the terms and conditions associated with such trading do not raise any regulatory concerns or issues. The Commission has found that the following terms do not affect an option contract's susceptible to manipulation or its utility for risk management. Thus, the Commission believes that, in most cases, any specification of the following terms would be acceptable; the only requirement is that such terms be specified in an automatic and objective manner in the option contract's rules:</P>
            <P>○ Exercise method;</P>
            <P>○ Exercise procedure (if positions in the underlying futures contract are established via book entry);</P>
            <P>○ Strike price listing provisions, including provisions for listing strike prices on a discretionary basis;</P>
            <P>○ Strike price intervals;</P>
            <P>○ Automatic exercise provisions;</P>
            <P>○ Contract size (unless not set equal to the size of the underlying futures contract); and</P>
            <P>○ Option minimum tick should be equal to or smaller than that of the underlying futures contract.</P>

            <P>(2) Option Expiration &amp; Last Trading Day. For options on futures contracts, specification of expiration dates should consider the relationship of the option expiration date to the delivery period for the underlying futures contract. In particular, an assessment should be made of liquidity in the underlying futures market to assure that any futures contracts acquired through exercise can be liquidated without adversely affecting the orderly liquidation of futures positions or increasing the underlying futures contract's susceptibility to manipulation. When the underlying futures contract exhibits a very low trading activity during an expiring delivery month's final trading days or has a greater risk of price manipulation than other contracts, the last trading day and expiration day of the option should occur prior to the delivery period or the settlement date of the underlying future. For example, the last <PRTPAGE P="795"/>trading day and option expiration day might appropriately be established prior to first delivery notice day for option contracts with underlying futures contracts that have very limited deliverable supplies. Similarly, if the futures contract underlying an option contract is cash settled using cash prices from a very limited number of underlying cash market transactions, the last trading and option expiration days for the option contract might appropriately be established prior to the last trading day for the futures contract.</P>
            <P>(3) Speculative Limits. In cases where the terms of an underlying futures contract specify a spot-month speculative position limit and the option contract expires during, or at the close of, the futures contract's delivery period, the option contract should include a spot-month speculative position limit provision that requires traders to combine their futures and option position and be subject to the limit established for the futures contract. Specific rules and policies for speculative position limits are set forth in part 150 and/or part 151, as applicable, of the Commission's regulations.</P>
            <P>(4) Options on Physicals Contracts.</P>
            <P>(i) Under the Commission's regulations, the term “option on physicals” refers to option contracts that do not provide for exercise into an underlying futures contract. Upon exercise, options on physicals can be settled via physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by a cash payment. Thus, options on physicals raise many of the same issues associated with trading in futures contracts regarding adequacy of deliverable supplies or acceptability of the cash settlement price series. In this regard, an option that is cash settled based on the settlement price of a futures contract would be considered an “option on physicals” and the futures settlement price would be considered the cash price series.</P>
            <P>(ii) In view of the above, acceptable practices for the terms and conditions of options on physicals contracts include, as appropriate, those practices set forth above for physical-delivery or cash-settled futures contracts plus the practices set forth for options on futures contracts.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Security Futures Products.</E> The listing of security futures products are governed by the special requirements of part 41 of the Commission's regulations.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Non-Price Based Futures Contracts.</E> (1) Non-price based contracts are typically construed as binary options, but also may be designed to function similar to traditional futures or option contracts.</P>
            <P>(2) Where the contract is settled to a third party cash-settlement series, the designated contract market should consider the nature and sources of the data comprising the cash-settlement calculation, the computational procedures, and the mechanisms in place to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the index value. The evaluation also considers the extent to which the third party has, or will adopt, safeguards against unauthorized or premature release of the index value itself or any key data used in deriving the index value.</P>
            <P>(3) The designated contract market should follow the guidance in paragraph (c)(4) (Contract Terms and Conditions Requirements for Futures Contracts Settled by Cash Settlement) of this appendix C to meet compliance.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Swap Contracts.</E> (1) In general, swap contracts are an agreement to exchange a series of cash flows over a period of time based on reference price indices. When listing a swap for trading, a swap execution facility or designated contract market should determine that the reference price indices used for its contracts are not readily susceptible to manipulation. Accordingly, careful consideration should be given to the potential for manipulation or distortion of the cash settlement price, as well as the reliability of that price as an indicator of cash market values. Appropriate consideration also should be given to the commercial acceptability, public availability, and timeliness of the price series that is used to calculate the cash settlement price. Documentation demonstrating that the settlement price index is a reliable indicator of market values and conditions and is highly regarded by industry/market agents should be provided. Such documentation may take on various forms, including carefully documented interviews with principal market trading agents, pricing experts, marketing agents, etc. Appropriate consideration also should be given to the commercial acceptability, public availability, and timeliness of the price series that is used to calculate the cash flows of the swap.</P>

            <P>(i) Where an independent, private-sector third party calculates the referenced price index, the designated contract market should verify that the third party utilizes business practices that minimize the opportunity or incentive to manipulate the cash-settlement price series. Such safeguards may include lock-downs, prohibitions against derivatives trading by employees, or public dissemination of the names of sources and the price quotes they provide. Because a cash-settled contract may create an incentive to manipulate or artificially influence the underlying market from which the cash-settlement price is derived or to exert undue influence on the cash-settlement computation in order to profit on a futures position in that commodity, a designated contract market should, whenever practicable, enter into an information-sharing agreement with the third-party provider which would enable the designated contract market to better detect and prevent manipulative behavior.<PRTPAGE P="796"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) Where a designated contract market itself generates the cash settlement price series, the designated contract market should establish calculation procedures that safeguard against potential attempts to artificially influence the price. For example, if the cash settlement price is derived by the designated contract market based on a survey of cash market sources, the designated contract market should maintain a list of such entities which all should be reputable sources with knowledge of the cash market. In addition, the sample of sources polled should be representative of the cash market, and the poll should be conducted at a time when trading in the cash market is active.</P>
            <P>(iii) The cash-settlement calculation should involve appropriate computational procedures that eliminate or reduce the impact of potentially unrepresentative data.</P>
            <P>(2) Speculative Limits: Specific rules and policies for speculative position limits are set forth in part 151 and/or part 151, as applicable, of the Commission's regulations.</P>
            <P>(3) Intraday Market Restrictions: Designated contract markets or swap execution facilities should have in place intraday market restrictions that pause or halt trading in the event of extraordinary price moves that may result in distorted prices. Such restrictions need to be coordinated with other markets that may be a proxy or a substitute for the contracts traded on their facility. For example, coordination with NYSE rule 80.B Circuit Breaker Trading Halts. The designated contract market or swap execution facility should adopt rules to specifically address who is authorized to declare an emergency; how the designated contract market or swap execution facility will notify the Commission of its decision that an emergency exists; how it will address conflicts of interest in the exercise of emergency authority; and how it will coordinate trading halts with markets that trade the underlying price reference index or product.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Settlement Method.</E> The designated contract market or swap execution facility should follow the guidance in paragraph (c)(4) (Contract Terms and Conditions Requirements for Futures Contracts Settled by Cash Settlement) of this appendix C to meet compliance, or paragraph (b)(2) (Contract Terms and Conditions Requirements for Futures Contracts Settled by Physical Delivery) of this appendix C, as appropriate.</P>

An applicant, when filing a Form DCO for purposes of amending its pending application or requesting an amendment to an existing registration, is only required to submit exhibits and updated information that are relevant to the requested amendment and are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the core principles affected by the requested amendment. The Commission will not commence processing an application unless the applicant has filed the application as required by this section. Failure to file a completed application will preclude the Commission from determining that an application is materially complete, as provided in section 6(a) of the Act. Upon its own initiative, an applicant may file with its completed application additional information that may be necessary or helpful to the Commission in processing the application.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Submission of supplemental information.</E> The filing of a completed application is a minimum requirement and does not create a presumption that the application is materially complete or that supplemental information will not <PRTPAGE P="799"/>be required. At any time during the application review process, the Commission may request that the applicant submit supplemental information in order for the Commission to process the application. The applicant shall file electronically such supplemental information with the Secretary of the Commission in the format and manner specified by the Commission.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Application amendments.</E> An applicant shall promptly amend its application if it discovers a material omission or error, or if there is a material change in the information provided to the Commission in the application or other information provided in connection with the application.</P>

            <P>(ii) The Director of the Division of Clearing and Risk may submit to the Commission for its consideration any matter which has been delegated in this paragraph.</P>

            <P>(e) <E T="03">Request for vacation of registration.</E> A registered derivatives clearing organization may vacate its registration under section 7 of the Act by filing electronically such a request with the Secretary of the Commission in the format and manner specified by the Commission. Vacation of registration shall not affect any action taken or to be taken by the Commission based upon actions, activities or events occurring during the time that the entity was registered by the Commission.</P>

            <P>(2) A derivatives clearing organization that wishes to accept for clearing any swap that is not within a group, category, type, or class of swaps that the derivatives clearing organization already clears shall request a determination by the Commission of the derivatives clearing organization's eligibility to clear such a swap before accepting the swap for clearing. The request, which shall be filed electronically with the Secretary of the Commission, shall address the derivatives clearing organization's ability, if it accepts the swap for clearing, to maintain compliance with section 5b(c)(2) of the Act, specifically:</P>

            <P>(ii) The derivative clearing organization's ability to manage the risks associated with clearing the swap, especially if the Commission determines that the swap is required to be cleared.</P>

            <P>(v) Pricing sources, models, and procedures, demonstrating an ability to obtain sufficient price data to measure credit exposures in a timely and accurate manner, including any agreements with clearing members to provide price data and copies of executed agreements with third-party price vendors, and information about any price reference index used, such as the name of the index, the source that calculates it, the methodology used to calculate the price reference index and how often it is calculated, and when and where it is published publicly;</P>

            <P>(6) The Commission will review the submission and determine whether the swap, or group, category, type, or class of swaps described in the submission is required to be cleared. The Commission will make its determination not later than 90 days after a complete submission has been received, unless the submitting derivatives clearing organization agrees to an extension. The determination of when such submission is complete shall be at the sole discretion of the Commission. In making a determination that a clearing requirement shall apply, the Commission may impose such terms and conditions to the clearing requirement as the Commission determines to be appropriate.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Commission-initiated reviews.</E> (1) The Commission, on an ongoing basis, will review swaps that have not been accepted for clearing by a derivatives clearing organization to make a determination as to whether the swaps should be required to be cleared.

            <P>(2) Notice regarding any determination made under paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be made available to the public and posted on the Commission Web site for a 30-day public comment period.</P>

            <P>(3) If no derivatives clearing organization has accepted for clearing a particular swap, group, category, type, or <PRTPAGE P="803"/>class of swaps that the Commission finds would otherwise be subject to a clearing requirement, the Commission will:</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Stay of clearing requirement.</E> (1) After making a determination that a swap, or group, category, type, or class of swaps is required to be cleared, the Commission, on application of a counterparty to a swap or on its own initiative, may stay the clearing requirement until the Commission completes a review of the terms of the swap, or group, category, type, or class of swaps and the clearing arrangement.</P>
            <P>(2) A counterparty to a swap that wishes to apply for a stay of the clearing requirement for that swap shall submit a written request to the Secretary of the Commission that includes:</P>

            <P>(5) Upon completion of its review, the Commission may:</P>
            <P>(i) Determine, subject to any terms and conditions as the Commission determines to be appropriate, that the swap, or group, category, type, or class of swaps must be cleared; or</P>

A derivatives clearing organization shall identify and adequately manage <PRTPAGE P="806"/>its general business risks and hold sufficient liquid resources to cover potential business losses that are not related to clearing members' defaults, so that the derivatives clearing organization can continue to provide services as an ongoing concern. Financial resources shall be considered sufficient if their value, at a minimum, exceeds the total amount that would:</P>
            <P>(1) Enable the derivatives clearing organization to meet its financial obligations to its clearing members notwithstanding a default by the clearing member creating the largest financial exposure for the derivatives clearing organization in extreme but plausible market conditions; Provided that if a clearing member controls another clearing member or is under common control with another clearing member, the affiliated clearing members shall be deemed to be a single clearing member for purposes of this provision; and</P>

            <P>(3) A financial resource may be allocated, in whole or in part, to satisfy the requirements of either paragraph (a)(1) or paragraph (a)(2) of this section, but not both paragraphs, and only to the extent the use of such financial resource is not otherwise limited by the Act, Commission regulations, the derivatives clearing organization's rules, or any contractual arrangements to which the derivatives clearing organization is a party.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Computation of financial resources requirement.</E> (1) A derivatives clearing organization shall, on a monthly basis, perform stress testing that will allow it to make a reasonable calculation of the financial resources needed to meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

The Commission may review the methodology and require changes as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(2) A derivatives clearing organization shall, on a monthly basis, make a reasonable calculation of its projected operating costs over a 12-month period in order to determine the amount needed to meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The derivatives clearing organization shall have reasonable discretion in determining the methodology used to compute such projected operating costs. The Commission may review the methodology and require changes as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Valuation of financial resources.</E> (1) At appropriate intervals, but not less than monthly, a derivatives clearing organization shall compute the current market value of each financial resource used to meet its obligations under paragraph (a) of this section.

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Documentation requirement.</E> A derivatives clearing organization shall establish and maintain written policies, procedures, and controls, approved by its board of directors, which establish an appropriate risk management framework that, at a minimum, clearly identifies and documents the range of risks to which the derivatives clearing organization is exposed, addresses the monitoring and management of the entirety of those risks, and provides a mechanism for internal audit. The risk management framework shall be regularly reviewed and updated as necessary.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Chief risk officer.</E> A derivatives clearing organization shall have a chief risk officer who shall be responsible for implementing the risk management framework, including the procedures, policies and controls described in paragraph (b) of this section, and for making appropriate recommendations to the derivatives clearing organization's risk management committee or board of directors, as applicable, regarding the derivatives clearing organization's risk management functions.</P>

            <P>(2) Monitor its credit exposure to each clearing member periodically during each business day.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Limitation of exposure to potential losses from defaults.</E> A derivatives clearing organization, through margin requirements and other risk control mechanisms, shall limit its exposure to potential losses from defaults by its clearing members to ensure that:</P>

            <P>(1) The operations of the derivatives clearing organization would not be disrupted; and<PRTPAGE P="812"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) Non-defaulting clearing members would not be exposed to losses that non-defaulting clearing members cannot anticipate or control.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Margin requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Each model and parameter used in setting initial margin requirements shall be risk-based and reviewed on a regular basis.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Methodology and coverage.</E> (i) A derivatives clearing organization shall establish initial margin requirements that are commensurate with the risks of each product and portfolio, including any unusual characteristics of, or risks associated with, particular products or portfolios, including but not limited to jump-to-default risk or similar jump risk.</P>

            <P>(ii) A derivatives clearing organization shall use models that generate initial margin requirements sufficient to cover the derivatives clearing organization's potential future exposures to clearing members based on price movements in the interval between the last collection of variation margin and the time within which the derivatives clearing organization estimates that it would be able to liquidate a defaulting clearing member's positions (liquidation time); <E T="03">provided, however,</E> that a derivatives clearing organization shall use:</P>
            <P>(A) A minimum liquidation time that is one day for futures and options;</P>

            <P>(iii) The actual coverage of the initial margin requirements produced by such models, along with projected measures of the models' performance, shall meet an established confidence level of at least 99 percent, based on data from an appropriate historic time period, for:</P>
            <P>(A) Each product for which the derivatives clearing organization uses a product-based margin methodology;</P>
            <P>(B) Each spread within or between products for which there is a defined spread margin rate;</P>

            <P>(iv) A derivatives clearing organization shall determine the appropriate historic time period based on the characteristics, including volatility patterns, as applicable, of each product, spread, account, or portfolio.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Independent validation.</E> A derivatives clearing organization's systems for generating initial margin requirements, including its theoretical models, must be reviewed and validated by a qualified and independent party, on a regular basis. Such qualified and independent parties may be independent contractors or employees of the derivatives clearing organization, but shall not be persons responsible for development or operation of the systems and models being tested.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Spread and portfolio margins.</E> (i) A derivatives clearing organization may allow reductions in initial margin requirements for related positions if the price risks with respect to such positions are significantly and reliably correlated. The price risks of different positions will only be considered to be reliably correlated if there is a theoretical basis for the correlation in addition to an exhibited statistical correlation. That theoretical basis may include, but is not limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(A) The products on which the positions are based are complements of, or substitutes for, each other;</P>
            <P>(B) One product is a significant input into the other product(s);</P>
            <P>(C) The products share a significant common input; or</P>
            <P>(D) The prices of the products are influenced by common external factors.</P>

            <P>(ii) A derivatives clearing organization shall regularly review its margin <PRTPAGE P="813"/>reductions and the correlations on which they are based.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Price data.</E> A derivatives clearing organization shall have a reliable source of timely price data in order to measure the derivatives clearing organization's credit exposure accurately. A derivatives clearing organization shall also have written procedures and sound valuation models for addressing circumstances where pricing data is not readily available or reliable.</P>

            <P>(7) <E T="03">Back tests.</E> A derivatives clearing organization shall conduct back tests, as defined in § 39.2 of this part, using an appropriate time period but not less than the previous 30 days, as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) On a daily basis, a derivatives clearing organization shall conduct back tests with respect to products or swap portfolios that are experiencing significant market volatility, to test the adequacy of its initial margin requirements, as follows:</P>
            <P>(A) For that product if the derivatives clearing organization uses a product-based margin methodology;</P>
            <P>(B) For each spread involving that product if there is a defined spread margin rate;</P>
            <P>(C) For each account held by a clearing member at the derivatives clearing organization that contains a significant position in that product, by house origin and by each customer origin; and</P>
            <P>(D) For each such swap portfolio, including any portfolio containing futures and/or options and held in a commingled account pursuant to § 39.15(b)(2) of this part, by beneficial owner.</P>
            <P>(ii) On at least a monthly basis, a derivatives clearing organization shall conduct back tests to test the adequacy of its initial margin requirements, as follows:</P>

            <P>(B) For each spread for which there is a defined spread margin rate;</P>
            <P>(C) For each account held by a clearing member at the derivatives clearing organization, by house origin and by each customer origin; and</P>
            <P>(D) For each swap portfolio, including any portfolio containing futures and/or options and held in a commingled account pursuant to § 39.15(b)(2) of this part, by beneficial owner.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Customer margin.</E> (i) <E T="03">Gross margin.</E> (A) A derivatives clearing organization shall collect initial margin on a gross basis for each clearing member's customer account(s) equal to the sum of the initial margin amounts that would be required by the derivatives clearing organization for each individual customer within that account if each individual customer were a clearing member.</P>
            <P>(B) For purposes of calculating the gross initial margin requirement for each clearing member's customer account(s), to the extent not inconsistent with other Commission regulations, a derivatives clearing organization may require its clearing members to report the gross positions of each individual customer to the derivatives clearing organization, or it may permit each clearing member to report the sum of the gross positions of its customers to the derivatives clearing organization.</P>
            <P>(C) For purposes of this paragraph (g)(8), a derivatives clearing organization may rely, and may permit its clearing members to rely, upon the sum of the gross positions reported to the clearing members by each domestic or foreign omnibus account that they carry, without obtaining information identifying the positions of each individual customer underlying such omnibus accounts.</P>
            <P>(D) A derivatives clearing organization may not, and may not permit its clearing members to, net positions of different customers against one another.</P>
            <P>(E) A derivatives clearing organization may collect initial margin for its clearing members' house accounts on a net basis.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Customer initial margin requirements.</E> A derivatives clearing organization shall require its clearing members to collect customer initial margin, as defined in § 1.3 of this chapter, from their customers, for non-hedge positions, at a level that is greater than 100 <PRTPAGE P="814"/>percent of the derivatives clearing organization's initial margin requirements with respect to each product and swap portfolio. The derivatives clearing organization shall have reasonable discretion in determining the percentage by which customer initial margins must exceed the derivatives clearing organization's initial margin requirements with respect to particular products or swap portfolios. The Commission may review such percentage levels and require different percentage levels if the Commission deems the levels insufficient to protect the financial integrity of the clearing members or the derivatives clearing organization.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Withdrawal of customer initial margin.</E> A derivatives clearing organization shall require its clearing members to ensure that their customers do not withdraw funds from their accounts with such clearing members unless the net liquidating value plus the margin deposits remaining in a customer's account after such withdrawal are sufficient to meet the customer initial margin requirements with respect to all products and swap portfolios held in such customer's account which are cleared by the derivatives clearing organization.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Time deadlines.</E> A derivatives clearing organization shall establish and enforce time deadlines for initial and variation margin payments to the derivatives clearing organization by its clearing members.</P>
            <P>(10) <E T="03">Types of assets.</E> A derivatives clearing organization shall limit the assets it accepts as initial margin to those that have minimal credit, market, and liquidity risks. A derivatives clearing organization may take into account the specific risk-reducing properties that particular assets have in a particular portfolio. A derivatives clearing organization may accept letters of credit as initial margin for futures and options on futures but shall not accept letters of credit as initial margin for swaps.</P>
            <P>(11) <E T="03">Valuation.</E> A derivatives clearing organization shall use prudent valuation practices to value assets posted as initial margin on a daily basis.</P>
            <P>(12) <E T="03">Haircuts.</E> A derivatives clearing organization shall apply appropriate reductions in value to reflect credit, market, and liquidity risks (haircuts), to the assets that it accepts in satisfaction of initial margin obligations, taking into consideration stressed market conditions, and shall evaluate the appropriateness of such haircuts on at least a quarterly basis.</P>
            <P>(13) <E T="03">Concentration limits or charges.</E> A derivatives clearing organization shall apply appropriate limitations or charges on the concentration of assets posted as initial margin, as necessary, in order to ensure its ability to liquidate such assets quickly with minimal adverse price effects, and shall evaluate the appropriateness of any such concentration limits or charges, on at least a monthly basis.</P>
            <P>(14) <E T="03">Pledged assets.</E> If a derivatives clearing organization permits its clearing members to pledge assets for initial margin while retaining such assets in accounts in the names of such clearing members, the derivatives clearing organization shall ensure that such assets are unencumbered and that such a pledge has been validly created and validly perfected in the relevant jurisdiction.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Other risk control mechanisms</E>— (1) <E T="03">Risk limits.</E> (i) A derivatives clearing organization shall impose risk limits on each clearing member, by house origin and by each customer origin, in order to prevent a clearing member from carrying positions for which the risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold relative to the clearing member's and/or the derivatives clearing organization's financial resources. The derivatives clearing organization shall have reasonable discretion in determining:</P>
            <P>(A) The method of computing risk exposure;</P>
            <P>(B) The applicable threshold(s); and</P>
            <P>(C) The applicable financial resources under this provision; provided however, that the ratio of exposure to capital must remain the same across all capital levels. The Commission may review such methods, thresholds, and financial resources and require the application of different methods, thresholds, or financial resources, as appropriate.</P>

            <P>(ii) A derivatives clearing organization may permit a clearing member to exceed the threshold(s) applied pursuant to paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section provided that the derivatives <PRTPAGE P="815"/>clearing organization requires the clearing member to post additional initial margin that the derivatives clearing organization deems sufficient to appropriately eliminate excessive risk exposure at the clearing member. The Commission may review the amount of additional initial margin and require a different amount of additional initial margin, as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Large trader reports.</E> A derivatives clearing organization shall obtain from its clearing members or from a relevant designated contract market or swap execution facility, copies of all reports that are required to be filed with the Commission by, or on behalf of, such clearing members pursuant to parts 17 and 20 of this chapter. A derivatives clearing organization shall review such reports on a daily basis to ascertain the risk of the overall portfolio of each large trader, including futures, options, and swaps cleared by the derivatives clearing organization, which are held by all clearing members carrying accounts for each such large trader, and shall take additional actions with respect to such clearing members, when appropriate, as specified in paragraph (h)(6) of this section, in order to address any risks posed by any such large trader.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Stress tests.</E> A derivatives clearing organization shall conduct stress tests, as defined in § 39.2 of this part, as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) On a daily basis, a derivatives clearing organization shall conduct stress tests with respect to each large trader who poses significant risk to a clearing member or the derivatives clearing organization, including futures, options, and swaps cleared by the derivatives clearing organization, which are held by all clearing members carrying accounts for each such large trader. The derivatives clearing organization shall have reasonable discretion in determining which traders to test and the methodology used to conduct such stress tests. The Commission may review the selection of accounts and the methodology and require changes, as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(ii) On at least a weekly basis, a derivatives clearing organization shall conduct stress tests with respect to each clearing member account, by house origin and by each customer origin, and each swap portfolio, including any portfolio containing futures and/or options and held in a commingled account pursuant to § 39.15(b)(2) of this part, by beneficial owner, under extreme but plausible market conditions. The derivatives clearing organization shall have reasonable discretion in determining the methodology used to conduct such stress tests. The Commission may review the methodology and require changes, as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Portfolio compression.</E> A derivatives clearing organization shall make portfolio compression exercises available, on a regular and voluntary basis, for its clearing members that clear swaps, to the extent that such exercises are appropriate for those swaps that it clears; <E T="03">provided, however,</E> a derivatives clearing organization is not required to develop its own portfolio compression services, and is only required to make such portfolio compression exercises available, if applicable portfolio compression services have been developed by a third party.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Clearing members' risk management policies and procedures.</E> (i) A derivatives clearing organization shall adopt rules that:</P>
            <P>(A) Require its clearing members to maintain current written risk management policies and procedures, which address the risks that such clearing members may pose to the derivatives clearing organization;</P>
            <P>(B) Ensure that it has the authority to request and obtain information and documents from its clearing members regarding their risk management policies, procedures, and practices, including, but not limited to, information and documents relating to the liquidity of their financial resources and their settlement procedures; and</P>
            <P>(C) Require its clearing members to make information and documents regarding their risk management policies, procedures, and practices available to the Commission upon the Commission's request.</P>

            <P>(ii) A derivatives clearing organization shall review the risk management policies, procedures, and practices of <PRTPAGE P="816"/>each of its clearing members, which address the risks that such clearing members may pose to the derivatives clearing organization, on a periodic basis and document such reviews.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Additional authority.</E> A derivatives clearing organization shall take additional actions with respect to particular clearing members, when appropriate, based on the application of objective and prudent risk management standards including, but not limited to:</P>
            <P>(i) Imposing enhanced capital requirements;</P>
            <P>(ii) Imposing enhanced margin requirements;</P>
            <P>(iii) Imposing position limits;</P>
            <P>(iv) Prohibiting an increase in positions;</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Daily settlements.</E> Except as otherwise provided by Commission order, a derivatives clearing organization shall effect a settlement with each clearing member at least once each business day, and shall have the authority and operational capacity to effect a settlement with each clearing member, on an intraday basis, either routinely, when thresholds specified by the derivatives clearing organization are breached, or in times of extreme market volatility.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Settlement banks.</E> A derivatives clearing organization shall employ settlement arrangements that eliminate or strictly limit its exposure to settlement bank risks, including the credit and liquidity risks arising from the use of such bank(s) to effect settlements with its clearing members, as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) A derivatives clearing organization shall have documented criteria that must be met by any settlement bank used by the derivatives clearing organization or its clearing members, including criteria addressing the capitalization, creditworthiness, access to liquidity, operational reliability, and regulation or supervision of such bank(s).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Financial resources requirements for systemically important derivatives clearing organizations and subpart C derivatives clearing organizations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> (1) Notwithstanding the requirements of § 39.11(a)(1), each systemically important derivatives clearing organization and subpart C derivatives clearing organization that, in either case, is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions or is involved in activities with a more complex risk profile shall maintain financial resources sufficient to enable it to meet its financial obligations to its clearing members notwithstanding a default by the two clearing members creating the largest combined loss to the derivatives clearing organization in extreme but plausible market conditions.</P>
            <P>(2) The Commission shall, if it deems appropriate, determine whether a systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions. In determining whether a systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions, the Commission shall consider whether the derivatives clearing organization:</P>
            <P>(i) Is a systemically important derivatives clearing organization, as defined by § 39.2; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Has been determined to be systemically important by one or more jurisdictions other than the United States pursuant to a designation process that considers whether the foreseeable effects of a failure or disruption of the derivatives clearing organization could threaten the stability of each relevant jurisdiction's financial system.</P>
            <P>(3) The Commission shall, if it deems appropriate, determine whether any of the activities of a systemically important derivatives clearing organization or a subpart C derivatives clearing organization, in addition to clearing credit default swaps, credit default futures, and any derivatives that reference either credit default swaps or credit default futures, has a more complex risk profile. In determining whether an activity has a more complex risk profile, the Commission will consider characteristics such as discrete jump-to-default price changes or high correlations with potential participant defaults as factors supporting (though not necessary for) a finding of a more complex risk profile.</P>

            <P>(4) For purposes of this section, if a clearing member controls another clearing member or is under common control with another clearing member, such affiliated clearing members shall <PRTPAGE P="836"/>be deemed to be a single clearing member.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Valuation of financial resources.</E> Notwithstanding the provisions of § 39.11(d)(2), assessments for additional guaranty fund contributions (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> guaranty fund contributions that are not pre-funded) shall not be included in calculating the financial resources available to meet a systemically important derivatives clearing organization's or subpart C derivatives clearing organization's obligations under paragraph (a) of this section or § 39.11(a)(1).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Liquidity resources</E>—(1) <E T="03">Minimum amount of liquidity resources.</E> (i) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 39.11(e)(1)(ii), each systemically important derivatives clearing organization and subpart C derivatives clearing organization shall maintain eligible liquidity resources that, at a minimum, will enable it to meet its intraday, same-day, and multiday obligations to perform settlements, as defined in § 39.14(a)(1), with a high degree of confidence under a wide range of stress scenarios that should include, but not be limited to, a default by the clearing member creating the largest aggregate liquidity obligation for the systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization in extreme but plausible market conditions.</P>

            <P>(ii) A systemically important derivatives clearing organization and subpart C derivatives clearing organization that is subject to § 39.33(a)(1) shall <E T="03">consider</E> maintaining eligible liquidity resources that, at a minimum, will enable it to meet its intraday, same-day, and multiday obligations to perform settlements, as defined in § 39.14(a)(1), with a high degree of confidence under a wide range of stress scenarios that should include, but not be limited to, a default of the two clearing members creating the largest aggregate liquidity obligation for the systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization in extreme but plausible market conditions.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Satisfaction of settlement in all relevant currencies.</E> Each systemically important derivatives clearing organization and subpart C derivatives clearing organization shall maintain liquidity resources that are sufficient to satisfy the obligations required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section in all relevant currencies for which the systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization has obligations to perform settlements, as defined in § 39.14(a)(1), to its clearing members.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Qualifying liquidity resources.</E> (i) Only the following liquidity resources are eligible for the purpose of meeting the requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section:</P>
            <P>(A) Cash in the currency of the requisite obligations, held either at the central bank of issue or at a creditworthy commercial bank;</P>
            <P>(B) Committed lines of credit;</P>
            <P>(C) Committed foreign exchange swaps;</P>
            <P>(D) Committed repurchase agreements; or</P>
            <P>(E) (<E T="03">1</E>) Highly marketable collateral, including high quality, liquid, general obligations of a sovereign nation.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The assets described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(E)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section must be readily available and convertible into cash pursuant to prearranged and highly reliable funding arrangements, even in extreme but plausible market conditions.</P>
            <P>(ii) With respect to the arrangements described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization must take appropriate steps to verify that such arrangements do not include material adverse change conditions and are enforceable, and will be highly reliable, in extreme but plausible market conditions.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Additional liquidity resources.</E> If a systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization maintains financial resources in addition to those required to satisfy paragraph (c)(1) of this section, then those resources should be in the form of assets that are likely to be saleable with proceeds available promptly or acceptable as collateral for lines of credit, swaps, or repurchase agreements on an <E T="03">ad hoc</E> basis. A systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization <PRTPAGE P="837"/>should consider maintaining collateral with low credit, liquidity, and market risks that is typically accepted by a central bank of issue for any currency in which it may have settlement obligations, but shall not assume the availability of emergency central bank credit as a part of its liquidity plan.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Liquidity providers.</E> (1) For the purposes of this paragraph, a liquidity provider means:</P>
            <P>(i) A depository institution, a U.S. branch or agency of a foreign banking organization, a trust company, or a syndicate of depository institutions, U.S. branches or agencies of foreign banking organizations, or trust companies providing a line of credit, foreign exchange swap facility or repurchase facility to a systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization;</P>
            <P>(ii) Any other counterparty relied upon by a systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization to meet its minimum liquidity resources requirement under paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) In fulfilling its obligations under paragraph (c) of this section, each systemically important derivatives clearing organization and subpart C derivatives clearing organization shall undertake due diligence to confirm that each of its liquidity providers, whether or not such liquidity provider is a clearing member, has:</P>
            <P>(i) Sufficient information to understand and manage the liquidity provider's liquidity risks; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The capacity to perform as required under its commitments to provide liquidity to the systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization.</P>
            <P>(3) Where relevant to a liquidity provider's ability reliably to perform its commitments with respect to a particular currency, the systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization may take into account the liquidity provider's access to the central bank of issue of that currency.</P>
            <P>(4) Each systemically important derivatives clearing organization and subpart C derivatives clearing organization shall regularly test its procedures for accessing its liquidity resources under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, including testing its arrangements under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) and its relevant liquidity provider(s) under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Documentation of financial resources and liquidity resources.</E> Each systemically important derivatives clearing organization and subpart C derivatives clearing organization shall document its supporting rationale for, and have appropriate governance arrangements relating to, the amount of total financial resources it maintains pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section and the amount of total liquidity resources it maintains pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

            <P>(1) Physical and technological resources (including a secondary site), sufficient to enable the entity to meet the recovery time objective after interruption of normal clearing by a wide-scale disruption, must be located outside the relevant area of the physical and technological resources the systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization normally relies upon to conduct that activity, and must not rely on the same critical transportation, telecommunications, power, water, or other critical infrastructure components the entity normally relies upon for such activities;</P>
            <P>(2) Personnel, who live and work outside that relevant area, sufficient to enable the entity to meet the recovery time objective after interruption of normal clearing by a wide-scale disruption affecting the relevant area in which the personnel the entity normally relies upon to engage in such activities are located;</P>
            <P>(3) The provisions of § 39.18(d) shall apply to these resource requirements.</P>
            <P>(c) Each systemically important derivatives clearing organization and subpart C derivatives clearing organization must conduct regular, periodic tests of its business continuity and disaster recovery plans and resources and its capacity to achieve the required recovery time objective in the event of a wide-scale disruption. The provisions of § 39.18(e) shall apply to such testing.</P>
            <P>(d) The Commission may, upon request, grant an entity, which has been designated as a systemically important derivatives clearing organization or that has elected to become subject to subpart C, up to one year to comply with any provision of this section.</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Wind-down</E> means the actions of a systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization to effect the permanent cessation or sale or transfer or one or more services.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Recovery</E> means the actions of a systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization, consistent with its rules, procedures, and other <E T="03">ex</E>-<E T="03">ante</E> contractual arrangements, to address any uncovered credit loss, liquidity shortfall, capital inadequacy, or business, operational or other structural weakness, including the replenishment of any depleted pre-funded financial resources and liquidity arrangements, as necessary to maintain the systemically important derivatives clearing organization's or subpart C derivatives clearing organization's viability as a going concern.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Operational risk</E> means the risk that deficiencies in information systems or internal processes, human errors, management failures or disruptions from external events will result in the reduction, deterioration, or breakdown of services provided by a systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Unencumbered liquid financial assets</E> include cash and highly liquid securities.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Recovery and wind-down plan.</E> Each systemically important derivatives clearing organization and subpart C derivatives clearing organization shall maintain viable plans for:</P>

            <P>(c)(1) In developing the plans specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization shall identify scenarios that may potentially prevent it from being able to meet its obligations, provide its critical operations and services as a going concern and assess the effectiveness of a full range of options for recovery or orderly wind-down. The plans shall include procedures for informing the Commission, as soon as practicable, when the recovery plan is initiated or wind-down is pending.</P>

            <P>(2) Each systemically important derivatives clearing organization and subpart C derivatives clearing organization shall maintain sufficient unencumbered liquid financial assets, funded by the equity of its owners, to implement its recovery or wind-down plans pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In general, the financial resources required by § 39.11(a)(2) may be sufficient, but the systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization shall analyze its particular circumstances and risks and maintain any additional resources that may be necessary to implement the plans. In allocating sufficient financial resources to implement the plans, the systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization shall comply with § 39.11(e)(2). The plan shall include evidence and analysis to support the conclusion that the amount considered necessary is, in fact, sufficient to implement the plans.</P>
            <P>(3) Resources counted in meeting the requirements of §§ 39.11(a)(1) and 39.33 may not be allocated, in whole or in part, to the recovery plans required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Other resources may be allocated, in whole or in part, to the recovery plans required by either paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this section, but not both paragraphs, and only to the extent the use of such resources is not otherwise limited by the Act, Commission regulations, the systemically important derivatives clearing organization's or subpart C derivatives clearing organization's rules, or any contractual arrangements to which the systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization is a party.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Plan for raising additional financial resources.</E> All systemically important derivatives clearing organizations and subpart C derivatives clearing organizations shall maintain viable plans for raising additional financial resources, including, where appropriate, capital, in a scenario in which the systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization is unable, or virtually unable, to comply with any financial resources requirements set forth in this part. This plan shall be approved by the board of directors and be updated regularly.</P>
            <P>(f) The Commission may, upon request, grant an entity, which has been designated as a systemically important derivatives clearing organization or that has elected to become subject to subpart C, up to one year to comply with any provision of this section or of § 39.35.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Special certification procedures for submission of rules by systemically important derivatives clearing organizations.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Advance notice.</E> A registered derivatives clearing organization that has been designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council as a systemically important derivatives clearing organization shall provide notice to the Commission not less than 60 days in advance of any proposed change to its rules, procedures, or operations that could materially affect the nature or level of risks presented by the systemically important derivatives clearing organization. A notice submitted under this section shall be subject to the filing requirements of § 40.6(a)(1) and the Web site publication requirements of § 40.6(a)(2).</P>
          <P>(1) The notice of a proposed change shall provide the information required to be submitted under § 40.6(a)(7) and shall specifically describe:</P>
          <P>(i) The nature of the change and expected effects on risks to the systemically important derivatives clearing organization, its clearing members, or the market; and</P>
          <P>(ii) How the systemically important derivatives clearing organization plans to manage any identified risks.</P>

          <P>(2) Concurrent with providing the Commission with the advance notice or any request or other information related to the advance notice, the systemically important derivatives clearing organization shall provide the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System with a copy of such notice, request or other information in the same format and manner as required by the Board of Governors for those designated financial market utilities for which it is the Supervisory Agency pursuant to section 803(8) of <PRTPAGE P="886"/>the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.</P>
          <P>(3) The systemically important derivatives clearing organization may request that the Commission expedite the review on the grounds that the change would materially decrease risk. The Commission, in its discretion, may expedite the review and, pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, notify the systemically important derivatives clearing organization in less than 60 days from the date the Commission receives the notice of proposed change in writing that it does not object to the proposed change and authorizes implementation of the change on an earlier date.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Materiality.</E> The term “materially affect the nature or level of risks presented,” when used to qualify determinations on a change to rules, procedures, or operations of a systemically important derivatives clearing organization, means matters as to which there is a reasonable possibility that the change could affect the performance of essential clearing and settlement functions or the overall nature or level of risk presented by the systemically important derivatives clearing organization. Such changes may include, but are not limited to, changes that materially affect financial resources, participant and product eligibility, risk management (including matters relating to margin and stress testing), daily or intraday settlement procedures, default procedures, system safeguards (business continuity and disaster recovery), and governance. If a systemically important derivatives clearing organization determines that a proposed change is not material and therefore does not file an advance notice under this § 40.10, but the Commission determines that the change is material, the Commission may require the systemically important derivatives clearing organization to withdraw the proposed change and provide notice pursuant to this section.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Further information.</E> The Commission may require the systemically important derivatives clearing organization to provide any further information necessary to assess the effect the proposed change would have on the nature or level of risks associated with the systemically important derivatives clearing organization's payment, clearing, or settlement activities and the sufficiency of any proposed risk management techniques.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice of objection.</E> A systemically important derivatives clearing organization shall not implement a change to which the Commission has an objection on the grounds that the proposed change is not consistent with the Act or the Commission's regulations, or the purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act or any applicable rules, orders, or standards prescribed under Section 805(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Commission will notify the systemically important derivatives clearing organization in writing of any objection regarding the proposed change within 60 days from the later of:</P>
          <P>(1) The date that the notice of the proposed change was received; or</P>
          <P>(2) The date the Commission received any further information it had requested for consideration of the notice.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Implementation of change absent Commission objection.</E> A systemically important derivatives clearing organization may implement a change if it has not received an objection to the proposed change within 60 days from the later of:</P>
          <P>(1) The date that the Commission received the notice of proposed change; or</P>
          <P>(2) The date the Commission received any further information it had requested for consideration of the notice.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Extended review.</E> The Commission may, during the 60-day review period, extend the review period if the proposed change raises novel or complex issues. A notification by the Commission pursuant to this paragraph will extend the review for an additional 60 days. Any extension under this paragraph will extend the time periods under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section for an additional 60 days.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Change allowed earlier if notified of no objection.</E> A systemically important derivatives clearing organization may implement a change in less than 60 days from the date the Commission receives the notice of proposed change or the date the Commission receives any further information it has requested, if <PRTPAGE P="887"/>the Commission notifies the systemically important derivatives clearing organization in writing that it does not object to the proposed change and authorizes implementation of the change on an earlier date, subject to any conditions imposed by the Commission.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Emergency changes.</E> A systemically important derivatives clearing organization may implement a change that would otherwise require advance notice under this section if it determines that an emergency exists and immediate implementation of the change is necessary for the systemically important derivatives clearing organization to continue to provide its services in a safe and sound manner.</P>
          <P>(1) The systemically important derivatives clearing organization shall provide notice of any such emergency change to the Commission as soon as practicable, which shall be no later than 24 hours after implementation of the change.</P>
          <P>(2) The notice of an emergency change shall:</P>
          <P>(i) Provide the information required for advance notice as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section;</P>
          <P>(ii) Describe the nature of the emergency; and</P>
          <P>(iii) Describe the reason the change was necessary for the systemically important derivatives clearing organization to continue to provide its services in a safe and sound manner.</P>
          <P>(3) The Commission may require modification or rescission of the emergency change if it finds that the change is not consistent with the Act or the Commission's regulations, or the purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act or any applicable rules, orders, or standards prescribed under Section 805(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act.</P>

          <P>1. <E T="03">Identifier Code (optional)</E>—A registered entity Identifier Code at the top of the cover sheet, if applicable. Such codes are commonly generated by registered entities to provide an identifier that is unique to each filing (e.g., NYMEX Submission 03-116).</P>

          <P>3. <E T="03">Organization</E>—The name of the organization filing the submission (e.g., CBOT).</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Filing as a</E>—Check in the appropriate box indicating that the rule or product is being submitted by a designated contract market (DCM), derivatives clearing organization (DCO), swap execution facility (SEF), or swap data repository (SDR).</P>

          <P>(c) Checking the box marked “confidential treatment requested” on the Submission Cover Sheet does not obviate the submitter's responsibility to comply with all applicable requirements for requesting confidential treatment in § 40.8 and, where appropriate, § 145.9 of this chapter, and will not substitute for notice or full compliance with such requirements.</P>
