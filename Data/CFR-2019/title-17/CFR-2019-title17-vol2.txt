      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
        
        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
        There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

            § 41.11
            Method for determining market capitalization and dollar value of average daily trading volume; application of the definition of narrow-based security index.
            (a) Market capitalization. For purposes of section 1a(35)(B) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 1a(35)(B)):
            (1) On a particular day, a security shall be 1 of 750 securities with the largest market capitalization as of the preceding 6 full calendar months when it is included on a list of such securities designated by the Commission and the SEC as applicable for that day.
            (2) In the event that the Commission and the SEC have not designated a list under paragraph (a)(1) of this section:
            (i) The method to be used to determine market capitalization of a security as of the preceding 6 full calendar months is to sum the values of the market capitalization of such security for each U.S. trading day of the preceding 6 full calendar months, and to divide this sum by the total number of such trading days.
            (ii) The 750 securities with the largest market capitalization shall be identified from the universe of all NMS securities as defined in § 242.600 that are common stock or depositary shares.

            (i)(A) The method to be used to determine the dollar value of ADTV of a security is to sum the dollar value of ADTV of all reported transactions in such security in each jurisdiction as calculated pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section.
            (B) The dollar value of ADTV of a security shall include the value of all reported transactions for such security and for any depositary share that represents such security.
            (C) The dollar value of ADTV of a depositary share shall include the value of all reported transactions for such depositary share and for the security that is represented by such depositary share.
            (ii) For trading in a security in the United States, the method to be used to determine the dollar value of ADTV as of the preceding 6 full calendar months is to sum the value of all reported transactions in such security for each U.S. trading day during the preceding 6 full calendar months, and to divide this sum by the total number of such trading days.
            (iii)(A) For trading in a security in a jurisdiction other than the United States, the method to be used to determine the dollar value of ADTV as of the preceding 6 full calendar months is to sum the value in U.S. dollars of all reported transactions in such security in such jurisdiction for each trading day during the preceding 6 full calendar months, and to divide this sum by the total number of trading days in such jurisdiction during the preceding 6 full calendar months.
            (B) If the value of reported transactions used in calculating the ADTV of securities under paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) is reported in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the total value of each day's transactions in such currency shall be converted into U.S. dollars on the basis of a spot rate of exchange for that day obtained from at least one independent entity that provides or disseminates foreign exchange quotations in the ordinary course of its business.
            (iv) The dollar value of ADTV of the lowest weighted 25% of an index is the sum of the dollar value of ADTV of each of the component securities comprising the lowest weighted 25% of such index.
            (2) For purposes of section 1a(35)(B)(III)(cc) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 1a(35)(B)(III)(cc)):

            (ii) In the event that the Commission and the SEC have not designated a list under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section:
            (A) The method to be used to determine the dollar value of ADTV of a security as of the preceding 6 full calendar months is to sum the value of all reported transactions in such security in the United States for each U.S. trading day during the preceding 6 full calendar months, and to divide this sum by the total number of such trading days.
            (B) The 675 securities with the largest dollar value of ADTV shall be identified from the universe of all NMS securities as defined in § 242.600 that are common stock or depositary shares.

            (iii) If no reported transactions in a security or in a depositary share representing such security have taken place in the United States, the closing price of such security shall be the price at which the last transaction in such security took place in the regular trading session of the principal market for the security. If such price is reported in a currency other than U.S. dollars, such price shall be converted into U.S. dollars on the basis of a spot rate of exchange relevant for the time of the transaction obtained from at least one independent entity that provides or disseminates foreign exchange quotations in the ordinary course of its business.

            § 41.25
            Additional conditions for trading for security futures products.
            (a) Common provisions—(1) Reporting of data. The designated contract market shall comply with part 16 of this chapter requiring the daily reporting of market data.
            (2) Regulatory trading halts. The rules of a designated contract market that lists or trades one or more security futures products must include the following provisions:
            (i) Trading of a security futures product based on a single security shall be halted at all times that a regulatory halt has been instituted for the underlying security; and
            (ii) Trading of a security futures product based on a narrow-based security index shall be halted at all times that a regulatory halt has been instituted for one or more underlying securities that constitute 50 percent or more of the market capitalization of the narrow-based security index.
            (3) Speculative position limits. The designated contract market shall have rules in place establishing position limits or position accountability procedures for the expiring futures contract month. The designated contract market shall:
            (i) Adopt a net position limit no greater than 13,500 (100-share) contracts applicable to positions held during the last five trading days of an expiring contract month; except where,
            (A) For security futures products where the average daily trading volume in the underlying security exceeds 20 million shares, or exceeds 15 million shares and there are more than 40 million shares of the underlying security outstanding, the designated contract market may adopt a net position limit no greater than 22,500 (100-share) contracts applicable to positions held during the last five trading days of an expiring contract month; or
            (B) For security futures products where the average daily trading volume in the underlying security exceeds 20 million shares and there are more than 40 million shares of the underlying security outstanding, the designated contract market may adopt a position accountability rule. Upon request by the designated contract market, traders who hold net positions greater than 22,500 (100-share) contracts, or such lower level specified by exchange rules, must provide information to the exchange and consent to halt increasing their positions when so ordered by the exchange.

            (ii) For a security futures product comprised of more than one security, the criteria in paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(A) and (a)(3)(i)(B) of this section must apply to the security in the index with the lowest average daily trading volume.
            
            (iii) Exchanges may approve exemptions from these position limits pursuant to rules that are consistent with § 150.3 of this chapter.

            (iv) For purposes of this section, average daily trading volume shall be calculated monthly, using data for the most recent six-month period. If the data justify a higher or lower speculative limit for a security future, the designated contract market may raise or lower the position limit for that security future effective no earlier than the day after it has provided notification to the Commission and to the public under the submission requirements of § 41.24. If the data require imposition of a reduced position limit for a security future, the designated contract market may permit any trader holding a position in compliance with the previous position limit, but in excess of the reduced limit, to maintain such position through the expiration of the security futures contract; provided, that the designated contract market does not find that the position poses a threat to the orderly expiration of such contract.
            (b) Final settlement prices for security futures products. (1) The final settlement price of a cash-settled security futures product must fairly reflect the opening price of the underlying security or securities;
            (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if an opening price for one or more securities underlying a security futures product is not readily available, the final settlement price of the security futures product shall fairly reflect:
            (i) The price of the underlying security or securities during the most recent regular trading session for such security or securities; or
            (ii) The next available opening price of the underlying security or securities.
            (3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, if a derivatives clearing organization registered under Section 5b of the Act or a clearing agency exempt from registration pursuant to Section 5b(a)(2) of the Act, to which the final settlement price of a security futures product is or would be reported determines, pursuant to its rules, that such final settlement price is not consistent with the protection of customers and the public interest, taking into account such factors as fairness to buyers and sellers of the affected security futures product, the maintenance of a fair and orderly market in such security futures product, and consistency of interpretation and practice, the clearing organization shall have the authority to determine, under its rules, a final settlement price for such security futures product.
            (c) Special requirements for physical delivery contracts. For security futures products settled by actual delivery of the underlying security or securities, payment and delivery of the underlying security or securities must be effected through a clearing agency that is registered pursuant to section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
            (d) The Commission may exempt a designated contract market from the provisions of paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) of this section, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, if the Commission determines that such exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of customers. An exemption granted pursuant to this paragraph shall not operate as an exemption from any Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Any exemption that may be required from such rules must be obtained separately from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

            § 41.27
            Prohibition of dual trading in security futures products by floor brokers.
            (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
            (1) Trading session means hours during which a designated contract market is scheduled to trade continuously during a trading day, as set forth in its rules, including any related post settlement trading session. A designated contract market may have more than one trading session during a trading day.
            (2) Member shall have the meaning set forth in section 1a(24) of the Act.

            (3) Broker association includes two or more designated contract market members with floor trading privileges of whom at least one is acting as a floor broker who:
            (i) Engage in floor brokerage activity on behalf of the same employer;
            (ii) Have an employer and employee relationship which relates to floor brokerage activity;
            (iii) Share profits and losses associated with their brokerage or trading activity; or
            (iv) Regularly share a deck of orders.
            (4) Customer means an account owner for which a trade is executed other than:
            (i) An account in which such floor broker has any interest;
            (ii) An account for which a floor broker has discretion;
            (iii) An account controlled by a person with whom a floor broker has a relationship through membership in a broker association;
            (iv) A house account of the floor broker's clearing member; or
            (v) An account for another member present on the floor of a designated contract market or an account controlled by such other member.
            (5) Dual trading means the execution of customer orders by a floor broker through open outcry during the same trading session in which the floor broker executes directly or by initiating and passing to another member, either through open outcry or through a trading system that electronically matches bids and offers pursuant to a predetermined algorithm, a transaction for the same security futures product on the same designated contract market for an account described in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (v) of this section.
            (b) Dual trading prohibition. (1) No floor broker shall engage in dual trading in a security futures product on a designated contract market, except as otherwise provided under paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section.
            (2) A designated contract market operating an electronic market or electronic trading system that provides market participants with a time or place advantage or the ability to override a predetermined algorithm must submit an appropriate rule proposal to the Commission consistent with the procedures set forth in § 40.5. The proposed rule must prohibit electronic market participants with a time or place advantage or the ability to override a predetermined algorithm from trading a security futures product for accounts in which these same participants have any interest during the same trading session that they also trade the same security futures product for other accounts. This paragraph, however, is not applicable with respect to execution priorities or quantity guarantees granted to market makers who perform that function, or to market participants who receive execution priorities based on price improvement activity, in accordance with the rules governing the designated contract market.
            (c) Rules prohibiting dual trading—(1) Designated contract markets. Prior to listing a security futures product for trading on a trading floor where bids and offers are executed through open outcry, a designated contract market:
            (i) Must submit to the Commission in accordance with § 40.6, a rule prohibiting dual trading, together with a written certification that the rule complies with the Act and the regulations thereunder, including this section; or
            (ii) Must obtain Commission approval of such rule pursuant to § 40.5.
            (2) [Reserved]
            (d) Specific permitted exceptions. Notwithstanding the applicability of a dual trading prohibition under paragraph (b) of this section, dual trading may be permitted on a designated contract market pursuant to one or more of the following specific exceptions:
            (1) Correction of errors. To offset trading errors resulting from the execution of customer orders, provided, that the floor broker must liquidate the position in his or her personal error account resulting from that error through open outcry or through a trading system that electronically matches bids and offers as soon as practicable, but, except as provided herein, not later than the close of business on the business day following the discovery of error. In the event that a floor broker is unable to offset the error trade because the daily price fluctuation limit is reached, a trading halt is imposed by the designated contract market, or an emergency is declared pursuant to the rules of the designated contract market, the floor broker must liquidate the position in his or her personal error account resulting from that error as soon as practicable thereafter.
            (2) Customer consent. To permit a customer to designate in writing not less than once annually a specifically identified floor broker to dual trade while executing orders for such customer's account. An account controller acting pursuant to a power of attorney may designate a dual trading broker on behalf of its customer, provided, that the customer explicitly grants in writing to the individual account controller the authority to select a dual trading broker.
            (3) Spread transactions. To permit a broker who unsuccessfully attempts to leg into a spread transaction for a customer to take the executed leg into his or her personal account and to offset such position, provided, that a record is prepared and maintained to demonstrate that the customer order was for a spread.
            (4) Market emergencies. To address emergency market conditions resulting in a temporary emergency action as determined by a designated contract market.
            (e) Rules permitting specific exceptions—(1) Designated contract markets. Prior to permitting dual trading under any of the exceptions provided in paragraphs (d)(1)-(4) of this section, a designated contract market:
            (i) Must submit to the Commission in accordance with § 40.6, a rule permitting the exception(s), together with a written certification that the rule complies with the Act and the regulations thereunder, including this section; or
            (ii) Must obtain Commission approval of such rule pursuant to § 40.5.
            (2) [Reserved]
            (f) Unique or special characteristics of agreements, contracts or transactions, or of designated contract markets. Notwithstanding the applicability of a dual trading prohibition under paragraph (b) of this section, dual trading may be permitted on a designated contract market to address unique or special characteristics of agreements, contracts, or transactions, or of the designated contract market as provided herein. Any rule of a designated contract market that would permit dual trading when it would otherwise be prohibited, based on a unique or special characteristic of agreements, contracts, or transactions, or of the designated contract market must be submitted to the Commission for prior approval under the procedures set forth in § 40.5. The rule submission must include a detailed demonstration of why an exception is warranted.

            § 41.41
            Security futures products accounts.
            (a) Where security futures products may be held. (1) A person registered with the Commission as a futures commission merchant pursuant to section 4f(a)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”) and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) as a broker or dealer pursuant to section 15(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Securities Exchange Act”) (“Full FCM/Full BD”) may hold all of a customer's security futures products in a futures account, all of a customer's security futures products in a securities account, or some of a customer's security futures products in a futures account and other security futures products of the same customer in a securities account. A person registered with the Commission as a futures commission merchant pursuant to section 4f(a)(2) of the CEA (a notice-registered FCM) may hold a customer's security futures products only in a securities account. A person registered with the SEC as a broker or dealer pursuant to section 15(b)(11) of the Securities Exchange Act (a notice-registered broker-dealer) may hold a customer's security futures products only in a futures account.
            (2) A Full FCM/Full BD shall establish written policies or procedures for determining whether customer security futures products will be placed in a futures account and/or a securities account and, if applicable, the process by which a customer may elect the type or types of account in which security futures products will be held (including the procedure to be followed if a customer fails to make an election of account type).
            (b) Disclosure requirements. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2), before a futures commission merchant accepts the first order for a security futures product from or on behalf of a customer, the firm shall furnish the customer with a disclosure document containing the following information:
            (i) A description of the protections provided by the requirements set forth under section 4d of the CEA applicable to a futures account;
            (ii) A description of the protections provided by the requirements set forth under Securities Exchange Act Rule 15c3-3 and the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 applicable to a securities account;
            (iii) A statement indicating whether the customer's security futures products will be held in a futures account and/or a securities account, or whether the firm permits customers to make or change an election of account type; and
            (iv) A statement that, with respect to holding the customer's security futures products in a securities account or a futures account, the alternative regulatory scheme is not available to the customer in connection with that account.

            (2) Where a customer account containing an open security futures product position is transferred to a futures commission merchant, that futures commission merchant may instead provide the statements described in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) and (b)(1)(iv) above no later than ten business days after the date the account is transferred.
            
            (c) Changes in account type. A Full FCM/Full BD may change the type of account in which a customer's security futures products will be held; provided, that:
            (1) The firm creates a record of each change in account type, including the name of the customer, the account number, the date the firm received the customer's request to change the account type, if applicable, and the date the change in account type became effective; and
            (2) The firm, at least ten business days before the customer's account type is changed:
            (i) Notifies the customer in writing of the date that the change will become effective; and
            (ii) Provides the customer with the disclosures described in paragraph (b)(1) above.
            (d) Recordkeeping requirements. The Commission's recordkeeping rules set forth in §§ 1.31, 1.32, 1.35, 1.36, 1.37, 4.23, 4.33, 18.05 and 190.06 of this chapter shall apply to security futures product transactions and positions in a futures account (as that term is defined in § 1.3 of this chapter). These rules shall not apply to security futures product transactions and positions in a securities account (as that term is defined in § 1.3 of this chapter); provided, that the SEC's recordkeeping rules apply to those transactions and positions.
            (e) Reports to customers. The Commission's reporting requirements set forth in §§ 1.33 and 1.46 of this chapter shall apply to security futures product transactions and positions in a futures account (as that term is defined in § 1.3 of this chapter). These rules shall not apply to security futures product transactions and positions in a securities account (as that term is defined in § 1.3 of this chapter); provided, that the SEC's rules set forth in §§ 240.10b-10 and 240.15c3-2 of this chapter regarding delivery of confirmations and account statements apply to those transactions and positions.
            (f) Segregation of customer funds. All money, securities, or property held to margin, guarantee or secure security futures products held in a futures account, or accruing to customers as a result of such products, are subject to the segregation requirements of section 4d of the CEA and the rules thereunder.

            (2) This Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49) does not apply to:
            
            (i) Financial relations between a customer and a security futures intermediary to the extent that they comply with a portfolio margining system under rules that meet the criteria set forth in section 7(c)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and that are effective in accordance with section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and, as applicable, section 5c(c) of the Act;
            (ii) Financial relations between a security futures intermediary and a foreign person involving security futures traded on or subject to the rules of a foreign board of trade;
            (iii) Margin requirements that clearing agencies registered under section 17A of the Exchange Act or derivatives clearing organizations registered under section 5b of the Act impose on their members;
            (iv) Financial relations between a security futures intermediary and a person based on a good faith determination by the security futures intermediary that such person is an exempted person; and

            (A) Is a member of a national securities exchange or national securities association registered pursuant to section 15A(a) of the Exchange Act; and
            (B) Is registered with such exchange or such association as a security futures dealer pursuant to rules that are effective in accordance with section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and, as applicable, section 5c(c) of the Act, that:
            (1) Require such member to be registered as a floor trader or a floor broker with the Commission under section 4f(a)(1) of the Act, or as a dealer with the SEC under section 15(b) of the Exchange Act;
            (2) Require such member to maintain records sufficient to prove compliance with this paragraph (c)(2)(v) and the rules of the exchange or association of which it is a member;
            (3) Require such member to hold itself out as being willing to buy and sell security futures for its own account on a regular or continuous basis; and
            (4) Provide for disciplinary action, including revocation of such member's registration as a security futures dealer, for such member's failure to comply with this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49) or the rules of the exchange or association.
            (d) Exemption. The Commission may exempt, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, financial relations involving any security futures intermediary, customer, position, or transaction, or any class of security futures intermediaries, customers, positions, or transactions, from one or more requirements of this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49), if the Commission determines that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of customers. An exemption granted pursuant to this paragraph shall not operate as an exemption from any SEC rules. Any exemption that may be required from such rules must be obtained separately from the SEC.

            (c) Terms used in this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49) and not otherwise defined in this section or in the margin rules applicable to the account shall have the meaning set forth in the Exchange Act and the Act; if the definitions of a term in the Exchange Act and the Act are inconsistent as applied in particular circumstances, such term shall have the meaning set forth in rules, regulations, or interpretations jointly promulgated by the SEC and the Commission.
            [67 FR 53171, Aug. 14, 2002, as amended at 77 FR 66346, Nov. 2, 2012; 83 FR 7997, Feb. 23, 2018]
          
          
            § 41.44
            General provisions.
            (a) Applicable margin rules. Except to the extent inconsistent with this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49):
            (1) A security futures intermediary that carries a security future on behalf of a customer in a securities account shall record and conduct all financial relations with respect to such security future and related positions in accordance with Regulation T and the margin rules of the self-regulatory authorities of which the security futures intermediary is a member.
            (2) A security futures intermediary that carries a security future on behalf of a customer in a futures account shall record and conduct all financial relations with respect to such security future and related positions in accordance with the margin rules of the self-regulatory authorities of which the security futures intermediary is a member.
            (b) Separation and consolidation of accounts. (1) The requirements for security futures and related positions in one account may not be met by considering items in any other account, except as permitted or required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section or applicable margin rules. If withdrawals of cash, securities or other assets deposited as margin are permitted under this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49), bookkeeping entries shall be made when such cash, securities, or assets are used for purposes of meeting requirements in another account.

            (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the security futures intermediary shall consider all futures accounts in which security futures and related positions are held that are within the same regulatory classification or account type and are owned by the same customer to be a single account for purposes of this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49). The security futures intermediary may combine such accounts with other futures accounts that are within the same regulatory classification or account type and are owned by the same customer for purposes of computing a customer's overall margin requirement, as permitted or required by applicable margin rules.
            (c) Accounts of partners. If a partner of the security futures intermediary has an account with the security futures intermediary in which security futures or related positions are held, the security futures intermediary shall disregard the partner's financial relations with the firm (as shown in the partner's capital and ordinary drawing accounts) in calculating the margin or equity of any such account.
            (d) Contribution to joint venture. If an account in which security futures or related positions are held is the account of a joint venture in which the security futures intermediary participates, any interest of the security futures intermediary in the joint account in excess of the interest which the security futures intermediary would have on the basis of its right to share in the profits shall be margined in accordance with this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49).
            (e) Extensions of credit. (1) No security futures intermediary may extend or maintain credit to or for any customer for the purpose of evading or circumventing any requirement under this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49).
            (2) A security futures intermediary may arrange for the extension or maintenance of credit to or for any customer by any person, provided that the security futures intermediary does not willfully arrange credit that would constitute a violation of Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR parts 220, 221, and 224) by such person.
            (f) Change in exempted person status. Once a person ceases to qualify as an exempted person, it shall notify the security futures intermediary of this fact before entering into any new security futures transaction or related transaction that would require additional margin to be deposited under this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49). Financial relations with respect to any such transactions shall be subject to the provisions of this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49).
          
          
            § 41.45
            Required margin.
            (a) Applicability. Each security futures intermediary shall determine the required margin for the security futures and related positions held on behalf of a customer in a securities account or futures account as set forth in this section.
            (b) Required margin—(1) General rule. The required margin for each long or short position in a security future shall be twenty (20) percent of the current market value of such security future.
            (2) Offsetting positions. Notwithstanding the margin levels specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a self-regulatory authority may set the required initial or maintenance margin level for an offsetting position involving security futures and related positions at a level lower than the level that would be required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if such positions were margined separately, pursuant to rules that meet the criteria set forth in section 7(c)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and are effective in accordance with section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and, as applicable, section 5c(c) of the Act.
            (c) Procedures for certain margin level adjustments. An exchange registered under section 6(g) of the Exchange Act, or a national securities association registered under section 15A(k) of the Exchange Act, may raise or lower the required margin level for a security future to a level not lower than that specified in this section, in accordance with section 19(b)(7) of the Exchange Act.
          
          
            § 41.46
            Type, form and use of margin.
            (a) When margin is required. Margin is required to be deposited whenever the required margin for security futures and related positions in an account is not satisfied by the equity in the account, subject to adjustment under paragraph (c) of this section.
            (b) Acceptable margin deposits. (1) The required margin may be satisfied by a deposit of cash, margin securities (subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section), exempted securities, any other asset permitted under Regulation T to satisfy a margin deficiency in a securities margin account, or any combination thereof, each as valued in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

            (2) Shares of a money market mutual fund may be accepted as a margin deposit for purposes of this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49), Provided that:
            
            (i) The customer waives any right to redeem the shares without the consent of the security futures intermediary and instructs the fund or its transfer agent accordingly;
            (ii) The security futures intermediary (or clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization with which the shares are deposited as margin) obtains the right to redeem the shares in cash, promptly upon request; and
            (iii) The fund agrees to satisfy any conditions necessary or appropriate to ensure that the shares may be redeemed in cash, promptly upon request.
            (c) Adjustments—(1) Futures accounts. For purposes of this section, the equity in a futures account shall be computed in accordance with the margin rules applicable to the account, subject to the following:
            (i) A security future shall have no value;
            (ii) Each net long or short position in a listed option on a contract for future delivery shall be valued in accordance with the margin rules applicable to the account;
            (iii) Except as permitted in paragraph (e) of this section, each margin equity security shall be valued at an amount no greater than its Regulation T collateral value;
            (iv) Each other security shall be valued at an amount no greater than its current market value reduced by the percentage specified for such security in § 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi) of this title;
            (v) Freely convertible foreign currency may be valued at an amount no greater than its daily marked-to-market U.S. dollar equivalent;
            (vi) Variation settlement receivable (or payable) by an account at the close of trading on any day shall be treated as a credit (or debit) to the account on that day; and
            (vii) Each other acceptable margin deposit or component of equity shall be valued at an amount no greater than its value under Regulation T.
            (2) Securities accounts. For purposes of this section, the equity in a securities account shall be computed in accordance with the margin rules applicable to the account, subject to the following:
            (i) A security future shall have no value;
            (ii) Freely convertible foreign currency may be valued at an amount no greater than its daily mark-to-market U.S. dollar equivalent; and
            (iii) Variation settlement receivable (or payable) by an account at the close of trading on any day shall be treated as a credit (or debit) to the account on that day.
            (d) Satisfaction restriction. Any transaction, position or deposit that is used to satisfy the required margin for security futures or related positions under this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49), including a related position, shall be unavailable to satisfy the required margin for any other position or transaction or any other requirement.
            (e) Alternative collateral valuation for margin equity securities in a futures account. (1) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, a security futures intermediary need not value a margin equity security at its Regulation T collateral value when determining whether the required margin for the security futures and related positions in a futures account is satisfied, provided that:
            
            (i) The margin equity security is valued at an amount no greater than the current market value of the security reduced by the lowest percentage level of margin required for a long position in the security held in a margin account under the rules of a national securities exchange registered pursuant to section 6(a) of the Exchange Act;

            (ii) Additional margin is required to be deposited on any day when the day's security futures transactions and related transactions would create or increase a margin deficiency in the account if the margin equity securities were valued at their Regulation T collateral value, and shall be for the amount of the margin deficiency so created or increased (a “special margin requirement”); and
            (iii) Cash, securities, or other assets deposited as margin for the positions in an account are not permitted to be withdrawn from the account at any time that:
            (A) Additional cash, securities, or other assets are required to be deposited as margin under this section for a transaction in the account on the same or a previous day; or
            (B) The withdrawal, together with other transactions, deposits, and withdrawals on the same day, would create or increase a margin deficiency if the margin equity securities were valued at their Regulation T collateral value.
            (2) All security futures transactions and related transactions on any day shall be combined to determine the amount of a special margin requirement. Additional margin deposited to satisfy a special margin requirement shall be valued at an amount no greater than its Regulation T collateral value.
            (3) If the alternative collateral valuation method set forth in paragraph (e) of this section is used with respect to an account in which security futures or related positions are carried:
            (i) An account that is transferred from one security futures intermediary to another may be treated as if it had been maintained by the transferee from the date of its origin, if the transferee accepts, in good faith, a signed statement of the transferor (or, if that is not practicable, of the customer), that any margin call issued under this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49) has been satisfied; and
            (ii) An account that is transferred from one customer to another as part of a transaction, not undertaken to avoid the requirements of this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49), may be treated as if it had been maintained for the transferee from the date of its origin, if the security futures intermediary accepts in good faith and keeps with the transferee account a signed statement of the transferor describing the circumstances for the transfer.
            (f) Guarantee of accounts. No guarantee of a customer's account shall be given any effect for purposes of determining whether the required margin in an account is satisfied, except as permitted under applicable margin rules.
          
          
            § 41.47
            Withdrawal of margin.
            (a) By the customer. Except as otherwise provided in § 41.46(e)(1)(ii) of this subpart, cash, securities, or other assets deposited as margin for positions in an account may be withdrawn, provided that the equity in the account after such withdrawal is sufficient to satisfy the required margin for the security futures and related positions in the account under this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49).
            (b) By the security futures intermediary. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the security futures intermediary, in its usual practice, may deduct the following items from an account in which security futures or related positions are held if they are considered in computing the balance of such account:
            (1) Variation settlement payable, directly or indirectly, to a clearing agency that is registered under section 17A of the Exchange Act or a derivatives clearing organization that is registered under section 5b of the Act;
            (2) Interest charged on credit maintained in the account;
            (3) Communication or shipping charges with respect to transactions in the account;
            (4) Payment of commissions, brokerage, taxes, storage and other charges lawfully accruing in connection with the positions and transactions in the account;
            (5) Any service charges that the security futures intermediary may impose; or
            (6) Any other withdrawals that are permitted from a securities margin account under Regulation T, to the extent permitted under applicable margin rules.
          
          
            § 41.48
            Undermargined accounts.
            (a) Failure to satisfy margin call. If any margin call required by this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49) is not met in full, the security futures intermediary shall take the deduction required with respect to an undermargined account in computing its net capital under SEC or Commission rules.
            (b) Accounts that liquidate to a deficit. If at any time there is a liquidating deficit in an account in which security futures are held, the security futures intermediary shall take steps to liquidate positions in the account promptly and in an orderly manner.
            (c) Liquidation of undermargined accounts not required. Notwithstanding § 41.44(a)(1) of this subpart, § 220.4(d) of Regulation T (12 CFR 220.4(d)) respecting liquidation of positions in lieu of deposit shall not apply with respect to security futures carried in a securities account.
          
          
            § 41.49
            Filing proposed margin rule changes with the Commission.
            (a) Notification requirement for notice-designated contract markets. Any self-regulatory authority that is registered with the Commission as a designated contract market under section 5f of the Act shall, when filing a proposed rule change regarding customer margin for security futures with the SEC for approval in accordance with section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act, concurrently provide to the Commission a copy of such proposed rule change and any accompanying documentation filed with the SEC.
            (b) Filing requirements under the Act. Any self-regulatory authority that is registered with the Commission as a designated contract market under section 5 of the Act shall, when filing a proposed rule change regarding customer margin for security futures with the SEC for approval in accordance with section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act, submit such proposed rule change to the Commission as follows:
            (1) If the self-regulatory authority elects to request the Commission's prior approval for the proposed rule change pursuant to section 5c(c)(2) of the Act, it shall concurrently file the proposed rule change with the Commission in accordance with § 40.5 of this chapter.
            (2) If the self-regulatory authority elects to implement a proposed rule change by written certification pursuant to section 5c(c)(1) of the Act, it shall concurrently provide to the Commission a copy of the proposed rule change and any accompanying documentation filed with the SEC. Promptly after obtaining SEC approval for the proposed rule change, such self-regulatory authority shall file its written certification with the Commission in accordance with § 40.6 of this chapter.

          § 43.1
          Purpose, scope, and rules of construction.
          (a) Purpose. This part implements rules relating to the reporting and public dissemination of certain swap transaction and pricing data to enhance transparency and price discovery pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, Pub. L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010).
          (b)(1) Scope. The provisions of this part shall apply to all swaps as defined in Section 1a(47) of the Act and any implementing regulations thereunder, including:
          (i) Swaps subject to the mandatory clearing requirement described in Section 2(h)(1) of the Act, including those swaps that are excepted from the requirement pursuant to Section 2(h)(7) of the Act;
          (ii) Swaps that are not subject to the mandatory clearing requirement described in Section 2(h)(1) of the Act, but are cleared at a registered derivatives clearing organization;
          (iii) Swaps that are not cleared at a registered derivatives clearing organization and are reported to a registered swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time; and
          (iv) Swaps that are required to be cleared under Section 2(h)(2) of the Act, but are not cleared.
          (2) This part also shall apply to registered entities as defined in the Act, as well as to parties to a swap including swap dealers, major swap participants and U.S.-based market participants in a manner as the Commission may determine.
          (c) Rules of construction. The examples in this part and in appendix A to this part are not exclusive. Compliance with a particular example or application of a sample clause, to the extent applicable, shall constitute compliance with the particular portion of the rule to which the example relates.
          (d) Severability. If any provision of this part, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or application of such provision to other persons or circumstances which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.
        
        
          § 43.2
          Definitions.
          As used in this part:
          
            Act means the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.
          
          
            Affirmation means the process by which parties to a swap verify (orally, in writing, electronically or otherwise) that they agree on the primary economic terms of a swap (but not necessarily all terms of the swap). Affirmation may constitute “execution” of the swap or may provide evidence of execution of the swap, but does not constitute confirmation (or confirmation by affirmation) of the swap.
          
            Appropriate minimum block size means the minimum notional or principal amount for a category of swaps that qualifies a swap within such category as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap.
          
            As soon as technologically practicable means as soon as possible, taking into consideration the prevalence, implementation and use of technology by comparable market participants.
          
          
            Asset class means a broad category of commodities including, without limitation, any “excluded commodity” as defined in Section 1a(19) of the Act, with common characteristics underlying a swap. The asset classes include interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity, other commodity and such other asset classes as may be determined by the Commission.
          
            Block trade means a publicly reportable swap transaction that:
          (1) Involves a swap that is listed on a registered swap execution facility or designated contract market;
          (2) Occurs away from the registered swap execution facility's or designated contract market's trading system or platform and is executed pursuant to the registered swap execution facility's or designated contract market's rules and procedures;
          (3) Has a notional or principal amount at or above the appropriate minimum block size applicable to such swap; and
          (4) Is reported subject to the rules and procedures of the registered swap execution facility or designated contract market and the rules described in this part, including the appropriate time delay requirements set forth in § 43.5 of this part.
          
            Business day means the twenty-four hour day, on all days except Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, in the location of the reporting party or registered entity reporting data for the swap.
          
            Business hours means the consecutive hours of one or more consecutive business days.
          
            Cap size means, for each swap category, the maximum notional or principal amount of a publicly reportable swap transaction that is publicly disseminated.
          
            Confirmation means the consummation (electronic or otherwise) of legally binding documentation (electronic or otherwise) that memorializes the agreement of the parties to all terms of a swap. A confirmation shall be in writing (electronic or otherwise) and shall legally supersede any previous agreement (electronic or otherwise) relating to the swap.
          
            Confirmation by affirmation means the process by which one party to a swap acknowledges its assent to the complete swap terms submitted by the other party to the swap.

The transferee accepts all of the transferor's rights, liabilities, duties and obligations under the swap. A novation is valid as long as the transferor and the remaining party to the swap are given notice, and the transferor, transferee and remaining party to the swap consent to the transfer.
          
            Off-facility swap means any publicly reportable swap transaction that is not executed on or pursuant to the rules of a registered swap execution facility or designated contract market.

          (ii) Portfolio compression exercises.
          (3) These examples represent swaps that are not at arm's length and thus are not publicly reportable swap transactions, notwithstanding that they do result in a corresponding change in the market risk position between two parties.
          
            Real-time public reporting means the reporting of data relating to a swap transaction, including price and volume, as soon as technologically practicable after the time at which the swap transaction has been executed.

          § 43.3
          Method and timing for real-time public reporting.
          (a) Responsibilities of parties to a swap to report swap transaction and pricing data in real-time—(1) In general. A reporting party shall report any publicly reportable swap transaction to a registered swap data repository as soon as technologically practicable after such publicly reportable swap transaction is executed. For purposes of this part, a registered swap data repository includes any swap data repository provisionally registered with the Commission pursuant to part 49 of this chapter.
          (2) Swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of a registered swap execution facility or designated contract market. A party to a publicly reportable swap transaction shall satisfy its reporting requirement under this section by executing a publicly reportable swap transaction on or pursuant to the rules of a registered swap execution facility or designated contract market.
          (3) Off-facility swaps. All off-facility swaps shall be reported by the reporting party as soon as technologically practicable following execution, to a registered swap data repository for the appropriate asset class in accordance with the rules set forth in this part. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties prior to the execution of the publicly reportable swap transaction, the following persons shall be reporting parties for off-facility swaps:
          (i) If only one party is a swap dealer or major swap participant, then the swap dealer or major swap participant shall be the reporting party;
          (ii) If one party is a swap dealer and the other party is a major swap participant, then the swap dealer shall be the reporting party;
          (iii) If both parties are swap dealers, then the swap dealers shall designate which party shall be the reporting party;
          (iv) If both parties are major swap participants, then the major swap participants shall designate which party shall be the reporting party;
          (v) If neither party is a swap dealer or a major swap participant, then the parties shall designate which party (or its agent) shall be the reporting party.
          (b) Public dissemination of swap transaction and pricing data—(1) Publicly reportable swap transactions executed on or pursuant to the rules of a registered swap execution facility or designated contract market. A registered swap execution facility or designated contract market shall satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph by transmitting swap transaction and pricing data to a registered swap data repository, as soon as technologically practicable after the publicly reportable swap transaction has been executed on or pursuant to the rules of such trading platform or facility.
          (2) Public dissemination of swap transaction and pricing data by registered swap data repositories. A registered swap data repository shall ensure that swap transaction and pricing data is publicly disseminated, as soon as technologically practicable after such data is received from a registered swap execution facility, designated contract market or reporting party, unless such publicly reportable swap transaction is subject to a time delay described in § 43.5 of this part, in which case the publicly reportable swap transaction shall be publicly disseminated in the manner described in § 43.5.
          (3) Prohibitions on disclosure of data. (i) If there is a registered swap data repository for an asset class, a registered swap execution facility or designated contract market shall not disclose swap transaction and pricing data relating to publicly reportable swap transactions in such asset class, prior to the public dissemination of such data by a registered swap data repository unless:

          (A) Such disclosure is made no earlier than the transmittal of such data to a registered swap data repository for public dissemination;
          
          (B) Such disclosure is only made to market participants on such registered swap execution facility or designated contract market;
          (C) Market participants are provided advance notice of such disclosure; and
          (D) Any such disclosure by the registered swap execution facility or designated contract market is non-discriminatory.
          (ii) If there is a registered swap data repository for an asset class, a swap dealer or major swap participant shall not disclose swap transaction and pricing data relating to publicly reportable swap transactions in such asset class, prior to the public dissemination of such data by a registered swap data repository unless:
          (A) Such disclosure is made no earlier than the transmittal of such data to a registered swap data repository for public dissemination;
          (B) Such disclosure is only made to the customer base of such swap dealer or major swap participant, including parties who maintain accounts with or have been swap counterparties with such swap dealer or major swap participant;
          (C) Swap counterparties are provided advance notice of such disclosure; and
          (D) Any such disclosure by the swap dealer or major swap participant is non-discriminatory.
          (c) Requirements for registered swap data repositories in providing the public dissemination of swap transaction and pricing data in real-time—(1) Compliance with 17 CFR part 49. Any registered swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time shall comply with part 49 of this chapter and shall publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data in accordance with this part as soon as technologically practicable upon receipt of such data, except as otherwise provided in this part.
          (2) Acceptance and public dissemination of all swaps in an asset class. Any registered swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time for swaps in its selected asset class shall accept and publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data in real-time for all publicly reportable swap transactions within such asset class, unless otherwise prescribed by the Commission.
          (3) Annual independent review. Any registered swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time shall perform, on an annual basis, an independent review in accordance with established audit procedures and standards of the registered swap data repository's security and other system controls for the purposes of ensuring compliance with the requirements in this part.
          (d) Availability of swap transaction and pricing data to the public. (1) Registered swap data repositories shall publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data in a consistent, usable and machine-readable electronic format that allows the data to be downloaded, saved and analyzed.
          (2) Data that is publicly disseminated pursuant to this part shall be available from an Internet Web site in a format that is freely available and readily accessible to the public.
          (3) Registered swap data repositories shall provide to the Commission a hyperlink to the Internet Web site where publicly disseminated swap transaction and pricing data can be accessed by the public.
          (e) Errors or omissions—(1) In general. Any errors or omissions in swap transaction and pricing data that were publicly disseminated in real-time shall be corrected or cancelled in the following manner:
          (i) If a party to the swap becomes aware of an error or omission in the swap transaction and pricing data reported with respect to such swap, such party shall promptly notify the other party of the error and/or correction.

          (ii) If a reporting party to a swap becomes aware of an error or omission in the swap transaction or pricing data which it reported to a registered swap data repository or which was reported by a registered swap execution facility or designated contract market with respect to such swap, either through its own initiative or through notice by the other party to the swap, the reporting party shall promptly submit corrected data to the same registered swap execution facility, designated contract market or registered swap data repository.
          (iii) If the registered swap execution facility or designated contract market becomes aware of an error or omission in the swap transaction or pricing data reported with respect to such swap, or receives notification from the reporting party, the registered swap execution facility or designated contract market shall promptly submit corrected data to the same registered swap data repository.
          (iv) Any registered swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time shall publicly disseminate any cancellations or corrections to such data, as soon as technologically practicable after receipt or discovery of any such cancellation or correction.
          (2) Improper cancellation or correction. Reporting parties, registered swap execution facilities, designated contract markets and registered swap data repositories shall not submit or agree to submit a cancellation or correction for the purpose of re-reporting swap transaction and pricing data in order to gain or extend a delay in public dissemination of accurate swap transaction or pricing data or to otherwise evade the reporting requirements in this part.
          (3) Cancellation. A registered swap data repository shall cancel any incorrect data that had been publicly disseminated by publicly disseminating a cancellation of such data, as soon as technologically practicable, in the manner described in appendix A to this part.
          (4) Correction. A registered swap data repository shall correct any incorrect data that had been publicly disseminated by publicly disseminating a cancellation of the incorrect swap transaction and pricing data and then publicly disseminating the correct data, as soon as technologically practicable, in the manner described in appendix A to this part.
          (f) Hours of operation of registered swap data repositories. Unless otherwise provided in this subsection, a registered swap data repository shall have systems in place to continuously receive and publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data in real-time pursuant to this part.
          (1) A registered swap data repository may declare closing hours to perform system maintenance.
          (2) A registered swap data repository shall, to the extent reasonably possible, avoid scheduling closing hours when, in its estimation, the U.S. market and major foreign markets are most active.
          (3) A registered swap data repository shall comply with the requirements under part 40 of this chapter in setting closing hours and shall provide advance notice of its closing hours to market participants and the public.
          (g) Acceptance of data during closing hours. During closing hours, a registered swap data repository shall have the capability to receive and hold in queue any data regarding publicly reportable swap transactions pursuant to this part.
          (1) Upon any reopening after closing hours, a registered swap data repository shall promptly and publicly disseminate the swap transaction and pricing data of swaps held in queue, in accordance with the requirements of this part.
          (2) If at any time during closing hours a registered swap data repository is unable to receive and hold in queue swap transaction and pricing data pursuant to this part, then the registered swap data repository shall immediately upon reopening issue notice that it has resumed normal operations. Any registered swap execution facility, designated contract market or reporting party that is obligated under this section to report data to the registered swap data repository shall report the data to the registered swap data repository immediately after receiving such notice.
          (h) Timestamp requirements. In addition to the execution timestamp described in appendix A to this part, registered entities, swap dealers and major swap participants shall have the following timestamp requirements with respect to real-time public reporting of swap transaction and pricing data for all publicly reportable swap transactions:

          (1) A registered swap execution facility or designated contract market shall timestamp swap transaction and pricing data relating to a publicly reportable swap transaction with the date and time, to the nearest second of when such registered swap execution facility or designated contract market:
          (i) Receives data from a swap counterparty (if applicable); and
          (ii) Transmits such data to a registered swap data repository for public dissemination.
          (2) A registered swap data repository shall timestamp swap transaction and pricing data relating to a publicly reportable swap transaction with the date and time, to the nearest second when such registered swap data repository:
          (i) Receives data from a registered swap execution facility, designated contract market or reporting party; and
          (ii) Publicly disseminates such data.
          (3) A swap dealer or major swap participant shall timestamp swap transaction and pricing data relating to an off-facility swap with the date and time, to the nearest second when such swap dealer or major swap participant transmits such data to a registered swap data repository for public dissemination.
          (4) Records of all timestamps required by this subsection shall be maintained for a period of at least five years from the execution of the publicly reportable swap transaction.
          (i) Fees. Any fees or charges assessed on a reporting party, registered swap execution facility or designated contract market by a registered swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time for the collection of such data shall be equitable and non-discriminatory. If such registered swap data repository allows a fee discount based on the volume of data reported to it for public dissemination, then such discount shall be made available to all reporting parties, registered swap execution facilities and designated contract markets in an equitable and non-discriminatory manner.
        
        
          § 43.4
          Swap transaction and pricing data to be publicly disseminated in real-time.
          (a) In general. Swap transaction and pricing information shall be reported to a registered swap data repository so that the registered swap data repository can publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data in real-time in accordance with this part, including the manner described in this section and appendix A to this part.
          (b) Public dissemination of data fields. Any registered swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time shall publicly disseminate the information described in appendix A to this part, as applicable, for any publicly reportable swap transaction.
          (c) Additional swap information. A registered swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time may require reporting parties, registered swap execution facilities and designated contract markets to report to such registered swap data repository, such information that is necessary to compare the swap transaction and pricing data that was publicly disseminated in real-time to the data reported to a registered swap data repository pursuant to Section 2(a)(13)(G) of the Act or to confirm that parties to a swap have reported in a timely manner pursuant to § 43.3 of this part. Such additional information shall not be publicly disseminated by the registered swap data repository.
          (d) Anonymity of the parties to a publicly reportable swap transaction—(1) In general. Swap transaction and pricing data that is publicly disseminated in real-time shall not disclose the identities of the parties to the swap or otherwise facilitate the identification of a party to a swap. A registered swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time shall not publicly disseminate such data in a manner that discloses or otherwise facilitates the identification of a party to a swap.
          (2) Actual product description reported to registered swap data repository. Reporting parties, registered swap execution facilities and designated contract markets shall provide a registered swap data repository with swap transaction and pricing data that includes an actual description of the underlying asset(s).

          (ii) The actual underlying asset(s) shall be publicly disseminated for the following publicly reportable swap transactions in the other commodity asset class:
          (A) Any publicly reportable swap transaction that references one of the contracts described in appendix B to this part;
          (B) Any publicly reportable swap transaction that is economically related to one of the contracts described in appendix B of this part; or
          (iii) The underlying assets of swaps in the other commodity asset class that are not described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section shall be publicly disseminated by limiting the geographic detail of the underlying assets. The identification of any specific delivery point or pricing point associated with the underlying asset of such other commodity swap shall be publicly disseminated pursuant to appendix E of this part.
          (C) Any publicly reportable swap transaction executed on or pursuant to the rules of a registered swap execution facility or designated contract market.
          (e) Unique product identifier. If a unique product identifier is developed that sufficiently describes one or more of the swap transaction and pricing data fields for real-time reporting described in appendix A to this part, then such unique product identifier may be publicly disseminated in lieu of the data fields that it describes.
          (f) Reporting of notional or principal amounts to a registered swap data repository—(1) Off-facility swaps. The reporting party shall report the actual notional or principal amount of any off-facility swap to a registered swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates such data pursuant to part 43.
          (2) Swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of a registered swap execution facility or designated contract market. (i) A registered swap execution facility or designated contract market shall transmit the actual notional or principal amount for all swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of such registered swap execution facility or designated contract market, to a registered swap data repository that accepts swaps in the asset class.

          (g) Public dissemination of rounded notional or principal amounts. The notional or principal amount of a publicly reportable swap transaction, as described in appendix A to this part, shall be rounded and publicly disseminated by a registered swap data repository as follows:

          (1) If the notional or principal amount is less than one thousand, round to nearest five, but in no case shall a publicly disseminated notional or principal amount be less than five;
          (2) If the notional or principal amount is less than ten thousand but equal to or greater than one thousand, round to nearest one hundred;
          (3) If the notional or principal amount is less than 100 thousand but equal to or greater than ten thousand, round to nearest one thousand;
          (4) If the notional or principal amount is less than one million but equal to or greater than 100 thousand, round to nearest ten thousand;
          (5) If the notional or principal amount is less than 100 million but equal to or greater than one million, round to the nearest one million;
          (6) If the notional or principal amount is less than 500 million but equal to or greater than 100 million, round to the nearest ten million;

          (h) Cap sizes—(1) Initial cap sizes. Prior to the effective date of a Commission determination to establish an applicable post-initial cap size for a swap category as determined pursuant to paragraph (h)(2) of this section, the initial cap sizes for each swap category shall be equal to the greater of the initial appropriate minimum block size for the respective swap category in appendix F of this part or the respective cap sizes in paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (h)(1)(v) of this section. If appendix F of this part does not provide an initial appropriate minimum block size for a particular swap category, the initial cap size for such swap category shall be equal to the appropriate cap size as set forth in paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (h)(1)(v) of this section.
          (i) For swaps in the interest rate asset class, the publicly disseminated notional or principal amount for a swap subject to the rules in this part shall be:
          (A) USD 250 million for swaps with a tenor greater than zero up to and including two years;
          (B) USD 100 million for swaps with a tenor greater than two years up to and including ten years; and

          (c) Methodologies to determine appropriate minimum block sizes and cap sizes. In determining appropriate minimum block sizes and cap sizes for publicly reportable swap transactions, the Commission shall utilize the following statistical calculations—
          (1) 50-percent notional amount calculation. The Commission shall use the following procedure in determining the 50-percent notional amount calculation:
          (i) Select all of the publicly reportable swap transactions within a specific swap category using a one-year window of data beginning with a minimum of one year's worth of data;
          (ii) Convert to the same currency or units and use a trimmed data set;
          (iii) Determine the sum of the notional amounts of swaps in the trimmed data set;
          (iv) Multiply the sum of the notional amount by 50 percent;
          (v) Rank order the observations by notional amount from least to greatest;
          (vi) Calculate the cumulative sum of the observations until the cumulative sum is equal to or greater than the 50-percent notional amount calculated in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section;
          (vii) Select the notional amount associated with that observation;
          (viii) Round the notional amount of that observation to two significant digits, or if the notional amount associated with that observation is already significant to two digits, increase that notional amount to the next highest rounding point of two significant digits; and
          (ix) Set the appropriate minimum block size at the amount calculated in paragraph (c)(1)(viii) of this section.
          (2) 67-percent notional amount calculation. The Commission shall use the following procedure in determining the 67-percent notional amount calculation:

          (i) Select all of the publicly reportable swap transactions within a specific swap category using a one-year window of data beginning with a minimum of one year's worth of data;
          (ii) Convert to the same currency or units and use a trimmed data set;
          (iii) Determine the sum of the notional amounts of swaps in the trimmed data set;
          (iv) Multiply the sum of the notional amount by 67 percent;
          (v) Rank order the observations by notional amount from least to greatest;
          (vi) Calculate the cumulative sum of the observations until the cumulative sum is equal to or greater than the 67-percent notional amount calculated in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section;
          (vii) Select the notional amount associated with that observation;
          (viii) Round the notional amount of that observation to two significant digits, or if the notional amount associated with that observation is already significant to two digits, increase that notional amount to the next highest rounding point of two significant digits; and
          (ix) Set the appropriate minimum block size at the amount calculated in paragraph (c)(2)(viii) of this section.
          (3) 75-percent notional amount calculation. The Commission shall use the following procedure in determining the 75-percent notional amount calculation:
          (i) Select all of the publicly reportable swap transactions within a specific swap category using a one-year window of data beginning with a minimum of one year's worth of data;
          (ii) Convert to the same currency or units and use a trimmed data set;
          (iii) Determine the sum of the notional amounts of swaps in the trimmed data set;
          (iv) Multiply the sum of the notional amount by 75 percent;
          (v) Rank order the observations by notional amount from least to greatest;
          (vi) Calculate the cumulative sum of the observations until the cumulative sum is equal to or greater than the 75-percent notional amount calculated in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section;
          (vii) Select the notional amount associated with that observation;
          (viii) Round the notional amount of that observation to two significant digits, or if the notional amount associated with that observation is already significant to two digits, increase that notional amount to the next highest rounding point of two significant digits; and
          (ix) Set the appropriate minimum block size at the amount calculated in paragraph (c)(3)(viii) of this section.
          (d) No appropriate minimum block sizes for swaps in the equity asset class. Publicly reportable swap transactions in the equity asset class shall not be treated as block trades or large notional off-facility swaps.
          (e) Initial appropriate minimum block sizes. Prior to the Commission making a determination as described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the following initial appropriate minimum block sizes shall apply:
          (1) Prescribed appropriate minimum block sizes. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, for any publicly reportable swap transaction that falls within the swap categories described in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(4)(i), (b)(5)(i) or (b)(5)(ii) of this section, the initial appropriate minimum block size for such publicly reportable swap transaction shall be the appropriate minimum block size that is in appendix F of this part.
          (2) Certain swaps in the foreign exchange and other commodity asset classes. All swaps or instruments in the swap categories described in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii) and (b)(5)(iii) of this section shall be eligible to be treated as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap, as applicable.
          (3) Exception. Publicly reportable swap transactions described in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section that are economically related to a futures contract in appendix B of this part shall not qualify to be treated as block trades or large notional off-facility swaps (as applicable), if such futures contract is not subject to a designated contract market's block trading rules.
          (f) Post-initial process to determine appropriate minimum block sizes—(1) Post-initial period. After a registered swap data repository has collected at least one year of reliable data for a particular asset class, the Commission shall establish, by swap categories, the post-initial appropriate minimum block sizes as described in paragraphs (f)(2) through (f)(5) of this section. No less than once each calendar year thereafter, the Commission shall update the post-initial appropriate minimum block sizes.
          (2) Post-initial appropriate minimum block sizes for certain swaps. The Commission shall determine post-initial appropriate minimum block sizes for the swap categories described in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(4)(i) and (b)(5) of this section by utilizing a one-year window of swap transaction and pricing data corresponding to each relevant swap category reviewed no less than once each calendar year, and by applying the 67-percent notional amount calculation to such data.
          (3) Certain swaps in the foreign exchange asset class. All swaps or instruments in the swap category described in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section shall be eligible to be treated as a block trade or large notional off-facility swap, as applicable.
          (4) Commission publication of post-initial appropriate minimum block sizes. The Commission shall publish the appropriate minimum block sizes determined pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section on its Web site at http://www.cftc.gov.
          
          (5) Effective date of post-initial appropriate minimum block sizes. Unless otherwise indicated on the Commission's Web site, the post-initial appropriate minimum block sizes described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall be effective on the first day of the second month following the date of publication.
          (g) Required notification—(1) Block trade election. (i) The parties to a publicly reportable swap transaction that has a notional amount at or above the appropriate minimum block size shall notify the registered swap execution facility or designated contract market, as applicable, pursuant to the rules of such registered swap execution facility or designated contract market, of its election to have the publicly reportable swap transaction treated as a block trade.
          (ii) The registered swap execution facility or designated contract market, as applicable, pursuant to the rules of which a block trade is executed shall notify the registered swap data repository of such a block trade election when transmitting swap transaction and pricing data to such swap data repository in accordance with § 43.3(b)(1).
          (2) Large notional off-facility swap election. A reporting party who executes an off-facility swap that has a notional amount at or above the appropriate minimum block size shall notify the applicable registered swap data repository that such swap transaction qualifies as a large notional off-facility swap concurrent with the transmission of swap transaction and pricing data in accordance with this part.
          (h) Special provisions relating to appropriate minimum block sizes and cap sizes. The following special rules shall apply to the determination of appropriate minimum block sizes and cap sizes—
          (1) Swaps with optionality. The notional amount of a swap with optionality shall equal the notional amount of the component of the swap that does not include the option component.
          (2) Swaps with composite reference prices. The parties to a swap transaction with composite reference prices may elect to apply the lowest appropriate minimum block size or cap size applicable to one component reference price's swap category of such publicly reportable swap transaction.
          (3) Notional amounts for physical commodity swaps. Unless otherwise specified in this part, the notional amount for a physical commodity swap shall be based on the notional unit measure utilized in the related futures contract market or the predominant notional unit measure used to determine notional quantities in the cash market for the relevant, underlying physical commodity.
          (4) Currency conversion. Unless otherwise specified in this part, when the appropriate minimum block size or cap size for a publicly reportable swap transaction is denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, parties to a swap and registered entities may use a currency exchange rate that is widely published within the preceding two business days from the date of execution of the swap transaction in order to determine such qualification.
          
          (5) Successor currencies. For currencies that succeed a super-major currency, the appropriate currency classification for such currency shall be based on the corresponding nominal gross domestic product classification (in U.S. dollars) as determined in the most recent World Bank, World Development Indicator at the time of succession. If the gross domestic product of the country or nation utilizing the successor currency is:
          (i) Greater than $2 trillion, then the successor currency shall be included among the super-major currencies;
          (ii) Greater than $500 billion but less than $2 trillion, then the successor currency shall be included among the major currencies; or
          (iii) Less than $500 billion, then the successor currency shall be included among the non-major currencies.
          (6) Aggregation. Except as otherwise stated in this paragraph, the aggregation of orders for different accounts in order to satisfy the minimum block trade size or the cap size requirement is prohibited. Aggregation is permissible on a designated contract market or swap execution facility if done by a person who:
          (i)(A) Is a commodity trading advisor registered pursuant to Section 4n of the Act, or exempt from registration under the Act, or a principal thereof, who has discretionary trading authority or directs client accounts,
          (B) Is an investment adviser who has discretionary trading authority or directs client accounts and satisfies the criteria of § 4.7(a)(2)(v) of this chapter, or
          (C) Is a foreign person who performs a similar role or function as the persons described in paragraphs (h)(6)(i)(A) or (h)(6)(i)(B) of this section and is subject as such to foreign regulation; and,
          (ii) Has more than $25,000,000 in total assets under management.
          (i) Eligible Block Trade Parties. (1) Parties to a block trade must be “eligible contract participants,” as defined in Section 1a(18) of the Act and the Commission's regulations. However, a designated contract market may allow:

          § 45.3
          Swap data reporting: Creation data.

          Registered entities and swap counterparties must report required swap creation data electronically to a swap data repository as set forth in this section and in the manner provided in § 45.13(b). The rules governing acceptance and recording of such data by a swap data repository are set forth in § 49.10 of this chapter. The reporting obligations of swap counterparties with respect to swaps executed prior to the applicable compliance date and in existence on or after July 21, 2010, the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, are set forth in part 46 of this chapter. This section and § 45.4 establish the general swap data reporting obligations of swap dealers, major swap participants, non-SD/MSP counterparties, swap execution facilities, designated contract markets, and derivatives clearing organizations to report swap data to a swap data repository. In addition to the reporting obligations set forth in this section and in § 45.4, registered entities and swap counterparties are subject to other reporting obligations set forth in this chapter, including, without limitation, the following: Swap dealers, major swap participants, and non-SD/MSP counterparties are also subject to the reporting obligations with respect to corporate affiliations reporting set forth in § 45.6; swap execution facilities, designated contract markets, swap dealers, major swap participants, and non-SD/MSP counterparties are subject to the reporting obligations with respect to real time reporting of swap data set forth in part 43 of this chapter; counterparties to a swap for which an exception to, or an exemption from, the clearing requirement has been elected under part 50 of this chapter are subject to the reporting obligations set forth in part 50 of this chapter; and, where applicable, swap dealers, major swap participants, and non-SD/MSP counterparties are subject to the reporting obligations with respect to large traders set forth in parts 17 and 18 of this chapter. Paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section apply to all swaps except clearing swaps, while paragraph (e) applies only to clearing swaps.
          (a) Swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market. For each swap executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market, the swap execution facility or designated contract market must report all primary economic terms data for the swap, as defined in § 45.1, as soon as technologically practicable after execution of the swap. If the swap is not intended to be submitted to a derivatives clearing organization for clearing at the time of execution, the swap execution facility or designated contract market must report all confirmation data for the swap, as defined in § 45.1, as soon as technologically practicable after execution of the swap.

          § 45.4
          Swap data reporting: Continuation data.
          Registered entities and swap counterparties must report required swap continuation data electronically to a swap data repository as set forth in this section and in the manner provided in § 45.13(b). The rules governing acceptance and recording of such data by a swap data repository are set forth in § 49.10 of this chapter. The reporting obligations of registered entities and swap counterparties with respect to swaps executed prior to the applicable compliance date and in existence on or after July 21, 2010, the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, are set forth in part 46 of this chapter. This section and § 45.3 establish the general swap data reporting obligations of swap dealers, major swap participants, non-SD/MSP counterparties, swap execution facilities, designated contract markets, and derivatives clearing organizations to report swap data to a swap data repository. In addition to the reporting obligations set forth in this section and in § 45.3, registered entities and swap counterparties are subject to other reporting obligations set forth in this chapter, including, without limitation, the following: Swap dealers, major swap participants, and non-SD/MSP counterparties are also subject to the reporting obligations with respect to corporate affiliations reporting set forth in § 45.6; swap execution facilities, designated contract markets, swap dealers, major swap participants, and non-SD/MSP counterparties are subject to the reporting obligations with respect to real time reporting of swap data set forth in part 43 of this chapter; and, where applicable, swap dealers, major swap participants, and non-SD/MSP counterparties are subject to the reporting obligations with respect to large traders set forth in parts 17 and 18 of this chapter.
          (a) Continuation data reporting method generally. For each swap, regardless of asset class, reporting counterparties and derivatives clearing organizations required to report swap continuation data must do so in a manner sufficient to ensure that all data in the swap data repository concerning the swap remains current and accurate, and includes all changes to the primary economic terms of the swap occurring during the existence of the swap. Reporting entities and counterparties fulfill this obligation by reporting either life cycle event data or state data for the swap within the applicable deadlines set forth in this section. Reporting counterparties and derivatives clearing organizations required to report swap continuation data for a swap may fulfill their obligation to report either life cycle event data or state data by reporting:
          (1) Life cycle event data to a swap data repository that accepts only life cycle event data reporting;
          (2) State data to a swap data repository that accepts only state data reporting; or
          (3) Either life cycle event data or state data to a swap data repository that accepts both life cycle event data and state data reporting.
          (b) Continuation data reporting for clearing swaps. For all clearing swaps, required continuation data must be reported as provided in this section.
          (1) Life cycle event data or state data reporting. The derivatives clearing organization, as reporting counterparty, must report to the swap data repository either:
          (i) All life cycle event data for the swap, reported on the same day that any life cycle event occurs with respect to the swap; or
          (ii) All state data for the swap, reported daily.
          (2) Valuation data reporting. Valuation data for the swap must be reported by the derivatives clearing organization, as reporting counterparty, daily.
          (c) Continuation data reporting for original swaps. For all original swaps, required continuation data, including terminations, must be reported to the swap data repository to which the swap that was accepted for clearing was reported pursuant to § 45.3(a) through (d) in the manner provided in § 45.13(b) and in this section, and must be accepted and recorded by such swap data repository as provided in § 49.10 of this chapter.
          (1) Life cycle event data or state data reporting. The derivatives clearing organization that accepted the swap for clearing must report to the swap data repository either:
          (i) All life cycle event data for the swap, reported on the same day that any life cycle event occurs with respect to the swap; or
          (ii) All state data for the swap, reported daily.
          (2) In addition to all other necessary continuation data fields, life cycle event data and state data must include all of the following:
          (i) The legal entity identifier of the swap data repository to which all required swap creation data for each clearing swap was reported by the derivatives clearing organization pursuant to § 45.3(e);
          (ii) The unique swap identifier of the original swap that was replaced by the clearing swaps; and
          (iii) The unique swap identifier of each clearing swap that replaces a particular original swap.
          (d) Continuation data reporting for uncleared swaps. For all swaps that are not cleared by a derivatives clearing organization, including swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market, the reporting counterparty must report all required swap continuation data as provided in this section.
          (1) Life cycle event data or state data reporting. The reporting counterparty for the swap must report to the swap data repository either all life cycle event data for the swap or all state data for the swap, within the applicable deadline set forth in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
          (i) If the reporting counterparty is a swap dealer or major swap participant:
          (A) Life cycle event data must be reported on the same day that any life cycle event occurs, with the sole exception that life cycle event data relating to a corporate event of the non-reporting counterparty must be reported no later than the second business day after the day on which such event occurs.
          (B) State data must be reported daily.
          (ii) If the reporting counterparty is a non-SD/MSP counterparty:
          (A) Life cycle event data must be reported no later than the end of the first business day following the date of any life cycle event; with the sole exception that life cycle event data relating to a corporate event of the non-reporting counterparty must be reported no later than the end of the second business day following such event.
          (B) State data must be reported daily.
          (2) Valuation data reporting. Valuation data for the swap must be reported by the reporting counterparty for the swap as follows:
          (i) If the reporting counterparty is a swap dealer or major swap participant, the reporting counterparty must report all valuation data for the swap, daily.
          (ii) If the reporting counterparty is a non-SD/MSP counterparty, the reporting counterparty must report the current daily mark of the transaction as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. This report must be transmitted to the swap data repository within 30 calendar days of the end of each fiscal quarter. If a daily mark of the transaction is not available for the swap, the reporting counterparty satisfies this requirement by reporting the current valuation of the swap recorded on its books in accordance with applicable accounting standards.

          (1) Creation. The derivatives clearing organization shall generate and assign a unique swap identifier upon, or as soon as technologically practicable after, acceptance of an original swap by the derivatives clearing organization for clearing or execution of a clearing swap that does not replace an original swap, and prior to the reporting of required swap creation data for the clearing swap. The unique swap identifier shall consist of a single data field that contains two components:
          (i) The unique alphanumeric code assigned to the derivatives clearing organization by the Commission for the purpose of identifying the derivatives clearing organization with respect to unique swap identifier creation; and
          (ii) An alphanumeric code generated and assigned to that clearing swap by the automated systems of the derivatives clearing organization, which shall be unique with respect to all such codes generated and assigned by that derivatives clearing organization.
          (2) Transmission. The derivatives clearing organization shall transmit the unique swap identifier electronically as follows:
          (i) To the swap data repository to which the derivatives clearing organization reports required swap creation data for the clearing swap, as part of that report; and
          (ii) To its counterparty to the clearing swap, as soon as technologically practicable after acceptance of a swap by the derivatives clearing organization for clearing or execution of a clearing swap that does not replace an original swap.
          (e) Allocations. For swaps involving allocation, unique swap identifiers shall be created and transmitted as follows.
          (1) Initial swap between reporting counterparty and agent. The unique swap identifier for the initial swap transaction between the reporting counterparty and the agent shall be created as required by paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, and shall be transmitted as follows:
          (i) If the unique swap identifier is created by a swap execution facility or designated contract market, the swap execution facility or designated contract market must include the unique swap identifier in its swap creation data report to the swap data repository, and must transmit the unique identifier to the reporting counterparty and to the agent.
          (ii) If the unique swap identifier is created by the reporting counterparty, the reporting counterparty must include the unique swap identifier in its swap creation data report to the swap data repository, and must transmit the unique identifier to the agent.
          (2) Post-allocation swaps. The reporting counterparty must create a unique swap identifier for each of the individual swaps resulting from allocation, as soon as technologically practicable after it is informed by the agent of the identities of its actual counterparties, and must transmit each such unique swap identifier to:
          (i) The non-reporting counterparty for the swap in question.
          (ii) The agent.
          
          (iii) The derivatives clearing organization, if any, to which the swap is submitted for clearing, as part of the required swap creation data transmitted to the derivatives clearing organization for clearing purposes.
          (f) Use.

            Level one reference data means the minimum information needed to identify, on a verifiable basis, the legal entity to which a legal entity identifier is assigned. Level one reference data shall include, without limitation, all of the data elements included in ISO Standard 17442. Examples of level one reference data include, without limitation, a legal entity's official legal name, its place of incorporation, and the address and contact information of its corporate headquarters.
          
            Level two reference data means information concerning the corporate affiliations or company hierarchy relationships of the legal entity to which a legal entity identifier is assigned. Examples of level two reference data include, without limitation, the identity of the legal entity's ultimate parent.
          
            Parent means, for the purposes of § 45.6, a legal person that controls a counterparty to a swap required to be reported pursuant to this section, or that controls a legal entity identified or to be identified by a legal entity identifier provided by the legal identifier system designated by the Commission pursuant to this section.
          
            Self-registration means submission by a legal entity of its own level one or level two reference data, as applicable.
          
            Third-party registration means submission of level one or level two reference data, as applicable, for a legal entity that is or may become a swap counterparty, made by an entity or organization other than the legal entity identified by the submitted reference data. Examples of third-party registration include, without limitation, submission by a swap dealer or major swap participant of level one or level two reference data for its swap counterparties, and submission by a national numbering agency, national registration agency, or data service provider of level one or level two reference data concerning legal entities with respect to which the agency or service provider maintains information.
          
            Ultimate parent means, for the purposes of § 45.6, a legal person that controls a counterparty to a swap required to be reported pursuant to this section, or that controls a legal entity identified or to be identified by a legal entity identifier provided by the legal identifier system designated by the Commission pursuant to this section, and that itself has no parent.
          (b) International standard for the legal entity identifier. The legal entity identifier used in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting required by this part, following designation of the legal entity identifier system as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, shall be issued under, and shall conform to, ISO Standard 17442, Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), issued by the International Organisation for Standardisation.
          (b) Technical principles for the legal entity identifier. The legal entity identifier used in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting required by this part shall conform to the technical principles set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section.
          (1) Uniqueness. Only one legal entity identifier shall be assigned to any legal entity, and no legal entity identifier shall ever be reused. Each entity within a corporate organization or group structure that acts as a counterparty in any swap shall have its own legal entity identifier.
          (2) Neutrality. To ensure the persistence of the legal entity identifier, it shall have a format consisting of a single data field, and shall contain either no embedded intelligence or as little embedded intelligence as practicable. Entity characteristics of swap counterparties identified by legal entity identifiers shall constitute separate elements within a reference data system as set forth in paragraphs (a), (c)(2), (d), and (e) of this section.
          (3) Reliability. The legal entity identifier shall be supported by a trusted and auditable method of verifying the identity of the legal entity to which it is assigned, both initially and at appropriate intervals thereafter. The issuer of legal entity identifiers shall maintain minimum reference or identification data sufficient to verify that a user has been correctly identified. Issuance and maintenance of the legal entity identifier, and storage and maintenance of all associated data, shall involve robust quality assurance practices and system safeguards. At a minimum, such system safeguards shall include the system safeguards applied to swap data repositories by part 49 of this chapter.
          (4) Open Source. The schema for the legal entity identifier shall have an open standard that ensures to the greatest extent practicable that the legal entity identifier is compatible with existing automated systems of financial market infrastructures, market participants, and regulators.
          (5) Extensibility. The legal entity identifier shall be capable of becoming the single international standard for unique identification of legal entities across the financial sector on a global basis. Therefore, it shall be sufficiently extensible to cover all existing and potential future legal entities of all types that may be counterparties to swap, OTC derivative, or other financial transactions; that may be involved in any aspect of the financial issuance and transactions process; or that may be subject to required due diligence by financial sector entities.
          (6) Persistence. The legal entity identifier assigned to an entity shall persist despite all corporate events. When a corporate event results in a new entity, the new entity shall receive a new legal entity identifier, while the previous legal entity identifier or identifiers continue to identify the predecessor entity or entities in the record.
          (c) Governance principles for the legal entity identifier. The legal entity identifier used in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting required by this part shall conform to the governance principles set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.
          (1) International governance. The issuance of the legal entity identifier used pursuant to this section, and any legal entity identifier utility formed for the purpose of issuing legal entity identifiers that are used pursuant to this section, shall be subject to international supervision as follows:
          (i) With respect to operations, by a governance structure that includes the Commission and other financial regulators in any jurisdiction requiring use of the legal entity identifier pursuant to applicable law. The governance structure shall have authority sufficient to ensure, and shall ensure, that issuance and maintenance of the legal entity identifier system adheres on an ongoing basis to the principles set forth in this section.
          (ii) With respect to adherence to ISO Standard 17442, by the International Organisation for Standardisation.
          (2) Reference data access. Access to reference data associated with the legal entity identifier shall enable use of the legal entity identifier as a public good, while respecting applicable law regarding data confidentiality. Accordingly:
          (i) Reference data associated with the legal entity identifier that is public under applicable law shall be available publicly and free of charge. Such data shall include, without limitation, level one reference data (i.e., the minimum reference data needed to verify the identity of the legal entity receiving each legal entity identifier), and a current directory of all issued legal entity identifiers.
          (ii) Collection and maintenance of, and access to, reference data associated with the legal entity identifier shall comply with applicable laws on data protection and confidentiality.
          (3) Non-profit operation and funding. Funding of both start-up and ongoing operation of the legal entity identifier system, including, without limitation, any legal entity identifier utility formed for the purpose of issuing legal entity identifiers that are used pursuant to this section, shall be conducted on a non-profit, reasonable cost-recovery basis, and shall be subject to international governance as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
          (4) Unbundling and non-restricted use. Issuance of the legal entity identifier shall not be tied to other services, if any, offered by the issuer, and information concerning the issuance process for new legal entity identifiers must be available publicly and free of charge. Restrictions shall not be imposed on use of the legal entity identifier by any person in its own products and services, or on use of the legal entity identifier and associated reference data by any financial regulator. Any intellectual property created as part of the legal entity identifier system shall be treated in a manner consistent with open source principles.
          (5) Commercial advantage prohibition. The legal entity identifier utility providing legal entity identifiers for use in compliance with this part shall not make any commercial or business use (other than the operation of the utility) of any reference data associated with the legal entity identifier that is not available to the public free of charge. This restriction shall also apply to any entity or person that participates in the utility, that is legally or otherwise affiliated or associated with the utility, or that provides third-party services to the utility or to any component, partner, affiliate, or associate thereof.
          (e) Designation of the legal entity identifier system. (1) The Commission shall determine, as provided in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, whether a legal entity identifier system that satisfies the requirements set forth in this section is available to provide legal entity identifiers for registered entities and swap counterparties required to comply with this part.
          (i) In making this determination, the Commission shall consider, without limitation, the following factors:

          (A) Whether the LEI provided by the LEI utility is issued under, and conforms to, ISO Standard 17442, Legal Entity Identifier (LEI).
          

          (B) Whether the LEI provided by the LEI utility complies with all of the technical principles set forth in this rule.
          
          (C) Whether the LEI utility complies with all of the governance principles set forth in this rule.
          (D) Whether the LEI utility has demonstrated that it in fact can provide LEIs complying with this section for identification of swap counterparties in swap data reporting commencing as of the compliance dates set forth in § 45.5.
          (E) The acceptability of the LEI utility to industry participants required to use the LEI in complying with this part.
          (ii) In making this determination, the Commission shall consider all candidates meeting the criteria set forth in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, but shall not consider any candidate that does not demonstrate that it in fact can provide LEIs for identification of swap counterparties in swap data reporting commencing as of the compliance dates set forth in this part.
          (iii) The Commission shall make this determination at a time it believes is sufficiently prior to the compliance dates set forth this part to enable issuance of LEIs far enough in advance of those compliance dates to enable compliance with this part.

          (2) If the Commission determines pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section that such a legal entity identifier system is available, the Commission shall designate the legal entity identifier system as the provider of legal entity identifiers to be used in recordkeeping and swap data reporting pursuant to this part, by means of a Commission order that is published in the Federal Register and on the Web site of the Commission, as soon as practicable after such determination is made. The order shall include notice of this designation, the contact information of the LEI utility, and information concerning the procedure and requirements for obtaining legal entity identifiers.

          (3) If the Commission determines pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section that such a legal entity identifier system is not yet available, the Commission shall publish notice of the determination in the Federal Register and on the Web site of the Commission, as soon as practicable after the determination is made. If the Commission later determines, pursuant to paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, that such a legal entity identifier system has become available, the Commission shall designate the legal entity identifier system as the provider of legal entity identifiers to be used in recordkeeping and swap data reporting pursuant to this part, by means of a Commission order that is published in the Federal Register and on the Web site of the Commission, as soon as practicable after such determination is made. The order shall include notice of this designation, the contact information of the LEI utility, and information concerning the procedure and requirements for obtaining legal entity identifiers.
          (e) Reference data reporting—(1) Reporting of level one reference data. Level one reference data for each counterparty to any swap subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission shall be reported, by means of self-registration, third-party registration, or both, into a public level one reference database maintained by the issuer of the legal entity identifier designated by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. Such level one reference data shall be reported at a time sufficient to ensure that the counterparty's legal entity identifier is available for inclusion in recordkeeping and swap data reporting as required by this section. All subsequent changes and corrections to level one reference data previously reported shall be reported to the issuer, by means of self-registration, third-party registration, or both, as soon as technologically practicable following occurrence of any such change or discovery of the need for a correction.
          (2) Reporting of level two reference data. (i) Level two reference data for each counterparty to any swap subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, consisting of the identity of the counterparty's ultimate parent, shall be reported, by means of self-registration, third-party registration, or both, into a level two reference database. Where applicable law forbids such reporting, that fact and the citation of the law in question shall be reported in place of the data to which such law applies.
          
          (ii) All non-public level two reference data reported to the level two reference database shall be confidential, non-public, and available only to financial regulators in any jurisdiction requiring use of the legal entity identifier pursuant to applicable law.

          (iii) The Commission shall determine the location of the level two reference database by means of a Commission order that is published in the Federal Register and on the Web site of the Commission, as soon as practicable after such determination is made. The order shall include notice of the location of the level two reference database, and information concerning the procedure and requirements for reporting level two reference data to the database.
          (iv) The obligation to report level two reference data does not apply until the Commission has determined the location of the level two reference database as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section.
          (v) After the Commission determines the location of the level two reference database pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, required level two reference data shall be reported at a time sufficient to ensure that it is included in the database when the counterparty's legal entity identifier is included in recordkeeping and swap data reporting as required by this section.
          (vi) All subsequent changes and corrections to required level two reference data previously reported shall be reported into the level two reference database, by means of self-registration, third-party registration, or both, as soon as technologically practicable following occurrence of any such change or discovery of the need for a correction.
          (f) Use of the legal entity identifier system by registered entities and swap counterparties. (1) When a legal entity identifier system has been designated by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, each registered entity and swap counterparty shall use the legal entity identifier provided by that system in all recordkeeping and swap data reporting pursuant to this part.
          (2) Before a legal entity identifier system has been designated by the Commission, each registered entity and swap counterparty shall use a substitute counterparty identifier created and assigned by a swap data repository in all recordkeeping and swap data reporting pursuant to this part, as follows:
          (i) When a swap involving one or more counterparties for which no substitute counterparty identifier has yet been created and assigned is reported to a swap data repository, the swap data repository shall create a substitute counterparty identifier for each such counterparty as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, and assign the substitute counterparty identifier to that counterparty, as soon as technologically practicable after that swap is first reported to the swap data repository. In lieu of creating a substitute identifier as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii), the swap data repository may assign a unique substitute identifier provided by a third party service provider, if such identifier complies with all of the principles for LEIs set forth in this part.
          (ii) Each such substitute counterparty identifier created by a swap data repository shall consist of a single data field that contains two components, including:
          (A) The unique alphanumeric code assigned to the swap data repository by the Commission for the purpose of identifying the swap data repository; and
          (B) An alphanumeric code generated and assigned to that counterparty by the automated systems of the swap data repository, which shall be unique with respect to all such substitute counterparty identifier codes generated and assigned by that swap data repository.

          (iii) The swap data repository shall transmit each substitute counterparty identifier thus created to each counterparty to the swap, to each other registered entity associated with the swap, to each registered entity or swap counterparty who has made any report of any swap data to the swap data repository, and to each swap data repository registered with the Commission, as soon as technologically practicable after creation and assignment of the substitute counterparty identifier.
          (iv) Once any swap data repository has created and assigned such a substitute counterparty identifier to a swap counterparty and has transmitted it as required by paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, all registered entities and swap counterparties shall use that substitute counterparty identifier to identify that counterparty in all swap data recordkeeping and reporting, until such time as the Commission designates a legal entity identifier system pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.
          (3) For swaps reported pursuant to this part prior to Commission designation of a legal entity identifier system, after such designation each swap data repository shall map the legal entity identifiers for the counterparties to the substitute counterparty identifiers in the record for each such swap.
          (4) Prior to October 15, 2012, if a legal entity identifier system has been designated by the Commission as provided in this section, but a reporting counterparty's automated systems are not yet prepared to include legal entity identifiers in recordkeeping and swap data reporting pursuant to this part, the counterparty shall be excused from complying with paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and shall instead comply with paragraph (f)(2) of this section, until its automated systems are prepared with respect to legal entity identifiers, at which time it must commence compliance with paragraph (f)(1) of this section. This paragraph shall have no effect on or after October 15, 2012.
        
        
          § 45.7
          Unique product identifiers.
          Each swap subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission shall be identified in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting pursuant to this part by means of a unique product identifier and product classification system as specified in this section. Each swap sufficiently standardized to receive a unique product identifier shall be identified by a unique product identifier. Each swap not sufficiently standardized for this purpose shall be identified by its description using the product classification system.
          (a) Requirements for the unique product identifier and product classification system. The unique product identifier and product classification system shall identify and describe the swap asset class and the sub-type within that asset class to which the swap belongs, and the underlying product for the swap, with sufficient distinctiveness and specificity to enable the Commission and other financial regulators to fulfill their regulatory responsibilities and to assist in real time reporting of swaps as provided in the Act and part 43 of this chapter. The level of distinctiveness and specificity which the unique product identifier will provide shall be determined separately for each swap asset class.
          (b) Designation of the unique product identifier and product classification system. (1) The Commission shall determine when a unique product identifier and product classification system that is acceptable to the Commission and satisfies the requirements set forth in this section is available for use in compliance with this section.

          (2) When the Commission determines that such a unique product identifier and product classification system is available, the Commission shall designate the unique product identifier and product classification system to be used in recordkeeping and swap data reporting pursuant to this part, by means of a Commission order that is published in the Federal Register and on the Web site of the Commission, as soon as practicable after such determination is made. The order shall include notice of this designation, the contact information of the issuer of such unique product identifiers, and information concerning the procedure and requirements for obtaining unique product identifiers and using the product classification system.
          (c) Use of the unique product identifier and product classification system by registered entities and swap counterparties. (1) When a unique product identifier and product classification system has been designated by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, each registered entity and swap counterparty shall use the unique product identifier and product classification system in all recordkeeping and swap data reporting pursuant to this part.
          (2) Before a unique product identifier and product classification system has been designated by the Commission, each registered entity and swap counterparty shall use the internal product identifier or product description used by the swap data repository to which a swap is reported in all recordkeeping and swap data reporting pursuant to this part.
        
        
          § 45.8
          Determination of which counterparty must report.
          The determination of which counterparty is the reporting counterparty for all swaps, except clearing swaps, shall be made as provided in paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section. The determination of which counterparty is the reporting counterparty for all clearing swaps shall be made as provided in paragraph (i) of this section.
          (a) If only one counterparty is a swap dealer, the swap dealer shall be the reporting counterparty.
          (b) If neither counterparty is a swap dealer, and only one counterparty is a major swap participant, the major swap participant shall be the reporting counterparty.
          (c) If both counterparties are non-SD/MSP counterparties, and only one counterparty is a financial entity as defined in CEA section 2(h)(7)(C), the counterparty that is a financial entity shall be the reporting counterparty.
          (d) If both counterparties are swap dealers, or both counterparties are major swap participants, or both counterparties are non-SD/MSP counterparties that are financial entities as defined in CEA section 2(h)(7)(C), or both counterparties are non-SD/MSP counterparties and neither counterparty is a financial entity as defined in CEA section 2(h)(7)(C):
          (1) For a swap executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market, the counterparties shall agree which counterparty shall be the reporting counterparty.
          (2) For an off-facility swap, the counterparties shall agree as one term of their swap which counterparty shall be the reporting counterparty.
          (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, if both counterparties to a swap are non-SD/MSP counterparties and only one counterparty is a U.S. person, that counterparty shall be the reporting counterparty.
          (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, if neither counterparty to a swap is a U.S. person, but the swap is executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market or otherwise executed in the United States, or is cleared by a derivatives clearing organization:
          (1) For such a swap executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market, the counterparties shall agree which counterparty shall be the reporting counterparty.
          (2) For an off-facility swap, the counterparties shall agree as one term of their swap which counterparty shall be the reporting counterparty.
          (g) If a reporting counterparty selected pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section ceases to be a counterparty to a swap due to an assignment or novation, the reporting counterparty for reporting of required swap continuation data following the assignment or novation shall be selected from the two current counterparties as provided in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section.
          (1) If only one counterparty is a swap dealer, the swap dealer shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.
          (2) If neither counterparty is a swap dealer, and only one counterparty is a major swap participant, the major swap participant shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.

          (3) If both counterparties are non-SD/MSP counterparties, and only one counterparty is a U.S. person, that counterparty shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.
          
          (4) In all other cases, the counterparty that replaced the previous reporting counterparty by reason of the assignment or novation shall be the reporting counterparty, unless otherwise agreed by the counterparties.
          (h) For all swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market, the rules of the swap execution facility or designated contract market must require each swap counterparty to provide sufficient information to the swap execution facility or designated contract market to enable the swap execution facility or designated contract market to report all swap creation data as provided in this part.
          (1) To achieve this, the rules of the swap execution facility or designated contract market must require each market participant placing an order with respect to any swap traded on the swap execution facility or designated contract market to include in the order, without limitation:
          (i) The legal entity identifier of the market participant placing the order.
          (ii) A yes/no indication of whether the market participant is a swap dealer with respect to the product with respect to which the order is placed.
          (iii) A yes/no indication of whether the market participant is a major swap participant with respect to the product with respect to which the order is placed.
          (iv) A yes/no indication of whether the market participant is a financial entity as defined in CEA section 2(h)(7)(C).
          (v) A yes/no indication of whether the market participant is a U.S. person.
          (vi) If applicable, an indication that the market participant will elect an exception to, or an exemption from, the clearing requirement under part 50 of this chapter for any swap resulting from the order.
          (vii) If the swap will be allocated:
          (A) An indication that the swap will be allocated.
          (B) The legal entity identifier of the agent.
          (C) An indication of whether the swap is a post-allocation swap.
          (D) If the swap is a post-allocation swap, the unique swap identifier of the initial swap transaction between the reporting counterparty and the agent.
          (2) To achieve this, the swap execution facility or designated contract market must use the information obtained pursuant to paragraph (h)(1) of this section to identify the counterparty that is the reporting counterparty pursuant to the CEA and this section.
          (i) Clearing swaps. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section, if the swap is a clearing swap, the derivatives clearing organization that is a counterparty to such swap shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all reporting counterparty obligations for such swap.

          § 45.9
          Third-party facilitation of data reporting.
          Registered entities and swap counterparties required by this part to report required swap creation data or required swap continuation data, while remaining fully responsible for reporting as required by this part, may contract with third-party service providers to facilitate reporting.
        
        
          § 45.10
          Reporting to a single swap data repository.
          All swap data for a given swap, which shall include all swap data required to be reported pursuant to parts 43 and 45 of this chapter, must be reported to a single swap data repository, which shall be the swap data repository to which the first report of required swap creation data is made pursuant to this part.
          (a) Swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market. To ensure that all swap data, including all swap data required to be reported pursuant to parts 43 and 45 of this chapter, for a swap executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market is reported to a single swap data repository:

          (1) The swap execution facility or designated contract market that reports required swap creation data as required by § 45.3 shall report all such data to a single swap data repository. As soon as technologically practicable after execution, the swap execution facility or designated contract market shall transmit to both counterparties to the swap, and to the derivatives clearing organization, if any, that will clear the swap, both:
          (i) The identity of the swap data repository to which required swap creation data is reported by the swap execution facility or designated contract market; and
          (ii) The unique swap identifier for the swap, created pursuant to § 45.5.
          (2) Thereafter, all required swap creation data and all required swap continuation data reported for the swap reported by any registered entity or counterparty shall be reported to that same swap data repository (or to its successor in the event that it ceases to operate, as provided in part 49 of this chapter).
          (b) Off-facility swaps with a swap dealer or major swap participant reporting counterparty. To ensure that all swap data, including all swap data required to be reported pursuant to parts 43 and 45 of this chapter, for off-facility swaps with a swap dealer or major swap participant reporting counterparty is reported to a single swap data repository:
          (1) If the reporting counterparty reports primary economic terms data to a swap data repository as required by § 45.3:
          (i) The reporting counterparty shall report primary economic terms data to a single swap data repository.
          (ii) As soon as technologically practicable after execution, but no later than as required pursuant to § 45.3, the reporting counterparty shall transmit to the other counterparty to the swap both the identity of the swap data repository to which primary economic terms data is reported by the reporting counterparty, and the unique swap identifier for the swap created pursuant to § 45.5.
          (iii) If the swap will be cleared, the reporting counterparty shall transmit to the derivatives clearing organization at the time the swap is submitted for clearing both the identity of the swap data repository to which primary economic terms data is reported by the reporting counterparty, and the unique swap identifier for the swap created pursuant to § 45.5.
          (2) Thereafter, all required swap creation data and all required swap continuation data reported for the swap, by any registered entity or counterparty, shall be reported to the swap data repository to which swap data has been reported pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section (or to its successor in the event that it ceases to operate, as provided in part 49 of this chapter).
          (c) Off-facility swaps with a non-SD/MSP reporting counterparty. To ensure that all swap data, including all swap data required to be reported pursuant to parts 43 and 45 of this chapter, for such swaps is reported to a single swap data repository:
          (1) If the reporting counterparty reports primary economic terms data to a swap data repository as required by § 45.3:
          (i) The reporting counterparty shall report primary economic terms data to a single swap data repository.
          (ii) As soon as technologically practicable after execution, but no later than as required pursuant to § 45.3, the reporting counterparty shall transmit to the other counterparty to the swap the identity of the swap data repository to which primary economic terms data was reported by the reporting counterparty.
          (iii) If the swap will be cleared, the reporting counterparty shall transmit to the derivatives clearing organization at the time the swap is submitted for clearing the identity of the swap data repository to which primary economic terms data was reported by the reporting counterparty.
          (2) The swap data repository to which the swap is reported as provided in paragraph (c) of this section shall transmit the unique swap identifier created pursuant to § 45.5 to both counterparties and to the derivatives clearing organization, if any, as soon as technologically practicable after creation of the unique swap identifier.

          (3) Thereafter, all required swap creation data and all required swap continuation data reported for the swap, by any registered entity or counterparty, shall be reported to the swap data repository to which swap data has been reported pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section (or to its successor in the event that it ceases to operate, as provided in part 49 of this chapter).
          (d) Clearing swaps. To ensure that all swap data for a given clearing swap, and for clearing swaps that replace a particular original swap or that are created upon execution of the same transaction and that do not replace an original swap, is reported to a single swap data repository:
          (1) The derivatives clearing organization that is a counterparty to such clearing swap shall report all required swap creation data for that clearing swap to a single swap data repository. As soon as technologically practicable after acceptance of an original swap by a derivatives clearing organization for clearing or execution of a clearing swap that does not replace an original swap, the derivatives clearing organization shall transmit to the counterparty to each clearing swap the legal entity identifier of the swap data repository to which the derivatives clearing organization reported the required swap creation data for that clearing swap.
          (2) Thereafter, all required swap creation data and all required swap continuation data reported for that clearing swap shall be reported by the derivatives clearing organization to the swap data repository to which swap data has been reported pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section (or to its successor in the event that it ceases to operate, as provided in part 49 of this chapter).
          (3) For clearing swaps that replace a particular original swap, and for equal and opposite clearing swaps that are created upon execution of the same transaction and that do not replace an original swap, the derivatives clearing organization shall report all required swap creation data and all required swap continuation data for such clearing swaps to a single swap data repository.

          § 45.11
          Data reporting for swaps in a swap asset class not accepted by any swap data repository.
          (a) Should there be a swap asset class for which no swap data repository registered with the Commission currently accepts swap data, each registered entity or counterparty required by this part to report any required swap creation data or required swap continuation data with respect to a swap in that asset class must report that same data to the Commission.
          (b) Data reported to the Commission pursuant to this section shall be reported at times announced by the Commission and in an electronic file in a format acceptable to the Commission.
          (c) Delegation of authority to the Chief Information Officer: The Commission hereby delegates to its Chief Information Officer, until the Commission orders otherwise, the authority set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, to be exercised by the Chief Information Officer or by such other employee or employees of the Commission as may be designated from time to time by the Chief Information Officer. The Chief Information Officer may submit to the Commission for its consideration any matter which has been delegated in this paragraph. Nothing in this paragraph prohibits the Commission, at its election, from exercising the authority delegated in this paragraph. The authority delegated to the Chief Information Officer by paragraph (c) of this section shall include:
          (1) The authority to determine the manner, format, coding structure, and electronic data transmission standards and procedures acceptable to the Commission for the purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
          (2) The authority to determine whether the Commission may permit or require use by reporting entities or counterparties in reporting pursuant to this section of one or more particular data standards (such as FIX, FpML, ISO 20022, or some other standard), in order to accommodate the needs of different communities of users.
          (3) The dates and times at which required swap creation data or required swap continuation data shall be reported pursuant to this section.

          (d) The Chief Information Officer shall publish from time to time in the Federal Register and on the Web site of the Commission the format, data schema, electronic data transmission methods and procedures, and dates and times for reporting acceptable to the Commission with respect to swap data reporting pursuant to this section.
        
        
          § 45.12
          Voluntary supplemental reporting
          (a) For purposes of this section, the term voluntary, supplemental report means any report of swap data to a swap data repository that is not required to be made pursuant to this part or any other part in this chapter.
          (b) A voluntary, supplemental report may be made only by a counterparty to the swap in connection with which the voluntary, supplemental report is made, or by a third-party service provider acting on behalf of a counterparty to the swap.
          (c) A voluntary, supplemental report may be made either to the swap data repository to which all required swap creation data and all required swap continuation data is reported for the swap pursuant to §§ 45.3 and 45.10, or to a different swap data repository.
          (d) A voluntary, supplemental report must contain:
          (1) An indication that the report is a voluntary, supplemental report.
          (2) The unique swap identifier created pursuant to §§ 45.5 and 45.9. Therefore, no voluntary, supplemental report may be made until after the unique swap identifier has been created pursuant to §§ 45.5 and 45.9 and has been transmitted to the counterparty making the voluntary, supplemental report.
          (3) The identity of the swap data repository to which all required swap creation data and all required swap continuation data is reported for the swap pursuant to §§ 45.3 and 45.10, if the voluntary supplemental report is made to a different swap data repository.
          (4) The legal entity identifier (or substitute identifier) required by § 45.6 for the counterparty making the voluntary, supplemental report.
          (5) If applicable, an indication that the voluntary, supplemental report is made pursuant to the laws or regulations of any jurisdiction outside the United States.
          (e) If a counterparty that has made a voluntary, supplemental report discovers any errors in the swap data included in the voluntary, supplemental report, the counterparty must report a correction of each such error to the swap data repository to which the voluntary, supplemental report was made, as soon as technologically practicable after discovery of any such error.
        
        
          § 45.13
          Required data standards.
          (a) Data maintained and furnished to the commission by swap data repositories. A swap data repository shall maintain all swap data reported to it in a format acceptable to the Commission, and shall transmit all swap data requested by the Commission to the Commission in an electronic file in a format acceptable to the Commission.
          (b) Data reported to swap data repositories. In reporting swap data to a swap data repository as required by this part, each reporting entity or counterparty shall use the facilities, methods, or data standards provided or required by the swap data repository to which the entity or counterparty reports the data. A swap data repository may permit reporting entities and counterparties to use various facilities, methods, or data standards, provided that its requirements in this regard enable it to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to maintenance and transmission of swap data.
          (c) Delegation of authority to the Chief Information Officer. The Commission hereby delegates to its Chief Information Officer, until the Commission orders otherwise, the authority set forth in this paragraph (c), to be exercised by the Chief Information Officer or by such other employee or employees of the Commission as may be designated from time to time by the Chief Information Officer. The Chief Information Officer may submit to the Commission for its consideration any matter which has been delegated in this paragraph (c). Nothing in this paragraph prohibits the Commission, at its election, from exercising the authority delegated in this paragraph. The authority delegated to the Chief Information Officer by this paragraph (c) shall include:

          (1) The authority to determine the manner, format, coding structure, and electronic data transmission standards and procedures acceptable to the Commission for the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section.
          
          (2) The authority to determine whether the Commission may permit or require use by reporting entities or counterparties, or by swap data repositories, of one or more particular data standards (such as FIX, FpML, ISO 20022, or some other standard), in order to accommodate the needs of different communities of users, or to enable swap data repositories to comply with paragraph (a) of this section.

          (d) The Chief Information Officer shall publish from time to time in the Federal Register and on the Web site of the Commission the format, data schema, and electronic data transmission methods and procedures acceptable to the Commission.
        
        
          § 45.14
          Reporting of errors and omissions in previously reported data.
          (a) Each registered entity and swap counterparty required by this part to report swap data to a swap data repository, to any other registered entity or swap counterparty, or to the Commission shall report any errors and omissions in the data so reported. Corrections of errors or omissions shall be reported as soon as technologically practicable after discovery of any such error or omission. With respect to swaps for which required swap continuation data is reported using the snapshot reporting method, reporting counterparties fulfill the requirement to report errors or omissions in state data previously reported by making appropriate corrections in their next daily report of state data as required by this part.
          (b) Each counterparty to a swap that is not the reporting counterparty as determined pursuant to § 45.8, and that discovers any error or omission with respect to any swap data reported to a swap data repository for that swap, shall promptly notify the reporting counterparty of each such error or omission. Upon receiving such notice, the reporting counterparty shall report a correction of each such error or omission to the swap data repository as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.
          (c) Unless otherwise approved by the Commission, or by the Chief Information Officer pursuant to § 45.13, each registered entity or swap counterparty reporting corrections to errors or omissions in data previously reported as required by this section shall report such corrections in the same format as it reported the erroneous or omitted data. Unless otherwise approved by the Commission, or by the Chief Information Officer pursuant to § 45.13, a swap data repository shall transmit corrections to errors or omission in data previously transmitted to the Commission in the same format as it transmitted the erroneous or omitted data.

          § 46.3
          Swap data reporting for pre-enactment swaps and transition swaps.
          (a) Reporting for pre-enactment and transition swaps in existence on or after April 25, 2011—(1) Initial data report. For each pre-enactment swap or transition swap in existence on or after April 25, 2011, the reporting counterparty shall report electronically to a swap data repository (or to the Commission if no swap data repository for swaps in the asset class in question is available), on the compliance date, the following:
          (i) All of the minimum primary economic terms data specified in appendix 1 to this part that were in the possession of the reporting counterparty on or after April 25, 2011;
          (ii) The legal entity identifier of the reporting counterparty required pursuant to § 46.4; and
          (iii) The following additional identifiers:
          (A) The internal counterparty identifier or legal entity identifier used by the reporting counterparty to identify the non-reporting counterparty; and
          (B) The internal transaction identifier used by the reporting counterparty to identify the swap.
          (2) Reporting of required swap continuation data. (i) For each uncleared pre-enactment or transition swap in existence on or after April 25, 2011, throughout the existence of the swap following the compliance date, the reporting counterparty must report all required swap continuation data required to be reported pursuant to part 45 of this chapter, with the exception that when a reporting counterparty reports changes to minimum primary economic terms for a pre-enactment or transition swap, the reporting counterparty is required to report only changes to the minimum primary economic terms listed in appendix 1 to this part and reported in the initial data report made pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, rather than changes to all minimum primary economic terms listed in appendix 1 to part 45.

          (ii) Swap continuation data reporting is not required for a pre-enactment or transition swap in existence on or after April 25, 2011, that has been cleared by a designated clearing organization.
          
          (3) Data reporting for multi-asset swaps and mixed swaps. (i) For each pre-enactment or transition swap in existence on or after April 25, 2011, that is a multi-asset swap, all data required to be reported by this part shall be reported to a single swap data repository that accepts swaps in the asset class treated as the primary asset class involved in the swap by the reporting counterparty making the first report of required swap creation data pursuant to this section.
          (ii) For each pre-enactment or transition swap in existence on or after April 25, 2011, that is a mixed swap, all data required to be reported pursuant to this part shall be reported to a swap data repository registered with the Commission and to a security-based swap data repository registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This requirement may be satisfied by reporting the mixed swap to a swap data repository or security-based swap data repository registered with both Commissions.
          (b) Reporting for pre-enactment and transition swaps expired or terminated prior to April 25, 2011—(1) Pre-enactment swaps expired or terminated prior to April 25, 2011. For each pre-enactment swap which expired or was terminated prior to April 25, 2011, the reporting counterparty shall report to a swap data repository (or to the Commission if no swap data repository for swaps in the asset class in question is available), on the compliance date, such information relating to the terms of the transaction as was in the reporting counterparty's possession on or after October 14, 2010 (17 CFR 44.00 through 44.02). This information may be reported via any method selected by the reporting counterparty.
          (2) Transition swaps expired or terminated prior to April 25, 2011. For each transition swap which expired or was terminated prior to April 25, 2011, the reporting counterparty shall report to a swap data repository (or to the Commission if no swap data repository for swaps in the asset class in question is available), on the compliance date, such information relating to the terms of the transaction as was in the reporting counterparty's possession on or after December 17, 2010 (17 CFR 44.03). This information may be reported via any method selected by the reporting counterparty.
          (c) Voluntary early submission of initial data report. For all pre-enactment and transition swaps required to be reported pursuant to this part, the reporting counterparty may make the initial data report required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or the data report required by paragraph (b) of this section, prior to the applicable compliance date, if a swap data repository accepting swaps in the asset class in question is prepared to accept the report. The obligation to report continuation data as required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section with respect to a swap for which a voluntary early submission is made commences on the applicable compliance date. However, the reporting counterparty may submit continuation data at any time after a voluntary early submission made pursuant to this paragraph, if the swap data repository is prepared to accept such continuation data, and if that repository has registered with the Commission as a swap data repository as of the applicable compliance date.
          (d) Non-duplication of previous reporting. If the reporting counterparty for a pre-enactment or transition swap has reported any of the information required as paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section to a trade repository prior to the compliance date, and if as of the compliance date that repository has registered with the Commission as a swap data repository, then:
          (1) The counterparty shall not be required to report such previously reported information to the swap data repository again;
          (2) The counterparty shall be required to report to the swap data repository on the compliance date any information required as part of the initial data report by paragraph (a) of this section that has not been reported prior to the compliance date: and

          (3) In the case of pre-enactment and transition swaps in existence on or after April 25, 2011, the initial data report required by paragraph (a) of this section and all subsequent data reporting concerning the swap shall be made to the same swap data repository to which data concerning the swap was first reported prior to the compliance date (or to its successor in the event that it ceases to operate, as provided in part 49 of this chapter).
        
        
          § 46.4
          Unique identifiers.
          The unique identifier requirements for swap data reporting with respect to pre-enactment or transition swaps shall be as follows:
          (a) By the compliance date, the reporting counterparty (as defined by part 45 of this chapter) for each pre-enactment or transition swap in existence on or after April 25, 2011, for which an initial data report is required by this part 46, shall obtain for itself a legal entity identifier as provided in § 45.6 of this chapter (or if the Commission has not yet designated a legal entity identifier system, a substitute counterparty identifier as provided in § 45.6(f) of this chapter), and shall include its own legal entity identifier (or substitute counterparty identifier) in the initial data report concerning the swap. With respect to the legal entity identifier (or substitute counterparty identifier) of the reporting counterparty, the reporting counterparty and the swap data repository to which the swap is reported shall comply thereafter with all unique identifier requirements of § 45.6 of this chapter.
          (b) Within 180 days after the compliance date, the non-reporting counterparty for each pre-enactment or transition swap in existence on or after April 25, 2011, for which an initial data report is required by this part 46, shall obtain a legal entity identifier as provided in § 45.6 of this chapter (or if the Commission has not yet designated a legal entity identifier system, a substitute counterparty identifier as provided in § 45.6(f) of this chapter), and shall provide its legal entity identifier (or substitute counterparty identifier) to the reporting counterparty. Upon receipt of the non-reporting counterparty's legal entity identifier (or substitute counterparty identifier), the reporting counterparty shall provide it to the swap data repository to which swap data for the swap was reported. Thereafter, with respect to the legal entity identifier (or substitute counterparty identifier) of the non-reporting counterparty, the counterparties to the swap and the swap data repository to which it is reported shall comply with all requirements of § 45.6 of this chapter.
          (c) The legal entity identifier requirements of parts 46 and 45 of this chapter shall not apply to pre-enactment or transition swaps expired or terminated prior to April 25, 2011.
          (d) The unique swap identifier and unique product identifier requirements of part 45 of this chapter shall not apply to pre-enactment or transition swaps.
        
        
          § 46.5
          Determination of which counterparty must report.
          (a) Determination of which counterparty must report swap data concerning each pre-enactment or transition swap shall be made as follows:
          (1) If only one counterparty is a swap dealer, the swap dealer shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.
          (2) If neither party is an swap dealer, and only one counterparty is an major swap participant, the major swap participant shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.
          (3) If both counterparties are non-SD/MSP counterparties, and only one counterparty is a financial entity as defined in CEA section 2(h)(7)(C), the counterparty that is a financial entity shall be the reporting counterparty.
          (4) For each pre-enactment swap or transition swap for which both counterparties are swap dealers, or both counterparties are major swap participants, or both counterparties are non-SD/MSP counterparties that are financial entities as defined in CEA section 2(h)(7)(C), or both counterparties are non-SD/MSP counterparties and neither counterparty is a financial entity as defined in CEA section 2(h)(7)(C), the counterparties shall agree which counterparty shall fulfill reporting obligations with respect to that swap; and the counterparty so selected shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.

          (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, for pre-enactment or transition swaps for which both counterparties are non-SD/MSP counterparties, if only one counterparty is a U.S. person, that counterparty shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.
          (b) For pre-enactment and transition swaps in existence as of the compliance date, determination of the reporting counterparty shall be made by applying the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to the current counterparties to the swap as of the compliance date, regardless of whether either or both were original counterparties to the swap when it was first executed.
          (c) For pre-enactment and transition swaps for which reporting is required, but which have expired or been terminated prior to the compliance date, determination of the reporting counterparty shall be made by applying the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section to the counterparties to the swap as of the date of its expiration or termination (except for determination of a counterparty's status as an SD or MSP, which shall be made as of the compliance date), regardless of whether either or both were original counterparties to the swap when it was first executed.
          (d) After the initial report required by § 46.3 is made, if a reporting counterparty selected pursuant to this section ceases to be a counterparty to a swap due to an assignment or novation, the reporting counterparty for reporting of required swap continuation data following the assignment or novation shall be selected from the two current counterparties as provided in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section.
          (1) If only one counterparty is a swap dealer, the swap dealer shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.
          (2) If neither counterparty is a swap dealer, and only one counterparty is a major swap participant, the major swap participant shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.
          (3) If both counterparties are non-SD/MSP counterparties, and only one counterparty is a U.S. person, that counterparty shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.
          (4) In all other cases, the counterparty that replaced the previous reporting counterparty by reason of the assignment or novation shall be the reporting counterparty, unless otherwise agreed by the counterparties.
        
        
          § 46.6
          Third-party facilitation of data reporting.
          Counterparties required by this part 46 to report swap data for any pre-enactment or transition swap, while remaining fully responsible for reporting as required by this part 46, may contract with third-party service providers to facilitate reporting.
        
        
          § 46.7
          Reporting to a single swap data repository.
          All data reported for each pre-enactment or transition swap pursuant to this part 46, and all corrections of errors and omissions in previously reported data for the swap, shall be reported to the same swap data repository to which the initial data report concerning the swap is made (or to its successor in the event that it ceases to operate, as provided in part 49 of this chapter).
        
        
          § 46.8
          Data reporting for swaps in a swap asset class not accepted by any swap data repository.
          (a) Should there be a swap asset class for which no swap data repository registered with the Commission currently accepts swap data, each registered entity or counterparty required by this part to report any required swap creation data or required swap continuation data with respect to a swap in that asset class must report that same data to the Commission.
          (b) Data reported to the Commission pursuant to this section shall be reported at times announced by the Commission.

          § 48.5
          Registration procedures.

          (b) A complete application for registration must include:
          (1) A completed Form FBOT and Form Supplement S-1, as set forth in the appendix to this part, or any successor forms, and all information and documentation described in such forms; and

          (2) Any additional information and documentation necessary, in the discretion of the Commission, to supplement the application including, but not limited to, documentation and information provided during the course of an on-site visit, as applicable, to the foreign board of trade, the clearing organization and the regulatory authority or authorities, to effectively demonstrate that the foreign board of trade and its clearing organization satisfy the registration requirements set forth in § 48.7.
          
          (c) An applicant for registration must identify with particularity any information in the application that will be subject to a request for confidential treatment and must provide support for any request for confidential treatment pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 145.9 of this chapter.
          (d) If, upon review, the Commission finds the application for registration to be complete, the Commission may approve or deny the application. In reviewing the application, the Commission will consider, among other things:
          (1) Whether the foreign board of trade is eligible to be registered as defined in § 48.2(b) and;
          (2) Whether the foreign board of trade and its clearing organization are subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation by the appropriate governmental authorities in their home country or countries that is comparable to the comprehensive supervision and regulation to which designated contract markets and derivatives clearing organizations are respectively subject under the Act, Commission regulations, and other applicable United States laws and regulations, if any, and;
          (3) Any previous Commission findings that the foreign board of trade and its clearing organization are subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation by the appropriate government authorities in their home country or countries that is comparable to the comprehensive supervision and regulation to which designated contract markets and derivatives clearing organizations are subject under the Act, Commission regulations, and other applicable United States laws and regulations, if any; and
          (4) Whether the foreign board of trade and its clearing organization have adequately demonstrated that they meet the requirements for registration specified in § 48.7.
          (5) The Commission's determination that the foreign board of trade and its clearing organization are subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation by the appropriate government authorities in their home country or countries that is comparable to the comprehensive supervision and regulation to which designated contract markets and derivatives clearing organizations are subject will be based upon a principles-based review conducted in a manner consistent with this part 48 pursuant to which the Commission will look to determine if the government authorities support and enforce regulatory objectives in the oversight of the foreign board of trade and the clearing organization that are substantially equivalent to the regulatory objectives supported and enforced by the Commission in its oversight of designated contract markets and derivatives clearing organizations.
          (e) If the Commission approves the application, the Commission will issue an Order of Registration. If the Commission does not approve the application, the Commission will, after appropriate notice and an opportunity to respond, issue a Notice of Action specifying that the application was not approved and setting forth the reasons therefor. The Commission, in its discretion, may impose conditions in the Order of Registration and may, after appropriate notice and an opportunity to respond, amend, suspend, or otherwise restrict the terms of an issued Order of Registration or issue an Order revoking registration.
          (f) A foreign board of trade whose application is not approved may reapply for registration 360 days after the issuance of the Notice of Action if the foreign board of trade has addressed any deficiencies in its original application or facts and circumstances relevant to the Commission's review of the application have changed.
        
        
          § 48.6
          Foreign boards of trade providing direct access pursuant to existing no-action relief.
          (a) A foreign board of trade operating pursuant to existing no-action relief as of the effective date of this part 48 must register with the Commission pursuant to this part in order to continue to provide direct access to its electronic trading and order matching system from the United States.

          (b)(1) The application of a foreign board of trade operating pursuant to existing no-action relief must include a complete Form FBOT and Supplement S-1, as set forth in the appendix to this part. If the foreign board of trade, as part of its application for registration, wishes to rely on information and documentation previously submitted electronically in connection with its request for no-action relief in order to demonstrate that it satisfies the registration requirements set forth in § 48.7, (limited application) the foreign board of trade must:
          (i) Specifically identify the information or documentation previously submitted;
          (ii) Identify the specific registration requirements set forth in § 48.7 that are satisfied by such information or documentation; and
          (iii) Certify that the information remains accurate and current.
          (2) If the foreign board of trade wishes to rely on information and documentation previously submitted in hard copy in connection with its application for no-action relief, the foreign board of trade must also resubmit the identified information or documentation. A foreign board of trade that has submitted a complete application for no-action relief that is pending as of February 21, 2012 may also apply for registration pursuant to these limited application procedures.
          (c) A foreign board of trade operating pursuant to existing no-action relief must submit a limited application for registration, determined in good faith by the applicant to be complete, within 180 days of February 21, 2012. If, at any time after August 20, 2012 but before a limited application is approved or disapproved, the Commission determines that the application is materially incomplete, the Commission may, after providing the foreign board of trade with notice and an opportunity to respond to the determination of incompleteness, withdraw the existing no-action relief if the Commission determines that the application cannot be made complete in a timely manner. The foreign board of trade may continue to operate pursuant to the existing no-action relief, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, August 20, 2012, while the Commission is reviewing its application, and until the Commission approves or disapproves the application or otherwise withdraws the existing no-action relief. The no-action relief is automatically withdrawn upon issuance of an Order of Registration or upon disapproval.

The registration requirements applicable to clearing organizations may alternatively be met by demonstrating that the clearing organization is registered and in good standing with the Commission as a derivatives clearing organization. The Commission, in its discretion, may request additional information and documentation in connection with an application for registration and an applicant for registration must provide promptly any such additional information or documentation.

          § 48.9
          Revocation of registration.
          (a) Failure to Satisfy Registration Requirements or Conditions:
          (1) If the Commission determines that a registered foreign board of trade or the clearing organization has failed to satisfy any registration requirements or conditions for registration, the Commission shall notify the foreign board of trade of such determination, including the particular requirements or conditions that are not being satisfied, and shall afford the foreign board of trade or clearing organization an opportunity to make appropriate changes to bring it into compliance.

          (2) If, not later than 30 days after receiving a notification under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the foreign board of trade or clearing organization fails to make changes that, in the opinion of the Commission, are necessary to comply with the registration requirements or conditions of registration, the Commission may revoke the foreign board of trade's registration, after appropriate notice and an opportunity to respond, by issuing an Order Revoking Registration which sets forth the reasons therefor.
          
          (3) A foreign board of trade whose registration has been revoked for failure to satisfy a registration requirement or condition of registration may apply for re-registration 360 days after the issuance of the Order Revoking Registration if the deficiency causing the revocation has been cured or relevant facts and circumstances have changed.
          (b) Other events that could result in revocation. Notwithstanding § 48.9(a), revocation under these circumstances will be handled by the Commission as relevant facts or circumstances warrant.
          (1) The Commission may revoke a foreign board of trade's registration, after appropriate notice and an opportunity to respond, if the Commission determines that a representation made in the foreign board of trade's application for registration is found to be untrue or materially misleading or if the foreign board of trade failed to include information in the application that would have been material to the Commission's determination as to whether to issue an Order of Registration.
          (2) The Commission may revoke a foreign board of trade's registration, after appropriate notice and an opportunity to respond, if there is a material change in the regulatory regime applicable to the foreign board of trade or clearing organization such that the regulatory regime no longer satisfies any registration requirement or condition for registration applicable to the regulatory regime.
          (3) The Commission may revoke a foreign board of trade's registration in the event of an emergency or in a circumstance where the Commission determines that revocation would be necessary or appropriate in the public interest. Following revocation, the Commission will provide notice and an opportunity to respond.
          (4) The Commission may revoke a foreign board of trade's registration in the event the foreign board of trade or the clearing organization is no longer authorized, licensed or registered, as applicable, as a regulated market and/or exchange or clearing organization or ceases to operate as a foreign board of trade or clearing organization, subject to notice and an opportunity to respond.
          (c) Upon request by the Commission, a registered foreign board of trade must file with the Commission a written demonstration, containing such supporting data, information, and documents, in such form and manner and within such timeframe as the Commission may specify, that the foreign board of trade or clearing organization is in compliance with the registration requirements and/or conditions for registration.
        
        
          § 48.10
          Additional contracts.
          (a) Generally. A registered foreign board of trade that wishes to make an additional futures, option or swap contract available for trading by identified members or other participants located in the United States with direct access to its electronic trading and order matching system must submit a written request prior to offering the contracts from within the United States. Such a written request must include the terms and conditions of the additional futures, option or swap contracts and a certification that the additional contracts meet the requirements of § 48.8(c), if applicable, and that the foreign board of trade and the clearing organization continue to satisfy the requirements and conditions of registration. The foreign board of trade can make available for trading by direct access the additional contracts ten business days after the date of receipt by the Commission of the written request, unless the Commission notifies the foreign board of trade that additional time is needed to complete its review of policy or other issues pertinent to the additional contracts. A registered foreign board of trade may list for trading by direct access an additional futures or option contract on a non-narrow-based security index pursuant to the Commission certification procedures set forth in § 30.13(d) and appendix D to part 30 of this chapter.
          (b) Option contracts on previously approved futures contracts. (1) If the option is on a futures contract that is not a linked contract, the option contract may be made available for trading by direct access by filing with the Commission no later than the business day preceding the initial listing of the contract:
          (i) A copy of the terms and conditions of the additional contract and
          (ii) A certification that the foreign board of trade and the clearing organization continue to satisfy the conditions of its registration.
          (2) If the option is on a futures contract that is a linked contract, the option contract may be made available for trading by direct access by filing with the Commission no later than the business day preceding the initial listing of the contract:
          (i) A copy of the terms and conditions of the additional contract; and
          (ii) A certification that the foreign board of trade and the clearing organization continue to satisfy the conditions of its registration, including the conditions specifically applicable to linked contracts set forth in § 48.8(c).
          (3) If the option is on a non-narrow-based security index futures contract which may be offered or sold in the United States pursuant to a Commission certification issued pursuant to § 30.13 of this chapter, the option contract may be listed for trading by direct access without further action by either the registered foreign board of trade or the Commission.
        
        
          § 48.11
          Delegation of authority.
          (a) The Commission hereby delegates, until it orders otherwise, to the Director of the Division of Market Oversight, or such other employee or employees as the Director may designate from time to time, the authority:
          (1) In § 48.7, to request additional information and documentation in connection with an application for registration;
          (2) In § 48.9(a)(1), to notify a registered foreign board of trade that it or the clearing organization has failed to satisfy any registration requirements or conditions for registration;
          (3) In § 48.9(c), to request that a registered foreign board of trade file with the Commission a written demonstration, containing such supporting data, information, and documents, in such form and manner and within such timeframe as the Commission may specify, that the foreign board of trade or clearing organization is in compliance with the registration requirements and/or conditions for registration; and
          (4) In § 48.10, to notify a foreign board of trade whether additional time is needed for staff to complete its review of policy or other issues pertinent to the additional contracts, or that the contract can be made available for trading by direct access.
          (b) The Director of the Division of Market Oversight may submit to the Commission for its consideration any matter which has been delegated in this section.
          (c) Nothing in this section prohibits the Commission, at its election, from exercising the authority delegated in this section.

          2. Form FBOT (including exhibits and any supplement thereto) (collectively, the “application” or “application for registration”) must be filed electronically with the Secretary of the Commission at FBOTapplications@cftc.gov. Applicants may prepare their own Form FBOT, but must follow the format prescribed herein.
          3. The name of any individual listed in Form FBOT shall be provided in full (Last Name, First Name and Middle Name or Initial).
          4. Form FBOT must be signed by the Chief Executive Officer (or the functional equivalent) of the foreign board of trade who must possess the authority to bind the foreign board of trade.

          6. Submission of a complete Form FBOT (including all information, documentation and exhibits requested therein, and any required supplement) is mandatory and must be received by the Commission before it will begin to process a foreign board of trade's application for registration. The information provided with a Form FBOT (including exhibits and any supplement thereto) will be used to determine whether the Commission should approve or deny registration to an applicant. Pursuant to its regulations, the Commission may determine that information and/or documentation in addition to that requested in the Form FBOT is required from the applicant in order to process the application for registration or to determine whether registration is appropriate.
          7. Pursuant to Commission regulations, an applicant or its clearing organization must identify with particularity any information in the application (including, but not limited to, any information contained in this Form FBOT) that will be the subject of a request for confidential treatment and must provide support for any request for confidential treatment pursuant to the procedures set forth in Commission regulation 145.9.3

             Acceptance of a Form FBOT by the Commission, however, shall not constitute a finding that the Form FBOT has been filed as required or that the information submitted is verified to be true, current, or complete. The Commission may revoke a foreign board of trade's registration, after appropriate notice and an opportunity to respond, if the Commission determines that a representation made in this Form FBOT is found to be untrue or materially misleading or if the foreign board of trade failed to include information in this Form FBOT that would have been material to the Commission's determination as to whether to issue an Order of Registration.
          
            
              4 Applicants and their clearing organizations are encouraged to correspond with the Commission's Division of Market Oversight regarding any content, procedural, or formatting questions encountered in connection with the preparation of a Form FBOT, or any exhibits or supplements thereto, prior to formally submitting those documents to the Commission.

          § 49.3
          Procedures for registration.
          (a) Application procedures. (1) An applicant, person or entity desiring to be registered as a swap data repository shall file electronically an application for registration on Form SDR provided in appendix A to this part, with the Secretary of the Commission at its headquarters in Washington, DC in a format and in the manner specified by the Secretary of the Commission in accordance with the instructions contained therein.
          (2) The application shall include information sufficient to demonstrate compliance with core principles specified in Section 21 of the Act and the regulations thereunder. Form SDR consists of instructions, general questions and a list of Exhibits (documents, information and evidence) required by the Commission in order to determine whether an applicant is able to comply with the core principles. An application will not be considered to be materially complete unless the applicant has submitted, at a minimum, the exhibits as required in Form SDR. If the application is not materially complete, the Commission shall notify the applicant that the application will not be deemed to have been submitted for purposes of the 180-day review procedures.
          (3) 180-Day review procedures. The Commission will review the application for registration as a swap data repository within 180 days of the date of the filing of such application. In considering an application for registration as a swap data repository, the staff of the Commission shall include in its review, an applicant's past relevant submissions and compliance history. At or prior to the conclusion of the 180-day period, the Commission will either by order grant registration; extend, by order, the 180-day review period for good cause; or deny the application for registration as a swap data repository. The 180-day review period shall commence once a completed submission on Form SDR is submitted to the Commission. The determination of when such submission on Form SDR is complete shall be at the sole discretion of the Commission. If deemed appropriate, the Commission may grant registration as a swap data repository subject to conditions. If the Commission denies an application for registration as a swap data repository, it shall specify the grounds for such denial. In the event of a denial of registration for a swap data repository, any person so denied shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the Commission.
          (4) Standard for approval. The Commission shall grant the registration of a swap data repository if the Commission finds that such swap data repository is appropriately organized, and has the capacity: to ensure the prompt, accurate and reliable performance of its functions as a swap data repository; comply with any applicable provisions of the Act and regulations thereunder; carry out its functions in a manner consistent with the purposes of Section 21 of the Act and the regulations thereunder; and operate in a fair, equitable and consistent manner. The Commission shall deny registration of a swap data repository if it appears that the application is materially incomplete; fails in form or substance to meet the requirements of Section 21 of the Act and part 49; or is amended or supplemented in a manner that is inconsistent with this § 49.3. The Commission shall notify the applicant seeking registration that the Commission is denying the application setting forth the deficiencies in the application, and/or the manner in which the application fails to meet the requirements of this part.
          (5) Amendments and annual filing. If any information reported on Form SDR or in any amendment thereto is or becomes inaccurate for any reason, whether before or after the application for registration has been granted, the swap data repository shall promptly file an amendment on Form SDR updating such information. In addition, the swap data repository shall annually file an amendment on Form SDR within 60 days after the end of each fiscal year.
          (6) Service of process. Each swap data repository shall designate and authorize on Form SDR an agent in the United States, other than a Commission official, who shall accept any notice or service of process, pleadings, or other documents in any action or proceedings brought against the swap data repository to enforce the Act and the regulations thereunder.
          (b) Provisional registration. The Commission, upon the request of an applicant, may grant provisional registration of a swap data repository if such applicant is in substantial compliance with the standards set forth in paragraph (a)(4) of this section and is able to demonstrate operational capability, real-time processing, multiple redundancy and robust security controls. Such provisional registration of a swap data repository shall expire on the earlier of: the date that the Commission grants or denies registration of the swap data repository; or the date that the Commission rescinds the temporary registration of the swap data repository. This paragraph (b) shall terminate within such time as determined by the Commission. A provisional registration granted by the Commission does not affect the right of the Commission to grant or deny permanent registration as provided under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
          (c) Withdrawal of application for registration. An applicant for registration may withdraw its application submitted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section by filing with the Commission such a request. Withdrawal of an application for registration shall not affect any action taken or to be taken by the Commission based upon actions, activities, or events occurring during the time that the application for registration was pending with the Commission, and shall not prejudice the filing of a new application by such applicant.
          (d) Reinstatement of dormant registration. Before accepting or re-accepting swap transaction data, a dormant registered swap data repository as defined in § 40.1(e) of this chapter shall reinstate its registration under the procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section; provided, however, that an application for reinstatement may rely upon previously submitted materials that still pertain to, and accurately describe, current conditions.
          (e) Delegation of authority. (1) The Commission hereby delegates, until it orders otherwise, to the Director of the Division of Market Oversight or the Director's delegates, with the consultation of the General Counsel or the General Counsel's delegates, the authority to notify an applicant seeking registration as a swap data repository pursuant to Section 21 of the Act that the application is materially incomplete and the 180-day period review period is extended.
          (2) The Director of the Division of Market Oversight may submit to the Commission for its consideration any matter which has been delegated in this paragraph.
          (3) Nothing in this paragraph prohibits the Commission, at its election, from exercising the authority delegated in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
          (f) Request for confidential treatment. An applicant for registration may request confidential treatment for materials submitted in its application as set forth in §§ 40.8 and 145.9 of this chapter. The applicant shall identify with particularity information in the application that will be subject to a request for confidential treatment.
        
        
          § 49.4
          Withdrawal from registration.
          (a)(1) A registered swap data repository may withdraw its registration by giving notice in writing to the Commission requesting that its registration as a swap data repository be withdrawn, which notice shall be served at least sixty days prior to the date named therein as the date when the withdrawal of registration shall take effect. The request to withdraw shall be made by a person duly authorized by the registrant and shall specify:
          (i) The name of the registrant for which withdrawal of registration is being requested;
          (ii) The name, address and telephone number of the swap data repository that will have custody of data and records of the registrant;
          (iii) The address where such data and records will be located; and
          (iv) A statement that the custodial swap data repository is authorized to make such data and records available in accordance with § 1.44.
          (2) Prior to filing a request to withdraw, a registered swap data repository shall file an amended Form SDR to update any inaccurate information. A withdrawal of registration shall not affect any action taken or to be taken by the Commission based upon actions, activities or events occurring during the time that the facility was designated by the Commission.
          (b) A notice of withdrawal from registration filed by a swap data repository shall become effective for all matters (except as provided in this paragraph (b)) on the 60th day after the filing thereof with the Commission, within such longer period of time as to which such swap data repository consents or which the Commission, by order, may determine as necessary or appropriate in the public interest.
          (c) Revocation of Registration for False Application. If, after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission finds that any registered swap data repository has obtained its registration by making any false or misleading statements with respect to any material fact or has violated or failed to comply with any provision of the Act and regulations thereunder, the Commission, by order, may revoke the registration. Pending final determination whether any registration shall be revoked, the Commission, by order, may suspend such registration, if such suspension appears to the Commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to be necessary or appropriate and in the public interest.
        
        
          § 49.5
          Equity interest transfers.
          (a) Equity transfer notification. Upon entering into any agreement(s) that could result in an equity interest transfer of ten percent or more in the swap data repository, the swap data repository shall file a notification of the equity interest transfer with the Secretary of the Commission at its headquarters in Washington, DC in a format and in the manner specified by the Secretary of the Commission, no later than the business day, as defined in § 40.1 of this chapter, following the date on which the swap data repository enters into a firm obligation to transfer the equity interest. The swap data repository shall also amend any information that is no longer accurate on Form SDR consistent with the procedures set forth in § 49.3 of this part.
          (b) Required information. The notification must include and be accompanied by: any relevant agreement(s), including any preliminary agreements; any associated changes to relevant corporate documents; a chart outlining any new ownership or corporate or organizational structure; a brief description of the purpose and any impact of the equity interest transfer; and a representation from the swap data repository that it meets all of the requirements of Section 21 of the Act and Commission regulations adopted thereunder. The swap data repository shall keep the Commission apprised of the projected date that the transaction resulting in the equity interest transfer will be consummated, and must provide to the Commission any new agreements or modifications to the original agreement(s) filed pursuant to this section. The swap data repository shall notify the Commission of the consummation of the transaction on the day in which it occurs.
          (c) Certification. (1) Upon a transfer of an equity interest of ten percent or more in a registered swap data repository, the registered swap data repository shall file with the Secretary of the Commission at its headquarters in Washington, DC in a format and in the manner specified by the Secretary of the Commission, a certification that the registered swap data repository meets all of the requirements of Section 21 of the Act and Commission regulations adopted thereunder, no later than two business days, as defined in § 40.1 of this chapter, following the date on which the equity interest of ten percent or more was acquired. Such certification shall state whether changes to any aspects of the swap data repository's operations were made as a result of such change in ownership, and include a description of any such change(s).
          (2) The certification required under this paragraph may rely on and be supported by reference to an application for registration as a swap data repository or prior filings made pursuant to a rule submission requirement, along with any necessary new filings, including new filings that provide any and all material updates of prior submissions.
        
        
          § 49.6
          Registration of successor entities.

          (a) In the event of a corporate transaction, such as a re-organization, merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other similar corporate event, that creates a new entity, in which the swap data repository continues to operate, the swap data repository shall request a transfer of the registration, rules, and other matters, no later than 30 days after the succession. The registration of the predecessor shall be deemed to remain effective as the registration of the successor if the successor, within 30 days after such succession, files an application for registration on Form SDR, and the predecessor files a request for vacation of registration on Form SDR provided, however, that the registration of the predecessor swap data repository shall cease to be effective 90 days after the application for registration on Form SDR is filed by the successor swap data repository.
          (b) If the succession is based solely on a change in the predecessor's date or state of incorporation, form of organization, or composition of a partnership, the successor may, within 30 days after the succession, amend the registration of the predecessor swap data repository on Form SDR to reflect these changes. This amendment shall be an application for registration filed by the predecessor and adopted by the successor.
        
        
          § 49.7
          Swap data repositories located in foreign jurisdictions.
          Any swap data repository located outside of the United States applying for registration pursuant to § 49.3 of this part shall certify on Form SDR and provide an opinion of counsel that the swap data repository, as a matter of law, is able to provide the Commission with prompt access to the books and records of such swap data repository and that the swap data repository can submit to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission.
        
        
          
          § 49.8
          Procedures for implementing registered swap data repository rules.
          (a) Request for Commission approval of rules. An applicant for registration as a swap data repository may request that the Commission approve under Section 5c(c) of the Act, any or all of its rules and subsequent amendments thereto, prior to their implementation or, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5c(c)(2) of the Act, at anytime thereafter, under the procedures of § 40.5 of this chapter.
          (b) Notwithstanding the timeline under § 40.5(c) of this chapter, the rules of a swap data repository that have been submitted for Commission approval at the same time as an application for registration under § 49.3 of this part or to reinstate the registration of a dormant registered swap data repository, as defined in § 40.1 of this chapter, will be deemed approved by the Commission no earlier than when the swap data repository is deemed to be registered or reinstated.
          (c) Self-certification of rules. Rules of a registered swap data repository not voluntarily submitted for prior Commission approval pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section must be submitted to the Commission with a certification that the rule or rule amendment complies with the Act or rules thereunder pursuant to the procedures of § 40.6 of this chapter, as applicable.

An Appropriate Domestic Regulator or Appropriate Foreign Regulator that has executed a confidentiality arrangement with the Commission pursuant to § 49.18(a) and provided such confidentiality arrangement to one or more swap data repositories shall notify the Commission and each such swap data repository of any change to such Appropriate Domestic Regulator's or Appropriate Foreign Regulator's scope of jurisdiction as described in such confidentiality arrangement. The Commission may direct a swap data repository to suspend, limit, or revoke access to swap data maintained by such swap data repository based on any such change to such Appropriate Domestic Regulator's or Appropriate Foreign Regulator's scope of jurisdiction, and, if so directed in writing, such swap data repository shall so suspend, limit, or revoke such access.
          (iv) The registered swap data repository need not make the determination required pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section more than once with respect to a recurring swap data request.

          (iii) Satisfied its obligations under paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section, such swap data repository shall provide access to the requested swap data; provided, however, that such swap data repository shall, if directed by the Commission in writing, limit, suspend or revoke such access should the Commission limit, suspend or revoke the appropriateness determination for such Appropriate Domestic Regulator or Appropriate Foreign Regulator or otherwise direct the swap data repository, in writing, to limit, suspend or revoke such access.
          (6) Confidentiality Arrangement. Consistent with § 49.18(a), the Appropriate Domestic Regulator or Appropriate Foreign Regulator shall, prior to receiving access to any requested swap data, execute the form of confidentiality arrangement set out in appendix B of this part with the Commission; provided, however, that the Commission may, in its discretion, agree to execute a confidentiality arrangement with an Appropriate Domestic Regulator or Appropriate Foreign Regulator that is not in the form set forth in appendix B of this part, if the confidentiality arrangement is consistent with the requirements set forth in § 49.18(b).

          (f) Access by market participants—(1) General. Access by market participants to swap data maintained by the registered swap data repository is prohibited other than as set forth in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
          (2) Exception. Swap data and information related to a particular swap that is maintained by the registered swap data repository may be accessed by either counterparty to that particular swap. However, the swap data and information maintained by the registered swap data repository that may be accessed by either counterparty to a particular swap shall not include the identity or the legal entity identifier (as such term is used in part 45 of this chapter) of the other counterparty to the swap, or the other counterparty's clearing member for the swap, if the swap is executed anonymously on a swap execution facility or designated contract market, and cleared in accordance with Commission regulations in §§ 1.74, 23.610, and 37.12(b)(7) of this chapter.
          (g) Commercial uses of data accepted and maintained by the registered swap data repository prohibited. Swap data accepted and maintained by the swap data repository generally may not be used for commercial or business purposes by the swap data repository or any of its affiliated entities.

          (h) Appropriateness determination process. (1) Each person seeking an appropriateness determination pursuant to this paragraph shall file an application with the Commission.

          (2) Each applicant seeking an appropriateness determination shall provide sufficient detail in its application to permit the Commission to analyze whether the applicant is acting within the scope of its jurisdiction in seeking access to swap data maintained by a registered swap data repository, and whether the applicant employs appropriate confidentiality safeguards to ensure that any swap data such applicant receives from a registered swap data repository will not, except as allowed for in the form of confidentiality arrangement set forth in appendix B to this part 49, be disclosed.
          (3) If the Commission determines that an applicant pursuant to this paragraph is, conditionally or unconditionally, appropriate for purposes of CEA section 21(c)(7), the Commission shall issue an order setting forth its appropriateness determination.

Such duties and obligations include, without limitation: The duties set forth in § 49.19, and maintenance of a comprehensive audit trail. The swap data repository's business continuity-disaster recovery plan and resources generally should enable resumption of the swap data repository's operations and resumption of ongoing fulfillment of the swap data repository's duties and obligations during the next business day following the disruption. A swap data repository shall update its business continuity-disaster recovery plan and emergency procedures at a frequency determined by an appropriate risk analysis, but at a minimum no less frequently than annually.
          (e) Registered swap data repositories determined by the Commission to be critical swap data repositories are subject to more stringent requirements as set forth below.
          (1) Each swap data repository that the Commission determines is critical must maintain a disaster recovery plan and business continuity and disaster recovery resources, including infrastructure and personnel, sufficient to enable it to achieve a same-day recovery time objective in the event that its normal capabilities become temporarily inoperable for any reason up to and including a wide-scale disruption.
          (2) A same-day recovery time objective is a recovery time objective within the same business day on which normal capabilities become temporarily inoperable for any reason up to and including a wide-scale disruption.
          (3) To ensure its ability to achieve a same-day recovery time objective in the event of a wide-scale disruption, each swap data repository that the Commission determines is critical must maintain a degree of geographic dispersal of both infrastructure and personnel such that:
          (i) Infrastructure sufficient to enable the swap data repository to meet a same-day recovery time objective after interruption is located outside the relevant area of the infrastructure the entity normally relies upon to conduct activities necessary to the reporting, recordkeeping and/or dissemination of swap data, and does not rely on the same critical transportation, telecommunications, power, water, or other critical infrastructure components the entity normally relies upon for such activities; and
          (ii) Personnel sufficient to enable the swap data repository to meet a same-day recovery time objective, after interruption of normal swap data reporting, recordkeeping and/or dissemination by a wide-scale disruption affecting the relevant area in which the personnel the entity normally relies upon to engage in such activities are located, live and work outside that relevant area.
          (4) Each swap data repository that the Commission determines is critical must conduct regular, periodic tests of its business continuity and disaster recovery plans and resources and its capacity to achieve a same-day recovery time objective in the event of a wide-scale disruption. The swap data repository shall keep records of the results of such tests, and make the results available to the Commission upon request.

          (f) A registered swap data repository that is not determined by the Commission to be a critical swap data repository satisfies the requirement to be able to resume operations and resume ongoing fulfillment of the swap data repository's duties and obligations during the next business day following a disruption by maintaining either:
          (1) Infrastructure and personnel resources of its own that are sufficient to ensure timely recovery and resumption of its operations, duties and obligations as a registered swap data repository following any disruption of its operations; or
          (2) Contractual arrangements with other registered swap data repositories or disaster recovery service providers, as appropriate, that are sufficient to ensure continued fulfillment of all of the swap data repository's duties and obligations following any disruption of its operations, both with respect to all swaps reported to the swap data repository and with respect to all swap data contained in the swap data repository.
          (g) A registered swap data repository shall notify Commission staff promptly of all:
          (1) Systems malfunctions;
          (2) Cyber security incidents or targeted threats that actually or potentially jeopardize automated system operation, reliability, security, or capacity; and
          (3) Any activation of the swap data repository's business continuity-disaster recovery plan.
          (h) A registered swap data repository shall give Commission staff timely advance notice of all:
          (1) Planned changes to automated systems that may impact the reliability, security, or adequate scalable capacity of such systems; and
          (2) Planned changes to the swap data repository's program of risk analysis and oversight.
          (i) As part of a swap data repository's obligation to produce books and records in accordance with §§ 1.31 and 45.2 of this chapter, and § 49.12, a swap data repository shall provide to the Commission the following system safeguards-related books and records, promptly upon the request of any Commission representative:
          (1) Current copies of its business continuity-disaster recovery plans and other emergency procedures;
          (2) All assessments of its operational risks or system safeguards-related controls;
          (3) All reports concerning system safeguards testing and assessment required by this chapter, whether performed by independent contractors or by employees of the swap data repository; and
          (4) All other books and records requested by Commission staff in connection with Commission oversight of system safeguards pursuant to the Act or Commission regulations, or in connection with Commission maintenance of a current profile of the swap data repository's automated systems.
          (5) Nothing in paragraph (i) of this section shall be interpreted as reducing or limiting in any way a swap data repository's obligation to comply with §§ 1.31 and 45.2 of this chapter, or with § 49.12.
          (j) A swap data repository shall conduct regular, periodic, objective testing and review of its automated systems to ensure that they are reliable, secure, and have adequate scalable capacity. It shall also conduct regular, periodic testing and review of its business continuity-disaster recovery capabilities. Such testing and review shall include, without limitation, all of the types of testing set forth in this paragraph.
          (1) Definitions. As used in this paragraph (j):
          
            Controls means the safeguards or countermeasures employed by the swap data repository in order to protect the reliability, security, or capacity of its automated systems or the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its data and information, and in order to enable the swap data repository to fulfill its statutory and regulatory duties and responsibilities.
          
            Controls testing means assessment of the swap data repository's controls to determine whether such controls are implemented correctly, are operating as intended, and are enabling the swap data repository to meet the requirements established by this section.
          
            Enterprise technology risk assessment means a written assessment that includes, but is not limited to, an analysis of threats and vulnerabilities in the context of mitigating controls. An enterprise technology risk assessment identifies, estimates, and prioritizes risks to swap data repository operations or assets, or to market participants, individuals, or other entities, resulting from impairment of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and information or the reliability, security, or capacity of automated systems.
          
            External penetration testing means attempts to penetrate the swap data repository's automated systems from outside the systems' boundaries to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. Methods of conducting external penetration testing include, but are not limited to, methods for circumventing the security features of an automated system.
          
            Internal penetration testing means attempts to penetrate the swap data repository's automated systems from inside the systems' boundaries, to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. Methods of conducting internal penetration testing include, but are not limited to, methods for circumventing the security features of an automated system.
          
            Key controls means those controls that an appropriate risk analysis determines are either critically important for effective system safeguards or intended to address risks that evolve or change more frequently and therefore require more frequent review to ensure their continuing effectiveness in addressing such risks.
          
            Security incident means a cyber security or physical security event that actually jeopardizes or has a significant likelihood of jeopardizing automated system operation, reliability, security, or capacity, or the availability, confidentiality or integrity of data.
          
            Security incident response plan means a written plan documenting the swap data repository's policies, controls, procedures, and resources for identifying, responding to, mitigating, and recovering from security incidents, and the roles and responsibilities of its management, staff and independent contractors in responding to security incidents. A security incident response plan may be a separate document or a business continuity-disaster recovery plan section or appendix dedicated to security incident response.
          
            Security incident response plan testing means testing of a swap data repository's security incident response plan to determine the plan's effectiveness, identify its potential weaknesses or deficiencies, enable regular plan updating and improvement, and maintain organizational preparedness and resiliency with respect to security incidents. Methods of conducting security incident response plan testing may include, but are not limited to, checklist completion, walk-through or table-top exercises, simulations, and comprehensive exercises.
          
            Vulnerability testing means testing of a swap data repository's automated systems to determine what information may be discoverable through a reconnaissance analysis of those systems and what vulnerabilities may be present on those systems.

          DEFINITIONS
          Unless the context requires otherwise, all terms used in this Form SDR have the same meaning as in the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, and in the Regulations of the Commission thereunder.
          For the purposes of this Form SDR, the term “Applicant” shall include any applicant for registration as a swap data repository or any registered swap data repository that is amending Form SDR.
          GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

          1. Form SDR and Exhibits thereto are to be filed with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission by Applicants for registration as a swap data repository, or by a registered swap data repository amending such registration, pursuant to Section 21 of the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder. Upon the filing of an application for registration, the Commission will publish notice of the filing and afford interested persons an opportunity to submit written data, views and arguments concerning such application. No application for registration shall be effective unless the Commission, by order, grants such registration.
          
          2. Individuals' names shall be given in full (Last Name, First Name, Middle Name).
          3. Signatures must accompany each copy of the Form SDR filed with the Commission. If this Form SDR is filed by a corporation, it must be signed in the name of the corporation by a principal officer duly authorized; if filed by a limited liability company, this Form SDR must be signed in the name of the limited liability company by a member duly authorized to sign on the limited liability company's behalf; if filed by a partnership, this Form SDR must be signed in the name of the partnership by a general partner authorized; if filed by an unincorporated organization or association which is not a partnership, it must be signed in the name of the organization or association by the managing agent, i.e., a duly authorized person who directs, manages or who participates in the directing or managing of its affairs.
          4. If Form SDR is being filed as an initial application for registration, all applicable items must be answered in full. If any item is not applicable, indicate by “none,” “not applicable,” or “N/A” as appropriate.

          5. Under Section 21 of the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder, the Commission is authorized to solicit the information required to be supplied by this form from Applicants for registration as a swap data repository and from registered swap data repositories amending their registration. Disclosure of the information specified on this form is mandatory prior to processing of an application for registration as a swap data repository. The information will be used for the principal purpose of determining whether the Commission should grant or deny registration to an Applicant. The Commission may determine that additional information is required from the Applicant in order to process its application. An Applicant is therefore encouraged to supplement this Form SDR with any additional information that may be significant to its operation as a swap data repository and to the Commission's review of its application. A Form SDR which is not prepared and executed in compliance with applicable requirements and instructions may be returned as not acceptable for filing. Acceptance of this Form SDR, however, shall not constitute any finding that the Form SDR has been filed as required or that the information submitted is true, current or complete.
          6. Except in cases where confidential treatment is requested by the Applicant and granted by the Commission pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and Commission Regulation § 145.9, information supplied on this form will be included routinely in the public files of the Commission and will be available for inspection by any interested person. The Applicant must identify with particularity the information in these exhibits that will be subject to a request for confidential treatment and supporting documentation for such request pursuant to Commission Regulations § 40.8, and § 145.9.
          UPDATING INFORMATION ON THE FORM SDR
          1. Section 21 requires that if any information contained in Items 1 through 17, 23, 29, and Item 53 of this application, or any supplement or amendment thereto, is or becomes inaccurate for any reason, an amendment must be filed promptly, unless otherwise specified, on Form SDR correcting such information.
          2. Registrants filing Form SDR as an amendment (other than an annual amendment) need file only the first page of Form SDR, the signature page (Item 13), and any pages on which an answer is being amended, together with such exhibits as are being amended. The submission of an amendment represents that all unamended items and exhibits remain true, current and complete as previously filed.
          ANNUAL AMENDMENT ON THE FORM SDR
          Annual amendments on the Form SDR shall be submitted within 60 days of the end of the Applicant's fiscal year. Applicants must complete the first page and provide updated information or exhibits.
          An Applicant may request an extension of time for submitting the annual amendment with the Secretary of the Commission based on substantial, undue hardship. Extensions for filing annual amendments may be granted at the discretion of the Commission.
          WHERE TO FILE
          File registration application and appropriate exhibits electronically with the Commission at the Washington, D.C. headquarters in a format and in the manner specified by the Secretary of the Commission.

          Appendix B to Part 49—Confidentiality Arrangement for Appropriate Domestic Regulators and Appropriate Foreign Regulators to Obtain Access to Swap Data Maintained by Registered Swap Data Respositories Pursuant to §§ 49.17(d)(6) and 49.18(a)
          
            ER12JN18.000
          

          The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the [name of foreign/domestic regulator (“ABC”)] (each an “Authority” and collectively the “Authorities”) have entered into this Confidentiality Arrangement (“Arrangement”) in connection with [whichever is applicable] [CFTC Regulation 49.17(b)(1)[(i)-(vi)]/the determination order issued by the CFTC to [ABC] (“Order”)] and any request for swap data by [ABC] to any swap data repository (“SDR”) registered with the CFTC.
          Article One: General Provisions

          1. ABC is permitted to request and receive swap data directly from a registered SDR (“Swap Data”) on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Arrangement.
          2. This Arrangement is entered into to fulfill the requirements under Section 21(d) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”) and CFTC Regulation 49.18. Upon receipt by a registered SDR, this Arrangement will satisfy the requirement for a written agreement pursuant to Section 21(d) of the Act and CFTC Regulation 49.17(d)(6). This Arrangement does not apply to information that is [reported to a registered SDR pursuant to [ABC]'s regulatory regime where the SDR also is registered with [ABC] pursuant to separate statutory authority, even if such information also is reported pursuant to the Act and CFTC regulations][reported to a registered SDR pursuant to [ABC]'s regulatory regime where the SDR also is registered with, or recognized or otherwise authorized by, [ABC], which has supervisory authority over the repository pursuant to foreign law and/or regulation, even if such information also is reported pursuant to the Act and CFTC regulations.] 1
            
          
          
            
              1 The first bracketed phrase will be used for ADRs; the second will be used for AFRs. The inapplicable phrase will be deleted.
          
          3. This Arrangement is not intended to limit or condition the discretion of an Authority in any way in the discharge of its regulatory responsibilities or to prejudice the individual responsibilities or autonomy of any Authority.
          4. This Arrangement does not alter the terms and conditions of any existing arrangements.
          Article Two: Confidentiality of Swap Data
          5. ABC will be acting within the scope of its jurisdiction in requesting Swap Data and employs procedures to maintain the confidentiality of Swap Data and any information and analyses derived therefrom (collectively, the “Confidential Information”). ABC undertakes to notify the CFTC and each relevant SDR promptly of any change to ABC's scope of jurisdiction.
          6. ABC undertakes to treat Confidential Information as confidential and will employ safeguards that:
          a. To the maximum extent practicable, identify the Confidential Information and maintain it separately from other data and information;
          b. Protect the Confidential Information from misappropriation and misuse;
          c. Ensure that only authorized ABC personnel with a need to access particular Confidential Information to perform their job functions related to such Confidential Information have access thereto, and that such access is permitted only to the extent necessary to perform their job functions related to such particular Confidential Information;
          d. Prevent the disclosure of aggregated Confidential Information; provided, however, that ABC is permitted to disclose any sufficiently aggregated Confidential Information that is anonymized to prevent identification, through disaggregation or otherwise, of a market participant's business transactions, trade data, market positions, customers or counterparties;
          e. Prohibit use of the Confidential Information by ABC personnel for any improper purpose, including in connection with trading for their personal benefit or for the benefit of others or with respect to any commercial or business purpose; and
          f. Include a process for monitoring compliance with the confidentiality safeguards described herein and for promptly notifying the CFTC, and each SDR from which ABC has received Swap Data, of any violation of such safeguards or failure to fulfill the terms of this Arrangement.
          7. Except as provided in Paragraphs 6.d. and 8, ABC will not onward share or otherwise disclose any Confidential Information.
          8. ABC undertakes that:
          a. If a department, central bank, or agency of the Government of the United States, it will not disclose Confidential Information except in an action or proceeding under the laws of the United States to which it, the CFTC, or the United States is a party;

          b. If a department or agency of a State or political subdivision thereof, it will not disclose Confidential Information except in connection with an adjudicatory action or proceeding brought under the Act or the laws of [name of either the State or the State and political subdivision] to which it is a party; or

          c. If a foreign futures authority or a department, central bank, ministry, or agency of a foreign government or subdivision thereof, or any other Foreign Regulator, as defined in Commission Regulation 49.2(a)(5), it will not disclose Confidential Information except in connection with an adjudicatory action or proceeding brought under the laws of [name of country, political subdivision, or (if a supranational organization) supranational lawmaking body] to which it is a party.
          9. Prior to complying with any legally enforceable demand for Confidential Information, ABC will notify the CFTC of such demand in writing, assert all available appropriate legal exemptions or privileges with respect to such Confidential Information, and use its best efforts to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information.
          10. ABC acknowledges that, if it does not fulfill the terms of this Arrangement, the CFTC may direct any registered SDR to suspend or revoke ABC's access to Swap Data.

          11. ABC will comply with all applicable security-related requirements imposed by an SDR in connection with access to Swap Data maintained by the SDR, as such requirements may be revised from time to time.
          12. ABC will promptly destroy all Confidential Information for which it no longer has a need or which no longer falls within the scope of its jurisdiction, and will certify to the CFTC, upon request, that ABC has destroyed such Confidential Information.
          Article Three: Administrative Provisions
          13. This Arrangement may be amended with the written consent of the Authorities.
          14. The text of this Arrangement will be executed in English, and may be made available to the public.
          15. On the date this Arrangement is signed by the Authorities, it will become effective and may be provided to any registered SDR that holds and maintains Swap Data that falls within the scope of ABC's jurisdiction.
          16. This Arrangement will expire 30 days after any Authority gives written notice to the other Authority of its intention to terminate the Arrangement. In the event of termination of this Arrangement, Confidential Information will continue to remain confidential and will continue to be covered by this Arrangement.

          This Arrangement is executed in duplicate, this ___ day of ___.

If ABC is enumerated in Commission Regulations 49.17(b)(1)(i)-(vi), it must attach a sufficiently detailed description of the scope of ABC's jurisdiction as it relates to Swap Data maintained by SDRs. In both cases, the description of the scope of jurisdiction must include elements allowing SDRs to establish, without undue obstacles, objective parameters for determining whether a particular Swap Data request falls within such scope of jurisdiction. Such elements could include LEIs of all jurisdictional entities and could also include UPIs of all jurisdictional products or, if no CFTC-approved UPI and product classification system is yet available, the internal product identifier or product description used by an SDR from which Swap Data is to be sought.]

            (1) After prior notice to the Commission, to determine whether one or more swaps submitted by a derivatives clearing organization under § 39.5 falls within a class of swaps as described in § 50.4, provided that inclusion of such swaps is consistent with the Commission's clearing requirement determination for that class of swaps; and
            (2) To notify all relevant derivatives clearing organizations of that determination.

            (b) The Director of the Division of Clearing and Risk may submit to the Commission for its consideration any matter which has been delegated in this section.

            § 50.25
            Clearing requirement compliance schedule.
            (a) Definitions. For the purposes of this paragraph:
            
              Active fund means any private fund as defined in section 202(a) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, that is not a third-party subaccount and that executes 200 or more swaps per month based on a monthly average over the 12 months preceding the Commission issuing a clearing requirement determination under section 2(h)(2) of the Act.
            
              Category 1 Entity means a swap dealer, a security-based swap dealer; a major swap participant; a major security-based swap participant; or an active fund.
            
              Category 2 Entity means a commodity pool; a private fund as defined in section 202(a) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 other than an active fund; or a person predominantly engaged in activities that are in the business of banking, or in activities that are financial in nature as defined in section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, provided that, in each case, the entity is not a third-party subaccount.
            
              Third-party Subaccount means an account that is managed by an investment manager that is independent of and unaffiliated with the account's beneficial owner or sponsor, and is responsible for the documentation necessary for the account's beneficial owner to clear swaps.
            (b) Upon issuing a clearing requirement determination under section 2(h)(2) of the Act, the Commission may determine, based on the group, category, type, or class of swaps subject to such determination, that the following schedule for compliance with the requirements of section 2(h)(1)(A) of the Act shall apply:

            (1) A swap between a Category 1 Entity and another Category 1 Entity, or any other entity that desires to clear the transaction, must comply with the requirements of section 2(h)(1)(A) of the Act no later than ninety (90) days from the date of publication of such clearing requirement determination in the Federal Register.
            

            (2) A swap between a Category 2 Entity and a Category 1 Entity, another Category 2 Entity, or any other entity that desires to clear the transaction, must comply with the requirements of section 2(h)(1)(A) of the Act no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days from the date of publication of such clearing requirement determination in the Federal Register.

            § 50.50
            Exceptions to the clearing requirement.
            (a) Non-financial entities. (1) A counterparty to a swap may elect the exception to the clearing requirement under section 2(h)(7)(A) of the Act if the counterparty:

A counterparty that satisfies the criteria in this paragraph (a)(1) and elects the exception is an “electing counterparty.”
            (2) If there is more than one electing counterparty to a swap, the information specified in paragraph (b) of this section shall be provided with respect to each of the electing counterparties.
            (b) Reporting. (1) When a counterparty elects the exception to the clearing requirement under section 2(h)(7)(A) of the Act, one of the counterparties to the swap (the “reporting counterparty,” as determined in accordance with § 45.8 of this part) shall provide, or cause to be provided, the following information to a registered swap data repository or, if no registered swap data repository is available to receive the information from the reporting counterparty, to the Commission, in the form and manner specified by the Commission:
            (i) Notice of the election of the exception;
            (ii) The identity of the electing counterparty to the swap; and
            (iii) The following information, unless such information has previously been provided by the electing counterparty in a current annual filing pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section:
            (A) Whether the electing counterparty is a “financial entity” as defined in section 2(h)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, and if the electing counterparty is a financial entity, whether it is:
            (1) Electing the exception in accordance with section 2(h)(7)(C)(iii) or section 2(h)(7)(D) of the Act; or
            (2) Exempt from the definition of “financial entity” as described in paragraph (d) of this section;
            (B) Whether the swap or swaps for which the electing counterparty is electing the exception are used by the electing counterparty to hedge or mitigate commercial risk as provided in paragraph (c) of this section;
            (C) How the electing counterparty generally meets its financial obligations associated with entering into non-cleared swaps by identifying one or more of the following categories, as applicable:
            (1) A written credit support agreement;
            (2) Pledged or segregated assets (including posting or receiving margin pursuant to a credit support agreement or otherwise);
            (3) A written third-party guarantee;
            (4) The electing counterparty's available financial resources; or
            (5) Means other than those described in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii)(C)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this section; and
            (D) Whether the electing counterparty is an entity that is an issuer of securities registered under section 12 of, or is required to file reports under section 15(d) of, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and if so:
            (1) The relevant SEC Central Index Key number for that counterparty; and
            (2) Whether an appropriate committee of that counterparty's board of directors (or equivalent body) has reviewed and approved the decision to enter into swaps that are exempt from the requirements of sections 2(h)(1) and 2(h)(8) of the Act.

            (2) An entity that qualifies for an exception to the clearing requirement under this section may report the information listed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section annually in anticipation of electing the exception for one or more swaps. Any such reporting under this paragraph shall be effective for purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section for swaps entered into by the entity for 365 days following the date of such reporting. During such period, the entity shall amend such information as necessary to reflect any material changes to the information reported.
            (3) Each reporting counterparty shall have a reasonable basis to believe that the electing counterparty meets the requirements for an exception to the clearing requirement under this section.
            (c) Hedging or mitigating commercial risk. For purposes of section 2(h)(7)(A)(ii) of the Act and paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, a swap is used to hedge or mitigate commercial risk if:
            (1) Such swap:
            (i) Is economically appropriate to the reduction of risks in the conduct and management of a commercial enterprise, where the risks arise from:
            (A) The potential change in the value of assets that a person owns, produces, manufactures, processes, or merchandises or reasonably anticipates owning, producing, manufacturing, processing, or merchandising in the ordinary course of business of the enterprise;
            (B) The potential change in the value of liabilities that a person has incurred or reasonably anticipates incurring in the ordinary course of business of the enterprise;
            (C) The potential change in the value of services that a person provides, purchases, or reasonably anticipates providing or purchasing in the ordinary course of business of the enterprise;
            (D) The potential change in the value of assets, services, inputs, products, or commodities that a person owns, produces, manufactures, processes, merchandises, leases, or sells, or reasonably anticipates owning, producing, manufacturing, processing, merchandising, leasing, or selling in the ordinary course of business of the enterprise;
            (E) Any potential change in value related to any of the foregoing arising from interest, currency, or foreign exchange rate movements associated with such assets, liabilities, services, inputs, products, or commodities; or
            (F) Any fluctuation in interest, currency, or foreign exchange rate exposures arising from a person's current or anticipated assets or liabilities; or
            (ii) Qualifies as bona fide hedging for purposes of an exemption from position limits under the Act; or
            (iii) Qualifies for hedging treatment under:
            (A) Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (formerly known as Statement No. 133); or
            (B) Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement 53, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Derivative Instruments; and
            (2) Such swap is:
            (i) Not used for a purpose that is in the nature of speculation, investing, or trading; and
            (ii) Not used to hedge or mitigate the risk of another swap or security-based swap position, unless that other position itself is used to hedge or mitigate commercial risk as defined by this rule or § 240.3a67-4 of this title.
            (d) For purposes of section 2(h)(7)(A) of the Act, a person that is a “financial entity” solely because of section 2(h)(7)(C)(i)(VIII) shall be exempt from the definition of “financial entity” if such person:
            (1) Is organized as a bank, as defined in section 3(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; a savings association, as defined in section 3(b) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; a farm credit system institution chartered under the Farm Credit Act of 1971; or an insured Federal credit union or State-chartered credit union under the Federal Credit Union Act; and
            (2) Has total assets of $10,000,000,000 or less on the last day of such person's most recent fiscal year.
          
          
            § 50.51
            Exemption for cooperatives.
            
              Exemption for cooperatives. Exempt cooperatives may elect not to clear certain swaps identified in paragraph (b) of this section that are otherwise subject to the clearing requirement of section 2(h)(1)(A) of the Act if the following requirements are satisfied.
            (a) For the purposes of this paragraph, an exempt cooperative means a cooperative:
            (1) Formed and existing pursuant to Federal or state law as a cooperative;
            (2) That is a “financial entity,” as defined in section 2(h)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, solely because of section 2(h)(7)(C)(i)(VIII) of the Act; and
            (3) Each member of which is not a “financial entity,” as defined in section 2(h)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, or if any member is a financial entity solely because of section 2(h)(7)(C)(i)(VIII) of the Act, such member is:
            (i) Exempt from the definition of “financial entity” pursuant to § 50.50(d); or
            (ii) A cooperative formed under Federal or state law as a cooperative and each member thereof is either not a “financial entity,” as defined in section 2(h)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, or is exempt from the definition of “financial entity” pursuant to § 50.50(d).
            (b) An exempt cooperative may elect not to clear a swap that is subject to the clearing requirement of section 2(h)(1)(A) of the Act if the swap:

            (1) Is entered into with a member of the exempt cooperative in connection with originating loan or loans for the member, which means the requirements of paragraphs (5)(i), (ii), and (iii) of the definition of swap dealer in § 1.3 of this chapter are satisfied; provided that, for this purpose, the term “insured depository institution” as used in those paragraphs is replaced with the term “exempt cooperative” and the word “customer” is replaced with the word “member”; or
            (2) Hedges or mitigates commercial risk, in accordance with § 50.50(c), related to loans to members or arising from a swap or swaps that meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
            (c) An exempt cooperative that elects the exemption provided in this section shall comply with the requirements of § 50.50(b). For this purpose, the exempt cooperative shall be the “electing counterparty,” as such term is used in § 50.50(b), and for purposes of § 50.50(b)(1)(iii)(A), the reporting counterparty, as determined pursuant to § 45.8, shall report that an exemption is being elected in accordance with this section.

            (ii) A third party, directly or indirectly, holds a majority ownership interest in both counterparties, and the third party reports its financial statements on a consolidated basis under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or International Financial Reporting Standards, and such consolidated financial statements include the financial results of both of the swap counterparties.
            (2) For purposes of this section:

            (2) Neither eligible affiliate counterparty is affiliated with an entity that is a swap dealer or major swap participant, as defined in § 1.3.
            (iii) If an eligible affiliate counterparty located in the United States enters into swaps, which are included in a class of swaps identified in § 50.4, with eligible affiliate counterparties located in jurisdictions other than the United States, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, and the aggregate notional value of such swaps, which are included in a class of swaps identified in § 50.4, does not exceed five percent of the aggregate notional value of all swaps, which are included in a class of swaps identified in § 50.4, in each instance the notional value as measured in U.S. dollar equivalents and calculated for each calendar quarter, entered into by the eligible affiliate counterparty located in the United States, then such swaps shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section until March 11, 2014, provided that:

            (2) For each electing eligible affiliate counterparty, how the counterparty generally meets its financial obligations associated with entering into non-cleared swaps by identifying one or more of the following categories, as applicable:
            (i) A written credit support agreement;
            (ii) Pledged or segregated assets (including posting or receiving margin pursuant to a credit support agreement or otherwise);

            (v) Means other than those described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this section; and
            (3) If an electing eligible affiliate counterparty is an entity that is an issuer of securities registered under section 12 of, or is required to file reports under section 15(d) of, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934:
            (i) The relevant SEC Central Index Key number for that counterparty; and
            (ii) Acknowledgment that an appropriate committee of the board of directors (or equivalent body) of the eligible affiliate counterparty has reviewed and approved the decision to enter into swaps that are exempt from the requirements of section 2(h)(1) and 2(h)(8) of the Act.
            (d) Annual reporting. An eligible affiliate counterparty that qualifies for the exemption described in paragraph (a) of this section may report the information listed in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section annually in anticipation of electing the exemption for one or more swaps. Any such reporting by a reporting counterparty under this paragraph will be effective for purposes of paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section for 365 days following the date of such reporting. During the 365-day period, the reporting counterparty shall amend the report as necessary to reflect any material changes to the information reported. Each reporting counterparty shall have a reasonable basis to believe that the eligible affiliate counterparties meet the requirements for the exemption under this section.

Except as otherwise provided under section 13 of the BHC Act, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the prohibitions and restrictions under section 13 of the BHC Act shall apply to the activities of an applicable banking entity, even if such activities are authorized for the applicable banking entity under other applicable provisions of law.

            Limitations on permitted proprietary trading activities.
            (a) No transaction, class of transactions, or activity may be deemed permissible under §§ 75.4 through 75.6 if the transaction, class of transactions, or activity would:
            (1) Involve or result in a material conflict of interest between the banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties;

            (3) Pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the banking entity or to the financial stability of the United States.
            (b) Definition of material conflict of interest. (1) For purposes of this section, a material conflict of interest between a banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties exists if the banking entity engages in any transaction, class of transactions, or activity that would involve or result in the banking entity's interests being materially adverse to the interests of its client, customer, or counterparty with respect to such transaction, class of transactions, or activity, and the banking entity has not taken at least one of the actions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
            (2) Prior to effecting the specific transaction or class or type of transactions, or engaging in the specific activity, the banking entity:
            (i) Timely and effective disclosure. (A) Has made clear, timely, and effective disclosure of the conflict of interest, together with other necessary information, in reasonable detail and in a manner sufficient to permit a reasonable client, customer, or counterparty to meaningfully understand the conflict of interest; and
            (B) Such disclosure is made in a manner that provides the client, customer, or counterparty the opportunity to negate, or substantially mitigate, any materially adverse effect on the client, customer, or counterparty created by the conflict of interest; or
            (ii) Information barriers. Has established, maintained, and enforced information barriers that are memorialized in written policies and procedures, such as physical separation of personnel, or functions, or limitations on types of activity, that are reasonably designed, taking into consideration the nature of the banking entity's business, to prevent the conflict of interest from involving or resulting in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty. A banking entity may not rely on such information barriers if, in the case of any specific transaction, class or type of transactions or activity, the banking entity knows or should reasonably know that, notwithstanding the banking entity's establishment of information barriers, the conflict of interest may involve or result in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty.
            (c) Definition of high-risk asset and high-risk trading strategy. For purposes of this section:
            (1) High-risk asset means an asset or group of related assets that would, if held by a banking entity, significantly increase the likelihood that the banking entity would incur a substantial financial loss or would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.
            (2) High-risk trading strategy means a trading strategy that would, if engaged in by a banking entity, significantly increase the likelihood that the banking entity would incur a substantial financial loss or would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.

            (1) Those activities are conducted in accordance with the requirements of § 75.4(a) or (b), respectively;

            (2) With respect to any banking entity (or any affiliate thereof) that acts as a sponsor, investment adviser or commodity trading advisor to a particular covered fund or otherwise acquires and retains an ownership interest in such covered fund in reliance on paragraph (a) of this section; acquires and retains an ownership interest in such covered fund and is either a securitizer, as that term is used in section 15G(a)(3) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-11(a)(3)), or is acquiring and retaining an ownership interest in such covered fund in compliance with section 15G of that Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-11) and the implementing regulations issued thereunder each as permitted by paragraph (b) of this section; or, directly or indirectly, guarantees, assumes, or otherwise insures the obligations or performance of the covered fund or of any covered fund in which such fund invests, then in each such case any ownership interests acquired or retained by the banking entity and its affiliates in connection with underwriting and market making related activities for that particular covered fund are included in the calculation of ownership interests permitted to be held by the banking entity and its affiliates under the limitations of § 75.12(a)(2)(ii) and (d); and
            (3) With respect to any banking entity, the aggregate value of all ownership interests of the banking entity and its affiliates in all covered funds acquired and retained under § 75.11, including all covered funds in which the banking entity holds an ownership interest in connection with underwriting and market making related activities permitted under paragraph (c) of this section, are included in the calculation of all ownership interests under § 75.12(a)(2)(iii) and (d).
          
          
            § 75.12
            Permitted investment in a covered fund.
            (a) Authority and limitations on permitted investments in covered funds. (1) Notwithstanding the prohibition contained in § 75.10(a), a banking entity may acquire and retain an ownership interest in a covered fund that the banking entity or an affiliate thereof organizes and offers pursuant to § 75.11, for the purposes of:
            (i) Establishment. Establishing the fund and providing the fund with sufficient initial equity for investment to permit the fund to attract unaffiliated investors, subject to the limits contained in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(iii) of this section; or
            (ii) De minimis investment. Making and retaining an investment in the covered fund subject to the limits contained in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (a)(2)(iii) of this section.
            (2) Investment limits—(i) Seeding period. With respect to an investment in any covered fund made or held pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the banking entity and its affiliates:
            (A) Must actively seek unaffiliated investors to reduce, through redemption, sale, dilution, or other methods, the aggregate amount of all ownership interests of the banking entity in the covered fund to the amount permitted in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section; and
            (B) Must, no later than 1 year after the date of establishment of the fund (or such longer period as may be provided by the Board pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section), conform its ownership interest in the covered fund to the limits in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section;
            (ii) Per-fund limits. (A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, an investment by a banking entity and its affiliates in any covered fund made or held pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section may not exceed 3 percent of the total number or value of the outstanding ownership interests of the fund.

            (B) An investment by a banking entity and its affiliates in a covered fund that is an issuing entity of asset-backed securities may not exceed 3 percent of the total fair market value of the ownership interests of the fund measured in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, unless a greater percentage is retained by the banking entity and its affiliates in compliance with the requirements of section 15G of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-11) and the implementing regulations issued thereunder, in which case the investment by the banking entity and its affiliates in the covered fund may not exceed the amount, number, or value of ownership interests of the fund required under section 15G of the Exchange Act and the implementing regulations issued thereunder.
            (iii) Aggregate limit. The aggregate value of all ownership interests of the banking entity and its affiliates in all covered funds acquired or retained under this section may not exceed 3 percent of the tier 1 capital of the banking entity, as provided under paragraph (c) of this section, and shall be calculated as of the last day of each calendar quarter.
            (iv) Date of establishment. For purposes of this section, the date of establishment of a covered fund shall be:
            (A) In general. The date on which the investment adviser or similar entity to the covered fund begins making investments pursuant to the written investment strategy for the fund;
            (B) Issuing entities of asset-backed securities. In the case of an issuing entity of asset-backed securities, the date on which the assets are initially transferred into the issuing entity of asset-backed securities.
            (b) Rules of construction—(1) Attribution of ownership interests to a covered banking entity. (i) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the amount and value of a banking entity's permitted investment in any single covered fund shall include any ownership interest held under § 75.12 directly by the banking entity, including any affiliate of the banking entity.
            (ii) Treatment of registered investment companies, SEC-regulated business development companies and foreign public funds. For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, a registered investment company, SEC-regulated business development companies or foreign public fund as described in § 75.10(c)(1) will not be considered to be an affiliate of the banking entity so long as the banking entity:
            (A) Does not own, control, or hold with the power to vote 25 percent or more of the voting shares of the company or fund; and
            (B) Provides investment advisory, commodity trading advisory, administrative, and other services to the company or fund in compliance with the limitations under applicable regulation, order, or other authority.
            (iii) Covered funds. For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, a covered fund will not be considered to be an affiliate of a banking entity so long as the covered fund is held in compliance with the requirements of this subpart.
            (iv) Treatment of employee and director investments financed by the banking entity. For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, an investment by a director or employee of a banking entity who acquires an ownership interest in his or her personal capacity in a covered fund sponsored by the banking entity will be attributed to the banking entity if the banking entity, directly or indirectly, extends financing for the purpose of enabling the director or employee to acquire the ownership interest in the fund and the financing is used to acquire such ownership interest in the covered fund.
            (2) Calculation of permitted ownership interests in a single covered fund. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) or (4) of this section, for purposes of determining whether an investment in a single covered fund complies with the restrictions on ownership interests under paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B) and (ii)(A) of this section:
            (i) The aggregate number of the outstanding ownership interests held by the banking entity shall be the total number of ownership interests held under this section by the banking entity in a covered fund divided by the total number of ownership interests held by all entities in that covered fund, as of the last day of each calendar quarter (both measured without regard to committed funds not yet called for investment);

            (ii) The aggregate value of the outstanding ownership interests held by the banking entity shall be the aggregate fair market value of all investments in and capital contributions made to the covered fund by the banking entity, divided by the value of all investments in and capital contributions made to that covered fund by all entities, as of the last day of each calendar quarter (all measured without regard to committed funds not yet called for investment). If fair market value cannot be determined, then the value shall be the historical cost basis of all investments in and contributions made by the banking entity to the covered fund;
            
            (iii) For purposes of the calculation under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, once a valuation methodology is chosen, the banking entity must calculate the value of its investment and the investments of all others in the covered fund in the same manner and according to the same standards.
            (3) Issuing entities of asset-backed securities. In the case of an ownership interest in an issuing entity of asset-backed securities, for purposes of determining whether an investment in a single covered fund complies with the restrictions on ownership interests under paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B) and (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section:
            (i) For securitizations subject to the requirements of section 15G of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-11), the calculations shall be made as of the date and according to the valuation methodology applicable pursuant to the requirements of section 15G of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-11) and the implementing regulations issued thereunder; or
            (ii) For securitization transactions completed prior to the compliance date of such implementing regulations (or as to which such implementing regulations do not apply), the calculations shall be made as of the date of establishment as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section or such earlier date on which the transferred assets have been valued for purposes of transfer to the covered fund, and thereafter only upon the date on which additional securities of the issuing entity of asset-backed securities are priced for purposes of the sales of ownership interests to unaffiliated investors.
            (iii) For securitization transactions completed prior to the compliance date of such implementing regulations (or as to which such implementing regulations do not apply), the aggregate value of the outstanding ownership interests in the covered fund shall be the fair market value of the assets transferred to the issuing entity of the securitization and any other assets otherwise held by the issuing entity at such time, determined in a manner that is consistent with its determination of the fair market value of those assets for financial statement purposes.
            (iv) For purposes of the calculation under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, the valuation methodology used to calculate the fair market value of the ownership interests must be the same for both the ownership interests held by a banking entity and the ownership interests held by all others in the covered fund in the same manner and according to the same standards.
            (4) Multi-tier fund investments—(i) Master-feeder fund investments. If the principal investment strategy of a covered fund (the “feeder fund”) is to invest substantially all of its assets in another single covered fund (the “master fund”), then for purposes of the investment limitations in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the banking entity's permitted investment in such funds shall be measured only by reference to the value of the master fund. The banking entity's permitted investment in the master fund shall include any investment by the banking entity in the master fund, as well as the banking entity's pro-rata share of any ownership interest of the master fund that is held through the feeder fund; and
            (ii) Fund-of-funds investments. If a banking entity organizes and offers a covered fund pursuant to § 75.11 for the purpose of investing in other covered funds (a “fund of funds”) and that fund of funds itself invests in another covered fund that the banking entity is permitted to own, then the banking entity's permitted investment in that other fund shall include any investment by the banking entity in that other fund, as well as the banking entity's pro-rata share of any ownership interest of the fund that is held through the fund of funds. The investment of the banking entity may not represent more than 3 percent of the amount or value of any single covered fund.
            (c) Aggregate permitted investments in all covered funds. (1) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the aggregate value of all ownership interests held by a banking entity shall be the sum of all amounts paid or contributed by the banking entity in connection with acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in covered funds (together with any amounts paid by the entity (or employee thereof) in connection with obtaining a restricted profit interest under § 75.10(d)(6)(ii)), on a historical cost basis.
            (2) Calculation of tier 1 capital. For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section:
            (i) Entities that are required to hold and report tier 1 capital. If a banking entity is required to calculate and report tier 1 capital, the banking entity's tier 1 capital shall be equal to the amount of tier 1 capital of the banking entity as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter, as reported to its primary financial regulatory agency; and
            (ii) If a banking entity is not required to calculate and report tier 1 capital, the banking entity's tier 1 capital shall be determined to be equal to:
            (A) In the case of a banking entity that is controlled, directly or indirectly, by a depository institution that calculates and reports tier 1 capital, be equal to the amount of tier 1 capital reported by such controlling depository institution in the manner described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section;
            (B) In the case of a banking entity that is not controlled, directly or indirectly, by a depository institution that calculates and reports tier 1 capital:
            (1) Bank holding company subsidiaries. If the banking entity is a subsidiary of a bank holding company or company that is treated as a bank holding company, be equal to the amount of tier 1 capital reported by the top-tier affiliate of such covered banking entity that calculates and reports tier 1 capital in the manner described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section; and
            (2) Other holding companies and any subsidiary or affiliate thereof. If the banking entity is not a subsidiary of a bank holding company or a company that is treated as a bank holding company, be equal to the total amount of shareholders' equity of the top-tier affiliate within such organization as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter that has ended, as determined under applicable accounting standards.
            (iii) Treatment of foreign banking entities—(A) Foreign banking entities. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, with respect to a banking entity that is not itself, and is not controlled directly or indirectly by, a banking entity that is located or organized under the laws of the United States or of any State, the tier 1 capital of the banking entity shall be the consolidated tier 1 capital of the entity as calculated under applicable home country standards.
            (B) U.S. affiliates of foreign banking entities. With respect to a banking entity that is located or organized under the laws of the United States or of any State and is controlled by a foreign banking entity identified under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the banking entity's tier 1 capital shall be as calculated under paragraphs (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section.
            (d) Capital treatment for a permitted investment in a covered fund. For purposes of calculating compliance with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, a banking entity shall deduct from the banking entity's tier 1 capital (as determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) the greater of:
            (1) The sum of all amounts paid or contributed by the banking entity in connection with acquiring or retaining an ownership interest (together with any amounts paid by the entity (or employee thereof) in connection with obtaining a restricted profit interest under § 75.10(d)(6)(ii)), on a historical cost basis, plus any earnings received; and
            (2) The fair market value of the banking entity's ownership interests in the covered fund as determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (3) of this section (together with any amounts paid by the entity (or employee thereof) in connection with obtaining a restricted profit interest under § 75.10(d)(6)(ii)), if the banking entity accounts for the profits (or losses) of the fund investment in its financial statements.
            (e) Extension of time to divest an ownership interest. (1) Upon application by a banking entity, the Board may extend the period under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section for up to 2 additional years if the Board finds that an extension would be consistent with safety and soundness and not detrimental to the public interest. An application for extension must:

            (i) Be submitted to the Board at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the applicable time period;
            
            (ii) Provide the reasons for application, including information that addresses the factors in paragraph (e)(2) of this section; and
            (iii) Explain the banking entity's plan for reducing the permitted investment in a covered fund through redemption, sale, dilution or other methods as required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
            (2) Factors governing Board determinations. In reviewing any application under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Board may consider all the facts and circumstances related to the permitted investment in a covered fund, including:
            (i) Whether the investment would result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure by the banking entity to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies;
            (ii) The contractual terms governing the banking entity's interest in the covered fund;
            (iii) The date on which the covered fund is expected to have attracted sufficient investments from investors unaffiliated with the banking entity to enable the banking entity to comply with the limitations in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section;
            (iv) The total exposure of the covered banking entity to the investment and the risks that disposing of, or maintaining, the investment in the covered fund may pose to the banking entity and the financial stability of the United States;
            (v) The cost to the banking entity of divesting or disposing of the investment within the applicable period;
            (vi) Whether the investment or the divestiture or conformance of the investment would involve or result in a material conflict of interest between the banking entity and unaffiliated parties, including clients, customers or counterparties to which it owes a duty;
            (vii) The banking entity's prior efforts to reduce through redemption, sale, dilution, or other methods its ownership interests in the covered fund, including activities related to the marketing of interests in such covered fund;
            (viii) Market conditions; and
            (ix) Any other factor that the Board believes appropriate.
            (3) Authority to impose restrictions on activities or investment during any extension period. The Board may impose such conditions on any extension approved under paragraph (e)(1) of this section as the Board determines are necessary or appropriate to protect the safety and soundness of the banking entity or the financial stability of the United States, address material conflicts of interest or other unsound banking practices, or otherwise further the purposes of section 13 of the BHC Act and this part.
            (4) Consultation. In the case of a banking entity that is primarily regulated by another Federal banking agency, the SEC, or the CFTC, the Board will consult with such agency prior to acting on an application by the banking entity for an extension under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

            (D) Is subject to continuing review, monitoring and management by the banking entity.
            (iii) The compensation arrangement relates solely to the covered fund in which the banking entity or any affiliate has acquired an ownership interest pursuant to this paragraph and such compensation arrangement provides that any losses incurred by the banking entity on such ownership interest will be offset by corresponding decreases in amounts payable under such compensation arrangement.
            (b) Certain permitted covered fund activities and investments outside of the United States. (1) The prohibition contained in § 75.10(a) does not apply to the acquisition or retention of any ownership interest in, or the sponsorship of, a covered fund by a banking entity only if:

            § 75.14
            Limitations on relationships with a covered fund.
            (a) Relationships with a covered fund. (1) Except as provided for in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, no banking entity that serves, directly or indirectly, as the investment manager, investment adviser, commodity trading advisor, or sponsor to a covered fund, that organizes and offers a covered fund pursuant to § 75.11, or that continues to hold an ownership interest in accordance with § 75.11(b), and no affiliate of such entity, may enter into a transaction with the covered fund, or with any other covered fund that is controlled by such covered fund, that would be a covered transaction as defined in section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371c(b)(7)), as if such banking entity and the affiliate thereof were a member bank and the covered fund were an affiliate thereof.
            (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a banking entity may:
            (i) Acquire and retain any ownership interest in a covered fund in accordance with the requirements of § 75.11, § 75.12, or § 75.13; and
            (ii) Enter into any prime brokerage transaction with any covered fund in which a covered fund managed, sponsored, or advised by such banking entity (or an affiliate thereof) has taken an ownership interest, if:
            (A) The banking entity is in compliance with each of the limitations set forth in § 75.11 with respect to a covered fund organized and offered by such banking entity (or an affiliate thereof);

            (B) The chief executive officer (or equivalent officer) of the banking entity certifies in writing annually to the Commission (with a duty to update the certification if the information in the certification materially changes) that the banking entity does not, directly or indirectly, guarantee, assume, or otherwise insure the obligations or performance of the covered fund or of any covered fund in which such covered fund invests; and
            (C) The Board has not determined that such transaction is inconsistent with the safe and sound operation and condition of the banking entity.
            (b) Restrictions on transactions with covered funds. A banking entity that serves, directly or indirectly, as the investment manager, investment adviser, commodity trading advisor, or sponsor to a covered fund, or that organizes and offers a covered fund pursuant to § 75.11, or that continues to hold an ownership interest in accordance with § 75.11(b), shall be subject to section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371c-1), as if such banking entity were a member bank and such covered fund were an affiliate thereof.
            (c) Restrictions on prime brokerage transactions. A prime brokerage transaction permitted under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section shall be subject to section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371c-1) as if the counterparty were an affiliate of the banking entity.
          
          
            § 75.15
            Other limitations on permitted covered fund activities.
            (a) No transaction, class of transactions, or activity may be deemed permissible under §§ 75.11 through 75.13 if the transaction, class of transactions, or activity would:
            (1) Involve or result in a material conflict of interest between the banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties;
            (2) Result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure by the banking entity to a high-risk asset or a high-risk trading strategy; or
            (3) Pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the banking entity or to the financial stability of the United States.
            (b) Definition of material conflict of interest. (1) For purposes of this section, a material conflict of interest between a banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties exists if the banking entity engages in any transaction, class of transactions, or activity that would involve or result in the banking entity's interests being materially adverse to the interests of its client, customer, or counterparty with respect to such transaction, class of transactions, or activity, and the banking entity has not taken at least one of the actions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
            (2) Prior to effecting the specific transaction or class or type of transactions, or engaging in the specific activity, the banking entity:
            (i) Timely and effective disclosure. (A) Has made clear, timely, and effective disclosure of the conflict of interest, together with other necessary information, in reasonable detail and in a manner sufficient to permit a reasonable client, customer, or counterparty to meaningfully understand the conflict of interest; and
            (B) Such disclosure is made in a manner that provides the client, customer, or counterparty the opportunity to negate, or substantially mitigate, any materially adverse effect on the client, customer, or counterparty created by the conflict of interest; or
            (ii) Information barriers. Has established, maintained, and enforced information barriers that are memorialized in written policies and procedures, such as physical separation of personnel, or functions, or limitations on types of activity, that are reasonably designed, taking into consideration the nature of the banking entity's business, to prevent the conflict of interest from involving or resulting in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty. A banking entity may not rely on such information barriers if, in the case of any specific transaction, class or type of transactions or activity, the banking entity knows or should reasonably know that, notwithstanding the banking entity's establishment of information barriers, the conflict of interest may involve or result in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty.
            (c) Definition of high-risk asset and high-risk trading strategy. For purposes of this section:
            (1) High-risk asset means an asset or group of related assets that would, if held by a banking entity, significantly increase the likelihood that the banking entity would incur a substantial financial loss or would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.
            (2) High-risk trading strategy means a trading strategy that would, if engaged in by a banking entity, significantly increase the likelihood that the banking entity would incur a substantial financial loss or would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.
          
          
            § 75.16
            Ownership of interests in and sponsorship of issuers of certain collateralized debt obligations backed by trust-preferred securities.
            (a) The prohibition contained in § 75.10(a)(1) does not apply to the ownership by a banking entity of an interest in, or sponsorship of, any issuer if:
            (1) The issuer was established, and the interest was issued, before May 19, 2010;
            (2) The banking entity reasonably believes that the offering proceeds received by the issuer were invested primarily in Qualifying TruPS Collateral; and
            (3) The banking entity acquired such interest on or before December 10, 2013 (or acquired such interest in connection with a merger with or acquisition of a banking entity that acquired the interest on or before December 10, 2013).
            (b) For purposes of this § 75.16, Qualifying TruPS Collateral shall mean any trust preferred security or subordinated debt instrument issued prior to May 19, 2010 by a depository institution holding company that, as of the end of any reporting period within 12 months immediately preceding the issuance of such trust preferred security or subordinated debt instrument, had total consolidated assets of less than $15,000,000,000 or issued prior to May 19, 2010 by a mutual holding company.
            (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a banking entity may act as a market maker with respect to the interests of an issuer described in paragraph (a) of this section in accordance with the applicable provisions of §§ 75.4 and 75.11.
            (d) Without limiting the applicability of paragraph (a) of this section, the Board, the FDIC and the OCC will make public a non-exclusive list of issuers that meet the requirements of paragraph (a). A banking entity may rely on the list published by the Board, the FDIC and the OCC.

            (3) The Commission notifies the banking entity in writing that it must satisfy the requirements and other standards contained in appendix B of this part.
            (d) Reporting requirements under appendix A of this part. (1) A banking entity engaged in proprietary trading activity permitted under subpart B of this part shall comply with the reporting requirements described in appendix A of this part, if:
            (i) The banking entity (other than a foreign banking entity as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section) has, together with its affiliates and subsidiaries, trading assets and liabilities (excluding trading assets and liabilities involving obligations of or guaranteed by the United States or any agency of the United States) the average gross sum of which (on a worldwide consolidated basis) over the previous consecutive four quarters, as measured as of the last day of each of the four prior calendar quarters, equals or exceeds the threshold established in paragraph (d)(2) of this section;
            (ii) In the case of a foreign banking entity, the average gross sum of the trading assets and liabilities of the combined U.S. operations of the foreign banking entity (including all subsidiaries, affiliates, branches and agencies of the foreign banking entity operating, located or organized in the United States and excluding trading assets and liabilities involving obligations of or guaranteed by the United States or any agency of the United States) over the previous consecutive four quarters, as measured as of the last day of each of the four prior calendar quarters, equals or exceeds the threshold established in paragraph (d)(2) of this section; or

            (3) Frequency of reporting. Unless the Commission notifies the banking entity in writing that it must report on a different basis, a banking entity with $50 billion or more in trading assets and liabilities (as calculated in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section) shall report the information required by appendix A of this part for each calendar month within 30 days of the end of the relevant calendar month; beginning with information for the month of January 2015, such information shall be reported within 10 days of the end of each calendar month. Any other banking entity subject to appendix A of this part shall report the information required by appendix A of this part for each calendar quarter within 30 days of the end of that calendar quarter unless the Commission notifies the banking entity in writing that it must report on a different basis.
            (e) Additional documentation for covered funds. Any banking entity that has more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets as reported on December 31 of the previous two calendar years shall maintain records that include:
            (1) Documentation of the exclusions or exemptions other than sections 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 relied on by each fund sponsored by the banking entity (including all subsidiaries and affiliates) in determining that such fund is not a covered fund;
            (2) For each fund sponsored by the banking entity (including all subsidiaries and affiliates) for which the banking entity relies on one or more of the exclusions from the definition of covered fund provided by § 75.10(c)(1), (5), (8), (9), or (10), documentation supporting the banking entity's determination that the fund is not a covered fund pursuant to one or more of those exclusions;
            (3) For each seeding vehicle described in § 75.10(c)(12)(i) or (iii) that will become a registered investment company or SEC-regulated business development company, a written plan documenting the banking entity's determination that the seeding vehicle will become a registered investment company or SEC-regulated business development company; the period of time during which the vehicle will operate as a seeding vehicle; and the banking entity's plan to market the vehicle to third-party investors and convert it into a registered investment company or SEC-regulated business development company within the time period specified in § 75.12(a)(2)(i)(B);

            (5) For purposes of paragraph (e)(4) of this section, a U.S. branch, agency, or subsidiary of a foreign banking entity is located in the United States; however, the foreign bank that operates or controls that branch, agency, or subsidiary is not considered to be located in the United States solely by virtue of operating or controlling the U.S. branch, agency, or subsidiary.
            (f) Simplified programs for less active banking entities—(1) Banking entities with no covered activities. A banking entity that does not engage in activities or investments pursuant to subpart B or subpart C of this part (other than trading activities permitted pursuant to § 75.6(a)) may satisfy the requirements of this section by establishing the required compliance program prior to becoming engaged in such activities or making such investments (other than trading activities permitted pursuant to § 75.6(a)).
            (2) Banking entities with modest activities. A banking entity with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or less as reported on December 31 of the previous two calendar years that engages in activities or investments pursuant to subpart B or subpart C of this part (other than trading activities permitted under § 75.6(a)) may satisfy the requirements of this section by including in its existing compliance policies and procedures appropriate references to the requirements of section 13 of the BHC Act and this part and adjustments as appropriate given the activities, size, scope and complexity of the banking entity.
          
          
            § 75.21
            Termination of activities or investments; penalties for violations.
            (a) Any banking entity that engages in an activity or makes an investment in violation of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part, or acts in a manner that functions as an evasion of the requirements of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part, including through an abuse of any activity or investment permitted under subparts B or C of this part, or otherwise violates the restrictions and requirements of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part, shall, upon discovery, promptly terminate the activity and, as relevant, dispose of the investment.
            (b) Whenever the Commission finds reasonable cause to believe any banking entity has engaged in an activity or made an investment in violation of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part, or engaged in any activity or made any investment that functions as an evasion of the requirements of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part, the Commission may take any action permitted by law to enforce compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part, including directing the banking entity to restrict, limit, or terminate any or all activities under this part and dispose of any investment.
          
          
            Pt. 75, App. A
            Appendix A to Part 75—Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements for Covered Trading Activities
            I. Purpose
            a. This appendix sets forth reporting and recordkeeping requirements that certain banking entities must satisfy in connection with the restrictions on proprietary trading set forth in subpart B of this part (“proprietary trading restrictions”). Pursuant to § 75.20(d), this appendix generally applies to a banking entity that, together with its affiliates and subsidiaries, has significant trading assets and liabilities. These entities are required to (i) furnish periodic reports to the Commission regarding a variety of quantitative measurements of their covered trading activities, which vary depending on the scope and size of covered trading activities, and (ii) create and maintain records documenting the preparation and content of these reports. The requirements of this appendix must be incorporated into the banking entity's internal compliance program under § 75.20 and Appendix B of this part.
            b. The purpose of this appendix is to assist banking entities and the Commission in:
            (i) Better understanding and evaluating the scope, type, and profile of the banking entity's covered trading activities;
            (ii) Monitoring the banking entity's covered trading activities;
            (iii) Identifying covered trading activities that warrant further review or examination by the banking entity to verify compliance with the proprietary trading restrictions;
            (iv) Evaluating whether the covered trading activities of trading desks engaged in market making-related activities subject to § 75.4(b) are consistent with the requirements governing permitted market making-related activities;
            (v) Evaluating whether the covered trading activities of trading desks that are engaged in permitted trading activity subject to § 75.4, 75.5, or 75.6(a) and (b) (i.e., underwriting and market making-related related activity, risk-mitigating hedging, or trading in certain government obligations) are consistent with the requirement that such activity not result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies;
            (vi) Identifying the profile of particular covered trading activities of the banking entity, and the individual trading desks of the banking entity, to help establish the appropriate frequency and scope of examination by the Commission of such activities; and
            (vii) Assessing and addressing the risks associated with the banking entity's covered trading activities.

            c. The quantitative measurements that must be furnished pursuant to this appendix are not intended to serve as a dispositive tool for the identification of permissible or impermissible activities.
            d. In order to allow banking entities and the Agencies to evaluate the effectiveness of these metrics, banking entities must collect and report these metrics for all trading desks beginning on the dates established in § 75.20. The Agencies will review the data collected and revise this collection requirement as appropriate based on a review of the data collected prior to September 30, 2015.

            e. In addition to the quantitative measurements required in this appendix, a banking entity may need to develop and implement other quantitative measurements in order to effectively monitor its covered trading activities for compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part and to have an effective compliance program, as required by § 75.20 and Appendix B of this part. The effectiveness of particular quantitative measurements may differ based on the profile of the banking entity's businesses in general and, more specifically, of the particular trading desk, including types of instruments traded, trading activities and strategies, and history and experience (e.g., whether the trading desk is an established, successful market maker or a new entrant to a competitive market). In all cases, banking entities must ensure that they have robust measures in place to identify and monitor the risks taken in their trading activities, to ensure that the activities are within risk tolerances established by the banking entity, and to monitor and examine for compliance with the proprietary trading restrictions in this part.
            f. On an ongoing basis, banking entities must carefully monitor, review, and evaluate all furnished quantitative measurements, as well as any others that they choose to utilize in order to maintain compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part. All measurement results that indicate a heightened risk of impermissible proprietary trading, including with respect to otherwise-permitted activities under §§ 75.4 through 75.6(a) and (b), or that result in a material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies, must be escalated within the banking entity for review, further analysis, explanation to the Commission, and remediation, where appropriate. The quantitative measurements discussed in this appendix should be helpful to banking entities in identifying and managing the risks related to their covered trading activities.
            II. Definitions
            The terms used in this appendix have the same meanings as set forth in §§ 75.2 and 75.3. In addition, for purposes of this appendix, the following definitions apply:
            
              Calculation period means the period of time for which a particular quantitative measurement must be calculated.
            
              Comprehensive profit and loss means the net profit or loss of a trading desk's material sources of trading revenue over a specific period of time, including, for example, any increase or decrease in the market value of a trading desk's holdings, dividend income, and interest income and expense.
            
              Covered trading activity means trading conducted by a trading desk under § 75.4, 75.5, or 75.6(a) or (b). A banking entity may include trading under § 75.3(d) or 75.6(c), (d) or (e).
            
              Measurement frequency means the frequency with which a particular quantitative metric must be calculated and recorded.
            
              Trading desk means the smallest discrete unit of organization of a banking entity that purchases or sells financial instruments for the trading account of the banking entity or an affiliate thereof.
            III. Reporting and Recordkeeping of Quantitative Measurements
            a. Scope of Required Reporting
            
              General scope. Each banking entity made subject to this part by § 75.20 must furnish the following quantitative measurements for each trading desk of the banking entity, calculated in accordance with this appendix:
            • Risk and Position Limits and Usage;
            • Risk Factor Sensitivities;
            • Value-at-Risk and Stress VaR;
            • Comprehensive Profit and Loss Attribution;
            • Inventory Turnover;
            • Inventory Aging; and
            • Customer Facing Trade Ratio
            b. Frequency of Required Calculation and Reporting
            A banking entity must calculate any applicable quantitative measurement for each trading day. A banking entity must report each applicable quantitative measurement to the Commission on the reporting schedule established in § 75.20 unless otherwise requested by the Commission. All quantitative measurements for any calendar month must be reported within the time period required by § 75.20.
            c. Recordkeeping
            A banking entity must, for any quantitative measurement furnished to the Commission pursuant to this appendix and § 75.20(d), create and maintain records documenting the preparation and content of these reports, as well as such information as is necessary to permit the Commission to verify the accuracy of such reports, for a period of 5 years from the end of the calendar year for which the measurement was taken.
            IV. Quantitative Measurements
            a. Risk-Management Measurements
            1. Risk and Position Limits and Usage
            i. Description: For purposes of this appendix, Risk and Position Limits are the constraints that define the amount of risk that a trading desk is permitted to take at a point in time, as defined by the banking entity for a specific trading desk. Usage represents the portion of the trading desk's limits that are accounted for by the current activity of the desk. Risk and position limits and their usage are key risk management tools used to control and monitor risk taking and include, but are not limited, to the limits set out in §§ 75.4 and 75.5. A number of the metrics that are described below, including “Risk Factor Sensitivities” and “Value-at-Risk and Stress Value-at-Risk,” relate to a trading desk's risk and position limits and are useful in evaluating and setting these limits in the broader context of the trading desk's overall activities, particularly for the market making activities under § 75.4(b) and hedging activity under § 75.5. Accordingly, the limits required under §§ 75.4(b)(2)(iii) and 75.5(b)(1)(i) must meet the applicable requirements under §§ 75.4(b)(2)(iii) and 75.5(b)(1)(i) and also must include appropriate metrics for the trading desk limits including, at a minimum, the “Risk Factor Sensitivities” and “Value-at-Risk and Stress Value-at-Risk” metrics except to the extent any of the “Risk Factor Sensitivities” or “Value-at-Risk and Stress Value-at-Risk” metrics are demonstrably ineffective for measuring and monitoring the risks of a trading desk based on the types of positions traded by, and risk exposures of, that desk.
            ii. General Calculation Guidance: Risk and Position Limits must be reported in the format used by the banking entity for the purposes of risk management of each trading desk. Risk and Position Limits are often expressed in terms of risk measures, such as VaR and Risk Factor Sensitivities, but may also be expressed in terms of other observable criteria, such as net open positions. When criteria other than VaR or Risk Factor Sensitivities are used to define the Risk and Position Limits, both the value of the Risk and Position Limits and the value of the variables used to assess whether these limits have been reached must be reported.
            iii. Calculation Period: One trading day.
            iv. Measurement Frequency: Daily.
            2. Risk Factor Sensitivities
            i. Description: For purposes of this appendix, Risk Factor Sensitivities are changes in a trading desk's Comprehensive Profit and Loss that are expected to occur in the event of a change in one or more underlying variables that are significant sources of the trading desk's profitability and risk.
            ii. General Calculation Guidance: A banking entity must report the Risk Factor Sensitivities that are monitored and managed as part of the trading desk's overall risk management policy. The underlying data and methods used to compute a trading desk's Risk Factor Sensitivities will depend on the specific function of the trading desk and the internal risk management models employed. The number and type of Risk Factor Sensitivities that are monitored and managed by a trading desk, and furnished to the Commission, will depend on the explicit risks assumed by the trading desk. In general, however, reported Risk Factor Sensitivities must be sufficiently granular to account for a preponderance of the expected price variation in the trading desk's holdings.
            A. Trading desks must take into account any relevant factors in calculating Risk Factor Sensitivities, including, for example, the following with respect to particular asset classes:
            • Commodity derivative positions: risk factors with respect to the related commodities set out in § 20.2 of this chapter, the maturity of the positions, volatility and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), and the maturity profile of the positions;
            • Credit positions: risk factors with respect to credit spreads that are sufficiently granular to account for specific credit sectors and market segments, the maturity profile of the positions, and risk factors with respect to interest rates of all relevant maturities;
            • Credit-related derivative positions: risk factor sensitivities, for example credit spreads, shifts (parallel and non-parallel) in credit spreads—volatility, and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), and the maturity profile of the positions;
            • Equity derivative positions: risk factor sensitivities such as equity positions, volatility, and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), and the maturity profile of the positions;
            • Equity positions: risk factors for equity prices and risk factors that differentiate between important equity market sectors and segments, such as a small capitalization equities and international equities;
            • Foreign exchange derivative positions: risk factors with respect to major currency pairs and maturities, exposure to interest rates at relevant maturities, volatility, and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), as well as the maturity profile of the positions; and
            • Interest rate positions, including interest rate derivative positions: risk factors with respect to major interest rate categories and maturities and volatility and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), and shifts (parallel and non-parallel) in the interest rate curve, as well as the maturity profile of the positions.
            B. The methods used by a banking entity to calculate sensitivities to a common factor shared by multiple trading desks, such as an equity price factor, must be applied consistently across its trading desks so that the sensitivities can be compared from one trading desk to another.
            iii. Calculation Period: One trading day.
            iv. Measurement Frequency: Daily.
            3. Value-at-Risk and Stress Value-at-Risk
            i. Description: For purposes of this appendix, Value-at-Risk (“VaR”) is the commonly used percentile measurement of the risk of future financial loss in the value of a given set of aggregated positions over a specified period of time, based on current market conditions. For purposes of this appendix, Stress Value-at-Risk (“Stress VaR”) is the percentile measurement of the risk of future financial loss in the value of a given set of aggregated positions over a specified period of time, based on market conditions during a period of significant financial stress.
            
            ii. General Calculation Guidance: Banking entities must compute and report VaR and Stress VaR by employing generally accepted standards and methods of calculation. VaR should reflect a loss in a trading desk that is expected to be exceeded less than one percent of the time over a one-day period. For those banking entities that are subject to regulatory capital requirements imposed by a Federal banking agency, VaR and Stress VaR must be computed and reported in a manner that is consistent with such regulatory capital requirements. In cases where a trading desk does not have a standalone VaR or Stress VaR calculation but is part of a larger aggregation of positions for which a VaR or Stress VaR calculation is performed, a VaR or Stress VaR calculation that includes only the trading desk's holdings must be performed consistent with the VaR or Stress VaR model and methodology used for the larger aggregation of positions.
            iii. Calculation Period: One trading day.
            iv. Measurement Frequency: Daily.
            b. Source-of-Revenue Measurements
            1. Comprehensive Profit and Loss Attribution
            i. Description: For purposes of this appendix, Comprehensive Profit and Loss Attribution is an analysis that attributes the daily fluctuation in the value of a trading desk's positions to various sources. First, the daily profit and loss of the aggregated positions is divided into three categories: (i) Profit and loss attributable to a trading desk's existing positions that were also positions held by the trading desk as of the end of the prior day (“existing positions”); (ii) profit and loss attributable to new positions resulting from the current day's trading activity (“new positions”); and (iii) residual profit and loss that cannot be specifically attributed to existing positions or new positions. The sum of (i), (ii), and (iii) must equal the trading desk's comprehensive profit and loss at each point in time. In addition, profit and loss measurements must calculate volatility of comprehensive profit and loss (i.e., the standard deviation of the trading desk's one-day profit and loss, in dollar terms) for the reporting period for at least a 30-, 60- and 90-day lag period, from the end of the reporting period, and any other period that the banking entity deems necessary to meet the requirements of the rule.
            A. The comprehensive profit and loss associated with existing positions must reflect changes in the value of these positions on the applicable day. The comprehensive profit and loss from existing positions must be further attributed, as applicable, to changes in (i) the specific Risk Factors and other factors that are monitored and managed as part of the trading desk's overall risk management policies and procedures; and (ii) any other applicable elements, such as cash flows, carry, changes in reserves, and the correction, cancellation, or exercise of a trade.
            B. The comprehensive profit and loss attributed to new positions must reflect commissions and fee income or expense and market gains or losses associated with transactions executed on the applicable day. New positions include purchases and sales of financial instruments and other assets/liabilities and negotiated amendments to existing positions. The comprehensive profit and loss from new positions may be reported in the aggregate and does not need to be further attributed to specific sources.
            C. The portion of comprehensive profit and loss that cannot be specifically attributed to known sources must be allocated to a residual category identified as an unexplained portion of the comprehensive profit and loss. Significant unexplained profit and loss must be escalated for further investigation and analysis.
            ii. General Calculation Guidance: The specific categories used by a trading desk in the attribution analysis and amount of detail for the analysis should be tailored to the type and amount of trading activities undertaken by the trading desk. The new position attribution must be computed by calculating the difference between the prices at which instruments were bought and/or sold and the prices at which those instruments are marked to market at the close of business on that day multiplied by the notional or principal amount of each purchase or sale. Any fees, commissions, or other payments received (paid) that are associated with transactions executed on that day must be added (subtracted) from such difference. These factors must be measured consistently over time to facilitate historical comparisons.
            iii. Calculation Period: One trading day.
            iv. Measurement Frequency: Daily.
            c. Customer-Facing Activity Measurements
            1. Inventory Turnover
            i. Description: For purposes of this appendix, Inventory Turnover is a ratio that measures the turnover of a trading desk's inventory. The numerator of the ratio is the absolute value of all transactions over the reporting period. The denominator of the ratio is the value of the trading desk's inventory at the beginning of the reporting period.
            ii. General Calculation Guidance: For purposes of this appendix, for derivatives, other than options and interest rate derivatives, value means gross notional value, for options, value means delta adjusted notional value, and for interest rate derivatives, value means 10-year bond equivalent value.
            iii. Calculation Period: 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days.
            iv. Measurement Frequency: Daily.
            
            2. Inventory Aging
            i. Description: For purposes of this appendix, Inventory Aging generally describes a schedule of the trading desk's aggregate assets and liabilities and the amount of time that those assets and liabilities have been held. Inventory Aging should measure the age profile of the trading desk's assets and liabilities.
            ii. General Calculation Guidance: In general, Inventory Aging must be computed using a trading desk's trading activity data and must identify the value of a trading desk's aggregate assets and liabilities. Inventory Aging must include two schedules, an asset-aging schedule and a liability-aging schedule. Each schedule must record the value of assets or liabilities held over all holding periods. For derivatives, other than options, and interest rate derivatives, value means gross notional value, for options, value means delta adjusted notional value and, for interest rate derivatives, value means 10-year bond equivalent value.
            iii. Calculation Period: One trading day.
            iv. Measurement Frequency: Daily.
            3. Customer-Facing Trade Ratio—Trade Count Based and Value Based
            i. Description: For purposes of this appendix, the Customer-Facing Trade Ratio is a ratio comparing (i) the transactions involving a counterparty that is a customer of the trading desk to (ii) the transactions involving a counterparty that is not a customer of the trading desk. A trade count based ratio must be computed that records the number of transactions involving a counterparty that is a customer of the trading desk and the number of transactions involving a counterparty that is not a customer of the trading desk. A value based ratio must be computed that records the value of transactions involving a counterparty that is a customer of the trading desk and the value of transactions involving a counterparty that is not a customer of the trading desk.
            ii. General Calculation Guidance: For purposes of calculating the Customer-Facing Trade Ratio, a counterparty is considered to be a customer of the trading desk if the counterparty is a market participant that makes use of the banking entity's market making-related services by obtaining such services, responding to quotations, or entering into a continuing relationship with respect to such services. However, a trading desk or other organizational unit of another banking entity would not be a client, customer, or counterparty of the trading desk if the other entity has trading assets and liabilities of $50 billion or more as measured in accordance with § 75.20(d)(1) unless the trading desk documents how and why a particular trading desk or other organizational unit of the entity should be treated as a client, customer, or counterparty of the trading desk. Transactions conducted anonymously on an exchange or similar trading facility that permits trading on behalf of a broad range of market participants would be considered transactions with customers of the trading desk. For derivatives, other than options, and interest rate derivatives, value means gross notional value, for options, value means delta adjusted notional value, and for interest rate derivatives, value means 10-year bond equivalent value.
            iii. Calculation Period: 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days.
            iv. Measurement Frequency: Daily.
          
          
            Pt. 75, App. B
            Appendix B to Part 75—Enhanced Minimum Standards for Compliance Programs
            I. Overview
            Section 75.20(c) requires certain banking entities to establish, maintain, and enforce an enhanced compliance program that includes the requirements and standards in this Appendix as well as the minimum written policies and procedures, internal controls, management framework, independent testing, training, and recordkeeping provisions outlined in § 75.20. This Appendix sets forth additional minimum standards with respect to the establishment, oversight, maintenance, and enforcement by these banking entities of an enhanced internal compliance program for ensuring and monitoring compliance with the prohibitions and restrictions on proprietary trading and covered fund activities and investments set forth in section 13 of the BHC Act and this part.
            a. This compliance program must:
            1. Be reasonably designed to identify, document, monitor, and report the permitted trading and covered fund activities and investments of the banking entity; identify, monitor and promptly address the risks of these covered activities and investments and potential areas of noncompliance; and prevent activities or investments prohibited by, or that do not comply with, section 13 of the BHC Act and this part;
            2. Establish and enforce appropriate limits on the covered activities and investments of the banking entity, including limits on the size, scope, complexity, and risks of the individual activities or investments consistent with the requirements of section 13 of the BHC Act and this part;
            3. Subject the effectiveness of the compliance program to periodic independent review and testing, and ensure that the entity's internal audit, corporate compliance and internal control functions involved in review and testing are effective and independent;

            4. Make senior management, and others as appropriate, accountable for the effective implementation of the compliance program, and ensure that the board of directors and chief executive officer (or equivalent) of the banking entity review the effectiveness of the compliance program; and
            5. Facilitate supervision and examination by the Agencies of the banking entity's permitted trading and covered fund activities and investments.
            II. Enhanced Compliance Program
            a. Proprietary Trading Activities
            A banking entity must establish, maintain and enforce a compliance program that includes written policies and procedures that are appropriate for the types, size, and complexity of, and risks associated with, its permitted trading activities. The compliance program may be tailored to the types of trading activities conducted by the banking entity, and must include a detailed description of controls established by the banking entity to reasonably ensure that its trading activities are conducted in accordance with the requirements and limitations applicable to those trading activities under section 13 of the BHC Act and this part, and provide for appropriate revision of the compliance program before expansion of the trading activities of the banking entity. A banking entity must devote adequate resources and use knowledgeable personnel in conducting, supervising and managing its trading activities, and promote consistency, independence and rigor in implementing its risk controls and compliance efforts. The compliance program must be updated with a frequency sufficient to account for changes in the activities of the banking entity, results of independent testing of the program, identification of weaknesses in the program, and changes in legal, regulatory or other requirements.
            1. Trading Desks: The banking entity must have written policies and procedures governing each trading desk that include a description of:
            i. The process for identifying, authorizing and documenting financial instruments each trading desk may purchase or sell, with separate documentation for market making-related activities conducted in reliance on § 75.4(b) and for hedging activity conducted in reliance on § 75.5;
            ii. A mapping for each trading desk to the division, business line, or other organizational structure that is responsible for managing and overseeing the trading desk's activities;
            iii. The mission (i.e., the type of trading activity, such as market-making, trading in sovereign debt, etc.) and strategy (i.e., methods for conducting authorized trading activities) of each trading desk;
            iv. The activities that the trading desk is authorized to conduct, including (i) authorized instruments and products, and (ii) authorized hedging strategies, techniques and instruments;
            v. The types and amount of risks allocated by the banking entity to each trading desk to implement the mission and strategy of the trading desk, including an enumeration of material risks resulting from the activities in which the trading desk is authorized to engage (including but not limited to price risks, such as basis, volatility and correlation risks, as well as counterparty credit risk). Risk assessments must take into account both the risks inherent in the trading activity and the strength and effectiveness of controls designed to mitigate those risks;
            vi. How the risks allocated to each trading desk will be measured;
            vii. Why the allocated risks levels are appropriate to the activities authorized for the trading desk;
            viii. The limits on the holding period of, and the risk associated with, financial instruments under the responsibility of the trading desk;
            ix. The process for setting new or revised limits, as well as escalation procedures for granting exceptions to any limits or to any policies or procedures governing the desk, the analysis that will be required to support revising limits or granting exceptions, and the process for independently reviewing and documenting those exceptions and the underlying analysis;
            x. The process for identifying, documenting and approving new products, trading strategies, and hedging strategies;
            xi. The types of clients, customers, and counterparties with whom the trading desk may trade; and
            xii. The compensation arrangements, including incentive arrangements, for employees associated with the trading desk, which may not be designed to reward or incentivize prohibited proprietary trading or excessive or imprudent risk-taking.
            2. Description of risks and risk management processes: The compliance program for the banking entity must include a comprehensive description of the risk management program for the trading activity of the banking entity. The compliance program must also include a description of the governance, approval, reporting, escalation, review and other processes the banking entity will use to reasonably ensure that trading activity is conducted in compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part. Trading activity in similar financial instruments should be subject to similar governance, limits, testing, controls, and review, unless the banking entity specifically determines to establish different limits or processes and documents those differences. Descriptions must include, at a minimum, the following elements:

            i. A description of the supervisory and risk management structure governing all trading activity, including a description of processes for initial and senior-level review of new products and new strategies;
            ii. A description of the process for developing, documenting, testing, approving and reviewing all models used for valuing, identifying and monitoring the risks of trading activity and related positions, including the process for periodic independent testing of the reliability and accuracy of those models;
            iii. A description of the process for developing, documenting, testing, approving and reviewing the limits established for each trading desk;
            iv. A description of the process by which a security may be purchased or sold pursuant to the liquidity management plan, including the process for authorizing and monitoring such activity to ensure compliance with the banking entity's liquidity management plan and the restrictions on liquidity management activities in this part;
            v. A description of the management review process, including escalation procedures, for approving any temporary exceptions or permanent adjustments to limits on the activities, positions, strategies, or risks associated with each trading desk; and
            vi. The role of the audit, compliance, risk management and other relevant units for conducting independent testing of trading and hedging activities, techniques and strategies.
            3. Authorized risks, instruments, and products. The banking entity must implement and enforce limits and internal controls for each trading desk that are reasonably designed to ensure that trading activity is conducted in conformance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part and with the banking entity's written policies and procedures. The banking entity must establish and enforce risk limits appropriate for the activity of each trading desk. These limits should be based on probabilistic and non-probabilistic measures of potential loss (e.g., Value-at-Risk and notional exposure, respectively), and measured under normal and stress market conditions. At a minimum, these internal controls must monitor, establish and enforce limits on:
            i. The financial instruments (including, at a minimum, by type and exposure) that the trading desk may trade;
            ii. The types and levels of risks that may be taken by each trading desk; and
            iii. The types of hedging instruments used, hedging strategies employed, and the amount of risk effectively hedged.
            4. Hedging policies and procedures. The banking entity must establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures regarding the use of risk-mitigating hedging instruments and strategies that, at a minimum, describe:
            i. The positions, techniques and strategies that each trading desk may use to hedge the risk of its positions;
            ii. The manner in which the banking entity will identify the risks arising in connection with and related to the individual or aggregated positions, contracts or other holdings of the banking entity that are to be hedged and determine that those risks have been properly and effectively hedged;
            iii. The level of the organization at which hedging activity and management will occur;
            iv. The manner in which hedging strategies will be monitored and the personnel responsible for such monitoring;
            v. The risk management processes used to control unhedged or residual risks; and
            vi. The process for developing, documenting, testing, approving and reviewing all hedging positions, techniques and strategies permitted for each trading desk and for the banking entity in reliance on § 75.5.
            5. Analysis and quantitative measurements. The banking entity must perform robust analysis and quantitative measurement of its trading activities that is reasonably designed to ensure that the trading activity of each trading desk is consistent with the banking entity's compliance program; monitor and assist in the identification of potential and actual prohibited proprietary trading activity; and prevent the occurrence of prohibited proprietary trading. Analysis and models used to determine, measure and limit risk must be rigorously tested and be reviewed by management responsible for trading activity to ensure that trading activities, limits, strategies, and hedging activities do not understate the risk and exposure to the banking entity or allow prohibited proprietary trading. This review should include periodic and independent back-testing and revision of activities, limits, strategies and hedging as appropriate to contain risk and ensure compliance. In addition to the quantitative measurements reported by any banking entity subject to Appendix A of this part, each banking entity must develop and implement, to the extent appropriate to facilitate compliance with this part, additional quantitative measurements specifically tailored to the particular risks, practices, and strategies of its trading desks. The banking entity's analysis and quantitative measurements must incorporate the quantitative measurements reported by the banking entity pursuant to Appendix A of this part (if applicable) and include, at a minimum, the following:
            i. Internal controls and written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure the accuracy and integrity of quantitative measurements;
            ii. Ongoing, timely monitoring and review of calculated quantitative measurements;

            iii. The establishment of numerical thresholds and appropriate trading measures for each trading desk and heightened review of trading activity not consistent with those thresholds to ensure compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part, including analysis of the measurement results or other information, appropriate escalation procedures, and documentation related to the review; and

            iv. Immediate review and compliance investigation of the trading desk's activities, escalation to senior management with oversight responsibilities for the applicable trading desk, timely notification to the Commission, appropriate remedial action (e.g., divesting of impermissible positions, cessation of impermissible activity, disciplinary actions), and documentation of the investigation findings and remedial action taken when quantitative measurements or other information, considered together with the facts and circumstances, or findings of internal audit, independent testing or other review suggest a reasonable likelihood that the trading desk has violated any part of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part.
            6. Other Compliance Matters. In addition to the requirements specified above, the banking entity's compliance program must:
            i. Identify activities of each trading desk that will be conducted in reliance on exemptions contained in §§ 75.4 through 75.6, including an explanation of:
            A. How and where in the organization the activity occurs; and
            B. Which exemption is being relied on and how the activity meets the specific requirements for reliance on the applicable exemption;
            ii. Include an explanation of the process for documenting, approving and reviewing actions taken pursuant to the liquidity management plan, where in the organization this activity occurs, the securities permissible for liquidity management, the process for ensuring that liquidity management activities are not conducted for the purpose of prohibited proprietary trading, and the process for ensuring that securities purchased as part of the liquidity management plan are highly liquid and conform to the requirements of this part;
            iii. Describe how the banking entity monitors for and prohibits potential or actual material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies presented by each trading desk that relies on the exemptions contained in §§ 75.3(d)(3) and 75.4 through 75.6, which must take into account potential or actual exposure to:
            A. Assets whose values cannot be externally priced or, where valuation is reliant on pricing models, whose model inputs cannot be externally validated;
            B. Assets whose changes in value cannot be adequately mitigated by effective hedging;
            C. New products with rapid growth, including those that do not have a market history;
            D. Assets or strategies that include significant embedded leverage;
            E. Assets or strategies that have demonstrated significant historical volatility;
            F. Assets or strategies for which the application of capital and liquidity standards would not adequately account for the risk; and
            G. Assets or strategies that result in large and significant concentrations to sectors, risk factors, or counterparties;
            iv. Establish responsibility for compliance with the reporting and recordkeeping requirements of subpart B of this part and § 75.20; and
            v. Establish policies for monitoring and prohibiting potential or actual material conflicts of interest between the banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties.
            7. Remediation of violations. The banking entity's compliance program must be reasonably designed and established to effectively monitor and identify for further analysis any trading activity that may indicate potential violations of section 13 of the BHC Act and this part and to prevent actual violations of section 13 of the BHC Act and this part. The compliance program must describe procedures for identifying and remedying violations of section 13 of the BHC Act and this part, and must include, at a minimum, a requirement to promptly document, address and remedy any violation of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part, and document all proposed and actual remediation efforts. The compliance program must include specific written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to assess the extent to which any activity indicates that modification to the banking entity's compliance program is warranted and to ensure that appropriate modifications are implemented. The written policies and procedures must provide for prompt notification to appropriate management, including senior management and the board of directors, of any material weakness or significant deficiencies in the design or implementation of the compliance program of the banking entity.
            b. Covered Fund Activities or Investments
            A banking entity must establish, maintain and enforce a compliance program that includes written policies and procedures that are appropriate for the types, size, complexity and risks of the covered fund and related activities conducted and investments made, by the banking entity.
            1. Identification of covered funds. The banking entity's compliance program must provide a process, which must include appropriate management review and independent testing, for identifying and documenting covered funds that each unit within the banking entity's organization sponsors or organizes and offers, and covered funds in which each such unit invests. In addition to the documentation requirements for covered funds, as specified under § 75.20(e), the documentation must include information that identifies all pools that the banking entity sponsors or has an interest in and the type of exemption from the Commodity Exchange Act (whether or not the pool relies on § 4.7 of the regulations under the Commodity Exchange Act (§ 4.7 of this chapter)), and the amount of ownership interest the banking entity has in those pools.
            2. Identification of covered fund activities and investments. The banking entity's compliance program must identify, document and map each unit within the organization that is permitted to acquire or hold an interest in any covered fund or sponsor any covered fund and map each unit to the division, business line, or other organizational structure that will be responsible for managing and overseeing that unit's activities and investments.
            3. Explanation of compliance. The banking entity's compliance program must explain how:
            i. The banking entity monitors for and prohibits potential or actual material conflicts of interest between the banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties related to its covered fund activities and investments;
            ii. The banking entity monitors for and prohibits potential or actual transactions or activities that may threaten the safety and soundness of the banking entity related to its covered fund activities and investments; and
            iii. The banking entity monitors for and prohibits potential or actual material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies presented by its covered fund activities and investments, taking into account potential or actual exposure to:
            A. Assets whose values cannot be externally priced or, where valuation is reliant on pricing models, whose model inputs cannot be externally validated;
            B. Assets whose changes in values cannot be adequately mitigated by effective hedging;
            C. New products with rapid growth, including those that do not have a market history;
            D. Assets or strategies that include significant embedded leverage;
            E. Assets or strategies that have demonstrated significant historical volatility;
            F. Assets or strategies for which the application of capital and liquidity standards would not adequately account for the risk; and
            G. Assets or strategies that expose the banking entity to large and significant concentrations with respect to sectors, risk factors, or counterparties;
            4. Description and documentation of covered fund activities and investments. For each organizational unit engaged in covered fund activities and investments, the banking entity's compliance program must document:
            i. The covered fund activities and investments that the unit is authorized to conduct;
            ii. The banking entity's plan for actively seeking unaffiliated investors to ensure that any investment by the banking entity conforms to the limits contained in § 75.12 or registered in compliance with the securities laws and thereby exempt from those limits within the time periods allotted in § 75.12; and
            iii. How it complies with the requirements of subpart C of this part.
            5. Internal Controls. A banking entity must establish, maintain, and enforce internal controls that are reasonably designed to ensure that its covered fund activities or investments comply with the requirements of section 13 of the BHC Act and this part and are appropriate given the limits on risk established by the banking entity. These written internal controls must be reasonably designed and established to effectively monitor and identify for further analysis any covered fund activity or investment that may indicate potential violations of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part. The internal controls must, at a minimum require:
            i. Monitoring and limiting the banking entity's individual and aggregate investments in covered funds;
            ii. Monitoring the amount and timing of seed capital investments for compliance with the limitations under subpart C of this part (including but not limited to the redemption, sale or disposition requirements of § 75.12), and the effectiveness of efforts to seek unaffiliated investors to ensure compliance with those limits;
            iii. Calculating the individual and aggregate levels of ownership interests in one or more covered fund required by § 75.12;
            iv. Attributing the appropriate instruments to the individual and aggregate ownership interest calculations above;
            v. Making disclosures to prospective and actual investors in any covered fund organized and offered or sponsored by the banking entity, as provided under § 75.11(a)(8);
            vi. Monitoring for and preventing any relationship or transaction between the banking entity and a covered fund that is prohibited under § 75.14, including where the banking entity has been designated as the sponsor, investment manager, investment adviser, or commodity trading advisor to a covered fund by another banking entity; and
            vii. Appropriate management review and supervision across legal entities of the banking entity to ensure that services and products provided by all affiliated entities comply with the limitation on services and products contained in § 75.14.
            6. Remediation of violations. The banking entity's compliance program must be reasonably designed and established to effectively monitor and identify for further analysis any covered fund activity or investment that may indicate potential violations of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part and to prevent actual violations of section 13 of the BHC Act and this part. The banking entity's compliance program must describe procedures for identifying and remedying violations of section 13 of the BHC Act and this part, and must include, at a minimum, a requirement to promptly document, address and remedy any violation of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part, including § 75.21, and document all proposed and actual remediation efforts. The compliance program must include specific written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to assess the extent to which any activity or investment indicates that modification to the banking entity's compliance program is warranted and to ensure that appropriate modifications are implemented. The written policies and procedures must provide for prompt notification to appropriate management, including senior management and the board of directors, of any material weakness or significant deficiencies in the design or implementation of the compliance program of the banking entity.
            III. Responsibility and Accountability for the Compliance Program
            a. A banking entity must establish, maintain, and enforce a governance and management framework to manage its business and employees with a view to preventing violations of section 13 of the BHC Act and this part. A banking entity must have an appropriate management framework reasonably designed to ensure that: Appropriate personnel are responsible and accountable for the effective implementation and enforcement of the compliance program; a clear reporting line with a chain of responsibility is delineated; and the compliance program is reviewed periodically by senior management. The board of directors (or equivalent governance body) and senior management should have the appropriate authority and access to personnel and information within the organizations as well as appropriate resources to conduct their oversight activities effectively.
            1. Corporate governance. The banking entity must adopt a written compliance program approved by the board of directors, an appropriate committee of the board, or equivalent governance body, and senior management.
            2. Management procedures. The banking entity must establish, maintain, and enforce a governance framework that is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part, which, at a minimum, provides for:
            i. The designation of appropriate senior management or committee of senior management with authority to carry out the management responsibilities of the banking entity for each trading desk and for each organizational unit engaged in covered fund activities;
            ii. Written procedures addressing the management of the activities of the banking entity that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part, including:
            A. A description of the management system, including the titles, qualifications, and locations of managers and the specific responsibilities of each person with respect to the banking entity's activities governed by section 13 of the BHC Act and this part; and
            B. Procedures for determining compensation arrangements for traders engaged in underwriting or market making-related activities under § 75.4 or risk-mitigating hedging activities under § 75.5 so that such compensation arrangements are designed not to reward or incentivize prohibited proprietary trading and appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose the banking entity to excessive or imprudent risk.
            3. Business line managers. Managers with responsibility for one or more trading desks of the banking entity are accountable for the effective implementation and enforcement of the compliance program with respect to the applicable trading desk(s).
            4. Board of directors, or similar corporate body, and senior management. The board of directors, or similar corporate body, and senior management are responsible for setting and communicating an appropriate culture of compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part and ensuring that appropriate policies regarding the management of trading activities and covered fund activities or investments are adopted to comply with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part. The board of directors or similar corporate body (such as a designated committee of the board or an equivalent governance body) must ensure that senior management is fully capable, qualified, and properly motivated to manage compliance with this part in light of the organization's business activities and the expectations of the board of directors. The board of directors or similar corporate body must also ensure that senior management has established appropriate incentives and adequate resources to support compliance with this part, including the implementation of a compliance program meeting the requirements of this appendix into management goals and compensation structures across the banking entity.
            5. Senior management. Senior management is responsible for implementing and enforcing the approved compliance program. Senior management must also ensure that effective corrective action is taken when failures in compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part are identified. Senior management and control personnel charged with overseeing compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part should review the compliance program for the banking entity periodically and report to the board, or an appropriate committee thereof, on the effectiveness of the compliance program and compliance matters with a frequency appropriate to the size, scope, and risk profile of the banking entity's trading activities and covered fund activities or investments, which shall be at least annually.
            6. CEO attestation. Based on a review by the CEO of the banking entity, the CEO of the banking entity must, annually, attest in writing to the Commission that the banking entity has in place processes to establish, maintain, enforce, review, test and modify the compliance program established under this appendix and § 75.20 in a manner reasonably designed to achieve compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part. In the case of a U.S. branch or agency of a foreign banking entity, the attestation may be provided for the entire U.S. operations of the foreign banking entity by the senior management officer of the United States operations of the foreign banking entity who is located in the United States.
            IV. Independent Testing
            a. Independent testing must occur with a frequency appropriate to the size, scope, and risk profile of the banking entity's trading and covered fund activities or investments, which shall be at least annually. This independent testing must include an evaluation of:
            1. The overall adequacy and effectiveness of the banking entity's compliance program, including an analysis of the extent to which the program contains all the required elements of this appendix;
            2. The effectiveness of the banking entity's internal controls, including an analysis and documentation of instances in which such internal controls have been breached, and how such breaches were addressed and resolved; and
            3. The effectiveness of the banking entity's management procedures.
            b. A banking entity must ensure that independent testing regarding the effectiveness of the banking entity's compliance program is conducted by a qualified independent party, such as the banking entity's internal audit department, compliance personnel or risk managers independent of the organizational unit being tested, outside auditors, consultants, or other qualified independent parties. A banking entity must promptly take appropriate action to remedy any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in its compliance program and to terminate any violations of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part.
            V. Training
            Banking entities must provide adequate training to personnel and managers of the banking entity engaged in activities or investments governed by section 13 of the BHC Act or this part, as well as other appropriate supervisory, risk, independent testing, and audit personnel, in order to effectively implement and enforce the compliance program. This training should occur with a frequency appropriate to the size and the risk profile of the banking entity's trading activities and covered fund activities or investments.
            VI. Recordkeeping
            Banking entities must create and retain records sufficient to demonstrate compliance and support the operations and effectiveness of the compliance program. A banking entity must retain these records for a period that is no less than 5 years or such longer period as required by the Commission in a form that allows it to promptly produce such records to the Commission on request.

            § 140.11
            Emergency action by the senior Commissioner available.
            (a) Authority of senior Commissioner. When it is not feasible to convene a quorum of the Commission, the Senior Commissioner present at the principal offices of the Commission (or, during non-business hours, available in the Washington, DC area) may take emergency action on behalf of and in the name of the Commission in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. Members of the Commission shall be considered senior in the following order: The Chairman, the Vice-Chairman, and other Commissioners in order of their length of service on the Commission. Where two or more Commissioners have commenced their service on the same date, the Commissioner whose unexpired term in office is the longest will be considered senior.
            (b) Exercise of authority. Subject to the right of the Commission to review any emergency action taken as hereinafter provided, the Senior Commissioner may act on behalf of and in the name of the Commission with respect to all of the functions of the Commission except general rulemaking functions: Provided, however, That the Senior Commissioner shall not exercise any authority on behalf of the Commission (1) without consultation with such other member of the Commission as may at the time be present at the Commission's offices in Washington, DC, and without a reasonable attempt to consult, by telephone, with other members of the Commission; and (2) unless, in the opinion of the Senior Commissioner (after consulting with the General Counsel or his deputy or associate, and such other members of the Commission staff as the Senior Commissioner deems appropriate) the public interest requires that action be taken prior to the next scheduled meeting of the Commission.
            (c) Report to the Commission. The exercise of Senior Commissioner authority shall be reported to the Commission within one business day thereafter either by the Senior Commissioner or at his direction, and shall be recorded by the Secretariat in the Minute Record of all official actions of the Commission. The Secretariat shall promptly notify any directly affected person of the action taken and that it was the Senior Commissioner available, rather than the Commission as a whole, who took the action.
            (d) Review by the Commission. The Commission may, in the following circumstances, review any action taken under Senior Commissioner authority and may affirm, modify, alter or set aside the decision:

            (1) Upon the request of any member of the Commission, any action taken by a Senior Commissioner shall be reviewed by the Commission.
            
            (2) In the event action by a Senior Commissioner suspends, denies or revokes or otherwise directly and adversely affects any license, right or privilege of any person, that person may in writing request review by the Commission and shall be entitled to have the action of the Senior Commissioner reviewed by the Commission.
            (3) The Commission may, in its discretion, review any action taken by a Senior Commissioner upon petition by any other person.
            (e) Final effect of action by Senior Commissioner. In any matter, the action taken under Senior Commissioner authority shall be deemed the action of the Commission unless and until the Commission shall otherwise direct.

The relevant materials shall be circulated to each member of the Commission, unless a member is unavailable or has determined not to participate in the matter. A written record of the vote of each participating Commission member shall be reported to the Secretariat who shall retain it in the records of the Commission.
            (b) Whenever any member of the Commission so requests, any matter circulated for disposition pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be withdrawn from circulation and scheduled instead for a Commission meeting.

The determination of that need shall be made by officials having responsibility for the classified information.

            Control and accountability procedures.

            Persons entrusted with classified information shall be responsible for providing protection and accountability for such information at all times and for locking classified information in approved security equipment whenever it is not in use or under direct supervision of authorized persons.
            
            (a) General safeguards. (1) Classified material must not be left in unoccupied rooms or be left inadequately protected in an occupied office, or one occupied by other than security cleared employees. Under no circumstances shall classified material be placed in desk drawers or anywhere other than in approved storage containers.
            (2) Employees using classified material shall take every precaution to prevent deliberate or casual inspection of it by unauthorized persons. Classified material shall be kept under constant surveillance and face down or covered when not in use.
            (3) All copies of classified documents and any informal material such as memoranda, rough drafts, shorthand notes, carbon copies, carbon paper, typewriter ribbons, recording discs, spools and tapes shall be given the same classification and secure handling as the classified information they contain.
            (4) Commission personnel authorized to use classified materials will obtain them from the Executive Director or his delegee on the day required and return them to the Executive Director or his delegee before the close of business on the same day.
            (5) Classified information shall not be revealed in telephone or telecommunications conversations.
            (6) Any person who has knowledge of the loss or possible compromise of classified information shall immediately report the circumstances either to the Security Officer or to the Executive Director or his delegee. The Executive Director or his delegee shall initiate a preliminary inquiry to determine the circumstances surrounding an actual or possible compromise, and to determine what corrective measures and administrative, disciplinary, or legal action is necessary.
            (b) Reproduction controls. (1) The number of copies of documents containing classified information must be kept to the minimum required by operational necessity to decrease the risk of compromise and reduce storage costs.
            (2) Top Secret documents, except for the controlled initial distribution of information processed or received electrically, shall not be reproduced without the consent of the originator.
            (3) Unless restricted by the originating agency, Secret and Confidential documents may be reproduced to the extent required by operational needs.
            (4) Reproduced copies of classified documents shall be subject to the same accountability and controls as the original documents.
            (5) Classified reproduction shall be controlled by persons with the proper level of security clearance.
            (6) Records shall be maintained to show the number and distribution of reproduced copies to all Top Secret documents, of all classified documents covered by special access programs distributed outside the originating agency, and of all Secret and Confidential documents which are marked with special dissemination and reproduction limitations.
            (7) Unauthorized reproduction of classified material will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.
            (c) Storage of classified material. (1) All classified material in the custody of the Commission will be stored in accordance with the guidelines set forth in 32 CFR 2001.43.

            (2) In addition, the Commission remains subject to the provisions of 32 CFR part 2001, et seq., insofar as they are applicable to classified materials held by the Commission.

            (a) Pursuant to the authority granted under sections 2(a)(11), 8a(5) and 8a(6) of the Act, the Commission hereby delegates, until such time as the Commission orders otherwise, to the Executive Director, the Director of the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight, the Director of the Division of Clearing and Risk, the Chief Accountant, the General Counsel, the Director of the Division of Market Oversight, the Director of the Division of Enforcement, the Chief Economist of the Office of the Chief Economist, the Director of the Office of International Affairs, or such other employee or employees as the General Counsel, Directors, Chief Accountant or Chief Economist each may designate from time to time, the authority to disclose to an official of any registered entity, swap execution facility, swap data repository, registered futures association, or self-regulatory organization as defined in section 3(a)(26) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, any information necessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes of the Act, including, but not limited to, the full facts concerning any transaction or market operation, including the names of the parties thereto. This authority to disclose shall be based on a determination that the transaction or market operation disrupts or tends to disrupt any market or is otherwise harmful or against the best interests of producers, consumers, or investors or that disclosure is necessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes of the Act.
            (b) Disclosure under this section shall only be made to a registered entity, swap execution facility, swap data repository, registered futures association or self-regulatory organization official who is named in a list filed with the Commission by the chief executive officer of the registered entity, swap execution facility, swap data repository, registered futures association or self-regulatory organization, which sets forth the official's name, business address and telephone number. The chief executive officer shall thereafter notify the Commission of any deletions or additions to the list of officials authorized to receive disclosures under this section. The original list and any supplemental list required by this paragraph shall be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, and a copy thereof shall also be filed with the Regional Coordinator for the region in which the registered entity, swap execution facility, or swap data repository is located or in which the registered futures association or self-regulatory organization has its principal office.
            (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, in any case in which a Commission employee delegated authority under this section believes it appropriate, he or she may submit to the Commission for its consideration the question of whether disclosure of information should be made.
            (d) For purposes of this section, the term “official” shall mean any officer or member of a committee of a registered entity, swap execution facility, swap data repository, registered futures association or self-regulatory organization who is specifically charged with market surveillance or audit or investigative responsibilities, or their duly authorized representative or agent, who is named on the list filed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section or any supplement thereto.
            (e) For the purposes of this section, the term “self-regulatory organization” shall mean the same as that defined in section 3(a) (26) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
            (f) Any registered entity, swap execution facility, swap data repository, registered futures association or self-regulatory organization receiving information from the Commission under these provisions shall not disclose such information except that disclosure may be made in any self-regulatory action or proceeding.

            (c) In furnishing information under this delegation pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, the Commission official making the disclosure shall remind the department or agency involved that section 8(e) of the Act prohibits the disclosure by such department or agency of information that would separately disclose the business transactions or market positions of any person and trade secrets or names of customers except in an action or proceeding under the laws of the United States, the State, or a political subdivision thereof to which the department or the agency of either the state or political subdivision, the Commission, or the United States is a party.
            (d) This delegation shall not affect any other delegation which the Commission has made or may make, which authorizes any other officer or employee of the Commission to furnish information to governmental bodies on the Commission's behalf.

            § 140.99
            Requests for exemptive, no-action and interpretative letters.
            (a) Definitions. For the purpose of this section:
            (1) Exemptive letter means a written grant of relief issued by the staff of a Division of the Commission from the applicability of a specific provision of the Act or of a rule, regulation or order issued thereunder by the Commission. An exemptive letter may only be issued by staff of a Division when the Commission itself has exemptive authority and that authority has been delegated by the Commission to the Division in question. An exemptive letter binds the Commission and its staff with respect to the relief provided therein. Only the Beneficiary may rely upon the exemptive letter.
            (2) No-action letter means a written statement issued by the staff of a Division of the Commission or of the Office of the General Counsel that it will not recommend enforcement action to the Commission for failure to comply with a specific provision of the Act or of a Commission rule, regulation or order if a proposed transaction is completed or a proposed activity is conducted by the Beneficiary. A no-action letter represents the position only of the Division that issued it, or the Office of the General Counsel if issued thereby. A no-action letter binds only the issuing Division or the Office of the General Counsel, as applicable, and not the Commission or other Commission staff. Only the Beneficiary may rely upon the no-action letter.
            (3) Interpretative letter means written advice or guidance issued by the staff of a Division of the Commission or the Office of the General Counsel. An interpretative letter binds only the issuing Division or the Office of the General Counsel, as applicable, and does not bind the Commission or other Commission staff. An interpretative letter may be relied upon by persons in addition to the Beneficiary.
            (4) Letter means an exemptive, no-action or interpretative letter.
            (5) Division means the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight, the Division of Clearing and Risk or the Division of Market Oversight.
            (b) General requirements. (1) Issuance of a Letter is entirely within the discretion of Commission staff.
            (2) Each request for a Letter must comply with the requirements of this section. Commission staff may reject or decline to respond to a request that does not comply with the requirements of this section.
            (3) The request must relate to a proposed transaction or a proposed activity. Absent extraordinary circumstances, Commission staff will not issue a Letter based upon transactions or activities that have been completed or activities that have been conducted prior to the date upon which the request is filed with the Commission.

            (4) The request must be made by or on behalf of the person whose activities or transactions are the subject of the request. Commission staff will not respond to a request for a Letter that is made by or on behalf of an unidentified person.
            
            (5)(i) The request must set forth as completely as possible all material facts and circumstances giving rise to the request.

            (ii) Commission staff will not respond to a request based on a hypothetical situation. However, a requester may set forth one or more alternative structures or fact situations for a proposed transaction or activity; Provided, That the request complies with this section with respect to each alternative structure or fact situation.
            (c) Information requirements. Each request for a Letter must comply with the following information requirements:

            (B) The name and, if applicable, the National Futures Association registration identification number of each other person for whose benefit the person is seeking the Letter.
            (ii) When made by a requester other than the person on whose behalf the Letter is sought, the request must contain:
            (A) The name, main business address and main business telephone number of the requester;
            (B) The name and, if applicable, the National Futures Association registration identification number of the person on whose behalf the Letter is sought; and
            (C) The name and, if applicable, the National Futures Association registration identification number of each other person for whose benefit the requester is seeking the Letter.
            (iii) The request must provide the name, address and telephone number of a contact person from whom Commission staff may obtain additional information if necessary.
            (2) The section number of the particular provision of the Act and/or Commission rules, regulations or orders to which the request relates must be set forth in the upper right-hand corner of the first page of the request.
            (3) The request must be accompanied by:

            (i) A certification by a person with knowledge of the facts that the material facts as represented in the request are true and complete. The following form of certification is sufficient for this purpose:

            and
            (ii) An undertaking made by the person on whose behalf the Letter is sought or by that person's authorized representative that, if at any time prior to issuance of a Letter, any material representation made in the request ceases to be true and complete, the person who made the undertaking will ensure that Commission staff is informed promptly in writing of all materially changed facts and circumstances. If a material change in facts or circumstances occurs subsequent to issuance of a Letter, the person on whose behalf the Letter is sought (or that person's authorized representative at the time of the change) must promptly so inform Commission staff.
            (4) The request must identify the type of relief requested and Letter sought and must clearly state why a Letter is needed. The request must identify all relevant legal and factual issues and discuss the legal and public policy bases supporting issuance of the Letter.
            (5) The request must contain references to all relevant authorities, including applicable provisions of the Act, Commission rules, regulations and orders, judicial decisions, administrative decisions, relevant statutory interpretations and policy statements. Adverse authority must be cited and discussed.

            (6) The request must identify prior publicly available Letters issued by Commission staff in response to circumstances similar to those surrounding the request (including adverse Letters), and must identify any conditions imposed by prior Letters as prerequisites for the issuance of those Letters. Citation of a representative sample of prior Letters is sufficient where a comprehensive recitation of prior Letters on a given topic would be repetitious or would not assist the staff in considering the request.
            (7) Requests may ask that, if the requested exemptive relief, no-action position or interpretative guidance is denied, the staff consider granting alternative relief or adopting an alternative position.
            (d) Filing requirements. Each request for a Letter must comply with the following filing requirements:
            (1) The request must be in writing and signed.

            (f) Withdrawal of requests. (1) A request for a Letter may be withdrawn by filing with Commission staff a written request for withdrawal, signed by the person on whose behalf the Letter was sought or by that person's authorized representative, that states whether the person on whose behalf the Letter was sought will proceed with the proposed transaction or activity.

            (h) Confidential treatment. Confidential treatment of a request for a Letter must be requested separately in accordance with § 140.98 or § 145.9 of this chapter, as applicable.

            (b) Prohibitions. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no member or employee of the Commission shall:

            (v) For the delivery of any commodity under a standardized contract commonly known to the trade as a margin account, margin contract, leverage account, or leverage contract, or under any contract, account, arrangement, scheme, or device that the Commission determines serves the same function or functions as such a standardized contract, or is marketed or managed in substantially the same manner as such a standardized contract;
            (2) Effect any purchase or sale of a commodity option, futures contract, or swap involving a security or group of securities;
            (3) Sell a security which he or she does not own or consummate a sale by the delivery of a security borrowed by or for his or her account;

            (c) Exception for farming, ranching, and natural resource operations. The prohibitions in paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iv) of this section shall not apply to a transaction in connection with any farming, ranching, oil and gas, mineral rights, or other natural resource operation in which the member or employee has a financial interest, if he or she is not involved in the decision to engage in, and does not have prior knowledge of, the actual futures, commodity option, or swap transaction and has previously notified the General Counsel 2
               in writing of the nature of the operation, the extent of the member's or employee's interest, the types of transactions in which the operation may engage, and the identity of the person or persons who will make trading decisions for the operation; 3
               or
            
              
                2 As used in this subpart, “General Counsel” refers to the General Counsel in his or her capacity as counselor for the Commission and designated agency ethics official for the Commission, and includes his or her designee and the alternate designated agency ethics official appointed by the agency head pursuant to 5 CFR 2638.202.

A member or employee considering such arrangements should consult with the Office of General Counsel in advance for approval. Should a member or employee gain knowledge of an actual futures, commodity option, or swap transaction entered into by an operation described in paragraph (c) of this section that has already taken place and the market position represented by that transaction remains open, he or she should promptly report that fact and all other details to the General Counsel and seek advice as to what action, including recusal from any particular matter that will have a direct and predictable effect on the financial interest in question, may be appropriate.
            
            (d) Other exceptions. The prohibitions in paragraphs (b)(1), (2) and (3) of this section shall not apply to:

            (1) A transaction entered into by any publicly-available pooled investment vehicle (such as a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund) other than one operated by a person who is a commodity pool operator with respect to such entity if the direct or indirect ownership interest of the member or employee neither exercises control nor has the ability to exercise control over the transactions entered into by such vehicle; 4
              
            
            
              

                4 Section 9(c) of the Commodity Exchange Act makes it a felony for any member or employee, or agent thereof, to participate, directly or indirectly in, inter alia, any transaction in commodity futures, option, leverage transaction, or other arrangement that the Commission determines serves the same function, unless authorized to do so by Commission rule or regulation. 17 CFR 4.5 excludes certain otherwise regulated persons from the definition of “commodity pool operator” with respect to operation of specific investment entities enumerated in the regulation.
            
            (2) The acceptance or exercise of any stock option or similar right granted by an employer as part of a compensation package to a spouse or minor child or other related member of the immediate household of a member or employee, or to the exercise of any stock option or similar right granted to the member or employee by a previous employer prior to commencement of the member's or employee's tenure with the Commission as part of such member's or employee's compensation package from such previous employer;
            (3) A transaction by any trust or estate of which the member or employee or the spouse, minor child, or other related member of the immediate household of the member or employee is solely a beneficiary, has no power to control, and does not in fact control or advise with respect to the investments of the trust or estate;
            (4) The exercise of any privilege to convert or exchange securities, of rights accruing unconditionally by virtue of ownership of other securities (as distinguished from a contingent right to acquire securities not subscribed for by others), or of rights in order to round out fractional shares in securities;
            (5) The acceptance of stock dividends on securities already owned, the reinvestment of cash dividends on a security already owned, or the participation in a periodic investment plan when the original purchase was otherwise consistent with this rule; or
            (6) Investment in any fund established pursuant to the Federal Employees Retirement System.
            (e) No prohibition on stocks or funds. Nothing in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section shall prohibit a member or employee from purchasing, selling, or retaining any share that represents ownership of a publicly-owned corporation or interest in a publicly-available pooled investment vehicle containing any such shares (such as a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund) other than one operated by a person who is a commodity pool operator with respect to such pooled investment vehicle, regardless of whether any security futures product may at any time be or have been based upon shares of such corporation or pooled investment vehicle, and regardless of whether such pooled investment vehicle may, by design or effect, track or follow any group of securities that also underlies a futures contract.
            (f) Exception applicable to legally separated employees. This section shall not apply to transactions of a legally separated spouse of a member or employee, including transactions for the benefit of a minor child, if the member or employee has no power to control, and does not, in fact, advise or control with respect to such transactions. If the member or employee has actual or constructive knowledge of such transactions of a legally separated spouse or for the benefit of a minor child, the disqualification provisions of § 140.735-2a(d)(2)(i)-(iii) and 18 U.S.C. 208 are applicable.

            § 140.735-2a
            Prohibited interests.
            (a) Application. This section applies to all financial interests of a Commission member or employee of the Commission, including financial interests held by the member or employee for the account of other persons. A member or employee shall be deemed to have a sufficient interest in the financial interests of his or her spouse, minor child, or other relative who is a resident of the immediate household of the member or employee, so that such financial interests must be reported and are subject to all the terms of this section.
            (b) Prohibitions. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no member or employee of the Commission shall:
            
            (1) Have a financial interest, through ownership of securities or otherwise, in any person 5
               registered with the Commission (including futures commission merchants, associated persons and agents of futures commission merchants, floor brokers, commodity trading advisors and commodity pool operators, and any other persons required to be registered in a fashion similar to any of the above under the Commodity Exchange Act or pursuant to any rule or regulation promulgated by the Commission), or any contract market, swap execution facility, swap data repository, board of trade, or other trading facility, or any derivatives clearing organization subject to regulation or oversight by the Commission; 6
              
            
            
              
                5 As defined in section 1a(38) of the Commodity Exchange Act and 17 CFR 1.3(u) thereunder, a “person” includes an individual, association, partnership, corporation and a trust.
            
            
              
                6 Attention is directed to 18 U.S.C. 208.
              
                7 [Reserved]
            
            (c) Exceptions. The prohibitions in paragraph (b) of this section shall not apply to:
            (1) A financial interest in any publicly-available pooled investment vehicle (such as a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund) other than one operated by a person who is a commodity pool operator with respect to such entity if such vehicle does not have invested, or indicate in its prospectus the intent to invest, ten percent or more of its assets in securities of persons described in paragraph (b) of this section and the member or employee neither exercises control nor has the ability to exercise control over the financial interests held in such vehicle;
            (2) A financial interest in any corporate parent or affiliate of a person described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the operations of such person provide less than ten percent of the gross revenues of the corporate parent or affiliate; 8
              
            
            
              
                8 It is the member's or employee's responsibility to monitor his or her financial interests and those of a spouse or minor child or other related member of his or her immediate household, to promptly report relevant changes to the General Counsel in writing, and to seek the advice of the General Counsel as to what action may be appropriate. In this regard, attention is directed to 18 U.S.C. 208, which bars an employee from participating in any particular matter that will have a direct and predictable effect on the financial interest in question.
            
            (3) A financial interest in any trust or estate of which the member or employee is solely a beneficiary, has no power to control, and does not in fact control or advise with respect to the investments of the trust or estate; except that such interest is subject to the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section.
            (d) Retention or passive acquisition of prohibited financial interests. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a member or employee, or a spouse or minor child or other related member of the immediate household of the member or employee, from:
            (1) Retaining a financial interest that was permitted to be retained by the member or employee prior to the adoption of this regulation, was obtained prior to the commencement of employment with the Commission, or was acquired by a spouse prior to marriage to the member or employee; or

            (2) Acquiring, retaining, or controlling an otherwise prohibited financial interest, including but not limited to any security or option on a security (but not a security futures product), where the financial interest was acquired by inheritance, gift, stock split, involuntary stock dividend, merger, acquisition, or other change in corporate ownership, exercise of preemptive right, or otherwise without specific intent to acquire the financial interest, or by a spouse or minor child or other related member of the immediate household of the member or employee as part of an employment compensation package; provided, however, that retention of any interest allowed by paragraph (c)(3) or (d) of this section is permitted only where the employee:
            (i) Makes full disclosure of any such interest on his or her annual financial disclosure (Standard Form 278 or Standard Form 450);

            (ii) Makes full written disclosure to the General Counsel within 30 days of commencing employment or, for incumbents, within twenty days of his or her receipt of actual or constructive notice that the interest has been acquired; 9
               and
            
              
                9 Changes in holdings, other than by purchase, which do not affect disqualification, such as those resulting from the automatic reinvestment of dividends, stock splits, stock dividends or reclassifications, may be reported on the annual statement, SF 278 or SF 450, rather than when notification of the transaction is received. Acquisition by, for example, gifts, inheritance, or spinoffs, which may result in additional disqualifications pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section and 18 U.S.C. 208 shall be reported to the General Counsel within 20 days of the receipt of actual or constructive notice thereof.
            

            (iii) Will be disqualified in accordance with 5 CFR part 2635, subpart D, and 18 U.S.C. 208 from participating in any particular matter that will have a direct and predictable effect on the financial interest in question. Any Commission member or employee affected by this section may, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(1) and 5 CFR 2640.301-303, request a waiver of the disqualification requirement.
            
            
              Note:
              With respect to any financial interest retained under paragraph (c)(3) or (d) of this section, Commission members and employees are reminded of their obligations under 18 U.S.C. 208 and 5 CFR part 2635, subpart D, to disqualify themselves from participating in any particular matter in which they, their spouses or minor children have a financial interest.
            
            
            (e) Exception applicable to legally separated employees. This section shall not apply to the financial interests of a legally separated spouse of a Commission member or employee, including transactions for the benefit of a minor child, if the member or employee has no power to control and does not, in fact, advise or control with respect to such transactions. If the member or employee has actual or constructive knowledge of such financial interests held by a legally separated spouse or for the benefit of a minor child, the disqualification provisions of paragraphs (d)(2)(i)-(iii) of this section and 18 U.S.C. 208 are applicable.
            (f) Divestiture. Based upon a determination of substantial conflict under 5 CFR 2635.403(b) and 18 U.S.C. 208, the Commission, or its designee, may require in writing that a member or employee, or the spouse or minor child or other related member of the immediate household of a member or employee, divest a financial interest that he or she is otherwise authorized to retain under this section. 10
              
            
            
              

                10 Any evidence of a violation of 18 U.S.C. 208 must be reported by the General Counsel to the Commission, which may refer the matter to the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice and the United States Attorney in whose venue the violations lie. See 28 U.S.C. 535.

            Non-governmental employment and other outside activity.
            A Commission member or employee shall not accept employment or compensation from any person, exchange, swap execution facility, swap data repository or derivatives clearing organization subject to regulation by the Commission. For purposes of this section, a person subject to regulation by the Commission includes but is not limited to a contract market, swap execution facility, swap data repository or derivatives clearing organization or member thereof, a registered futures commission merchant, any person associated with a futures commission merchant or with any agent of a futures commission merchant, floor broker, commodity trading advisor, commodity pool operator or any person required to be registered in a fashion similar to any of the above or file reports under the Act or pursuant to any rule or regulation promulgated by the Commission.11
              
            
            
              
                11 Attention is directed to section 2(a)(8) of the Commodity Exchange Act, which provides, among other things, that no Commission member or employee shall accept employment or compensation from any person, exchange or derivatives clearing organization (“clearinghouse”) subject to regulation by the Commission, or participate, directly or indirectly, in any contract market operations or transactions of a character subject to regulation by the Commission.

            § 140.735-4
            Receipt and disposition of foreign gifts and decorations.
            (a) For purposes of this section only:
            (1) Commission member or employee means any Commission member or any person employed by or who occupies an office or a position in the Commission; an expert or consultant under contract with the Commission, or in the case of an organization performing services under such contract, any individual involved in the performance of such service; and the spouse, unless the individual and his or her spouse are separated, and any dependent, as defined by section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, of any such person.
            (2) Foreign government means:
            (A) Any unit of foreign governmental authority, including any foreign national, state, local, and municipal government;
            (B) Any international or multinational organization whose membership is composed of any unit of foreign government described in paragraph (a)(2)(A) of this section; and
            (C) Any agent or representative of any such unit or such organization, while acting as such.
            (3) Gift means a tangible or intangible present (other than a decoration) tendered by, or received from, a foreign government, except grants and other forms of assistance to which section 108A of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 applies.
            (4) Decoration means an order, device, medal, badge, insignia, emblem, or award tendered by, or received from, a foreign government.
            (5) Minimal value means a retail value in the United States at the time of acceptance of $140 or less, except as redefined to reflect changes in the consumer price index at three year intervals by the Administrator of General Services pursuant to authority granted in 5 U.S.C. 7342(a)(5)(A).
            (b) Commission members and employees shall not:
            (1) Request or otherwise encourage the tender of a gift or decoration;
            (2) Accept a gift of currency, except that which has an historical or numismatic value;
            (3) Accept gifts of travel or gifts of expenses for travel, such as transportation, food and lodging, from foreign governments, other than those authorized in paragraph (c)(5) of this section; or
            (4) Accept any gift or decoration, except as authorized by this section.
            (c) Gifts which may be accepted:
            (1) Commission members and employees may accept and retain gifts of minimal value tendered or received as a souvenir or mark of courtesy from a foreign government without further approval. If the value of a gift is uncertain, the recipient shall be responsible for establishing that it is of minimal value, as defined in this section. Documentary evidence may be required in support of the valuation.
            (2) Commission members and employees may accept, on behalf of the United States, gifts of more than minimal value tendered or received from a foreign government when it appears that to refuse the gift would likely cause offense or embarrassment or otherwise adversely affect the foreign relations of the United States. When a tangible gift of more than minimal value is accepted on behalf of the United States, it becomes the property of the United States.
            (3) Commission members and employees may accept a gift of more than minimal value where such gift is in the nature of an educational scholarship or medical treatment.
            (4) Within 60 days after accepting a tangible gift of more than minimal value, other than a gift described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, a Commission member or employee shall file a statement with the Executive Director of the Commission which shall include the following information:
            (A) The name and position of the Commission member or employee;
            (B) A brief description of the gift and the circumstances justify acceptance;
            (C) The identity, if known, of the foreign government and the name and position of the individual who presented the gift;
            (D) The date of acceptance of the gift;
            (E) The estimated value in the United States of the gift at the time of acceptance; and
            (F) The disposition or current location of the gift.

            (5) Commission members and employees are authorized to accept from a foreign government gifts of travel or gifts of expenses for travel taking place entirely outside the United States, such as transportation, food and lodging, of more than minimal value if the acceptance is approved by the Executive Director, upon a finding that it is consistent with the interests of the Commission. Either prior to or within 30 days after accepting each gift of travel or gift of travel expenses pursuant to this paragraph, the Commission member or employee concerned shall file a statement with the Executive Director containing the following information:
            (A) The name and position of the Commission member or employee;
            (B) A brief description of the gift and the circumstances justifying acceptance;
            (C) The identity, if known, of the foreign government and the name and position of the individual who presented the gift; and
            (D) The date of acceptance.
            (6) Not later than January 31 of each year the Executive Director shall compile a listing of all statements filed during the preceding year by Commission members and employees pursuant to paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(5) of this section and shall transmit the listing to the Secretary of State.
            (d) Commission members or employees may accept, retain and wear decorations tendered by a foreign government in recognition of active field service in time of combat operations or awarded for other outstanding or unusually meritorious performance, subject to the approval of the Executive Director. Without this approval, the decoration is deemed to have been accepted on behalf of the United States, shall become the property of the United States, and shall be deposited by the employee, within 60 days of acceptance, with the Executive Director for official use or forwarding to the Administrator of General Services for disposal in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section. Under normal circumstances, it can be expected that a Commission member or employee will be notified of the intent of a foreign government to award him or her or a spouse or dependent a decoration for outstanding or unusually meritorious service sufficiently in advance so that the approval required can be sought prior to its acceptance. A request for the approval of the Executive Director shall be submitted in writing, stating the nature of the decoration and the reason why it is being awarded. Whenever possible, the request should also be accompanied by a statement from the foreign government, preferably in the form of the citation, which shows the basis for the tender of the award, whether it is in recognition of active field service in time of combat operations or for other outstanding or unusually meritorious performance.
            (e) Within 60 days after acceptance of a tangible gift of more than minimal value or a decoration for which the Executive Director has not given approval, a Commission member or employee shall:
            (1) Deposit the gift or decoration for disposal with the Executive Director; or
            (2) Subject to the approval of the Commission, upon the recommendation of the Executive Director, deposit the gift or decoration with the Commission for official use.
            A gift or decoration may be retained for official use if the Commission determines that it can be properly displayed in an area accessible to employees and members of the public. Within 30 days after termination of the official use of a gift, the Executive Director shall forward the gift to the Administrator of General Services in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
            (f) Whenever possible, gifts and decorations that have been deposited with the Executive Director for disposal shall be returned to the donor. The Executive Director, in coordination with the Office of the General Counsel, shall examine the circumstances surrounding the donation, assessing whether any adverse effect on the foreign relations of the United States might result from the return of the gift or decoration to the donor. The appropriate Department of State officials shall be consulted if a question of adverse effect on United States foreign relations arises.

            (g) Gifts and decorations that have not been returned to the donor, retained for official use, or for which official use has terminated, shall be forwarded by the Executive Director to the Administrator of General Services for transfer, donation, or other disposal in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, and 5 U.S.C. 7342.
            (h) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 7342(h), the U.S. Attorney General may bring a civil action in any United States district court against any Commission member or employee who knowingly solicits or accepts a gift from a foreign government not consented to by the Congress of the United States in 5 U.S.C. 7342, or who fails to deposit or report such gift as required by 5 U.S.C. 7342. The court may assess a penalty against such Commission member or employee in any amount not exceeding the retail value of the gift improperly solicited or received plus $5,000.
            (i) A violation of the requirements set forth in this section by a Commission employee may be cause for appropriate disciplinary action which may be in addition to any penalty prescribed by law.
            (j)(1) The burden of proving minimal value shall be on the recipient. In the event of a dispute over the value of a gift, the Executive Director shall arrange for an outside appraiser to determine whether the gift is of more or less than minimal value.
            (2) When requested by the Administrator of Government Services, the Executive Director shall arrange for an appraisal of a gift or decoration.
            (k) No appropriated funds of the Commission may be used to buy any tangible gift of more than minimal value for any foreign individual, unless the gift has been approved by Congress.

                13 Attention is directed to 18 U.S.C. 207(a)(1), as amended, which generally prohibits former Federal officers and employees permanently from knowingly making, with the intent to influence, any communication to or appearance before any Federal (or District of Columbia) department, agency or court, or court martial, or any officer or employee thereof, in connection with any particular matter involving a specific party or parties in which the United States (or the District of Columbia) is a party or has a direct and substantial interest and in which the former officer or employee participated personally and substantially while with the government.
            
            (b) Particular matter under an individual's official responsibility. No person who has been a member or employee of the Commission shall, within two years after that employment has ceased, knowingly make, with the intent to influence, any communication to or appearance before the Commission in connection with a particular matter involving a specific party or parties which was actually pending under his official responsibility as a member or employee of the Commission at any time within one year prior to the termination of government service. 14
              
            
            
              
                14 Attention is directed to 18 U.S.C. 207(a)(2), as amended. Section 207(a)(2) generally prohibits former Federal officers and employees, within two years after their Federal employment has ceased, from knowingly making, with the intent to influence, any communication to or appearance before any Federal (or District of Columbia) department, agency or court, or court martial, or any officer or employee thereof, in connection with any particular matter involving a specific party or parties in which the United States (or the District of Columbia) is a party or has a direct and substantial interest and which was actually pending under the official responsibility of the former officer or employee within one year prior to the termination of government service.
              As used in paragraph (b) of this section, the term “official responsibility” has the meaning assigned to it in 18 U.S.C. 202(b), namely, the “direct administrative or operating authority, whether intermediate or final, and either exercisable alone or with others, and either personally or through subordinates, to approve, disapprove, or otherwise direct Government action.”
            
            (c) Restrictions on former members and senior employees. A former member or employee of the Commission who occupied a “senior” position specified in 18 U.S.C. 207(c)(2), as amended, shall not within one year after such “senior” employment has ceased, knowingly make, with the intent to influence, any communication to or appearance before the Commission on behalf of any other person in connection with any matter in which such person seeks official action by the Commission. 15
              
            
            
              
                15 Attention is directed to 18 U.S.C. 207(c), as amended, which places restrictions on the representational activities of certain senior officers and employees after their departure from a senior position. Section 207(c) generally makes it unlawful for one year after service in a “senior” position terminates for a former “senior” Federal employee to knowingly make, with the intent to influence, any communication to or appearance before an employee of a department or agency in which he served in any capacity during the one year period prior to termination from “senior” service, if that communication or appearance is on behalf of any other person (except the United States), in connection with any matter concerning which he seeks official action by that employee.
              Note that the one year period is measured from the date when the employee ceases to be a senior employee, not from the termination of Government service, unless the two occur simultaneously. This provision prohibits communications to or appearances before the Government and does not prohibit “behind-the-scenes” assistance. The restriction does not require that the former employee have ever been in any way involved in the matter that is the subject of the communication or appearance. The restriction applies with respect to any matter, whether or not involving a specific party.
            
            (d) Exceptions. The prohibitions contained in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section do not apply to communications solely for the purpose of furnishing scientific or technological information if approved by the Commission or generally to giving testimony under oath or making a statement which is subject to penalty or perjury. Further, the prohibition contained in paragraph (c) of this section does not apply to an uncompensated statement in a particular area within the special knowledge of the former Commission member or employee. 16
              
            
            
              
                16 Attention is directed to 18 U.S.C. 207(j), as amended (listing other exceptions). Self-representation is not prohibited under section 207.
            
            (e) Reporting requirement. Any former member or employee of the Commission who, within two years after ceasing to be such, is employed or retained as the representative of any person (except the United States) in connection with a matter in which it is contemplated that he will appear before or communicate with the Commission shall, within ten days of such retainer or employment, or of the time when appearance before or communication with the Commission is first contemplated, file with the General Counsel of the Commission a statement as to the nature thereof together with any desired explanation as to why it is deemed consistent with this section. Employment of a recurrent character may be covered by a single comprehensive statement. Each such statement should include an appropriate caption indicating that it is filed pursuant to this section. The reporting requirement of this paragraph does not apply to communications incidental to court appearances in litigation involving the Commission.
            (f) Definitions. As used in this section, the phrase “appearance before the Commission” means any formal or informal appearance on behalf of any person (except the United States) before the Commission, or any member or employee thereof with an intent to influence. As used in this section, the phrase “communication with the Commission” means any oral or written communication made to the Commission, or any member or employee thereof, on behalf of any person (except the United States) with an intent to influence.
            (g) Advisory ruling. Persons in doubt as to the applicability of this section may apply for an advisory ruling by addressing a letter requesting such a ruling to the General Counsel.
            (h) Procedures for administrative enforcement of statutory restrictions on post-government employment conflicts of interest 17
              —(1) Scope. The provisions of this paragraph prescribe procedures for administrative enforcement of the restrictions which 18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b), and (c), as amended, place on appearances before or communications with Federal (and District of Columbia) departments, agencies and courts, and other enumerated entities, as well as the officers and employees thereof, by former Commission members and employees.
            
              
                17 This section does not apply to employees who leave service after December 31, 1990.
            
            (2) Investigations. The General Counsel of the Commission, or his or her designee, shall conduct such investigations as he or she deems appropriate to determine whether any former Commission member or employee have violated 18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b) or (c), as amended. The General Counsel shall report the results of his or her investigations to the Commission and shall recommend to the Commission such action as he or she deems appropriate.
            (3) Hearings. Hearings required to be held under the provisions of this section shall be held before an Administrative Law Judge, utilizing the procedures prescribed by the Commission's rules of practice for adjudicatory proceedings (17 CFR part 10), except to the extent that those rules are inconsistent with the provisions of this section. Any proceeding brought under the provisions of this section shall be prosecuted by the General Counsel or his or her designee.
            (4) Sanctions. If the Commission finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that a former Commission member or employee has violated 18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b) or (c), as amended, the Commission may prohibit that person from making, on behalf of any other person (except the United States), any formal or informal appearance before, or with the intent to influence any oral or written communication to, the Commission on a pending matter of business for a period not to exceed five years, or may take other appropriate disciplinary action.

            § 140.735-8
            Interpretative and advisory service.
            (a) Counselor for the Commission. The General Counsel, or his or her designee, will serve as Counselor for the Commission and as the Commission's representative to the Office of Government Ethics, on matters covered by this subpart. The General Counsel will also serve as the Commission's designated agency ethics official to review the financial reports filed by high-level Commission officials under title II of the Ethics in Government Act, as well as otherwise to coordinate and manage the Commission's ethics program.
            (b) Duties of the Counselor. The Counselor shall:
            (1) Coordinate the agency's counseling services and assure that counseling and interpretations on questions of conflict of interests and other matters covered by the regulations in this subpart are available as needed to Regional Deputy Counselors, who shall be appointed by the General Counsel, in coordination with the Chairman of the Commission, for each Regional Office of the Commission;
            (2) Render authoritative advice and guidance on matters covered by the regulations in this subpart which are presented to him or her by employees in the Washington, DC headquarters office; and
            (3) Receive information on, and resolve or forward to the Commission for consideration, any conflict of interests or apparent conflict of interests which appears in the annual financial disclosure (Standard Form 278 or Standard Form 450), or is disclosed to the General Counsel by a member or employee pursuant to § 140.735-2a(d) of this part, or otherwise is made known to the General Counsel.

            (i) A conflict of interests or apparent conflict of interests is considered resolved by the General Counsel when the affected member or employee has executed an ethics agreement pursuant to 5 CFR 2634.801 et seq. to undertake specific actions in order to resolve the actual or apparent conflict.
            (ii) If, after advice and guidance from the General Counsel, a member or employee does not execute an ethics agreement, the conflict of interests is considered unresolved and must be referred to the Commission for resolution or further action consistent with 18 U.S.C. 208 and 28 U.S.C. 535.
            (iii) Where an unresolved conflict of interests or apparent conflict of interests is to be forwarded to the Commission by the General Counsel, the General Counsel will promptly notify the affected member or employee in writing of his or her intent to forward the matter to the Commission. Any member or employee so affected will be afforded an opportunity to be heard by the Commission through written submission.
            (c) Regional Deputy Counselors. Regional Deputy Counselors shall:
            (1) Give advice and guidance as requested to the employees assigned to their respective Regional Offices; and
            (2) Receive information on and refer to the Director of Human Resources, any conflict of interests or appearance of conflict of interests in Statements of Employment and Financial Interests submitted by employees to whom they are required to give advice and guidance.
            (d) Confidentiality of communications. Communications between the Counselor and Regional Deputy Counselors and an employee shall be confidential, except as deemed necessary by the Commission or the Counselor to carry out the purposes of this subpart and of the laws of the United States. 18
              
            
            
              
                18 No attorney-client privilege, however, attaches to such communications since the Counselors are counsel to the Commission, not to the employee. Thus, any evidence of criminal law violations divulged by an employee to the Counselor must be reported by the latter to the Commission, which may refer the matter to the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice and the United States Attorney in whose venue the violations lie.
            
            (e) Furnishing of conduct regulations. The Director of Human Resources shall furnish a copy of this Conduct Regulation to each member, employee, and special government employee immediately upon his or her entrance on duty and shall thereafter, annually, and at such other times as circumstances warrant, bring to the attention of each member and employee this Conduct Regulation and all revisions thereof.
            (f) Availability of counseling services. The Director of Human Resources shall notify each member, employee, and special government employee of the availability of counseling services and of how and where these services are available at the time of entrance on duty and periodically thereafter.

          § 141.1
          Purpose and scope.
          (a) This regulation provides procedures for the collection by administrative offset of a federal employee's salary without his/her consent to satisfy certain debts owed to the federal government. These regulations apply to employees of other federal agencies and current employees of the Commission who owe debts to the Commission and to current employees of the Commission who owe debts to other federal agencies. This regulation does not apply when the employee consents to recovery from his/her current pay account.
          (b) This regulation does not apply to debts or claims arising under:

          (1) The Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, 26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.;
          (2) The Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.;
          (3) The tariff laws of the United States; or
          (4) Any case where a collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute.

          (c) This regulation does not apply to any adjustment to pay arising out of an employee's selection of coverage or a change in coverage under a federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less.

          (d) This regulation does not preclude the compromise, suspension, or termination of collection action where appropriate under the standards implementing the Federal Claims Collection Act, 31 U.S.C. 3711 et seq., 4 CFR parts 101 through 105, 45 CFR part 1177.
          (e) This regulation does not preclude an employee from requesting waiver of an overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584, 10 U.S.C. 2774 or 32 U.S.C. 716 or in any way questioning the amount or validity of the debt by submitting a subsequent claim to the General Accounting Office in accordance with General Accounting Office procedures. This regulation does not preclude an employee from requesting a waiver pursuant to other statutory provisions applicable to the particular debt being collected. Neither the requesting of a waiver nor the filing of a claim with the General Accounting Office will affect the amount or validity of the debt being collected until a waiver has been granted or the debt has been determined to be for an incorrect amount or invalid.

          (f) Matters not addressed in these regulations should be reviewed in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards at 4 CFR 101.1 et seq.

          § 141.5
          Hearing.
          (a) Request for hearing. (1) An employee must file a petition for a hearing in accordance with the instructions outlined in the Commission's notice to offset.

The petition for a hearing must be received by the Executive Director no later than fifteen (15) calendar days after the date of the notice to offset unless the employee can show good cause for failing to meet the deadline date.
          (b) Hearing procedures. (1) The hearing will be presided over by an impartial hearing official.
          (2) The hearing shall conform to procedures contained in the Federal Claims Collection Standards 4 CFR 102.3(c). The burden shall be on the employee to demonstrate that the existence or the amount of the debt is in error.
        
        
          § 141.6
          Written decision.
          (a) The hearing official shall issue a written opinion no later than 60 days after the hearing.
          (b) The written opinion will include a statement of the facts presented to demonstrate the nature and origin of the alleged debt; the hearing official's analysis, findings and conclusions; the amount and validity of the debt, and the repayment schedule.
        
        
          § 141.7
          Coordinating offset with another Federal agency.
          (a) The Commission as the creditor agency. When the Commission determines that an employee of another federal agency owes a delinquent debt to the Commission, the Commission shall as appropriate:
          (1) Arrange for a hearing upon the proper petitioning by the employee;

          (2) Certify to the paying agency in writing that the employee owes the debt, the amount and basis of the debt, the date on which payment is due, the date the Government's right to collect the debt accrued, and that Commission regulations for salary offset have been approved by the Office of Personnel Management;
          
          (3) If collection must be made in installments, the Commission must advise the paying agency of the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be collected in each installment;
          (4) Advise the paying agency of the actions taken under 5 U.S.C. 5514(b) and provide the dates on which action was taken unless the employee has consented to salary offset in writing or signed a statement acknowledging that the Commission has complied with the procedures required by law. The written consent or acknowledgment must be sent to the paying agency;
          (5) If the employee is in the process of separating, the Commission must submit its debt claim to the paying agency as provided in this part. The paying agency must certify any amounts already collected, notify the employee, and send a copy of the certification and notice of the employee's separation to the Commission. If the paying agency is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or similar payments, it must certify to the agency responsible for making such payments the amount of the debt and that the provisions of 5 CFR 550.1108 have been followed; and
          (6) If the employee has already separated and all payments due from the paying agency have been paid, the Commission may request, unless otherwise prohibited, that money payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar funds be collected by administrative offset.
          (b) The Commission as the paying agency. (1) Upon receipt of a properly certified debt claim from another agency, deductions will be scheduled to begin at the next established pay interval. The employee must receive written notice from the Commission that the Commission has received a certified debt claim from the creditor agency, the amount of the debt, the date salary offset will begin, and the amount of the deduction(s). The Commission shall not review the merits of the creditor agency's determination of the validity or the amount of the certified claim.
          (2) If the employee transfers to another agency after the creditor agency has submitted its debt claim to the Commission and before the debt is collected completely, the Commission must certify the total amount collected. One copy of the certification must be furnished to the employee. A copy must be furnished the creditor agency with notice of the employee's transfer.
        
        
          § 141.8
          Procedures for salary offset.
          (a) Deductions to liquidate an employee's debt will be by the method and in the amount stated in the Commission's notice of intention to offset as provided in § 141.4. Debts will be collected in one lump sum where possible. If the employee is financially unable to pay in one lump sum, collection must be made in installments.
          (b) Debts will be collected by deduction at officially established pay intervals from an employee's current pay account unless alternative arrangements for repayment are made.
          (c) Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size of installment deductions must bear a reasonable relationship to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. The deduction for the pay intervals for any period must not exceed 15% of disposable pay unless the employee has agreed in writing to a deduction of a greater amount.
          (d) Unliquidated debts may be offset against any financial payment due to a separated employee including but not limited to final salary or leave payments in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716.
        
        
          § 141.9
          Refunds.
          (a) The Commission will refund promptly any amounts deducted to satisfy debts owed to the Commission when the debt is waived, found not owed to the Commission or when directed by an administrative or judicial order.

          (b) The creditor agency will promptly return any amounts deducted by the Commission to satisfy debts owed to the creditor agency when the debt is waived, found not owed, or when directed by an administrative or judicial order.
          
          (c) Unless required by law, refunds under this subsection shall not bear interest.
        
        
          § 141.10
          Statute of limitations.
          If a debt has been outstanding for more than 10 years after the agency's right to collect the debt first accrued, the agency may not collect by salary offset unless facts material to the Government's right to collect were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the official or officials who were charged with the responsibility for discovery and collection of such debts.
        
        
          § 141.11
          Non-waiver of rights.
          An employee's involuntary payment of all or any part of a debt collected under these regulations will not be construed as a waiver of any rights that employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any other provision of contract or law unless there are statutes or contract(s) to the contrary.
        
        
          § 141.12
          Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.
          Charges may be assessed for interest, penalties, and administrative costs in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 4 CFR 102.13.

          § 142.1
          Purpose and scope.
          This part sets forth the policy and procedure with respect to the indemnification of Commission employees who are sued in their individual capacities and suffer an adverse judgment as a result of conduct taken within the scope of employment. (For purposes of this part the term Commission employees includes all present and former Commissioners and employees of the Commission). This part is intended to provide indemnification for adverse judgments for constitutional and federal statutory torts excepted from the Federal Tort Claims Act exclusive remedy provision 28 U.S.C. 2679(b) (as amended by the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-694)). In any lawsuit which is filed against the employee alleging a common law tort occurring within the scope of employment, the United States may be substituted for the individual employee and any liability which may be found will be assessed against the government, pursuant to the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988.
        
        
          § 142.2
          Policy.
          (a) The Commission may indemnify its employees by the payment of available funds, in whole, or in part, for any verdict, judgment or other monetary award which is rendered against any employee, provided that the conduct giving rise to the verdict, judgment or award was taken within the scope of his or her employment with the Commission and that such indemnification is in the interest of the United States, as determined by the Commission.
          (b) The Commission may settle or compromise a personal damage claim against its employee by the payment of available funds, at any time, provided the alleged conduct giving rise to the personal damage claim was taken within the scope of employment and that such settlement is in the interest of the United States as determined by the Commission in its discretion.
          (c) Absent exceptional circumstances, as determined by the Commission, the Commission will not entertain a request either to agree to indemnify or to settle a personal damage claim before entry of an adverse verdict, judgment or monetary award.

          (d) When an employee of the Commission becomes aware that an action may be or has been filed against the employee in his or her individual capacity as a result of conduct taken within the scope of his or her employment, the employee should immediately notify the Commission's Office of General Counsel that such an action is pending or threatened.
          
          (e) The employee may thereafter request either (1) indemnification to satisfy a verdict, judgment or award entered against the employee or (2) payment to satisfy the requirements of a settlement proposal. The employee shall submit a written request, with documentation including copies of the verdict, judgment, award or settlement proposal, as appropriate, to the head of his or her division or office, who thereupon shall submit to the General Counsel, in a timely manner, a recommended disposition of the request. The General Counsel shall also seek the views of the Department of Justice. The General Counsel shall forward the request, the division or office's recommendation and the General Counsel's recommendation to the Commission for decision.
          (f) Any payment under this section either to indemnify a Commodity Futures Trading Commission employee or to settle a personal damage claim shall be contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

          § 143.1
          Purpose.
          This part provides procedures that the Commission will use to collect debts owed the United States arising from activities under the Commission's jurisdiction. As applicable, these procedures are based upon, and conform to, the Federal Claims Collection Act, as amended, 31 U.S.C. 3701-3720E; the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 31 CFR Parts 900-905, issued by the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Justice; administrative wage garnishment regulations issued by the Department of the Treasury, 31 CFR 285.11; and other laws applicable to the collection of non-tax debts owed to the United States arising from activities under the Commission's jurisdiction. Subpart A describes procedures for collection by offset against obligations of the United States to the debtor, by compromise, and by referral to the Department of Justice for litigation. It also sets forth the Commission's policy on collecting interest on unpaid claims, the method used in calculating such interest, and the maximum inflation-adjusted civil monetary penalties that may be assessed and enforced for each violation of the Commodity Exchange Act or regulations or orders of the Commission promulgated thereunder. Subpart B describes procedures for collection by administrative garnishment of the debtor's wages.

          Subpart A—General Provisions
          
            § 143.2
            Notice of claim.
            (a) The Commission will send a written notice to any person who owes payment to the United States under this part, stating the basis for the claim, the interest, penalties, and administrative costs that may be imposed for non-payment, and the date full payment is due.

            (b) If the claim is disputed, the debtor shall respond to the notice in writing and state the reasons for non-payment. If the claim is not disputed but full payment is not made by the date indicated in the notice, the debtor shall state the reasons for the failure to make full payment.
            (c) If no response or an unsatisfactory response is received by the date indicated in the notice, the Commission may take further action as appropriate under the Commodity Exchange Act or regulations thereunder, or under 31 CFR parts 900-905 or the Federal Claims Collection Act as amended, 31 U.S.C. 3701-3720E.

            § 143.3
            Interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs.

            (a) The Commission will assess interest on unpaid claims. The rate of interest assessed shall be the rate of the current value of funds to the U.S. Treasury (i.e., the Treasury tax and loan account rate) as prescribed and published by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Commission will charge penalty fees of not more than 6 percent per year on any portion of a claim that is delinquent for more than 90 days. The Commission will also impose actual administrative costs to cover the processing and handling of delinquent claims.
            (b) Interest on claims will be charged and will run from the date the notice of claim is mailed if the amount of the claim is not paid within 30 days from that date. Interest will be calculated only on the principal of the claim. The rate of interest charged is the rate in effect on the date from which interest begins to run. The rate will remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness.
            (c) The Commission may waive in whole or in part interest, penalty charges or administrative costs if it finds that:
            (1) The debtor is unable to pay any significant sum within a reasonable period of time;
            (2) Collection of interest or penalty charges jeopardizes collection of the principal of the claim; or
            (3) It is in the best interests of the United States.
          
          
            § 143.4
            Collection by offset.
            (a) Whenever feasible, the Commission will collect claims under this part by means of administrative offset against obligations of the United States to the debtor.
            (b) The Commission will notify the debtor in writing of its intent to use offset procedures to collect the debt unless the debtor agrees to repayment. The notice to the debtor shall include the type and amount of the claim and an explanation of the debtor's rights for records and review under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a).
            (c) The Commission will seek to coordinate administrative offset with other federal agencies in accordance with 4 CFR part 102.
          
          
            § 143.5
            Collection by compromise.
            The Commission may settle claims not exceeding $100,000 (excluding interest) by compromise at less than the principal amount of the claim if—
            (a) The debtor shows an inability to pay the full amount within a reasonable period of time;
            (b) The Government would be unable to enforce collection in full through litigation or administrative means within a reasonable period of time;
            (c) The cost of collecting the claim in full is not justified by the amount of the claim; or
            (d) The Commission's enforcement policy would be served by settlement of the claim for less than the full amount.

            § 143.6
            Referral for litigation.
            Claims that cannot be collected by the Commission under this part or for which collection action cannot be ended or suspended under 4 CFR part 104 will be referred to the Department of Justice for litigation.
          
          
            § 143.7
            Delegation of authority to the Executive Director.

            (a) The Commission hereby delegates, until such time as the Commission orders otherwise, to the Executive Director or to any Commission employee under the Executive Director's supervision as he or she may designate, authority to take action to carry out subpart A and subpart B of this part and the requirements of 31 CFR parts 900-905 and 31 CFR 285.11.
            
            (b) Delegated waivers or compromise under this part shall be with the concurrence of the General Counsel and the Director of the Division of Enforcement or of their respective designees.

            § 143.8
            Inflation-adjusted civil monetary penalties.
            (a) Statutory inflation adjustment of civil monetary penalties. The Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended, requires annual inflation adjustments to the civil monetary penalties imposed under the Commodity Exchange Act for violations that occurred on or after November 2, 2015. The Commission will publish notice of these adjusted penalty amounts in the Federal Register. The inflation adjustment is calculated by multiplying the maximum dollar amount of the civil monetary penalty for the previous calendar year by the cost-of-living inflation adjustment multiplier provided by the Office Management and Budget, which is based on the change in the Consumer Price Index, and rounding the total to the nearest dollar. Set forth in the charts in paragraph (b) of this section are the inflation adjusted penalty amounts for violations occurring on or after November 2, 2015 and the penalty amounts for violations that occurred prior to November 2, 2015. These penalty charts are also available on the Commission's website at: http://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/Enforcement/InflationAdjustedCivilMonetaryPenalties/index.htm.
            
            (b) 2019 Inflation adjustment. The maximum amount of each civil monetary penalty in the following charts applies to penalties assessed after January 15, 2019:

            Whenever an individual owes the United States a delinquent non-tax debt arising from activities under the Commission's jurisdiction, the Commission, or another federal agency collecting the debt on behalf of the Commission, may initiate administrative proceedings to garnish the disposable income of the delinquent debtor in accordance with the requirements of, and the procedures set forth in, 31 CFR 285.11. The Commission's use of other debt-collection measures set forth in subpart A of this part does not preclude the initiation of an administrative wage garnishment proceeding against a delinquent debtor.
          
          
            § 143.10
            Garnishment hearings.
            Any oral or written hearing required to establish the Commission's right to collect a delinquent debt through administrative wage garnishment shall be presided over by a hearing official designated by the Executive Director, with the concurrence of the General Counsel or the General Counsel's designee. Any qualified and impartial employee of the Commission designated by the Executive Director may serve as a hearing official. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements of, and the procedures set forth in, 31 CFR 285.11(f). All documents presented to the hearing official for his or her consideration shall be marked as exhibits and retained in the record. All testimony given at an oral hearing, either in person or by telephone, shall be under oath or affirmation; a transcript of the hearing shall be prepared and made part of the record. When a debtor requests a hearing, the designated hearing official shall hold the hearing and issue his or her written decision within 60 days of the Commission's receipt of the request, unless otherwise approved, in writing, by the Executive Director.

          § 144.0
          Purpose and scope.
          (a) The regulations in this part set forth procedures to be followed with respect to the disclosure, in response to a subpoena, order or other demand (collectively “demand”) of a court or other authority of any material contained in the files of the Commission, of any information relating to material contained in the files of the Commission or any information acquired by any person while such person is or was an employee of the Commission as part of the performance of that person's official duties or by virtue of that person's official status.

Nothing in this part otherwise permits disclosure of information by the Commission except as is provided by statute or other applicable law.
          (c) This part is intended to provide guidance for the internal operations of the Commission and is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law against the Commission.
        
        
          § 144.1
          Service upon the Commission.
          (a) Subject to paragraph (e) of this section, the Secretary of the Commission is the only person authorized to accept service of a demand directed to the Commission or to an employee of the Commission for documentary information contained in or relating to information contained in the files of the Commission.
          (b) Any such demand must be addressed to the Secretary of the Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581.
          (c) In the event that any such demand is attempted to be served upon an employee of the Commission other than the Secretary of the Commission, unless otherwise directed by the Commission's General Counsel, that employee shall respectfully decline to accept service on the ground that the employee is without authority to do so.
          (d) The Secretary shall promptly advise the General Counsel of any service of any demand, and the General Counsel shall thereafter advise the Commission regarding the matter.
          (e) A demand for information contained in the Commission's files concerning the registration of persons or entities for which authority has been delegated to the National Futures Association must be served upon the National Futures Association, 200 West Madison Street, Suite 1600, Chicago, Illinois 60606, to the attention of the General Counsel.

          (a) Any employee of the Commission who is served or is attempted to be served with a demand of a court or other authority seeking information or documents relating to the business of the Commission shall promptly advise the General Counsel of the service or attempted service of such demand, the nature of the information or documents sought by the demand and any circumstances that may bear upon the desirability in the public interest of disclosure of the information or the production of documents.

          (b) Any former employee of the Commission who is served or is attempted to be served with a demand of a court or other authority seeking information or documents relating to the business of the Commission shall promptly advise the General Counsel of the service or the attempted service of such demand, the nature of the information or documents sought by the demand and any circumstances that might bear upon the desirability in the public interest of the disclosure of the information or the production of documents.
          
          (c) After such further inquiry as appropriate, the General Counsel shall advise the Commission concerning the matter.

In litigation in which the Commission is a party no employee may produce any confidential Commission material without Commission authorization.
          (b) No former employee of the Commission shall, in response to a demand by a court or other authority or otherwise in any proceeding in which the Commission is not a party, produce without Commission authorization any material contained in or from the files of the Commission acquired as part of the performance of the former employee's official duties while employed by the Commission. No former employee may in any litigation produce confidential material acquired as part of the performance of the former employee's official duties while employed by the Commission unless authorized to do so by the Commission.
        
        
          § 144.5
          Procedures when production or disclosure of Commission records or information relating to Commission business is sought.
          (a) If in any proceeding oral testimony of an employee or former employee of the Commission is sought concerning matters related to the business of the Commission, an affidavit or, if that is not feasible, a signed statement by the party seeking the testimony or by his attorney, setting forth with particularity a summary of the testimony sought and its relevance to the proceeding, must be furnished to the Commission's General Counsel at the Commission's office in Washington, DC. When authorization by the Commission is required, any authorization shall be limited to the scope of the demand as summarized in such statement.
          (b) If a response to a demand by a court or other authority is required before instructions from the Commission are received, and Commission authorization is required, a Commission attorney shall be designated by the General Counsel to appear and to inform the court or other authority of these regulations and that the subpoena or demand has been referred for prompt consideration by the Commission. The Commission attorney shall request a stay of the demand pending receipt of instructions.
          (c) In the event that the court or other authority declines to stay the effect of the demand pending receipt of instructions or in the event that the court rules that there must be compliance with the demand irrespective of instructions not to produce the material or disclose the information sought, the Commission employee or former employee upon whom the demand has been made shall respectfully decline to comply with the demand.

          § 145.7
          Requests for Commission records and copies thereof.

          Requests for Commission records and copies thereof shall specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) of the response. The Commission will accommodate requesters as to form or format if the record is readily available in that form or format. When requesters do not specify the form or format of the response, the Commission will respond in the form or format in which the document is most accessible to the Commission.
          (a) Public inquiries and inspection of public records. Information concerning the nature and extent of available public records may be obtained in person, by telephone, via Internet (http://www.cftc.gov), or by writing to the Commission offices designated in §§ 145.2 and 145.6.
          (b) Requests for nonpublic records. Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section with respect to public records, all requests for records maintained by the Commission shall be in writing, shall be addressed to the Office of General Counsel of the Commission and shall be clearly marked “Freedom of Information Act Request.”
          (c) Misdirected written requests. The Commission cannot ensure that a timely or satisfactory response will be given to requests for records that are directed to the Commission other than in the manner prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section. Any misdirected written request for nonpublic records should be promptly forwarded to the Office of General Counsel of the Commission. Misdirected requests for nonpublic records will be considered to have been received for purposes of this section only when they actually have been received by the Office of General Counsel.
          (d) Description of requested records. Each written request for Commission records made under paragraph (b) of this section shall reasonably describe the records sought with sufficient specificity to permit the records to be located among the records maintained by or for the Commission. The Commission staff may communicate with the requester (by telephone when practicable) in an effort to reduce the administrative burden of processing a broad request and to minimize fees for copying and search services.
          (e) Description of requester and intended use of requested records. In each request for records, requesters shall reasonable identify themselves as a commercial user, educational institution, noncommercial scientific institution, or representative of the news media if one of these categories is applicable. The requester shall describe the use to which the records will be put.
          (f) Request for existing records. The Commission's response to a request for nonpublic records will encompass all nonpublic records identifiable as responsive to the request that are in existence on the date that the written request is received by the Office of General Counsel. The Commission need not create a new record in response to a FOIA request.
          (g) Fee agreement. A request for copies of records pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section must indicate the requester's agreement to pay all fees that are associated with the processing of the request, in accordance with the rates set forth in appendix B to this part, or the requester's intention to limit the fees incurred to a stated amount. If the requester states a fee limitation, no work will be done that will result in fees beyond the stated amount. A requester who seeks a waiver or reduction of fees pursuant to paragraph (b) of appendix B of this part must show that such a waiver or reduction would be in the public interest. If the Office of General Counsel receives a request for records under paragraph (b) of this section from a requester who has not paid fees from a previous request in accordance with appendix B of this part, the staff will decline to process the request until such fees have been paid.
          (h) Initial determination, denials. (1) With respect to any request for nonpublic records as defined in § 145.0(c), the Compliance Staff of the Commission will forward the request to the Commission divisions or offices likely to maintain records that are responsive to the request. If a responsive record is located, the Compliance Staff will, in consultation with the Commission office in which the record was located, determine whether to comply with such request. The Compliance Staff may, in their discretion, determine whether to comply with any portion of a request for nonpublic records before considering the remainder of the request. The Compliance Staff will inform the requester of the availability of the Commission's FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance.
          (2) Where it is determined to deny, in whole or in part, a request for nonpublic records, the Compliance Staff will notify the requester of the denial, citing applicable exemptions of the Freedom of Information Act or other provisions of law that require or allow the records to be withheld. The Compliance Staff's response to the FOIA request should describe in general terms what categories of documents are being withheld under which applicable FOIA exemption or exemptions. The Compliance Staff's response will include a statement notifying the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the Commission's FOIA Public Liaison and the National Archives and Records Administration's Office of Government Information Services. The Compliance Staff, in denying an initial request for records, is not required to provide the requester with an inventory of those documents determined to be exempt from disclosure.
          (3) The Compliance Staff will issue an initial determination with respect to a FOIA request within twenty business days after receipt by the Office of General Counsel. In unusual circumstances, as defined in this paragraph, the prescribed time limit may be extended by written notice to the person making a request for a record or a copy. The notice shall set forth the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. Where the extension exceeds ten business days, the Compliance Staff will provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. The Compliance Staff or the FOIA Public Liaison is available to assist the requester in unusual circumstances. The Compliance Staff will notify the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services. As used in this paragraph, “unusual circumstances” means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of a particular request:
          (i) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;
          (ii) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request;
          (iii) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components in the Commission having substantial subject matter interest therein;
          (iv) The need to coordinate a response with several Commission offices;
          (v) The need to obtain records currently being used by members of the Commission, the Commission staff, or the public;
          (vi) The need to respond to a large number of previously-filed FOIA requests.
          (i) Administrative review. (1) Any person who has been notified pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section that his request for records has been denied in whole or in part may file an application for review as set forth below.
          (2) An application for review must be received by the Office of General Counsel within 90 days of the date of the denial by the Compliance Staff. This 90-day period shall not begin to run until the Compliance Staff has issued an initial determination with respect to all portions of the request for nonpublic records. An application for review shall be in writing and shall be marked “Freedom of Information Act Appeal” and be sent to the Commission's Office of General Counsel. If the appeal involves information as to which the FOIA requester has received a detailed written justification of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to § 145.9(e), the requester must also serve a copy of the appeal on the submitter of the information.

          (3) The applicant must attach to the application for review a copy of all correspondence relevant to the request, 
            i.e., the initial request, any correspondence amending or modifying the request, and all correspondence from the staff responding to the request.
          (4) The application for review shall state such facts and cite such legal or other authorities as the applicant may consider appropriate. The application may, in addition, include a description of the general benefit to the public from disclosure of that information.
          (5) If the appeal involves information that is subject to a petition for confidential treatment filed under § 145.9, the submitter of the information shall have an opportunity to respond in writing to the appeal within 10 business days of the date of filing the appeal. Any response shall be sent to the Commission's Office of General Counsel. Copies shall be sent to the person requesting the information.
          (6) The General Counsel, or his or her designee, shall have the authority to consider all appeals under this section from initial determinations of the Compliance Staff of the Commission. The General Counsel, or his or her designee, may:
          (i) Determine either to affirm or to reverse the initial determination in whole or in part;
          (ii) Determine to disclose a record, even if exempt, if good cause for doing so either is shown by the application or otherwise appears;
          (iii) Remand the matter to the Compliance Staff—
          (A) To correct a deficiency in the initial processing of the request, or
          (B) When an investigation as to which the staff originally claimed exemption from mandatory disclosure on the basis of 5 U.S.C. 555(b)(7)(A) or 7 U.S.C. 12(a) is subsequently closed; or
          (iv) Refer the matter to the Commission for a decision.
          (7) If the initial denial of the request for nonpublic records is reversed, the Office of General Counsel shall, in writing, advise the requester that the records will be available on or after a specified date. If, on appeal, the denial of access to a record is affirmed in whole or in part, the person who requested the information shall be notified in writing of:
          (i) The reasons for the denial,
          (ii) The mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation, and
          (iii) The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4) providing for judicial review of a determination to withhold records.
          (j) Expedited processing. A request may be given expedited processing if the requester demonstrates a compelling need for the requested records. For purposes of this provision, the term “compelling need” means: That a failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or with respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged federal government activity. A requester who seeks expedited processing must demonstrate a compelling need by submitting a statement that is certified by the requester to be true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief. The Compliance Staff will determine whether to provide expedited processing, and notice of the determination will be provided to requester, within ten days after the date of the request. If the request for expedited processing is denied, the requester may file an appeal with the Office of General Counsel within ten days of the date of the denial by the Compliance Staff. The Office of General Counsel will respond to the appeal within ten days after the date of the appeal.

          § 145.9
          Petition for confidential treatment of information submitted to the Commission.
          (a) Purpose. This section provides a procedure by which persons submitting information in any form to the Commission can request that the information not be disclosed pursuant to a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. This section does not affect the Commission's right, authority, or obligation to disclose information in any other context.
          (b) Scope. The provisions of this section shall apply only where the Commission has not specified that an alternative procedure be utilized in connection with a particular study, report, investigation, or other matter. See 40.8 for procedures to be utilized in connection with filing information required to be filed pursuant to 17 CFR parts 40 and 41.
          (c) Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section:
          (1) Submitter. A “submitter” is any person who submits any information or material to the Commission or who permits any information or material to be submitted to the Commission. For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section only, “submitter” includes any person whose information has been submitted to a designated contract market, derivatives clearing organization, swap execution facility, swap data repository or registered futures association that in turn has submitted the information to the Commission.
          (2) FOIA requester. A “FOIA requester” is any person who files with the Commission a request to inspect or copy Commission records or documents pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.
          (d) Written request for confidential treatment. (1) Any submitter may request in writing that the Commission afford confidential treatment under the Freedom of Information Act to any information that he or she submits to the Commission. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, no oral requests for confidential treatment will be accepted by the Commission. The submitter shall specify the grounds on which confidential treatment is being requested but need not provide a detailed written justification of the request unless required to do so under paragraph (e) of this section. Confidential treatment may be requested only on the grounds that disclosure:
          (i) Is specifically exempted by a statute that either requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such manner as to leave no discretion on the issue or establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.
          (ii) Would reveal the submitter's trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information.
          (iii) Would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the submitter's personal privacy.
          (iv) Would reveal investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes whose disclosure would deprive the submitter of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication.
          (v) Would reveal investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes whose disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the submitter.

          (vi) Would reveal investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes when disclosure would interfere with enforcement proceedings or disclose investigative techniques and procedures, provided, that the claim may be made only by a designated contract market, derivatives clearing organization, swap execution facility, swap data repository or registered futures association with regard to its own investigatory records.
          (2) The original of any written request for confidential treatment must be sent to the Assistant Secretary of the Commission for FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts Compliance. A copy of any request for confidential treatment shall be sent to the Commission division or office receiving the original of any material for which confidential treatment is being sought.

          (3) A request for confidential treatment shall be clearly marked “FOIA Confidential Treatment Request” and shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of the submitter. The submitter is responsible for informing the Assistant Secretary of the Commission for FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts Compliance of any changes in his or her name, address, and telephone number.
          (4) A request for confidential treatment should accompany the material for which confidential treatment is being sought. If a request for confidential treatment is filed after the filing of such material, the submitter shall have the burden of showing that it was not possible to request confidential treatment for that material at the time the material was filed. A request for confidential treatment of a future submission will not be processed. All records which contain information for which a request for confidential treatment is made or the appropriate segregable portions thereof should be marked by the person submitting the records with a prominent stamp, typed legend, or other suitable form of notice on each page or segregable portion of each page stating “Confidential Treatment Requested by [name].” If such marking is impractical under the circumstances, a cover sheet prominently marked “Confidential Treatment Requested by [name]” should be securely attached to each group of records submitted for which confidential treatment is requested. Each of the records transmitted in this matter should be individually marked with an identifying number and code so that they are separately identifiable. In some circumstances, such as when a person is testifying in the course of a Commission investigation or providing documents requested in the course of a Commission inspection, it may be impractical to submit a written request for confidential treatment at the time the information is first provided to the Commission. In no circumstances can the need to comply with the requirements of this section justify or excuse any delay in submitting information to the Commission. Rather, in such circumstances, the person testifying or otherwise submitting information should inform the Commission employee receiving the information, at the time the information is submitted or as soon thereafter as practicable, that the person is requesting confidential treatment for the information. The person shall then submit a written request for confidential treatment within 30 days of the submission of the information. If access is requested under the Freedom of Information Act with respect to material for which no timely request for confidential treatment has been made, it may be presumed that the submitter of the information has waived any interest in asserting that the material is confidential.
          (5) A request for confidential treatment shall state the length of time for which confidential treatment is being sought.
          (6) A request for confidential treatment (as distinguishing from the material that is the subject of the request) shall be considered a public document. When a submitter deems it necessary to include, in its request for confidential treatment, information for which it seeks confidential treatment, the submitter shall place that information in an appendix to the request.
          (7) On 10 business days notice from the Assistant Secretary, a submitter shall submit a detailed written justification of a request for confidential treatment, as specified in paragraph (e) of this section. Upon request and for good cause shown, the Assistant Secretary may grant an extension of such time. The Assistant Secretary will notify the submitter that failure to provide timely a detailed written justification will be deemed a waiver of the submitter's opportunity to appeal an adverse determination.
          (8)(i) Requests for confidential treatment for any reasonably segregable material that is not exempt from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, as implemented in § 145.5, shall be summarily rejected under § 145.9(d)(9). Requests for confidential treatment of public information contained in financial reports as specified in § 1.10 shall not be processed. A submitter has the burden of specifying clearly and precisely the material that is the subject of the confidential treatment request. A submitter may be able to meet this burden in various ways, including:
          (A) Segregating material for which confidential treatment is being sought;

          (B) Submitting two copies of the submission: a copy from which material for which confidential treatment is being sought has been obliterated, deleted, or clearly marked and an unmarked copy; and
          (C) Clearly describing the material within a submission for which confidential treatment is being sought.
          (ii) A submitter shall not employ a method of specifying the material for which confidential treatment is being sought if that method makes it unduly difficult for the Commission to read the full submission, including all portion claimed to be confidential, in its entirely.
          (9) If a submitter fails to follow the procedures set forth in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(8) of this section, the Assistant Secretary of the Commission for FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts Compliance or his or her designee may summarily reject the submitter's request for confidential treatment with leave to the submitter to refile a proper petition. Failure of the Assistant Secretary or his or her designee summarily to reject a confidential treatment request pursuant to this paragraph shall not be construed to indicate that the submitter has complied with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(8) of this section.
          (10) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(9) of this section, no determination with respect to any request for confidential treatment will be made until the Commission receives a Freedom of Information Act request for the material for which confidential treatment is being sought.
          (e) Detailed written justification of request for confidential treatment. (1) If the Assistant Secretary or his or her designee determines that a FOIA request seeks material for which confidential treatment has been requested pursuant to § 145.9, the Assistant Secretary or his or her designee shall require the submitter to file a detailed written justification of the confidential request within ten business days (unless under § 145.9(d)(7) an extension of time has been granted) of that determination unless, pursuant to an earlier FOIA request, a prior determination to release or withhold the material has been made, the submitter has already provided sufficient information to grant the request for confidential treatment; or the material is otherwise in the public domain. The detailed written justification shall be filed with the Assistant Secretary of the Commission for FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts Compliance. It shall be clearly marked “Detailed Written Justification of FOIA Confidential Treatment Request” and shall contain the request number supplied by the Commission. The submitter shall also send a copy of the detailed written justification to the FOIA requester at the address specified by the Commission.
          (2) The period for filing a detailed written justification may be extended upon request and for good cause shown.
          (3) The detailed written justification of the confidential treatment request shall contain:
          (i) The reasons, referring to the specific exemptive provisions of the Freedom of Information Act listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, why the information that is the subject of the FOIA request should be withheld from access under the Freedom of Information Act;
          (ii) The applicability of any specific statutory or regulatory provisions that govern or may govern the treatment of the information;
          (iii) The existence and applicability of prior determinations by the Commission, other federal agencies, or courts concerning the specific exemptive provisions of the Freedom of Information Act pursuant to which confidential treatment is being requested. Submitters shall satisfy any evidentiary burdens imposed upon them by applicable Freedom of Information Act case law.
          (iv) Such additional facts and authorities as the submitter may consider appropriate.
          (4) The detailed written justification of a confidential treatment request shall be accompanied by affidavits to the extent necessary to establish the facts necessary to satisfy the submitter's evidentiary burden.

          (5) The detailed written justification of a confidential treatment request (as distinguished from the material that is the subject of the request) shall be considered a public document. However, a submitter will be permitted to submit to the Commission supplementary confidential affidavits with his or her detailed written justification if that is the only way in which he or she can convincingly demonstrate that the material that is the subject of the confidential treatment request should not be disclosed to the FOIA requester.
          (f) Initial determination with respect to petition for confidential treatment. (1) The Assistant Secretary for FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts Compliance or his or her designee, in consultation with the Office in which the record was located, shall issue an initial determination with respect to a confidential treatment request for material that is responsive to the FOIA request. This determination shall be issued at the same time as the initial determination with respect to the FOIA request. See § 145.7(g). To the extent that the initial determination grants a confidential treatment request in full or in part, it should specify the FOIA exemptions upon which this determination is based and briefly describe the material to which each exemption applies. See § 145.7(g)(2). To the extent that the initial determination denies confidential treatment to any material for which confidential treatment was requested, it should briefly describe the material for which confidential treatment is denied.
          (2) If the Assistant Secretary or his or her designee determines that a confidential treatment request shall be denied in full or in part, the submitter shall be informed of his or her right to appeal to the Commission's General Counsel in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (g) of this section. The material for which confidential treatment was denied shall be released to the FOIA requester if the submitter does not file an appeal within 10 business days of the date on which his or her request was denied.
          (3) If the Assistant Secretary or his or her designee determines that a confidential treatment request shall be granted in full or in part, the FOIA requester shall be informed of his or her right to appeal to the Commission's General Counsel in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 145.7(h).
          (g) Appeal from initial determination that confidential treatment is not warranted. (1) An appeal from an initial determination to deny a confidential treatment request in full or in part shall be filed with the General Counsel of the Commission. No disclosure of the material that is the subject of the appeal shall be made until the appeal is resolved. If both a submitter and a FOIA requester appeal to the General Counsel from a partial grant and partial denial of a confidential treatment request, those appeals shall be consolidated.
          (2) Any appeal of a denial of a request for confidential treatment shall be in writing, and shall be clearly marked “FOIA Confidential Treatment Appeal.” The appeal shall include a copy of the initial determination and shall clearly indicate the portions of the initial determination from which an appeal is being taken.
          (3) The appeal shall be sent to the Commission's Office of General Counsel. A copy of the appeal shall be sent to the FOIA requester. The General Counsel or his or her designee shall have the authority to consider all appeals from initial determinations of the Assistant Secretary of the Commission for FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts compliance. The General Counsel may, in his sole and unfettered discretion, refer such appeals and questions concerning stays under paragraph (g)(10) of this section to the Commission for decision.
          (4) In the appeal, the submitter may supply additional substantiation for his or her request for confidential treatment, including additional affidavits and additional legal argument. Such submissions shall be governed by paragraph (e)(5) of this section.
          (5) The FOIA requester shall have an opportunity to respond in writing to the appeal within 10 business days of the date of filing of the FOIA Confidential Treatment Appeal. The FOIA requester need not respond, however. Any response shall be sent to the Commission's Office of General Counsel. A copy shall be sent to the submitter.
          (6) All FOIA Confidential Treatment Appeals and all responses thereto shall be considered public documents.

          (7) The General Counsel will make a determination with respect to any appeal within twenty business days after receipt by the Office of General Counsel of such appeal or within such extended period as may be permitted in accordance with the standards set forth in § 145.7(g)(3). Although other procedures may be employed, to the extent possible the General Counsel will decide the appeal on the basis of the affidavits and other documentary evidence submitted by the submitter and the FOIA requests.
          (8) The General Counsel or his or her designee shall have the authority to remand any matter to the Assistant Secretary of the Commission for FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts Compliance to correct deficiencies in the initial processing of the confidential treatment request.
          (9) If the General Counsel or his or her designee denies a confidential treatment appeal in full or in part, the information for which confidential treatment is denied shall be disclosed to the FOIA requester 10 business days later, subject to any stay entered pursuant to paragraph (g)(10) of this section.
          (10) The General Counsel or his or here designee shall have the authority to enter and vacate stays as set forth below. If, within 10 business days of the date of issuance of a determination by the General Counsel or his or her designee to disclose information for which a submitter sought confidential treatment, the submitter commences an action in federal court concerning that determination, the General Counsel will stay the public disclosure of the information pending final judicial resolution of the matter. The General Counsel or his or her designee may vacate a stay entered under this section, either on his or her own motion or at the request of the FOIA requester. If such a stay is vacated, the information will be released to the requester 10 business days after the submitter is notified of this action, unless a court orders otherwise.
          (h) Extensions of time limits. Any time limit under this section may be extended for good cause shown, in the discretion of the Commission, the Commission's General Counsel, or the Assistant Secretary of the Commission for FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts Compliance.
          (i) A submitter whose confidential treatment request has been upheld by the Commission shall, upon request of the General Counsel, aid the Commission in defending a court action to compel the Commission to disclose the information subject to the confidential treatment request. If the submitter is unwilling to aid the Commission in this regard, the General Counsel may, in appropriate cases, make the information available to the public.

          Appendix B to Part 145—Schedule of Fees
          (a) Charges for requests. The following charges may be made where applicable for responding to requests for records.
          (1) $4.75 for each quarter hour spent by clerical personnel in searching for or reviewing records.
          (2) When a search or review cannot be performed by clerical personnel, $10.25 for each quarter hour spent by professional personnel in searching or reviewing records.
          (3) When searches require the expertise of a computer specialist, staff time for programming and performing searches will be charged at $10.25 per quarter hour. For searches of records stored on personal computers used as workstations by Commission staff and shared access network servers, the computer processing time is included in the search time for the staff member using the workstation as set forth in paragraph (a) of this appendix.
          (4) Document duplication, including computer printouts, will be charged at $0.15 per page.
          (5) For copies of materials other than paper records, the requester will be charged the actual cost of materials and reproduction, including the time of clerical personnel at a rate of $4.75 per quarter hour.
          (6) When a request has been made and granted to examine Commission records at an office of the Commission other than the office in which the records are routinely maintained, the requester:
          (i) Will reimburse the Commission for the actual cost of transporting the records; and
          (ii) Will be charged at a rate of $4.75 for each quarter hour spent by clerical personnel in preparing the records for transit.
          (7) For certifying that requested records are true copies, the charge will be $3.00 per certification.
          (8) Upon request, records will be mailed by means of overnight or express mail at the fee of $10.00 per package mailed.
          (b) Waiver or reduction of fees. Fees will be waived or reduced by the Commission if:
          (1) The fee is less than or equal to $10.00, the approximate cost to the Commission of collecting the fee; or,
          (2) If the Commission determines that the disclosure of the information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
          (c) Applicability of fees. Fees shall be charged even if no records are ultimately furnished to the requester. Fees apply to various types of requests as follows.
          (1) Commercial use request. Fees for search time, review time and duplication of records will be charged to requests from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a user or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made.
          (2) Educational institution or noncommercial scientific institution. Only duplication fees will be charged to schools or to organizations which operate solely for the purpose of scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. No charge will be made for the first 100 pages duplicated or for search or review time.
          (3) Representative of the news media. Only duplication fees will be charged to any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. No charge will be made for the first 100 pages duplicated or for search or review time.
          (4) Other requesters. Fees for search time and duplication will be charged to requesters who are not covered by one of the categories above. No charge will be made for the first two hours of search time, the first 100 pages of duplication, or for review time. If the search is for records stored in a computer format, a combination of computer operation charges and search time charges will be waived up to the equivalent of two hours of professional search time.
          (d) Aggregation of requests. For purposes of determining fees, the Commission may aggregate reasonably related requests if multiple requests are made within a 30-day period or if there is a solid basis for believing that multiple requests were made solely to avoid fees.
          (e) Notification of fees. A request for Commission records may state that the party is willing to pay fees up to a stated limit for services to be provided in searching, reviewing and duplicating requested records. If such a statement is made, no work will be done that will result in fees beyond the stated limit without written authorization. If no limit is stated, no work will be done that will result in fees in excess of $25.00 without written authorization from the requester.
          (f) Advance payment of fees. The Commission may request advance payment of all or part of the fee (i) when fees are expected to exceed $250; or (ii) when a requester has previously failed to pay fees in a timely fashion.
          (g) Payment of fees. Payment should be made by check or money order payable to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
          (h) Interest on fees. The Commission will begin charging interest on unpaid bills starting on the 31th day following the day on which the bill was sent. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.
          (i) Collection of fees. If fees not paid, the Commission may disclose debts to appropriate authorities for collection or to consumer reporting agencies.

          (a) This part contains the rules of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission implementing the Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-579, 5 U.S.C. 552a). These rules apply to all records maintained by this Commission which are not excepted or exempted as set forth in § 146.12, insofar as they contain personal information concerning an individual, identify that individual by name or other symbol and are contained in a system of records from which information is retrieved by the individual's name or identifying symbol. Among the primary purposes of these rules are to permit individuals to determine whether information about them is contained in Commission files and, if so, to obtain access to that information; to establish procedures whereby individuals may have inaccurate and incomplete information corrected; and, to restrict access by unauthorized persons to that information.

          (b) In this part the Commission is also exempting certain Commission systems of records from some of the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 that would otherwise be applicable to those systems. These exemptions are authorized under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k).

If a definitive reply cannot be given within ten days, the request will be acknowledged and an explanation will be given of the status of the request.
          (e) When an individual has requested access to records, available to him under these rules, he will either be notified in writing of where and when he may obtain access to the records requested or be given the name, address and telephone number of the member of the Commission staff with whom he should communicate to make further arrangements for access.

          (3) Providing such other proof of identity as the Commission deems satisfactory in the circumstances of a particular request.
          (b) If the Executive Director or other designated Commission official determines that the data in a requested record is so sensitive that unauthorized access could cause harm or embarrassment to the person whose record is involved, or if the person making the request is unable to produce satisfactory evidence of identity under paragraph (a) of this section, the individual making the request may be required to submit a notarized statement attesting to his identity and that he is familiar with and understands the criminal penalties provided under section 1001 of title 18 of the U.S. Code for making false statements to a Government agency and under the Privacy Act, section 552a(i)(3) of title 5 of the U.S. Code, for obtaining records under false pretenses. Copies of these statutory provisions and forms for such notarized statements may be attained upon request from the FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts compliance staff, Office of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581.

          (d) Nothing in this section shall preclude the Commission from requiring additional identification before granting access to the records if there is reason to believe that the person making the request may not be the individual to whom the record pertains, or where the sensitivity of the data warrants it.
          
          (e) The requirements of this section shall not apply if the records involved would be available to any person pursuant to the Commission's rules under the Freedom of Information Act as set forth in part 145 of this chapter.

Upon his request persons of his own choosing may accompany him, but the individual shall first furnish a written statement authorizing discussion of that individual's record in the accompany persons' presence.
          (b) Access will generally be granted in the office of the Commission where the records are maintained during normal business hours, but for good cause shown the Commission may grant access at another office of the Commission or at different times for the convenience of the individual making the request.

          (7) The disclosure is made to another agency or to an instrumentality of any Governmental jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a civil or criminal law enforcement activity if the activity is authorized by law and if the head of the agency or instrumentality has made a written request to the Commission specifying the particular portion desired and the law enforcement activity for which the record is sought;

Registration information may be furnished to a department or agency of any state or political subdivision thereof upon reasonable request made by the department or agency or without request whenever the Commission or an employee designated by § 140.75 of this chapter determines that such information may be appropriate for use by the department or agency.
          (13) The disclosure is made, upon request, to a department or agency of any foreign government or any political subdivision thereof, acting within the scope of its jurisdiction, provided that, prior to disclosure, the Commission or an employee delegated authority by § 140.73 of this chapter to disclose information pursuant to section 8(e) of the Act is satisfied that the information will not be disclosed by such department or agency except in connection with an adjudicatory action or proceeding brought under the laws of such foreign government or political subdivision to which such foreign government or political subdivision or any department or agency thereof is a party.
          (b) The Commission will make reasonable efforts to serve notice on an individual when any record on such individual is made available to any person under compulsory legal process when such process becomes a matter of public record.

          (b) The Commission will maintain no record describing how any individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment unless expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained or unless pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity.
          (c) The Commission will collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs.
          (d) The Commission will maintain all records which are used by the Commission in making any determination about any individual with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination.
        
        
          § 146.8
          Amendment of a record.
          (a) Any individual may request amendment of information pertaining to him which is contained in a system of records maintained by the Commission and which is filed under his name or other individual identifier if he believes the information is not accurate, relevant, timely or complete. A request for amendment shall be directed to the FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts compliance staff, Office of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581.

          (b) A request for amendment may be made by mail or in person and shall: (1) Be in writing and signed by the person making the request; (2) describe the particular record to be amended with sufficient specificity to permit the record to be located among those maintained by the Commission; and (3) specify the nature of the amendment sought and the justification for the requested change. The person making the request may be required to provide the information specified in §§ 146.3 and 146.4 of these rules in order to simplify identification of the record and permit verification of the identity of the person making the request for amendment.
          (c) Receipt of a request for amendment will be acknowledged in writing within ten days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) except that, if the individual is given notice within the ten day period that his request will or will not be complied with, no acknowledgement is required.
          (d) Assistance in preparing a request to amend a record may be obtained from the FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts compliance staff, Office of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581.
          (e) Upon receipt of a request for amendment the Executive Director of the Commission or a person designated by the Executive Director shall promptly determine whether the record is materially inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, or is irrelevant or not timely, as claimed by the individual, and, if so, shall cause the record to be amended in accordance with the individual's request.
          (f) If the Executive Director or designee grants the request to amend the record, the individual shall promptly be advised of the decision and of the action taken, and notice shall be given of the correction and its substance to each person or agency to whom the record had previously been disclosed, as shown on the record of disclosures maintained in accordance with § 146.6(c).
          (g) If the Executive Director or designee disagrees in whole or in part with a request for amendment of a record, the individual shall promptly be notified of the complete or partial denial of his request and the reasons for the refusal. The individual shall also be notified of the procedures for administrative review by the Commission of any complete or partial denial of a request for amendment, which are set forth in § 146.9.
          (h) If a request is received for amendment of a record prepared by another agency which is in the possession or control of the Commission, the request for amendment will be forwarded to that agency. If that agency determines that the correction should be made, the Commission will amend its records accordingly and notify the individual making the request for amendment of the change. If the other agency declines to make the amendment, the Executive Director or designee will independently determine whether the amendment will be made to the record in the Commission's possession or control, considering any explanation given by the other agency for its decision.

          § 146.12
          Exemptions.
          (a) Investigatory materials compiled for law enforcement purposes are exempt from portions of the Privacy Act of 1974 and of these rules as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, on the basis and to the extent that individual access to these files could impair the effectiveness and orderly conduct of the Commission's regulatory and enforcement program. Materials exempted under this paragraph are contained in the system of records entitled “Exempted Investigatory Records” and/or in the system of records entitled “Exempted Closed Commission Meetings.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, no record which has served as a basis for denying an individual a right, privilege, or benefit to which he would otherwise be eligible, shall be maintained in this system, unless the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to the effective date of this section, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence. For records of this type, if practicable, material identifying the confidential source shall be extracted or summarized in a manner which protects the source and the summary or extract shall be maintained in a comparable nonexempted system of records.
          (b) Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for employment with the Commission are exempt from portions of the Privacy Act of 1974 and of these rules as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, to the extent that it identifies a confidential source. This is done in order to encourage persons from whom information is sought to provide information to the Commission which, absent assurances of confidentiality, they would be unwilling to give. However, if practicable, material identifying a confidential source shall be extracted or summarized in a manner which protects the source and the summary or extract shall be maintained in a non-exempt system containing the same category of record. Materials exempted under this paragraph are included in the system of records entitled “Exempted Employee Background Investigation Material” and/or in the system of records entitled “Exempted Closed Commission Meetings.”
          (c) The systems set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are hereby exempted from the provisions of sections 552a(c), (3)(d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (e)(4)(I) and (f) of title 5 of the U.S. Code (the Privacy Act of 1974), and are also exempted from the following sections of these rules: § 146.3 (requests for information and for access); § 146.5 (access to records); § 146.6(d) (accounting of disclosures to be made available to the individual); § 146.11(a) (7), (8), (9) (content of the system notice); and § 146.7(a) (relevancy of records).

Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, every portion of every meeting of the Commission shall be open to public observation.
          (b) Except where the Commission finds that the public interest requires otherwise, meetings or portions of meetings shall not be open to public observation, and the requirements of §§ 147.4, 147.5 and 147.6 shall not apply to any information pertaining to such meetings or portions of meetings otherwise required by the rules of this part to be publicly disclosed, where the Commission determines that such meetings or portions of meetings or the disclosure of such information is likely to:

          (c) A single vote of Commissioners may be taken with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, when each meeting in such series involves the same particular matters and is scheduled to be held no more than thirty days after the initial meeting in such series.
          (d) Whenever any person whose interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting requests in writing to the Commission that the Commission close such portion to the public for any of the reasons set forth in § 147.3(b) (5), (6) or (7), the Commission, upon the request of any Commissioner, shall vote by recorded vote whether to close that portion of the meeting.
          (e) Whenever any Commission employee whose appointment, employment or dismissal is to be the subject of a meeting or portion of meeting closed to the public pursuant to § 147.3(b) requests in writing to the Commission that the Commission open that meeting or portion of meeting, the Commission shall open that meeting or portion of meeting to the public.
          (f) Within one day of any vote taken pursuant to paragraphs (b), (c) or (d) of this section, the Commission shall make publicly available a written copy of that vote reflecting the vote of each Commissioner on the question.

          Subpart A—General Provisions
          
            § 148.1
            Purpose of these rules.
            The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called “the Act” in this part), provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are prevailing private parties in adjudicatory proceedings before the Commission. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over the Commission, unless the Commission's position was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this part describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the Commission will use to make them.

            § 148.2
            When the Act applies.
            The Act applies to any covered adjudicatory proceeding pending before the Commission on or after October 1, 1981. This includes proceedings begun before October 1, 1981, if final Commission action has not been taken before that date. Awards may be sought for fees and other expenses incurred before October 1, 1981, in any such covered proceeding.
            [51 FR 18880, May 23, 1986]
          
          
            § 148.3
            Proceedings covered.

            (a) The Act applies to adjudicatory proceedings conducted by the Commission. These are adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of the Commission or any other agency of the United States, or any component of an agency, is presented by an attorney or other representative who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding. Reparation proceedings under section 14 of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 18, Commission review of exchange disciplinary and access denial actions under section 8c of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 12c, and registered futures association disciplinary and membership denial actions under section 17 of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 21, are not covered by the Act. Proceedings brought to determine whether or not to grant or renew registrations pursuant to sections 8a or 17(o), of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 8, 12a and 21(o), or contract market designations pursuant to section 6(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 8 (a), are excluded, but proceedings brought to suspend or revoke registrations or contract market designations are covered if they are otherwise adjudicatory proceedings. For the Commission, the types of proceedings generally covered are adjudicatory proceedings as defined in § 10.2(b) of this chapter; part 14 proceedings, if they involve a hearing, are also covered.
            (b) The Commission's decision not to identify a type of proceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing of an application by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the Act; whether the proceeding is covered will then be an issue for resolution in the proceedings on the application.
            (c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include only fees and expenses related to covered issues.
            [46 FR 57671, Nov. 25, 1981, as amended at 51 FR 18880, May 23, 1986; 59 FR 5528, Feb. 7, 1994]
          
          
            
            § 148.4
            Eligibility of applicants.
            (a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses under the Act, the applicant must be a party to the adjudicatory proceeding for which it seeks an award. The term “party” is defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3). The applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart and in subpart B.
            (b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:
            (1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;
            (2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business interests, and not more that 500 employees;
            (3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 employees;
            (4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 employees; and
            (5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or public or private organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million and not more than 500 employees.
            (c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the adjudicatory proceeding was initiated.
            (d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered as an “individual” rather than a “sole owner of an unincorporated business” if the issues on which the applicant prevails are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business interests.

            (e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly perform services for compensation for the applicant, under the applicant's direction and control. The term “employee” also embraces all the agents of an applicant, by whatever title or label they may be known, for whose acts or omissions the applicant may be held liable under the Commodity Exchange Act. See 7 U.S.C. 4. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis.
            (f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this part, unless the Presiding Officer determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the Presiding Officer may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.
            (g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding on behalf of one or more other persons or entitles that would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.

            § 148.5
            Standards for awards.
            (a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and expenses incurred in connection with an adjudicatory proceeding, or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position of the Commission was substantially justified. The position of the Commission includes, in addition to the position taken by the Commission in the adversary adjudication, the action or failure to act by the Commission upon which the adversary adjudication is based. The burden of proof that an award should not be made to an eligible prevailing applicant is on the Commission.

            (b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly or unreasonably protracted the adjudicatory proceeding or if special circumstances make the award sought unjust.
            [46 FR 57671, Nov. 25, 1981, as amended at 51 FR 18880, May 23, 1986]
          
          
            § 148.6
            Allowable fees and expenses.
            (a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents and expert witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at a reduced rate to the applicant.
            (b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules may exceed $75 per hour. No award to compensate an expert witness may exceed the maximum daily rate prescribed for GS-18 under section 5332 of title 5 of the U.S. Code. However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.
            (c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent or expert witness, the Presiding Officer shall consider the following:
            (1) If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or her customary fee for similar services, or, if an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;
            (2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily performs services;
            (3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;
            (4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the adjudicatory proceeding; and
            (5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services provided.
            (d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, test, project or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.
          
          
            § 148.7
            Rulemaking on maximum rates for attorney fees.
            (a) If warranted by an increase in the cost of living or by special circumstances (such as limited availability of attorneys qualified to handle certain types of proceedings), the Commission may adopt regulations providing that attorney fees may be awarded at a rate higher than $75 per hour in some or all of the types of proceedings covered by this part. The Commission will conduct any rulemaking proceedings for this purpose under the informal rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553.
            (b) Any person may file with the Commission a petition for rulemaking to increase the maximum rate for attorney fees, in accordance with § 13.2 of this chapter.
          
          
            § 148.8
            Awards against other agencies.
            If an applicant is entitled to an award because it prevails over another agency of the United States that participates in an adjudicatory proceeding before the Commission and takes a postion that is not substantially justified, the award or an appropriate portion of the award shall be made against that agency.

            § 148.11
            Contents of application.
            (a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under the Act shall identify the applicant and the adjudicatory proceeding for which an award is sought. The application shall show that the applicant has prevailed and identify the position of the Commission or other agency that the applicant alleges was not substantially justified. Unless the applicant is an individual, the application shall also state the number of employees of the applicant and describe briefly the type and purpose of its organization or business.

            (b) The application shall also include a statement that the applicant's net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or $7 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). However, an applicant may omit this statement if:
            (1) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) or, in the case of a tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under such section; or
            (2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)).
            (c) The application shall state the amount of fees and expenses for which an award is sought.
            (d) The application may also include any other matters that the applicant wishes the Commission to consider in determining whether and in what amount an award should be made.
            (e) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an authorized officer or attorney of the applicant. It shall also contain or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the application is true and correct.

            § 148.12
            Net worth exhibit.
            (a) Each applicant except a qualified tax-exempt organization or cooperative association must provide with its application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as defined in § 148.4(f) of this part) when the adjudicatory proceeding was initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this part. The Presiding Officer may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.
            (b) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public record of the adjudicatory proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit that portion of the exhibit directly to the Presiding Officer in a sealed envelope labeled “Confidential Financial Information,” accompanied by a motion to withhold the information from public disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of the specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9), why public disclosure of the information would adversely affect the applicant, and why disclosure is not required in the public interest. The material in question shall be served on counsel representing the Commission or other agency against which the applicant seeks an award, but need not be served on any other party to the adjudicatory proceeding. If the Presiding Officer finds that the information should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in the public record of the adjudicatory proceeding. Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the exhibit shall be disposed of in accordance with the Commission's established procedures under the Freedom of Information Act as provided in part 145 of this chapter. For that purpose, the applicant shall file a copy of its motion with the Commission's Freedom of Information Act Compliance Staff in the Office of the Secretariat, Washington, DC.
          
          
            § 148.13
            Documentation of fees and expenses.

            The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of the fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, test, project or similar matter, for which an award is sought. A separate itemized statement shall be submitted for each professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the application, showing the hours spent in connection with the proceeding by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, the rate at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for the services provided. The Presiding Officer may require the applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any expenses claimed.
          
          
            § 148.14
            When an application may be filed.
            (a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed in the adjudicatory proceeding or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, subject to the separate hearing procedure pursuant to § 10.63(b) of this chapter, but in no case later than 30 days after the Commission's final disposition of the adjudicatory proceeding.
            (b) If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision as to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the underlying controversy.
            (c) For purposes of this rule, final disposition means the later of
            (1) The date on which an initial decision by the Presiding Officer becomes final pursuant to § 10.84 of this chapter;
            (2) Issuance of an order disposing of any petitions for reconsideration of the Commission's final order in the proceeding pursuant to § 10.106 of the Rules of Practice;
            (3) If no petition for reconsideration is filed, the last date on which such a petition could have been filed pursuant to § 10.106 of the Rules of Practice; or
            (4) Issuance of a final Commission order or any other final resolution of a proceeding, such as a settlement or voluntary dismissal, which is not subject to a petition for reconsideration.

            Any application for an award or other pleading or document related to an application shall be filed and served on all parties to the adjudicatory proceeding, except as provided in § 148.12(b) for confidential financial information.
          
          
            § 148.22
            Answer to application.
            (a) Within 30 days after service of an application, counsel representing the Commission or other agency against which an award is sought may file an answer to the application. Unless counsel for the Commission or for another relevant agency requests an extension of time for filing or files a statement of intent to negotiate under paragraph (b) of this section, failure to file an answer within the 30-day period may be treated as a consent to the award requested.
            (b) If counsel for the Commission or for another relevant agency and the applicant believe that the issues in the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, and further extensions may be granted by the Presiding Officer upon request by counsel for the Commission or for another relevant agency and the applicant.
            (c) Any answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award requested and identify the facts relied on in support of the position of counsel for the Commission or for another relevant agency. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the adjudicatory proceeding, counsel for the Commission or for another relevant agency shall include with the answer either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under § 148.26 of this part.
          
          
            § 148.23
            Reply.
            Within 15 days after service of an answer, the applicant may file a reply. If the reply is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the adjudicatory proceeding, the applicant shall include with the reply either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under § 148.26 of this part.
          
          
            § 148.24
            Comments by other parties.

            Any party to an adjudicatory proceeding other than the applicant and counsel for the Commission or for another relevant agency may file comments on an application within 30 days after it is served or on an answer within 15 days after it is served. A commenting party may not participate further in proceedings on the application unless the Presiding Officer determines that the public interest requires such participation in order to permit full exploration of matters raised in the comments.
          
          
            § 148.25
            Settlement.
            The applicant may propose settlement of the award to the Commission before final action on the application, either in connection with a settlement of the adjudicatory proceeding, or after the adjudicatory proceeding has been concluded, in either case in accordance with § 10.108 of this chapter. If a prevailing party offers a proposed settlement of an award before an application has been filed, the application shall be filed with the proposed settlement.
          
          
            § 148.26
            Further proceedings.
            (a) Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the basis of the written record. However, on request of either the applicant or counsel for the Commission or for another relevant agency, or on his or her own initiative, the Presiding Officer may order further proceedings, such as an informal conference, oral argument, additional written submissions or an evidentiary hearing. Such further proceedings shall be held only when necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the application, and shall be conducted as promptly as possible. Whether or not the position of the Commission was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the administrative record, as a whole, which is made in the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses are sought. No discovery and/or evidentiary proceedings shall be permitted into the question of whether the agency's position was substantially justified.
            (b) A request that the Presiding Officer order further proceedings under this section shall specifically identify the information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.

            § 148.27
            Decision.
            The Presiding Officer shall issue an initial decision on the application in accordance with the provisions of § 10.84 of this chapter. The decision shall include written findings and conclusions on the applicant's eligibility and status as a prevailing party, and an explanation of the reasons for any difference between the amount requested and the amount awarded. The decision shall also include, if at issue, findings on whether the Commission's position was substantially justified, whether the applicant unduly or unreasonably protracted the adjudicatory proceedings, or whether special circumstances make an award unjust. If the applicant has sought an award against more than one agency, the decision shall allocate responsibility for payment of any award made among the agencies, and shall explain the reasons for the allocation made.
          
          
            § 148.28
            Appeal to the Commission.
            (a) Either the applicant or counsel for the Commission or for another relevant agency may appeal the initial decision on the fee application by complying with the requirements of this section. An appealing party shall serve upon opposing parties and shall file with the Proceedings Clerk a notice of appeal within fifteen (15) days after service of the initial decision. The notice need consist only of a brief statement indicating the filing party's intent to appeal the initial decision, and shall include the date upon which the initial decision was rendered, the name of the proceeding, and the docket number of the proceeding. The failure of a party timely to file and serve a notice of appeal in accordance with this paragraph, or to perfect the appeal in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, shall constitute a voluntary waiver of any objection to the initial decision, and of all further administrative or judicial review under these rules and the Equal Access to Justice Act.

            (b) An appeal shall be perfected by the appealing party by timely filing with the Proceedings Clerk an appeal brief which meets the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section. An original and one copy of the appeal brief shall be filed within thirty (30) days after filing of the notice of appeal. By motion of the appealing party, the Commission may, for good cause shown, extend the time for filing the appeal brief. If the appeal brief is not filed within the time prescribed in this subparagraph, the Commission may, upon its own motion or upon motion by a party, dismiss the appeal, in which event the initial decision shall become the final decision and order of the Commission, effective upon service of the order of dismissal.
            (c) The opposing party may, within thirty (30) days after service of the appeal brief, file an original and one copy of an answering brief, and serve one copy thereof, unless the time limit is extended by the Commission upon motion of the party and for good cause shown.
            (d) Parties filing an appeal brief or answering brief shall meet the requirements of § 10.12 of this chapter as to form. The content of briefs shall satisfy the requirements of § 10.102(d) of this chapter, except that any party, with leave of the Commission, may file an informal document in lieu of a brief. No brief shall exceed thirty-five (35) pages in length without advance leave of the Commission.

            (e) On review, the Commission may, in its discretion, consider sua sponte any issues arising from the record and may base its determination thereon, or limit the issues to those presented in the statement of issues in the briefs, treating those issues not raised as waived.

            § 148.30
            Payment of award.
            An applicant seeking payment of an award from the Commission shall submit to the Executive Director of the Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581, a copy of the Commission's final decision granting the award, accompanied by a statement that the applicant will not seek review of the decision in the United States courts. At the same time, the applicant shall provide a copy of his submissions to counsel for the Commission. The Commission will, within 60 days of receipt of the applicant's submissions, forward to the United States Department of the Treasury a Standard Form 1166, “Voucher and Schedule of Payments,” so as to have the Treasury Department issue a check in the amount awarded in the Commission's decision, unless judicial review of the award or of the underlying decision in the adjudicatory proceeding has been sought by the applicant or any other party to the adjudicatory proceeding.

          General prohibitions against discrimination.
          (a) No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.
          (b)(1) The agency, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, on the basis of handicap—
          (i) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;
          (ii) Afford a qualified handicapped person an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others;
          (iii) Provide a qualified handicapped person with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;
          (iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to handicapped persons or to any class of handicapped persons than is provided to others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified handicapped persons with aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others;
          (v) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate as a member of planning or advisory boards; or
          (vi) Otherwise limit a qualified handicapped person in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving the aid, benefit, or service.

          (2) The agency may not deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate in programs or activities that are not separate or different, despite the existence of permissibly separate or different programs or activities.
          (3) The agency may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangments, utilize criteria or methods of administration the purpose or effect of which would—
          (i) Subject qualified handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap; or

          Employment.
          No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of handicap, be subjected to discrimination in employment under any program or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or activities.

          § 149.149
          Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.
          Except as otherwise provided in § 149.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.
        
        
          § 149.150
          Program accessibility: Existing facilities.
          (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—
          (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;
          (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or

          (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 149.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
          (b) Methods—(1) General. The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.
          (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of § 149.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 149.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—
          (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;
          (ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or
          (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
          (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.
          (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—
          (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;

          § 149.151
          Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.
          Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.

          § 149.160
          Communications.
          (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.
          (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.
          (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.
          (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.
          (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
          (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.
          (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.
          (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 149.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

          (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.

For the purpose of determining the positions in accounts for which any person controls trading or holds a 10 percent or greater ownership or equity interest, positions or ownership or equity interests held by, and trading done or controlled by, two or more persons acting pursuant to an expressed or implied agreement or understanding shall be treated the same as if the positions or ownership or equity interests were held by, or the trading were done or controlled by, a single person.
          (2) Substantially identical trading.

For the purpose of applying the position limits set forth in § 150.2, and notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, but subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the aggregation requirements of this section shall not apply in the circumstances set forth in this paragraph (b).
          (1) Exemption for ownership by limited partners, shareholders or other pool participants. Any person that is a limited partner, limited member, shareholder or other similar type of pool participant holding positions in which the person by power of attorney or otherwise directly or indirectly has a 10 percent or greater ownership or equity interest in a pooled account or positions need not aggregate the accounts or positions of the pool with any other accounts or positions such person is required to aggregate, except that such person must aggregate the pooled account or positions with all other accounts or positions owned or controlled by such person if such person:
          (i) Is the commodity pool operator of the pooled account;
          (ii) Is a principal or affiliate of the operator of the pooled account, unless:

          (B) The person does not have direct, day-to-day supervisory authority or control over the pool's trading decisions;
          (C) The person, if a principal of the operator of the pooled account, maintains only such minimum control over the commodity pool operator as is consistent with its responsibilities as a principal and necessary to fulfill its duty to supervise the trading activities of the commodity pool; and
          (D) The pool operator has complied with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section on behalf of the person or class of persons; or
          (iii) Has, by power of attorney or otherwise directly or indirectly, a 25 percent or greater ownership or equity interest in a commodity pool, the operator of which is exempt from registration under § 4.13 of this chapter.

          (i) Such person, including any entity that such person must aggregate, and the owned entity (to the extent that such person is aware or should be aware of the activities and practices of the aggregated entity or the owned entity):
          (A) Do not have knowledge of the trading decisions of the other;
          (B) Trade pursuant to separately developed and independent trading systems;
          (C) Have and enforce written procedures to preclude each from having knowledge of, gaining access to, or receiving data about, trades of the other.

          (D) Do not share employees that control the trading decisions of either; and
          (E) Do not have risk management systems that permit the sharing of its trades or its trading strategy with employees that control the trading decisions of the other; and

          (3) Exemption for accounts held by futures commission merchants. A futures commission merchant or any affiliate of a futures commission merchant need not aggregate positions it holds in a discretionary account, or in an account which is part of, or participates in, or receives trading advice from a customer trading program of a futures commission merchant or any of the officers, partners, or employees of such futures commission merchant or of its affiliates, if:
          (i) A person other than the futures commission merchant or the affiliate directs trading in such an account;
          (ii) The futures commission merchant or the affiliate maintains only such minimum control over the trading in such an account as is necessary to fulfill its duty to supervise diligently trading in the account;

          (iv) The futures commission merchant or the affiliate has complied with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
          (4) Exemption for accounts carried by an independent account controller. An eligible entity need not aggregate its positions with the eligible entity's client positions or accounts carried by an authorized independent account controller, as defined in § 150.1(e), except for the spot month in physical-delivery commodity contracts, provided that the eligible entity has complied with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, and that the overall positions held or controlled by such independent account controller may not exceed the limits specified in § 150.2.
          (i) Additional requirements for exemption of affiliated entities. If the independent account controller is affiliated with the eligible entity or another independent account controller, each of the affiliated entities must:

          (A) Have, and enforce, written procedures to preclude the affiliated entities from having knowledge of, gaining access to, or receiving data about, trades of the other. Such procedures must include security arrangements, including separate physical locations, which would maintain the independence of their activities; provided, however, that such procedures may provide for the disclosure of information which is reasonably necessary for an eligible entity to maintain the level of control consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities to the managed positions and accounts and necessary to fulfill its duty to supervise diligently the trading done on its behalf;
          (B) Trade such accounts pursuant to separately developed and independent trading systems;
          (C) Market such trading systems separately; and
          (D) Solicit funds for such trading by separate disclosure documents that meet the standards of § 4.24 or § 4.34 of this chapter, as applicable, where such disclosure documents are required under part 4 of this chapter.
          (ii) [Reserved]
          (5) Exemption for underwriting. A person need not aggregate the positions or accounts of an owned entity if the ownership or equity interest is based on the ownership of securities constituting the whole or a part of an unsold allotment to or subscription by such person as a participant in the distribution of such securities by the issuer or by or through an underwriter.
          (6) Exemption for broker-dealer activity. A broker-dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or similarly registered with a foreign regulatory authority, need not aggregate the positions or accounts of an owned entity if the ownership or equity interest is based on the ownership of securities acquired in the normal course of business as a dealer, provided that such person does not have actual knowledge of the trading decisions of the owned entity.
          (7) Exemption for information sharing restriction. A person need not aggregate the positions or accounts of an owned entity if the sharing of information associated with such aggregation (such as, only by way of example, information reflecting the transactions and positions of a such person and the owned entity) creates a reasonable risk that either person could violate state or federal law or the law of a foreign jurisdiction, or regulations adopted thereunder, provided that such person does not have actual knowledge of information associated with such aggregation, and provided further that such person has filed a prior notice pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section and included with such notice a written memorandum of law explaining in detail the basis for the conclusion that the sharing of information creates a reasonable risk that either person could violate state or federal law or the law of a foreign jurisdiction, or regulations adopted thereunder. However, the exemption in this paragraph shall not apply where the law or regulation serves as a means to evade the aggregation of accounts or positions. All documents submitted pursuant to this paragraph shall be in English, or if not, accompanied by an official English translation.
          (8) Exemption for affiliated entities. After a person has filed a notice under paragraph (c) of this section, another person need not file a separate notice identifying any position or account identified in such notice filing, provided that:
          (i) Such other person has an ownership or equity interest of 10 percent or greater in the person that filed the notice, or the person that filed the notice has an ownership or equity interest of 10 percent or greater in such other person, or an ownership or equity interest of 10 percent or greater is held in such other person by a third person who holds an ownership or equity interest of 10 percent or greater in the person that has filed the notice (in any such case, the ownership or equity interest may be held directly or indirectly);
          (ii) Such other person complies with the conditions applicable to the exemption specified in such notice filing, other than the filing requirements; and
          (iii) Such other person does not otherwise control trading of any account or position identified in such notice filing.
          (iv) Upon call by the Commission, any person relying on the exemption in this paragraph (b)(8) shall provide to the Commission such information concerning the person's claim for exemption. Upon notice and opportunity for the affected person to respond, the Commission may amend, suspend, terminate, or otherwise modify a person's aggregation exemption for failure to comply with the provisions of this section.
          (c) Notice filing for exemption. (1) Persons seeking an aggregation exemption under paragraph (b)(1)(ii), (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), or (b)(7) of this section shall file a notice with the Commission, which shall be effective upon submission of the notice (or earlier, as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section), and shall include:
          (i) A description of the relevant circumstances that warrant disaggregation; and
          (ii) A statement of a senior officer of the entity certifying that the conditions set forth in the applicable aggregation exemption provision have been met.
          (2) If a person newly acquires an ownership or equity interest in an owned entity of 10 percent or greater and is eligible for the aggregation exemption under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the person may elect that a notice filed under this paragraph (c) shall be effective as of the date of such acquisition if such notice is filed no later than 60 days after such acquisition.
          (3) Upon call by the Commission, any person claiming an aggregation exemption under this section shall provide such information demonstrating that the person meets the requirements of the exemption, as is requested by the Commission. Upon notice and opportunity for the affected person to respond, the Commission may amend, suspend, terminate, or otherwise modify a person's aggregation exemption for failure to comply with the provisions of this section.
          (4) In the event of a material change to the information provided in any notice filed under this paragraph (c), an updated or amended notice shall promptly be filed detailing the material change.
          (5) Any notice filed under this paragraph (c) shall be submitted in the form and manner provided for in paragraph (d) of this section.

          (6) If a person is eligible for an aggregation exemption under paragraph (b)(1)(ii), (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), or (b)(7) of this section, a failure to timely file a notice under this paragraph (c) shall not constitute a violation of paragraph (a)(1) of this section or any position limit set forth in § 150.2 if such notice is filed no later than five business days after the person is aware, or should be aware, that such notice has not been timely filed.
          (d) Form and manner of reporting and submitting information or filings. Unless otherwise instructed by the Commission or its designees, any person submitting reports under this section shall submit the corresponding required filings and any other information required under this part to the Commission using the format, coding structure, and electronic data transmission procedures approved in writing by the Commission. Unless otherwise provided in this section, the notice shall be effective upon filing. When the reporting entity discovers errors or omissions to past reports, the entity shall so notify the Commission and file corrected information in a form and manner and at a time as may be instructed by the Commission or its designee.
          (e) Delegation of authority. (1) The Commission hereby delegates, until it orders otherwise, to the Director of the Division of Enforcement, or such other employee or employees as the Director may designate from time to time, the authority:
          (i) In paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this section to call for additional information from a person claiming the exemption in paragraph (b)(8) of this section.
          (ii) In paragraph (c)(3) of this section to call for additional information from a person claiming an aggregation exemption under this section.
          (2) The Commission hereby delegates, until it orders otherwise, to the Director of the Office of Data and Technology, with the concurrence of the Director of the Division of Enforcement, or such other employee or employees as the Directors each may designate from time to time, the authority in paragraph (d) of this section to provide instructions or determine the format, coding structure, and electronic data transmission procedures for submitting data records and any other information required under this part.
          (3) The Directors of the Division of Enforcement and the Office of Data and Technology may submit to the Commission for its consideration any matter which has been delegated in this section.
          (4) Nothing in this section prohibits the Commission, at its election, from exercising the authority delegated in this section.

          § 150.5
          Exchange-set speculative position limits.
          (a) Exchange limits. Each contract market as a condition of designation under part 5, appendix A, of this chapter shall be bylaw, rule, regulation, or resolution limit the maximum number of contracts a person may hold or control, separately or in combination, net long or net short, for the purchase or sale of a commodity for future delivery or, on a futures-equivalent basis, options thereon. This section shall not apply to a contract market for which position limits are set forth in § 150.2 of this part or for a futures or option contract market on a major foreign currency, for which there is no legal impediment to delivery and for which there exists a highly liquid cash market. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a contract market from fixing different and separate position limits for different types of futures contracts based on the same commodity, or from fixing different position limits for different futures or for different delivery months, or from exempting positions which are normally known in the trade as “spreads, straddles, or arbitrage,” of from fixing limits which apply to such positions which are different from limits fixed for other positions.
          (b) Levels at designation. At the time of its initial designation, a contract market must provide for speculative position limit levels as follows:

          (1) For physical delivery contracts, the spot month limit level must be no greater than one-quarter of the estimated spot month deliverable supply, calculated separately for each month to be listed, and for cash settled contracts, the spot month limit level must be no greater than necessary to minimize the potential for manipulation or distortion of the contract's or the underlying commodity's price;
          
          (2) Individual nonspot or all-months-combined levels must be no greater than 1,000 contracts for tangible commodities other than energy products;
          (3) Individual nonspot or all-months-combined levels must be no greater than 5,000 contracts for energy products and nontangible commodities, including contracts on financial products.
          (c) Adjustments to levels. Contract markets may adjust their speculative limit levels as follows:
          (1) For physical delivery contracts, the spot month limit level must be no greater than one-quarter of the estimated spot month deliverable supply, calculated separately for each month to be listed, and for cash settled contracts, the spot month limit level must be no greater than necessary to minimize the potential for manipulation or distortion of the contract's or the underlying commodity's price; and
          (2) Individual nonspot or all-months-combined levels must be no greater than 10% of the average combined futures and delta-adjusted option month-end open interest for the most recent calendar year up to 25,000 contracts with a marginal increase of 2.5% thereafter or be based on position sizes customarily held by speculative traders on the contract market, which shall not be extraordinarily large relative to total open positions in the contract, the breadth and liquidity of the cash market underlying each delivery month and the opportunity for arbitrage between the futures market and the cash market in the commodity underlying the futures contract.
          (d) Hedge exemption. (1) No exchange bylaw, rule, regulation, or resolution adopted pursuant to this section shall apply to bona fide hedging positions as defined by a contract market in accordance with the definition of bona fide hedging transactions and positions for excluded commodities in § 1.3 of this chapter. Provided, however, that the contract market may limit bona fide hedging positions or any other positions which have been exempted pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section which it determines are not in accord with sound commercial practices or exceed an amount which may be established and liquidated in orderly fashion.
          (2) Traders must apply to the contract market for exemption from its speculative position limit rules. In considering whether to grant such an application for exemption, contract markets must take into account the factors contained in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
          (e) Trader accountability exemption. Twelve months after a contract market's initial listing for trading or at any time thereafter, contract markets may submit for Commission approval under section 5a(a)(12) of the Act and § 1.41(b) of this chapter a bylaw, rule, regulation, or resolution, substituting for the position limits required under paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section an exchange rule requiring traders to be accountable for large positions as follows:
          (1) For futures and option contracts on a financial instrument or product having an average open interest of 50,000 contracts and an average daily trading volume of 100,000 contracts and a very highly liquid cash market, an exchange bylaw, regulation or resolution requiring traders to provide information about their position upon request by the exchange;
          (2) For futures and option contracts on a financial instrument or product or on an intangible commodity having an average moth-end open interest of 50,000 and an average daily volume of 25,000 contracts and a highly liquid cash market, an exchange bylaw, regulation or resolution requiring traders to provide information about their position upon request by the exchange and to consent to halt increasing further a trader's positions if so ordered by the exchange;

          (3) For futures and option contracts on a tangible commodity, including but not limited to metals, energy products, or international soft agricultural products, having an average month-end open interest of 50,000 contracts and an average daily volume of 5,000 contracts and a liquid cash market, an exchange bylaw, regulation or resolution requiring traders to provide information about their position upon request by the exchange and to consent to halt increasing further a trader's positions if so ordered by the exchange, provided, however, such contract markets are not exempt from the requirement of paragraphs (b) or (c) that they adopt an exchange bylaw, regulation or resolution setting a spot month speculative position limit with a level no grater than one quarter of the estimated spot month deliverable supply;
          (4) For purposes of this paragraph, trading volume and open interest shall be calculated by combining the month-end futures and its related option contract, on a delta-adjusted basis, for all months listed during the most recent calendar year.
          (f) Other exemptions. Exchange speculative position limits adopted pursuant to this section shall not apply to any position acquired in good faith prior to the effective date of any bylaw, rule, regulation, or resolution which specifies such limit or to a person that is registered as a futures commission merchant or as a floor broker under authority of the Act except to the extent that transactions made by such person are made on behalf of or for the account or benefit of such person. In addition to the express exemptions specified in this section, a contract market may propose such other exemptions from the requirements of this section consistent with the purposes of this section and shall submit such rules Commission review under section 5a(1)(12) of the Act and § 1.41(b) of this chapter.
          (g) Aggregation. In determining whether any person has exceeded the limits established under this section, all positions in accounts for which such person by power of attorney or otherwise directly or indirectly controls trading shall be included with the positions held by such person; such limits upon positions shall apply to positions held by two or more person acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding, the same as if the positions were held by a single person.

          § 150.6
          Responsibility of contract markets.
          Nothing in this part shall be construed to affect any provisions of the Act relating to manipulation or corners nor to relieve any contract market or its governing board from responsibility under section 5(4) of the Act to prevent manipulation and corners.

          § 151.4
          Position limits for Referenced Contracts.
          (a) Spot-month position limits. In accordance with the procedure in paragraph (d) of this section, and except as provided or as otherwise authorized by § 151.5, no trader may hold or control a position, separately or in combination, net long or net short, in Referenced Contracts in the same commodity when such position is in excess of:
          (1) For physical-delivery Referenced Contracts, a spot-month position limit that shall be based on one-quarter of the estimated spot-month deliverable supply as established by the Commission pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section; and
          (2) For cash-settled Referenced Contracts:

          (i) A spot-month position limit that shall be based on one-quarter of the estimated spot-month deliverable supply as established by the Commission pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section. Provided, however,
          
          (ii) For New York Mercantile Exchange Henry Hub Natural Gas Referenced Contracts:
          (A) A spot-month position limit equal to five times the spot-month position limit established by the Commission for the physical-delivery New York Mercantile Exchange Henry Hub Natural Gas Referenced Contract pursuant to paragraph (a)(1); and
          (B) An aggregate spot-month position limit for physical-delivery and cash-settled New York Mercantile Exchange Henry Hub Natural Gas Referenced Contracts equal to five times the spot-month position limit established by the Commission for the physical-delivery New York Mercantile Exchange Henry Hub Natural Gas Referenced Contract pursuant to paragraph (a)(1).
          (b) Non-spot-month position limits. In accordance with the procedure in paragraph (d) of this section, and except as otherwise authorized in § 151.5, no person may hold or control positions, separately or in combination, net long or net short, in the same commodity when such positions, in all months combined (including the spot month) or in a single month, are in excess of:
          (1) Non-legacy Referenced Contract position limits. All-months-combined aggregate and single-month position limits, fixed by the Commission based on 10 percent of the first 25,000 contracts of average all-months-combined aggregated open interest with a marginal increase of 2.5 percent thereafter as established by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section;
          (2) Aggregate open interest calculations for non-spot-month position limits for non-legacy Referenced Contracts. (i) For the purpose of fixing the speculative position limits for non-legacy Referenced Contracts in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Commission shall determine:
          (A) The average all-months-combined aggregate open interest, which shall be equal to the sum, for 12 or 24 months of values obtained under paragraph (B) and (C) of this section for a period of 12 or 24 months prior to the fixing date divided by 12 or 24 respectively as of the last day of each calendar month;
          (B) The all-months-combined futures open interest of a Referenced Contract is equal to the sum of the month-end open interest for all of the Referenced Contract's open contract months in futures and option contracts (on a delta adjusted basis) across all designated contract markets; and
          (C) The all-months-combined swaps open interest is equal to the sum of all of a Referenced Contract's month-end open swaps positions, considering open positions attributed to both cleared and uncleared swaps, where the uncleared all-months-combined swaps open positions shall be the absolute sum of swap dealers' net uncleared open swaps positions by counterparty and by single Referenced Contract month as reported to the Commission pursuant to part 20 of this chapter, provided that, other than for the purpose of determining initial non-spot-month position limits, open swaps positions attributed to swaps with two swap dealer counterparties shall be counted once for the purpose of determining uncleared all-months-combined swaps open positions, provided further that, upon entry of an order under § 20.9 of this chapter determining that operating swap data repositories are processing positional data that will enable the Commission effectively to conduct surveillance in swaps, the Commission shall rely on data from such swap data repositories to compute the all-months-combined swaps open interest;

          (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, for the purpose of determining initial non-spot-month position limits for non-legacy Referenced Contracts, the Commission may estimate uncleared all-months-combined swaps open positions based on uncleared open swaps positions reported to the Commission pursuant to part 20 of this chapter by clearing organizations or clearing members that are swap dealers; and
          (3) Legacy agricultural Referenced Contract position limits. All-months-combined aggregate and single-month position limits, fixed by the Commission at the levels provided below as established by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section:

          (c) Netting of positions—(1) For Referenced Contracts in the spot month. (i) For the spot-month position limit in paragraph (a) of this section, a trader's positions in the physical-delivery Referenced Contract and cash-settled Referenced Contract are calculated separately. A trader cannot net any physical-delivery Referenced Contract with cash-settled Referenced Contracts towards determining the trader's positions in each of the physical-delivery Referenced Contract and cash-settled Referenced Contracts in paragraph (a) of this section. However, a trader can net positions in cash-settled Referenced Contracts in the same commodity.
          (ii) Notwithstanding the netting provision in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, for the aggregate spot-month position limit in New York Mercantile Exchange Henry Hub Natural Gas Referenced Contracts in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, a trader's positions shall be combined and the net resulting position in the physical-delivery Referenced Contract and cash-settled Referenced Contracts shall be applied towards determining the trader's aggregate position.
          (2) For the purpose of applying non-spot-month position limits, a trader's position in a Referenced Contract shall be combined and the net resulting position shall be applied towards determining the trader's aggregate single-month and all-months-combined position.
          (d) Establishing and effective dates of position limits—(1) Initial spot-month position limits for Referenced Contracts. (i) Sixty days after the term “swap” is further defined under the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, the spot-month position limits for Referenced Contracts referred to in appendix A shall apply to all the provisions of this part.
          (2) Subsequent spot-month position limits for Referenced Contracts. (i) Commencing January 1st of the second calendar year after the term “swap” is further defined under the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, the Commission shall fix position limits by Commission order that shall supersede the initial limits established under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
          (ii) In fixing spot-month position limits for Referenced Contracts, the Commission shall utilize the estimates of deliverable supply provided by a designated contract market under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section unless the Commission determines to rely on its own estimate of deliverable supply.

          (iii) Each designated contract market shall submit to the Commission an estimate of deliverable supply for each Core Referenced Futures Contract that is subject to a spot-month position limit and listed or executed pursuant to the rules of the designated contract market according to the following schedule commencing January 1st of the second calendar year after the term “swap” is further defined under the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010:

          (v) The estimate submitted under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section shall be accompanied by a description of the methodology used to derive the estimate along with any statistical data supporting the designated contract market's estimate of deliverable supply.
          (vi) The Commission shall fix and publish pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, the spot-month limits by Commission order, no later than:
          (A) For metal Referenced Contracts listed in § 151.2(b), by the 28th of February following the submission of estimates of deliverable supply provided to the Commission under paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section and biennially thereafter;
          (B) For energy Referenced Contracts listed in § 151.2(c), by the 31st of May following the submission of estimates of deliverable supply provided to the Commission under paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section and biennially thereafter;

          (ii) Subsequent non-spot-month limits for non-legacy Referenced Contracts shall be fixed and published within one month after two years following the fixing and publication of initial non-spot-month position limits and shall be based on the higher of 12 months average all-months-combined aggregate open interest, or 24 months average all-months-combined aggregate open interest, as provided for in paragraphs (b)(2) and (e) of this section.
          (iii) Initial non-spot-month limits for non-legacy Referenced Contracts shall be made effective by Commission order.

          § 151.5
          Bona fide hedging and other exemptions for Referenced Contracts.
          (a) Bona fide hedging transactions or positions. (1) Any person that complies with the requirements of this section may exceed the position limits set forth in § 151.4 to the extent that a transaction or position in a Referenced Contract:

          (B) Meets the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.
          (v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no transactions or positions shall be classified as bona fide hedging for purposes of § 151.4 unless such transactions or positions are established and liquidated in an orderly manner in accordance with sound commercial practices and the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section regarding enumerated hedging transactions and positions or paragraphs (a)(3) or (4) of this section regarding pass-through swaps of this section have been satisfied.

          (ii) Purchases of Referenced Contracts that do not exceed in quantity:
          (A) The fixed-price sale of the contract's underlying cash commodity by the same person;
          (B) The quantity equivalent of fixed-price sales of the cash products and by-products of such commodity by the same person; and

          (iv) Purchases or sales by an agent who does not own or has not contracted to sell or purchase the offsetting cash commodity at a fixed price, provided that the agent is responsible for the merchandising of the cash positions that is being offset in Referenced Contracts and the agent has a contractual arrangement with the person who owns the commodity or holds the cash market commitment being offset.
          (v) Anticipated merchandising hedges. Offsetting sales and purchases in Referenced Contracts that do not exceed in quantity the amount of the same cash commodity that is anticipated to be merchandised, provided that:

          (B) The offsetting sales and purchases in Referenced Contracts are in different contract months, which settle in not more than one year; and
          (C) No such position is maintained in any physical-delivery Referenced Contract during the last five days of trading of the Core Referenced Futures Contract in an agricultural or metal commodity or during the spot month for other physical-delivery contracts.

Bona fide hedging transactions and positions for the purposes of this paragraph include the purchase or sales of Referenced Contracts that reduce the risks attendant to a position resulting from a swap that was executed opposite a counterparty for whom the swap transaction would qualify as a bona fide hedging transaction pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section (“pass-through swaps”), provided that no such position is maintained in any physical-delivery Referenced Contract during the last five days of trading of the Core Referenced Futures Contract in an agricultural or metal commodity or during the spot month for other physical-delivery contracts unless such pass-through swap position continues to offset the cash market commodity price risk of the bona fide hedging counterparty.
          (4) Pass-through swap offsets. For swaps executed opposite a counterparty for whom the swap transaction would qualify as a bona fide hedging transaction pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section (pass-through swaps), such pass-through swaps shall also be classified as a bona fide hedging transaction for the counterparty for whom the swap would not otherwise qualify as a bona fide hedging transaction pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section (“non-hedging counterparty”), provided that the non-hedging counterparty purchases or sells Referenced Contracts that reduce the risks attendant to such pass-through swaps. Provided further, that the pass-through swap shall constitute a bona fide hedging transaction only to the extent the non-hedging counterparty purchases or sells Referenced Contracts that reduce the risks attendant to the pass-through swap.
          (5) Any person engaging in other risk-reducing practices commonly used in the market which they believe may not be specifically enumerated in § 151.5(a)(2) may request relief from Commission staff under § 140.99 of this chapter or the Commission under section 4a(a)(7) of the Act concerning the applicability of the bona fide hedging transaction exemption.
          (b) Aggregation of accounts. Entities required to aggregate accounts or positions under § 151.7 shall be considered the same person for the purpose of determining whether a person or persons are eligible for a bona fide hedge exemption under § 151.5(a).

Any person who intends to exceed the position limits set forth in § 151.4 pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B), (a)(2)(ii)(C), (a)(2)(v), (a)(2)(vi), or (a)(2)(vii) of this section in order to hedge anticipated production, requirements, merchandising, royalties, or services connected to a commodity underlying a Referenced Contract, shall submit to the Commission a 404A filing in the form and manner provided in § 151.10. The 404A filing shall contain the following information with respect to such activities, by Referenced Contract:
          (i) A description of the type of anticipated cash market activity to be hedged; how the purchases or sales of Referenced Contracts are consistent with the provisions of (a)(1) of this section; and the units in which the cash commodity is measured;
          (ii) The time period for which the person claims the anticipatory hedge exemption is required, which may not exceed one year for agricultural commodities or one year for anticipated merchandising activity;
          (iii) The actual use, production, processing, merchandising (bought and sold), royalties and service payments and receipts of that cash market commodity during each of the three complete fiscal years preceding the current fiscal year;
          (iv) The anticipated use production, or commercial or merchandising requirements (purchases and sales), anticipated royalties, or service contract receipts or payments of that cash market commodity which are applicable to the anticipated activity to be hedged for the period specified in (d)(1)(ii) of this section;
          (v) The unsold anticipated production or unfilled anticipated commercial or merchandising requirements of that cash market commodity which are applicable to the anticipated activity to be hedged for the period specified in (d)(1)(ii) of this section;
          (vi) The maximum number of Referenced Contracts long and short (on an all-months-combined basis) that are expected to be used for each anticipatory hedging activity for the period specified in (d)(1)(ii) of this section on a futures equivalent basis;
          (vii) If the hedge exemption sought is for anticipated merchandising pursuant to (a)(2)(v) of this section, a description of the storage capacity related to the anticipated merchandising transactions, including:
          (A) The anticipated total storage capacity, the anticipated merchandising quantity, and purchase and sales commitments for the period specified in (d)(1)(ii) of this section;
          (B) Current inventory; and
          (C) The total storage capacity and quantity of commodity moved through the storage capacity for each of the three complete fiscal years preceding the current fiscal year; and
          (viii) Cross-commodity hedging information as required under paragraph (g) of this section.
          (2) Notice filing. Persons seeking an exemption under this paragraph shall file a notice with the Commission. Such a notice shall be filed at least ten days in advance of a date the person expects to exceed the position limits established under this part, and shall be effective after that ten day period unless otherwise notified by the Commission.
          (3) Supplemental reports for 404A filings. Whenever a person intends to exceed the amounts determined by the Commission to constitute a bona fide hedge for anticipated activity in the most recent statement or filing, such person shall file with the Commission a statement that updates the information provided in the person's most recent filing at least ten days in advance of the date that person wishes to exceed those amounts.
          (e) Review of notice filings. (1) The Commission may require persons submitting notice filings provided for under paragraphs (c)(2) and (d)(2) of this section to submit such other information, before or after the effective date of a notice, which is necessary to enable the Commission to make a determination whether the transactions or positions under the notice filing fall within the scope of bona fide hedging transactions or positions described under paragraph (a) of this section.
          (2) The transactions and positions described in the notice filing shall not be considered, in part or in whole, as bona fide hedging transactions or positions if such person is so notified by the Commission.
          (f) Additional information from swap counterparties to bona fide hedging transactions. All persons that maintain positions in excess of the limits set forth in § 151.4 in reliance upon the exemptions set forth in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section shall submit to the Commission a 404S filing, in the form and manner provided for in § 151.10. Such 404S filing shall contain the following information with respect to such position for each business day that the same person exceeds the limits set forth in § 151.4, up to and through the day the person's position first falls below the position limit that was exceeded:
          (1) By Referenced Contract;
          (2) By commodity reference price and units of measurement used for the swaps that would qualify as a bona fide hedging transaction or position gross long and gross short positions; and
          (3) Cross-commodity hedging information as required under paragraph (g) of this section.
          (g) Conversion methodology for cross-commodity hedges. In addition to the information required under this section, persons who avail themselves of cross-commodity hedges pursuant to (a)(2)(viii) of this section shall submit to the Commission a form 404, 404A, or 404S filing, as appropriate. The first time such a form is filed where a cross-commodity hedge is claimed, it should contain a description of the conversion methodology. That description should explain the conversion from the actual commodity used in the person's normal course of business to the Referenced Contract that is being used for hedging, including an explanation of the methodology used for determining the ratio of conversion between the actual or anticipated cash positions and the person's positions in the Referenced Contract.
          (h) Recordkeeping. Persons who avail themselves of bona fide hedge exemptions shall keep and maintain complete books and records concerning all of their related cash, futures, and swap positions and transactions and make such books and records, along with a list of pass-through swap counterparties for pass-through swap exemptions under (a)(3) of this section, available to the Commission upon request.
          (i) Additional requirements for pass-through swap counterparties. A party seeking to rely upon § 151.5(a)(3) to exceed the position limits of § 151.4 with respect to such a swap may only do so if its counterparty provides a written representation (e.g., in the form of a field or other representation contained in a mutually executed trade confirmation) that, as to such counterparty, the swap qualifies in good faith as a bona fide hedging transaction under paragraph (a)(3) of this section at the time the swap was executed. That written representation shall be retained by the parties to the swap for a period of at least two years following the expiration of the swap and furnished to the Commission upon request. Any person that represents to another person that the swap qualifies as a pass-through swap under paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall keep and make available to the Commission upon request all relevant books and records supporting such a representation for a period of at least two years following the expiration of the swap.
          (j) Financial distress exemption. Upon specific request made to the Commission, the Commission may exempt a person or related persons under financial distress circumstances for a time certain from any of the requirements of this part. Financial distress circumstances are situations involving the potential default or bankruptcy of a customer of the requesting person or persons, affiliate of the requesting person or persons, or potential acquisition target of the requesting person or persons. Such exemptions shall be granted by Commission order.

          (b) Statement of person exceeding visibility level. Persons meeting the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, shall submit to the Commission a 401 filing in the form and manner provided for in § 151.10. The 401 filing shall contain the following information, by Referenced Contract:
          (1) A list of dates, within the applicable calendar quarter, on which the person held or controlled a position that equaled or exceeded such visibility levels; and
          (2) As of the first business Tuesday following the applicable calendar quarter and as of the day, within the applicable calendar quarter, in which the person held the largest net position (on an all months combined basis) in excess of the level in paragraph (a) of this section:
          (i) Separately by futures, options and swaps, gross long and gross short futures equivalent positions in all months in the applicable Referenced Contract(s) (using economically reasonable and analytically supported deltas) on a futures-equivalent basis; and
          (ii) If applicable, by commodity referenced price, gross long and gross short uncleared swap positions in all months basis in the applicable Referenced Contract(s) futures-equivalent basis (using economically reasonable and analytically supported deltas).
          (c) 404 filing.

          (d) Alternative filing. With the express written permission of the Commission or its designees, the submission of a swaps or physical commodity portfolio summary statement spreadsheet in digital format, only insofar as the spreadsheet provides at least the same data as that required by paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section respectively may be substituted for the 401 or 404 filing respectively.
          (e) Precedence of other reporting obligations. Reporting obligations imposed by regulations other than those contained in this section shall supersede the reporting requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section but only insofar as other reporting obligations provide at least the same data and are submitted to the Commission or its designees at least as often as the reporting requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
          (f) Compliance date. The compliance date of this section shall be sixty days after the term “swap” is further defined under the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010. A document will be published in the Federal Register establishing the compliance date.
        
        
          § 151.7
          Aggregation of positions.
          (a) Positions to be aggregated. The position limits set forth in § 151.4 shall apply to all positions in accounts for which any person by power of attorney or otherwise directly or indirectly holds positions or controls trading and to positions held by two or more persons acting pursuant to an expressed or implied agreement or understanding the same as if the positions were held by, or the trading of the position were done by, a single individual.
          (b) Ownership of accounts generally. For the purpose of applying the position limits set forth in § 151.4, except for the ownership interest of limited partners, shareholders, members of a limited liability company, beneficiaries of a trust or similar type of pool participant in a commodity pool subject to the provisos set forth in paragraph (c) of this section or in accounts or positions in multiple pools as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, any person holding positions in more than one account, or holding accounts or positions in which the person by power of attorney or otherwise directly or indirectly has a 10 percent or greater ownership or equity interest, must aggregate all such accounts or positions.
          (c) Ownership by limited partners, shareholders or other pool participants. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section, a person that is a limited partner, shareholder or other similar type of pool participant with an ownership or equity interest of 10 percent or greater in a pooled account or positions who is also a principal or affiliate of the operator of the pooled account must aggregate the pooled account or positions with all other accounts or positions owned or controlled by that person, unless:
          (i) The pool operator has, and enforces, written procedures to preclude the person from having knowledge of, gaining access to, or receiving data about the trading or positions of the pool;
          (ii) The person does not have direct, day-to-day supervisory authority or control over the pool's trading decisions; and
          (iii) The pool operator has complied with the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section on behalf of the person or class of persons.
          (2) A commodity pool operator having ownership or equity interest of 10 percent or greater in an account or positions as a limited partner, shareholder or other similar type of pool participant must aggregate those accounts or positions with all other accounts or positions owned or controlled by the commodity pool operator.
          (3) Each limited partner, shareholder, or other similar type of pool participant having an ownership or equity interest of 25 percent or greater in a commodity pool the operator of which is exempt from registration under § 4.13 of this chapter must aggregate the pooled account or positions with all other accounts or positions owned or controlled by that person.
          (d) Identical trading. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, for the purpose of applying the position limits set forth in § 151.4, any person that holds or controls the trading of positions, by power of attorney or otherwise, in more than one account, or that holds or controls trading of accounts or positions in multiple pools with identical trading strategies must aggregate all such accounts or positions that a person holds or controls.
          (e) Trading control by futures commission merchants. The position limits set forth in § 151.4 shall be construed to apply to all positions held by a futures commission merchant or its separately organized affiliates in a discretionary account, or in an account which is part of, or participates in, or receives trading advice from a customer trading program of a futures commission merchant or any of the officers, partners, or employees of such futures commission merchant or its separately organized affiliates, unless:
          (1) A trader other than the futures commission merchant or the affiliate directs trading in such an account;
          (2) The futures commission merchant or the affiliate maintains only such minimum control over the trading in such an account as is necessary to fulfill its duty to supervise diligently trading in the account; and
          (3) Each trading decision of the discretionary account or the customer trading program is determined independently of all trading decisions in other accounts which the futures commission merchant or the affiliate holds, has a financial interest of 10 percent or more in, or controls.
          (f) Independent Account Controller. An eligible entity need not aggregate its positions with the eligible entity's client positions or accounts carried by an authorized independent account controller, as defined in § 151.1, except for the spot month provided in physical-delivery Referenced Contracts, provided, however, that the eligible entity has complied with the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section, and that the overall positions held or controlled by such independent account controller may not exceed the limits specified in § 151.4.
          (1) Additional requirements for exemption of Affiliated Entities. If the independent account controller is affiliated with the eligible entity or another independent account controller, each of the affiliated entities must:
          (i) Have, and enforce, written procedures to preclude the affiliated entities from having knowledge of, gaining access to, or receiving data about, trades of the other. Such procedures must include document routing and other procedures or security arrangements, including separate physical locations, which would maintain the independence of their activities; provided, however, that such procedures may provide for the disclosure of information which is reasonably necessary for an eligible entity to maintain the level of control consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities and necessary to fulfill its duty to supervise diligently the trading done on its behalf;
          (ii) Trade such accounts pursuant to separately developed and independent trading systems;
          (iii) Market such trading systems separately; and
          (iv) Solicit funds for such trading by separate disclosure documents that meet the standards of § 4.24 or § 4.34 of this chapter, as applicable where such disclosure documents are required under part 4 of this chapter.
          (g) Exemption for underwriting. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this section, a person need not aggregate the positions or accounts of an owned entity if the ownership interest is based on the ownership of securities constituting the whole or a part of an unsold allotment to or subscription by such person as a participant in the distribution of such securities by the issuer or by or through an underwriter.
          (h) Notice filing for exemption. (1) Persons seeking an aggregation exemption under paragraph (c), (e), (f), or (i) of this section shall file a notice with the Commission, which shall be effective upon submission of the notice, and shall include:
          (i) A description of the relevant circumstances that warrant disaggregation; and
          (ii) A statement certifying that the conditions set forth in the applicable aggregation exemption provision has been met.

          (2) Upon call by the Commission, any person claiming an aggregation exemption under this section shall provide to the Commission such information concerning the person's claim for exemption. Upon notice and opportunity for the affected person to respond, the Commission may amend, suspend, terminate, or otherwise modify a person's aggregation exemption for failure to comply with the provisions of this section.
          (3) In the event of a material change to the information provided in the notice filed under this paragraph, an updated or amended notice shall promptly be filed detailing the material change.
          (4) A notice shall be submitted in the form and manner provided for in § 151.10.
          (i) Exemption for federal law information sharing restriction. Notwithstanding any provision of this section, a person is not subject to the aggregation requirements of this section if the sharing of information associated with such aggregation would cause either person to violate Federal law or regulations adopted thereunder and provided that such a person does not have actual knowledge of information associated with such aggregation. Provided, however, that such person file a prior notice with the Commission detailing the circumstances of the exemption and an opinion of counsel that the sharing of information would cause a violation of Federal law or regulations adopted thereunder.
        
        
          § 151.8
          Foreign boards of trade.
          The aggregate position limits in § 151.4 shall apply to a trader with positions in Referenced Contracts executed on, or pursuant to the rules of a foreign board of trade, provided that:
          (a) Such Referenced Contracts settle against any price (including the daily or final settlement price) of one or more contracts listed for trading on a designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility; and
          (b) The foreign board of trade makes available such Referenced Contracts to its members or other participants located in the United States through direct access to its electronic trading and order matching system.
        
        
          § 151.9
          Pre-existing positions.
          (a) Non-spot-month position limits. The position limits set forth in § 151.4(b) of this chapter may be exceeded to the extent that positions in Referenced Contracts remain open and were entered into in good faith prior to the effective date of any rule, regulation, or order that specifies a position limit under this part.
          (b) Spot-month position limits. Notwithstanding the pre-existing exemption in non-spot months, a person must comply with spot month limits.
          (c) Pre-Dodd-Frank and transition period swaps. The initial position limits established under § 151.4 shall not apply to any swap positions entered into in good faith prior to the effective date of such initial limits. Swap positions in Referenced Contracts entered into in good faith prior to the effective date of such initial limits may be netted with post-effective date swap and swaptions for the purpose of applying any position limit.
          (d) Exemptions. Exemptions granted by the Commission under § 1.47 for swap risk management shall not apply to swap positions entered into after the effective date of initial position limits established under § 151.4.
        
        
          § 151.10
          Form and manner of reporting and submitting information or filings.
          Unless otherwise instructed by the Commission or its designees, any person submitting reports under this section shall submit the corresponding required filings and any other information required under this part to the Commission as follows:

          (b) Not later than 9 a.m. Eastern Time on the next business day following the reporting or filing obligation is incurred unless:
          
          (1) A 404A filing is submitted pursuant § 151.5(d), in which case the filing must be submitted at least ten business days in advance of the date that transactions and positions would be established that would exceed a position limit set forth in § 151.4;

          (2) A 404 filing is submitted pursuant to § 151.5(c) or a 404S is submitted pursuant to § 151.5(f), the filing must be submitted not later than 9 a.m. on the third business day after a position has exceeded the level in a Referenced Contract for the first time and not later than the third business day following each calendar month in which the person exceeded such levels;
          (3) The filing is submitted pursuant to § 151.6, then the 401 or 404, or their respective alternatives as provided for under § 151.6(d), shall be submitted within ten business days following the quarter in which the person holds a position in excess in the visibility levels provided in § 151.6(a); or
          (4) A notice of disaggregation is filed pursuant to § 151.7(h), in which case the notice shall be submitted within five business days of when the person claims a disaggregation exemption.

          § 151.11
          Designated contract market and swap execution facility position limits and accountability rules.
          (a) Spot-month limits. (1) For all Referenced Contracts executed pursuant to their rules, swap execution facilities that are trading facilities and designated contract markets shall adopt, enforce, and, establish rules and procedures for monitoring and enforcing spot-month position limits set at levels no greater than those established by the Commission under § 151.4.
          (2) For all agreements, contracts, or transactions executed pursuant to their rules that are not subject to the limits set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, it shall be an acceptable practice for swap execution facilities that are trading facilities and designated contract markets to adopt, enforce, and establish rules and procedures for monitoring and enforcing spot-month position limits set at levels no greater than 25 percent of estimated deliverable supply, consistent with Commission guidance set forth in this title.
          (b) Non-spot-month limits—(1) Referenced Contracts. For Referenced Contracts executed pursuant to their rules, swap execution facilities that are trading facilities and designated contract markets shall adopt enforce, and establish rules and procedures for monitoring and enforcing single month and all-months limits at levels no greater than the position limits established by the Commission under § 151.4(d)(3) or (4).
          (2) Non-referenced contracts. For all other agreements, contracts, or transactions executed pursuant to their rules that are not subject to the limits set forth in § 151.4, except as provided in § 151.11(b)(3) and (c), it shall be an acceptable practice for swap execution facilities that are trading facilities and designated contract markets to adopt, enforce, and establish rules and procedures for monitoring and enforcing single-month and all-months-combined position limits at levels no greater than ten percent of the average delta-adjusted futures, swaps, and options month-end all months open interest in the same contract or economically equivalent contracts executed pursuant to the rules of the designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility for the greater of the most recent one or two calendar years up to 25,000 contracts with a marginal increase of 2.5 percent thereafter.
          (3) Levels at designation or initial listing. Other than in Referenced Contracts, at the time of its initial designation or upon offering a new contract, agreement, or transaction to be executed pursuant to its rules, it shall be an acceptable practice for a designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility to provide for speculative limits for an individual single-month or in all-months-combined at no greater than 1,000 contracts for physical commodities other than energy commodities and 5,000 contracts for other commodities, provided that the notional quantity for such contracts, agreements, or transactions, corresponds to a notional quantity per contract that is no larger than a typical cash market transaction in the underlying commodity.

          (4) For purposes of this paragraph, it shall be an acceptable practice for open interest to be calculated by combining the all months month-end open interest in the same contract or economically equivalent contracts executed pursuant to the rules of the designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility (on a delta-adjusted basis, as appropriate) for all months listed during the most recent one or two calendar years.
          (c) Alternatives. In lieu of the limits provided for under § 151.11(a)(2) or (b)(2), it shall be an acceptable practice for swap execution facilities that are trading facilities and designated contract markets to adopt, enforce, and establish rules and procedures for monitoring and enforcing position accountability rules with respect to any agreement, contract, or transaction executed pursuant to their rules requiring traders to provide information about their position upon request by the exchange and to consent to halt increasing further a trader's position upon request by the exchange as follows:

          (1) On an agricultural or exempt commodity that is not subject to the limits set forth in § 151.4, having an average month-end open interest of 50,000 contracts and an average daily volume of 5,000 contracts and a liquid cash market, provided, however, such swap execution facilities that are trading facilities and designated contract markets are not exempt from the requirement set forth in paragraph (a)(2) that they adopt a spot-month position limit with a level no greater than 25 percent of estimated deliverable supply; or
          (2) On a major foreign currency, for which there is no legal impediment to delivery and for which there exists a highly liquid cash market; or
          (3) On an excluded commodity that is an index or measure of inflation, or other macroeconomic index or measure; or
          (4) On an excluded commodity that meets the definition of section 1a(19)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of the Act.
          (d) Securities futures products. Position limits for securities futures products are specified in 17 CFR part 41.
          (e) Aggregation. Position limits or accountability rules established under this section shall be subject to the aggregation standards of § 151.7.
          (f) Exemptions—(1) Hedge exemptions. (i) For purposes of exempt and agricultural commodities, no designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility bylaw, rule, regulation, or resolution adopted pursuant to this section shall apply to any position that would otherwise be exempt from the applicable Federal speculative position limits as determined by § 151.5; provided, however, that the designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility may limit bona fide hedging positions or any other positions which have been exempted pursuant to § 151.5 which it determines are not in accord with sound commercial practices or exceed an amount which may be established and liquidated in an orderly fashion.

          (ii) For purposes of excluded commodities, no designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility by law, rule, regulation, or resolution adopted pursuant to this section shall apply to any transaction or position within the definition of bona fide hedging transactions and positions for excluded commodities in § 1.3 of this chapter; provided, however, that the designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility may limit bona fide hedging positions that it determines are not in accord with sound commercial practices or exceed an amount which may be established and liquidated in an orderly fashion.
          (2) Procedure. Persons seeking to establish eligibility for an exemption must comply with the procedures of the designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility for granting exemptions from its speculative position limit rules. In considering whether to permit or grant an exemption, a designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility must take into account sound commercial practices and paragraph (d)(1) of this section and apply principles consistent with § 151.5.
          (g) Other exemptions. Speculative position limits adopted pursuant to this section shall not apply to:
          (1) Any position acquired in good faith prior to the effective date of any bylaw, rule, regulation, or resolution which specifies such limit;

          (2) Spread or arbitrage positions either in positions in related Referenced Contracts or, for contracts that are not Referenced Contracts, economically equivalent contracts provided that such positions are outside of the spot month for physical-delivery contracts; or
          
          (3) Any person that is registered as a futures commission merchant or floor broker under authority of the Act, except to the extent that transactions made by such person are made on behalf of or for the account or benefit of such person.
          (h) Ongoing responsibilities. Nothing in this part shall be construed to affect any provisions of the Act relating to manipulation or corners or to relieve any designated contract market, swap execution facility that is a trading facility, or governing board of a designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility from its responsibility under other provisions of the Act and regulations.
          (i) Compliance date. The compliance date of this section shall be 60 days after the term “swap” is further defined under the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010. A document will be published in the Federal Register establishing the compliance date.
          (j) Notwithstanding paragraph (i) of this section, the compliance date of provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section as it applies to non-legacy Referenced Contracts shall be upon the establishment of any non-spot-month position limits pursuant to § 151.4(d)(3). In the period prior to the establishment of any non-spot-month position limits pursuant to § 151.4(d)(3) it shall be an acceptable practice for a designated contract market or swap execution facility to either:
          (1) Retain existing non-spot-month position limits or accountability rules; or
          (2) Establish non-spot-month position limits or accountability levels pursuant to the acceptable practice described in § 151.11(b)(2) and (c)(1) based on open interest in the same contract or economically equivalent contracts executed pursuant to the rules of the designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility.

          Appendix B to Part 151—Examples of Bona Fide Hedging Transactions and Positions
          A non-exhaustive list of examples of bona fide hedging transactions or positions under § 151.5 is presented below. A transaction or position qualifies as a bona fide hedging transaction or position when it meets the requirements under § 151.5(a)(1) and one of the enumerated provisions under § 151.5(a)(2). With respect to a transaction or position that does not fall within an example in this appendix , a person seeking to rely on a bona fide hedging exemption under § 151.5 may seek guidance from the Division of Market Oversight.
          1. Royalty Payments
          a. Fact Pattern: In order to develop an oil field, Company A approaches Bank B for financing. To facilitate the loan, Bank B first establishes an independent legal entity commonly known as a special purpose vehicle (SPV). Bank B then provides a loan to the SPV. Payments of principal and interest from the SPV to the Bank are based on a fixed price for crude oil. The SPV in turn makes a production loan to Company A. The terms of the production loan require Company A to provide the SPV with volumetric production payments (VPPs) based on the SPV's share of the production and the prevailing price of crude oil. Because the price of crude may fall, the SPV reduces that risk by entering into a NYMEX Light Sweet Crude Oil crude oil swap with Swap Dealer C. The swap requires the SPV to pay Swap Dealer C the floating price of crude oil and for Swap Dealer C to pay a fixed price. The notional quantity for the swap is equal to the expected production underlying the VPPs to the SPV.
          
            Analysis: The swap between Swap Dealer C and the SPV meets the general requirements for bona fide hedging transactions (§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and the specific requirements for royalty payments (§ 151.5(a)(2)(vi)). The VPPs that the SPV receives represent anticipated royalty payments from the oil field's production. The swap represents a substitute for transactions to be made in the physical marketing channel. The SPV's swap position qualifies as a hedge because it is economically appropriate to the reduction of risk. The SPV is reasonably certain that the notional quantity of the swap is equal to the expected production underlying the VPPs. The swap reduces the risk associated with a change in value of a royalty asset. The fluctuations in value of the SPV's anticipated royalties are substantially related to the fluctuations in value of the NYMEX Light Sweet Crude Oil Referenced Contract swap with Swap Dealer C. The risk-reducing position will not qualify as a bona fide hedge in a physical-delivery Referenced Contract during the spot month.
          b. Continuation of Fact Pattern: Swap Dealer C offsets the risk associated with the swap to the SPV by selling Referenced Contracts. The notional quantity of the Referenced Contracts sold by Swap Dealer C exactly matches the notional quantity of the swap with the SPV.
          
            Analysis: Because the SPV enters the swap as a bona fide hedger under § 151.5(a)(2)(vi), the offset of the risk of the swap in a Referenced Contract by Swap Dealer C qualifies as a bona fide hedging transaction under § 151.5(a)(3). As provided in § 151.5(a)(3), the risk reducing position of Swap Dealer C does not qualify as a bona fide hedge in a physical-delivery Referenced Contract during the spot month.
          2. Sovereigns
          a. Fact Pattern: A Sovereign induces a farmer to sell his anticipated production of 100,000 bushels of corn forward to User A at a fixed price for delivery during the expected harvest. In return for the farmer entering into the fixed-price forward sale, the Sovereign agrees to pay the farmer the difference between the market price at the time of harvest and the price of the fixed-price forward, in the event that the market price is above the price of the forward. The fixed-price forward sale of 100,000 bushels of corn reduces the farmer's downside price risk associated with his anticipated agricultural production. The Sovereign faces commodity price risk as it stands ready to pay the farmer the difference between the market price and the price of the fixed-price contract. To reduce that risk, the Sovereign purchases 100,000 bushels of Chicago Board of Trade (“CBOT”) Corn Referenced Contract call options.
          
            Analysis: Because the Sovereign and the farmer are acting together pursuant to an express agreement, the aggregation provisions of § 151.7 and § 151.5(b) apply and they are treated as a single person. Taking the positions of the Sovereign and farmer jointly, the risk profile of the combination of the forward sale and the long call is approximately equivalent to the risk profile of a synthetic long put.521
             A synthetic long put may be a bona fide hedge for anticipated production. Thus, that single person satisfies the general requirements for bona fide hedging transactions (§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and specific requirements for anticipated agricultural production (§ 151.5(a)(2)(i)(B)). The synthetic long put is a substitute for transactions that the farmer will make at a later time in the physical marketing channel after the crop is harvested. The synthetic long put reduces the price risk associated with anticipated agricultural production. The size of the hedge is equivalent to the size of the Sovereign's risk exposure. As provided under § 151.5(a)(2)(i)(B), the Sovereign's risk-reducing position will not qualify as a bona fide hedge in a physical-delivery Referenced Contract during the last five trading days.
          
            
              521 Put-call parity describes the mathematical relationship between price of a put and call with identical strike prices and expiry.
          
          3. Services
          a. Fact Pattern: Company A enters into a risk service agreement to drill an oil well with Company B. The risk service agreement provides that a portion of the revenue receipts to Company A depends on the value of the oil produced. Company A is concerned that the price of oil may fall resulting in lower anticipated revenues from the risk service agreement. To reduce that risk, Company A sells 5,000 NYMEX Light Sweet Crude Oil Referenced Contracts, which is equivalent to the firm's anticipated share of the oil produced.
          
            Analysis: Company A's hedge of a portion of its revenue stream from the risk service agreement meets the general requirements for bona fide hedging (§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and the specific provisions for services (§ 151.5(a)(2)(vii)). Selling NYMEX Light Sweet Crude Oil Referenced Contracts is a substitute for transactions to be taken at a later time in the physical marketing channel once the oil is produced. The Referenced Contracts sold by Company A are economically appropriate to the reduction of risk because the total notional quantity of the Referenced Contracts sold by Company A equals its share of the expected quantity of future production under the risk service agreement. Because the price of oil may fall, the transactions in Referenced Contracts arise from a potential reduction in the value of the service that Company A is providing to Company B. The contract for services involves the production of a commodity underlying the NYMEX Exchange Light Sweet Crude Oil Referenced Contract. As provided under § 151.5(a)(2)(vii), the risk reducing position will not qualify as a bona fide hedge during the spot month of the physical-delivery Referenced Contract.
          b. Fact Pattern: A City contracts with Firm A to provide waste management services. The contract requires that the trucks used to transport the solid waste use natural gas as a power source. According to the contract, the City will pay for the cost of the natural gas used to transport the solid waste by Firm A. In the event that natural gas prices rise, the City's waste transport expenses rise. To mitigate this risk, the City establishes a long position in NYMEX Natural Gas Referenced Contracts that is equivalent to the expected use of natural gas over the life of the service contract.
          
            Analysis: This transaction meets the general requirements for bona fide hedging transaction (§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and the specific provisions for services (§ 151.5(a)(2)(vii)). Because the City is responsible for paying the cash price for the natural gas used to power the trucks that transport the solid waste under the services agreement, the long hedge is a substitute for transactions to be taken at a later time in the physical marketing channel. The transaction is economically appropriate to the reduction of risk because the total notional quantity of the positions Referenced Contracts purchased equals the expected use of natural gas over the life of the contract. The positions in Referenced Contracts reduce the risk associated with an increase in anticipated liabilities that the City may incur in the event that the price of natural gas increases. The service contract involves the use of a commodity underlying a Referenced Contract. As provided under § 151.5(a)(2)(vii), the risk reducing position will not qualify as a bona fide hedge during the spot month of the physical-delivery Referenced Contract.
          c. Fact Pattern: Natural Gas Producer A induces Pipeline Operator B to build a pipeline between Producer A's natural gas wells and the Henry Hub pipeline interconnection by entering into a fixed-price contract for natural gas transportation that guarantees a specified quantity of gas to be transported over the pipeline. With the construction of the new pipeline, Producer A plans to deliver natural gas to Henry Hub at a price differential between his gas wells and Henry Hub that is higher than its transportation cost. Producer A is concerned, however, that the price differential may decline. To lock in the price differential, Producer A decides to sell outright NYMEX Henry Hub Natural Gas Referenced Contract cash-settled futures contracts and buy an outright swap that NYMEX Henry Hub Natural Gas at his gas wells.
          
            Analysis: This transaction satisfies the general requirements for a bona fide hedge exemption (§§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and specific provisions for services (§ 151.5(a)(2)(vii)).522

             The hedge represents a substitute for transactions to be taken in the future (e.g., selling natural gas at Henry Hub). The hedge is economically appropriate to the reduction of risk that the location differential will decline, provided the hedge is not larger than the quantity equivalent of the cash market commodity to be produced and transported. As provided under § 151.5(a)(2)(vii), the risk reducing position will not qualify as a bona fide hedge during the spot month of the physical-delivery Referenced Contract.
          
            
              522 Note that in addition to the use of Referenced Contracts, Producer A could have hedged this risk by using a basis contract, which is excluded from the definition of Referenced Contracts.
          
          4. Lending a Commodity
          a. Fact Pattern: Bank B lends 1,000 ounces of gold to Jewelry Fabricator J at LIBOR plus a differential. Under the terms of the loan, Jewelry Fabricator J may later purchase the gold at a differential to the prevailing price of Commodity Exchange, Inc. (“COMEX”) Gold (i.e., an open-price purchase agreement embedded in the terms of the loan). Jewelry Fabricator J intends to use the gold to make jewelry and reimburse Bank B for the loan using the proceeds from jewelry sales. Because Bank B is concerned about its potential loss if the price of gold drops, it reduces the risk of a potential loss in the value of the gold by selling COMEX Gold Referenced Contracts with an equivalent notional quantity of 1,000 ounces of gold.
          
            Analysis: This transaction meets the general bona fide hedge exemption requirements (§§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and the specific requirements associated with owing a cash commodity (§ 151.5(a)(2)(i)). Bank B's short hedge of the gold represents a substitute for a transaction to be made in the physical marketing channel. Because the total notional quantity of the amount of gold contracts sold is equal to the amount of gold that Bank B owns, the hedge is economically appropriate to the reduction of risk. Finally, the transactions in Referenced Contracts arise from a potential change in the value of the gold owned by Bank B.
          b. Fact Pattern: Silver Processor A agrees to purchase scrap metal from a Scrap Yard that will be processed into 5,000 ounces of silver. To finance the purchase, Silver Processor A borrows 5,000 ounces of silver from Bank B and sells the silver in the cash market. Using the proceeds from the sale of silver in the cash market, Silver Processor A pays the Scrap Yard for the scrap metal containing 5,000 ounces of silver at a negotiated discount from the current spot price. To repay Bank B, Silver Processor A may either: Provide Bank B with 5,000 ounces of silver and an interest payment based on a differential to LIBOR; or repay the Bank at the current COMEX Silver settlement price plus an interest payment based on a differential to LIBOR (i.e., an open-price purchase agreement). Silver Processor A processes and refines the scrap to repay Bank B. Although Bank B has lent the silver, it is still exposed to a reduction in value if the price of silver falls. Bank B reduces the risk of a possible decline in the value of their silver asset over the loan period by selling COMEX Silver Referenced Contracts with a total notional quantity equal to 5,000 ounces.
          
            Analysis: This transaction meets the general requirements for a bona fide hedging transaction (§§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and specific provisions for owning a commodity (§ 151.5(a)(2)(i)). Bank B's hedge of the silver that it owns represents a substitute for a transaction in the physical marketing channel. The hedge is economically appropriate to the reduction of risk because the bank owns 5,000 ounces of silver. The hedge reduces the risk of a potential change in the value of the silver that it owns.
          5. Processor Margins
          a. Fact Pattern: Soybean Processor A has a total throughput capacity of 100 million tons of soybeans per year. Soybean Processor A “crushes” soybeans into products (soybean oil and meal). It currently has 20 million tons of soybeans in storage and has offset that risk through fixed-price forward sales of the amount of products expected to be produced from crushing 20 million tons of soybeans, thus locking in the crushing margin on 20 million tons of soybeans. Because it has consistently operated its plant at full capacity over the last three years, it anticipates purchasing another 80 million tons of soybeans over the next year. It has not sold the crushed products forward. Processor A faces the risk that the difference in price between soybeans and the crushed products could change such that crush products (i.e., the crush spread) will be insufficient to cover its operating margins. To lock in the crush spread, Processor A purchases 80 million tons of CBOT Soybean Referenced Contracts and sells CBOT Soybean Meal and Soybean Oil Referenced Contracts, such that the total notional quantity of soybean meal and oil Referenced Contracts equals the expected production from crushing soybeans into soybean meal and oil respectively.
          
            Analysis: These hedging transactions meet the general requirements for bona fide hedging transactions (§§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and the specific provisions for unfilled anticipated requirements and unsold anticipated agricultural production (§§ 151.5(a)(2)(i)-(ii)). Purchases of soybean Referenced Contracts qualify as bona fide hedging transaction provided they do not exceed the unfilled anticipated requirements of the cash commodity for one year (in this case 80 million tons). Such transactions are a substitute for purchases to be made at a later time in the physical marketing channel and are economically appropriate to the reduction of risk. The transactions in Referenced Contracts arise from a potential change in the value of soybeans that the processor anticipates owning. The size of the permissible hedge position in soybeans must be reduced by any inventories and fixed-price purchases because they are no longer unfilled requirements. As provided under § 151.5(a)(2)(ii)(C), the risk reduction position that is not in excess of the anticipated requirements for soybeans for that month and the next succeeding month qualifies as a bona fide hedge during the last five trading days provided it is not in a physical-delivery Referenced Contract.

          Given that Soybean Processor A has purchased 80 million tons worth of CBOT Soybean Referenced Contracts, it can reduce its processing risk by selling soybean meal and oil Referenced Contracts equivalent to the expected production. The sale of CBOT Soybean, Soybean Meal, and Soybean Oil contracts represents a substitute for transactions to be taken at a later time in the physical marketing channel by the soybean processor. Because the amount of soybean meal and oil Referenced Contracts sold forward by the soybean processor corresponds to expected production from 80 million tons of soybeans, the hedging transactions are economically appropriate to the reduction of risk in the conduct and management of the commercial enterprise. These transactions arise from a potential change in the value of soybean meal and oil that is expected to be produced. The size of the permissible hedge position in the products must be reduced by any fixed-price sales because they are no longer unsold production. As provided under § 151.5(a)(2)(i)(B), the risk reducing position does not qualify as a bona fide hedge in a physical-delivery Referenced Contract during the last five trading days in the event the anticipated crushed products have not been produced.
          6. Portfolio Hedging
          a. Fact Pattern: It is currently January and Participant A owns five million bushels of corn located in its warehouses. Participant A has entered into fixed-price forward sale contracts with several processors for a total of five million bushels of corn that will be delivered in May of this year. Participant A has separately entered into fixed-price purchase contracts with several merchandisers for a total of two million bushels of corn to be delivered in March of this year. Participant A's gross long cash position is equal to seven million bushels of corn. Because Participant A has sold forward five million bushels of corn, its net cash position is equal to long two million bushels of corn. To reduce its price risk, Participant A chooses to sell the quantity equivalent of two million bushels of CBOT Corn Referenced Contracts.
          
            Analysis: The cash position and the fixed-price forward sale and purchases are all in the same crop year. Participant A currently owns five million bushels of corn and has effectively sold that amount forward. The firm is concerned that the remaining amount—two million bushels worth of fixed-price purchase contracts—will fall in value. Because the firm's net cash position is equal to long two million bushels of corn, the firm is exposed to price risk. Selling the quantity equivalent of two million bushels of CBOT Corn Referenced Contracts satisfies the general requirements for bona fide hedging transactions (§§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and the specific provisions associated with owning a commodity (§ 151.5(a)(2)(i)).523
             Participant A's hedge of the two million bushels represents a substitute to a fixed-price forward sale at a later time in the physical marketing channel. The transaction is economically appropriate to the reduction of risk because the amount of Referenced Contracts sold does not exceed the quantity equivalent risk exposure (on a net basis) in the cash commodity in the current crop year. Lastly, the hedge arises from a potential change in the value of corn owned by Participant A.
          
            
              523 Participant A could also choose to hedge on a gross basis. In that event, Participant A would sell the quantity equivalent of seven million bushels of March Chicago Board of Trade Corn Referenced Contracts, and separately purchase the quantity equivalent of five million bushels of May Chicago Board of Trade Corn Referenced Contracts.
          
          7. Anticipated Merchandising
          a. Fact Pattern: Elevator A, a grain merchandiser, owns a 31 million bushel storage facility. The facility currently has 1 million bushels of corn in storage. Based upon its historical purchasing and selling patterns for the last three years, Elevator A expects that in September it will enter into fixed-price forward purchase contracts for 30 million bushels of corn that it expects to sell in December. Currently the December corn futures price is substantially higher than the September corn futures price. In order to reduce the risk that its unfilled storage capacity will not be utilized over this period and in turn reduce Elevator A's profitability, Elevator A purchases the quantity equivalent of 30 million bushels of September CBOT Corn Referenced Contracts and sells 30 million bushels of December CBOT Corn Referenced Contracts.
          
            Analysis: This hedging transaction meets the general requirements for bona fide hedging transactions (§§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and specific provisions associated with anticipated merchandising (§ 151.5(a)(2)(v)). The hedging transaction is a substitute for transactions to be taken at a later time in the physical marketing channel. The hedge is economically appropriate to the reduction of risk associated with the firm's unfilled storage capacity because: (1) The December CBOT Corn futures price is substantially above the September CBOT Corn futures price; and (2) Elevator A reasonably expects to engage in the anticipated merchandising activity based on a review of its historical purchasing and selling patterns at that time of the year. The risk arises from a change in the value of an asset that the firm owns. As provided by § 151.5(a)(2)(v), the size of the hedge is equal to the firm's unfilled storage capacity relating to its anticipated merchandising activity. The purchase and sale of offsetting Referenced Contracts are in different months, which settle in not more than twelve months. As provided under § 151.5(a)(2)(v), the risk reducing position will not qualify as a bona fide hedge in a physical-delivery Referenced Contract during the last 5 trading days of the September contract.
          8. Aggregation of Persons
          a. Fact Pattern: Company A owns 100 percent of Company B. Company B buys and sells a variety of agricultural products, such as wheat and cotton. Company B currently owns 1 million bushels of wheat. To reduce some of its price risk, Company B decides to sell the quantity equivalent of 600,000 bushels of CBOT Wheat Referenced Contracts. After communicating with Company B, Company A decides to sell the quantity equivalent of 400,000 bushels of CBOT Wheat Referenced Contracts.
          
            Analysis: Because Company A owns more than 10 percent of Company B, Company A and B are aggregated together as one person under § 151.7. Under § 151.5(b), entities required to aggregate accounts or positions under § 151.7 shall be considered the same person for the purpose of determining whether a person or persons are eligible for a bona fide hedge exemption under paragraph § 151.5(a). The sale of wheat Referenced Contracts by Company A and B meets the general requirements for bona fide hedging transactions (§§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and the specific provisions for owning a cash commodity (§ 151.5(a)(2)(i)). The transactions in Referenced Contracts by Company A and B represent a substitute for transactions to be taken at a later time in the physical marketing channel. The transactions in Referenced Contracts by Company A and B are economically appropriate to the reduction of risk because the combined total of 1,000,000 bushels of CBOT Wheat Referenced Contracts sold by Company A and Company B does not exceed the 1,000,000 bushels of wheat that is owned by Company A. The risk exposure for Company A and B results from a potential change in the value of wheat.
          9. Repurchase Agreements
          a. Fact Pattern: When Elevator A purchased 500,000 bushels of wheat in April it decided to reduce its price risk by selling the quantity equivalent of 500,000 bushels of CBOT Wheat Referenced Contracts. Because the price of wheat has steadily risen since April, Elevator A has had to make substantial maintenance margin payments. To alleviate its concern about further margin payments, Elevator A decides to enter into a repurchase agreement with Bank B. The repurchase agreement involves two separate contracts: A fixed-price sale from Elevator A to Bank B at today's spot price; and an open-priced purchase agreement that will allow Elevator A to repurchase the wheat from Bank B at the prevailing spot price three months from now. Because Bank B obtains title to the wheat under the fixed-price purchase agreement, it is exposed to price risk should the price of wheat drop. It therefore decides to sell the quantity equivalent of 500,000 bushels of CBOT Wheat Referenced Contracts.
          
            Analysis: Bank B's hedging transaction meets the general requirements for bona fide hedging transactions (§§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and the specific provisions for owning the cash commodity (§ 151.5(a)(2)(i)). The sale of Referenced Contracts by Bank B is a substitute for a transaction to be taken at a later time in the physical marketing channel either to Elevator A or to another commercial party. The transaction is economically appropriate to the reduction of risk in the conduct and management of the commercial enterprise of Bank B because the notional quantity of Referenced Contracts sold by Bank B is not larger than the quantity of cash wheat purchased by Bank B. Finally, the purchase of CBOT Wheat Referenced Contracts reduces the risk associated with owning cash wheat.
          10. Inventory
          a. Fact Pattern: Copper Wire Fabricator A is concerned about possible reductions in the price of copper. Currently it is November and it owns inventory of 100,000 pounds of copper and 50,000 pounds of finished copper wire. Currently, deferred futures prices are lower than the nearby futures price. Copper Wire Fabricator A expects to sell 150,000 pounds of finished copper wire in February. To reduce its price risk, Copper Wire Fabricator A sells 150,000 pounds of February COMEX Copper Referenced Contracts.
          
            Analysis: The Copper Wire Fabricator A's hedging transaction meets the general requirements for bona fide hedging transactions (§§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and the provisions for owning a commodity (§ 151.5(a)(2)(i)(A)). The sale of Referenced Contracts represents a substitute for transactions to be taken at a later time. The transactions are economically appropriate to the reduction of risk in the conduct and management of the commercial enterprise because the price of copper could drop further. The transactions in Referenced Contracts arise from a possible reduction in the value of the inventory that it owns.

          § 155.2
          Trading standards for floor brokers.
          Each contract market shall adopt rules which shall, at a minimum, with respect to each member of the contract market acting as a floor broker:

          (a) Prohibit such member from purchasing any commodity for future delivery, purchasing any call option, or selling any put option, for his own account or for any account in which he has an interest, while holding an order of another person for the (1) purchase of any future, (2) purchase of any call option, or (3) sale of any put option, in the same commodity which is executable at the market price or at the price at which such purchase or sale can be made for the member's own account or any account in which he has an interest.
          (b) Prohibit such member from selling any commodity for future delivery, selling any call option, or purchasing any put option, for his own account or for any account in which he has an interest, while holding an order of another person for the (1) sale of any future, (2) sale of any call option, or (3) purchase of any put option, in the same commodity which is executable at the market price or at the price at which such sale or purchase can be made for the member's own account or any account in which he has an interest.
          (c) Prohibit such member from executing any transaction for any account of another person for which buying and/or selling orders can be placed or originated, or for which transactions can be executed, by such member without the prior specific consent of the account owner, regardless of whether the general authorization for such orders or transactions is pursuant to a written agreement, except that orders for such an account may be placed with another member for execution.
          (d) Prohibit such member from disclosing at any time that he is holding an order of another person or from divulging any order revealed to him by reason of his relationship to such other person, except pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section or at the request of an authorized representative of the Commission or the contract market.
          (e) Prohibit such member from taking, directly or indirectly, the other side of any order of another person revealed to him by reason of his relationship to such other person, except with such other person's prior consent and in conformity with contract market rules approved by the Commission.
          (f) Prohibit such member from making any purchase or sale which has been directly or indirectly prearranged.
          (g) Prohibit such member from allocating trades among accounts except in accordance with rules of the contract market which have been approved by the Commission.
          (h) Prohibit such member from withholding or withdrawing from the market any order or part of an order of another person for the convenience of another member.
          (i) Require that every execution of a transaction on the floor by such member be confirmed promptly with the opposite floor broker or floor trader; such confirmation shall identify price or premium, quantity, future or commodity option and respective clearing members. In the event a contract market cannot require prompt identification of respective clearing members without seriously disrupting the functions of its marketplace, the contract market may petition the Commission for exemption from this requirement. Such petition shall include:
          (1) An explanation of why the contract market cannot require the prompt identification of respective clearing members without seriously disrupting the functions of its marketplace, and
          (2) A proposed contract market rule which will insure that the opposite sides of every trade executed on the contract market can be effectively matched and will be accepted by a clearing member for clearance or will be otherwise sufficiently guaranteed.

          The Commission may, in its discretion and upon such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, grant such petition for exemption upon finding that the functions of the contract market may be seriously disrupted by requiring the prompt identification of respective clearing members and that the contract market appears to have adequately insured that every trade executed thereon can be effectively matched and will be accepted by a clearing member for clearance or will be otherwise sufficiently guaranteed.

          § 155.3
          Trading standards for futures commission merchants.
          (a) Each futures commission merchant shall, at a minimum, establish and enforce internal rules, procedures and controls to:
          (1) Insure, to the extent possible, that each order received from a customer which is executable at or near the market price is transmitted to the floor of the appropriate contract market before any order in any future or in any commodity option in the same commodity for any proprietary account, any other account in which an affiliated person has an interest, or any account for which an affiliated person may originate orders without the prior specific consent of the account owner, if the affiliated person has gained knowledge of the customer's order prior to the transmission to the floor of the appropriate contract market of the order for a proprietary account, an account in which the affiliated person has an interest, or an account in which the affiliated person may originate orders without the prior specific consent of the account owner; and
          (2) Prevent affiliated persons from placing orders, directly or indirectly, with another futures commission merchant in a manner designed to circumvent the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
          (b) No futures commission merchant or any of its affiliated persons shall:
          (1) Disclose that an order of another person is being held by the futures commission merchant or any of its affiliated persons, unless such disclosure is necessary to the effective execution of such order or is made at the request of an authorized representative of the Commission, the contract market on which such order is to be executed, or a futures association registered with the Commission pursuant to section 17 of the Act; or
          (2)(i) Knowingly take, directly or indirectly, the other side of any order of another person revealed to the futures commission merchant or any of its affiliated persons by reason of their relationship to such other person, except with such other person's prior consent and in conformity with contract market rules approved by or certified to the Commission.
          (ii) In the case of a customer who does not qualify as an “institutional customer” as defined in § 1.3 of this chapter, a futures commission merchant must obtain the customer's prior consent through a signed acknowledgment, which may be accomplished in accordance with § 1.55(d) of this chapter.
          (c) No futures commission merchant shall knowingly handle the account of any affiliated person of another futures commission merchant or of an introducing broker unless the futures commission merchant:
          (1) Receives written authorization from a person designated by such other futures commission merchant or introducing broker with responsibility for the surveillance over such account pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section or § 155.4(a)(2), respectively;

          (b) Scope. This part applies only to nonpublic personal information about individuals who obtain financial products or services primarily for personal, family, or household purposes from the institutions listed below.

            (b) When initial notice to a consumer is not required. You are not required to provide an initial notice to a consumer under paragraph (a) of this section if:
            (1) You do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about the consumer to any nonaffiliated third party other than as authorized by §§ 160.14 and 160.15; and
            (2) You do not have a customer relationship with the consumer.
            (c) When you establish a customer relationship—(1) General rule. You establish a customer relationship when you and the consumer enter into a continuing relationship.
            (2) Examples of establishing customer relationship. You establish a customer relationship when the consumer:
            (i) Instructs you to execute a commodity interest transaction for the consumer;
            (ii) Opens a retail forex account, or opens a commodity interest account through an introducing broker or with a futures commission merchant that clears transactions for its customers through you on a fully-disclosed basis;
            (iii) Transmits specific orders for commodity interest transactions to you that you pass on to a futures commission merchant for execution, if you are an introducing broker;
            (iv) Enters into an advisory contract or subscription with you, whether in writing or orally, and whether you provide standardized, or individually tailored commodity trading advice based on the customer's commodity interest or cash market positions or other circumstances or characteristics, if you are a commodity trading adviser; or
            (v) Provides to you funds, securities, or property for an interest in a commodity pool, if you are a commodity pool operator.
            (d) Existing customers. When an existing customer obtains a new financial product or service from you that is to be used primarily for personal, family or household purposes, you satisfy the initial notice requirements of paragraph (a) of this section as follows:
            (1) You may provide a revised privacy notice under § 160.8 that covers the customer's new financial product or service; or
            (2) If the initial, revised or annual notice that you most recently provided to that customer was accurate with respect to the new financial product or service, you do not need to provide a new privacy notice under paragraph (a) of this section.
            (e) Exceptions to allow subsequent delivery of notice. (1) You may provide the initial notice required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section within a reasonable time after you establish a customer relationship if:
            (i) Establishing the customer relationship is not at the customer's election;

            (ii) Providing notice not later than when you establish a customer relationship would substantially delay the customer's transaction and the customer agrees to receive the notice at a later time;
            (iii) A nonaffiliated financial institution establishes a customer relationship between you and a consumer without your prior knowledge; or
            (iv) You have established a customer relationship with a customer in a bulk transfer in accordance with § 1.65, if you are a transferee futures commission merchant, retail foreign exchange dealer or introducing broker.
            (2) Examples of exceptions—(i) Not at customer's election. Establishing a customer relationship is not at the customer's election if you acquire the customer's commodity interest account from another financial institution and the customer does not have a choice about your acquisition.
            (ii) Substantial delay of customer's transaction. Providing notice not later than when you establish a customer relationship would substantially delay the customer's transaction when you and the individual agree over the telephone to enter into a customer relationship involving prompt delivery of the financial product or service.
            (iii) No substantial delay of customer's transaction. Providing notice not later than when you establish a customer relationship would not substantially delay the customer's transaction when the relationship is initiated in person at your office or through other means by which the customer may view the notice, such as on a web site.
            (f) Delivery of notice. When you are required by this section to deliver an initial privacy notice, you must deliver it according to the provisions of § 160.9. If you use a short-form initial notice for non-customers according to § 160.6(d), you may deliver your privacy notice as provided in section § 160.6(d)(3).
            [66 FR 21252, Apr. 27, 2001, as amended at 75 FR 55451, Sept. 10, 2010]
          
          
            § 160.5
            Annual privacy notice to customers required.
            (a)(1) General rule. You must provide a clear and conspicuous notice to customers that accurately reflects your privacy policies and practices not less than annually during the life of the customer relationship. Annually means at least once in any period of 12 consecutive months during which that relationship exists. You may define the 12-consecutive-month period, but you must apply it to the customer on a consistent basis.
            (2) Example. You provide notice annually if you define the 12-consecutive-month period as a calendar year and provide the annual notice to the customer once in each calendar year following the calendar year in which you provided the initial notice. For example, if a customer opens an account on any day of year 1, you must provide an annual notice to that customer by December 31 of year 2.
            (b)(1) Termination of customer relationship. You are not required to provide an annual notice to a former customer.
            (2) Examples. Your customer becomes a former customer when:
            (i) The individual's commodity interest account is closed;
            (ii) The individual's advisory contract or subscription is terminated or expires; or
            (iii) The individual has redeemed all of his or her units in your pool.
            (c) Delivery of notice. When you are required by this section to deliver an annual privacy notice, you must deliver it in the manner provided by § 160.9.
          
          
            § 160.6
            Information to be included in privacy notices.
            (a) General rule. The initial, annual, and revised privacy notices that you provide under §§ 160.4, 160.5 and 160.8 must include each of the following items of information that applies to you or to the consumers to whom you send your privacy notice, in addition to any other information you wish to provide:
            (1) The categories of nonpublic personal information that you collect;
            (2) The categories of nonpublic personal information that you disclose;
            (3) The categories of affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties to whom you disclose nonpublic personal information, other than those parties to whom you disclose information under §§ 160.14 and 160.15;

            (4) The categories of nonpublic personal information about your former customers that you disclose and the categories of affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties to whom you disclose nonpublic personal information about your former customers, other than those parties to whom you disclose information under §§ 160.14 and 160.15;
            (5) If you disclose nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party under § 160.13 (and no other exception applies to that disclosure), a separate statement of the categories of information you disclose and the categories of third parties with whom you have contracted;
            (6) An explanation of the consumer's rights under § 160.10(a) to opt out of the disclosure of nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties, including the method(s) by which the consumer may exercise that right at that time;
            (7) Any disclosures that you make under § 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a(d)(2)(A)(iii)) (that is, notices regarding the ability to opt out of disclosures of information among affiliates);
            (8) Your policies and practices with respect to protecting the confidentiality and security of nonpublic personal information; and
            (9) Any disclosure that you make under paragraph (b) of this section.
            (b) Description of nonaffiliated third parties subject to exceptions. If you disclose nonpublic personal information to third parties as authorized under §§ 160.14 and 160.15, you are not required to list those exceptions in the initial or annual privacy notices required by §§ 160.4 and 160.5. When describing the categories with respect to those parties, it is sufficient to state that you make disclosures to other nonaffiliated companies:
            (1) For your everyday business purposes, such as [include all that apply] to process transactions, maintain account(s), respond to court orders and legal investigations, or report to credit bureaus; or
            (2) As permitted by law.
            (c) Examples—(1) Categories of nonpublic personal information that you collect. You satisfy the requirement to categorize the nonpublic personal information that you collect if you list the following categories, as applicable:
            (i) Information from the consumer;
            (ii) Information about the consumer's transactions with you or your affiliates;
            (iii) Information about the consumer's transactions with nonaffiliated third parties; and
            (iv) Information from a consumer reporting agency.
            (2) Categories of nonpublic personal information you disclose. (i) You satisfy the requirement to categorize the nonpublic personal information you disclose if you list the categories described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, as applicable, and a few examples to illustrate the types of information in each category.
            (ii) If you reserve the right to disclose all of the nonpublic personal information about consumers that you collect, you may simply state that fact without describing the categories or examples of the nonpublic personal information you disclose.
            (3) Categories of affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties to whom you disclose. You satisfy the requirement to categorize the affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties to whom you disclose nonpublic personal information if you list the following categories, as applicable, and a few examples to illustrate the types of third parties in each category:
            (i) Financial service providers;
            (ii) Non-financial companies; and
            (iii) Others.
            (4) Disclosures under exception for service providers and joint marketers. If you disclose nonpublic personal information under the exception in § 160.13 to a nonaffiliated third party to market products or services that you offer alone or jointly with another financial institution, you satisfy the disclosure requirement of paragraph (a)(5) of this section if you:
            (i) List the categories of nonpublic personal information you disclose, using the same categories and examples you used to meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, as applicable; and
            (ii) State whether the third party is:

            (A) A service provider that performs marketing services on your behalf or on behalf of you and another financial institution; or
            
            (B) A financial institution with which you have a joint marketing agreement.
            (5) Simplified notices. If you do not disclose, and do not wish to reserve the right to disclose, nonpublic personal information to affiliates or nonaffiliated third parties except as authorized under §§ 160.14 and 160.15, you may simply state that fact, in addition to information you must provide under paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(8), (a)(9) and (b) of this section.
            (6) Confidentiality and security. You describe your policies and practices with respect to protecting the confidentiality and security of nonpublic personal information if you do both of the following:
            (i) Describe in general terms who is authorized to have access to the information; and
            (ii) State whether you have security practices and procedures in place to ensure the confidentiality of the information in accordance with your policy. You are not required to describe technical information about the safeguards you use.
            (d) Short-form initial notice with opt out notice for non-customers. (1) You may satisfy the initial notice requirements in §§ 160.4(a)(2), 160.7(b) and 160.7(c) for a consumer who is not a customer by providing a short-form initial notice at the same time as you deliver an opt out notice as required in 160.7.
            (2) A short-form initial notice must:
            (i) Be clear and conspicuous;
            (ii) State that your privacy notice is available upon request; and
            (iii) Explain a reasonable means by which the consumer may obtain your privacy notice.
            (3) You must deliver your short-form initial notice according to § 160.9. You are not required to deliver your privacy notice with your short-form initial notice. You instead may simply provide the consumer a reasonable means to obtain your privacy notice. If a consumer who receives your short-form notice requests your privacy notice, you must deliver your privacy notice according to § 160.9.
            (4) Examples of obtaining privacy notice. You provide a reasonable means by which a consumer may obtain a copy of your privacy notice if you:
            (i) Provide a toll-free telephone number that the consumer may call to request the notice; or
            (ii) For a consumer who conducts business in person at your office, maintain copies of the notice on hand that you provide to the consumer immediately upon request.
            (e) Future disclosures. Your notice may include:
            (1) Categories of nonpublic personal information that you reserve the right to disclose in the future, but do not currently disclose; and
            (2) Categories of affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties to whom you reserve the right in the future to disclose, but to whom you do not currently disclose, nonpublic personal information.
            (f) Model privacy form. Pursuant to § 160.2(a) of this part, a model privacy form that meets the notice content requirements of this section is included in appendix A of this part.
            [66 FR 21252, Apr. 27, 2001, as amended at 74 FR 62974, Dec. 1, 2009]
          
          
            § 160.7
            Form of opt out notice to consumers; opt out methods.
            (a)(1) Form of opt out notice. If you are required to provide an opt out notice under § 160.10(a), you must provide a clear and conspicuous notice to each of your consumers that accurately explains the right to opt out under that section. The notice must state:
            (i) That you disclose or reserve the right to disclose nonpublic personal information about your consumer to a nonaffiliated third party;
            (ii) That the consumer has the right to opt out of that disclosure; and
            (iii) A reasonable means by which the consumer may exercise the opt out right.
            (2) Examples—(i) Adequate opt out notice. You provide adequate notice that the consumer can opt out of the disclosure of nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party if you:

            (A) Identify all of the categories of nonpublic personal information that you disclose or reserve the right to disclose, and all of the categories of nonaffiliated third parties to which you disclose the information, as described in § 160.6(a)(2) and (3), and state that the consumer can opt out of the disclosure of that information; and
            (B) Identify the financial products or services that the consumer obtains from you, either singly or jointly, to which the opt out direction would apply.
            (ii) Reasonable means to opt out. You provide a reasonable means to exercise an opt out right if you:
            (A) Designate check-off boxes in a prominent position on the relevant forms with the opt out notice;
            (B) Include a reply form together with the opt out notice;
            (C) Provide an electronic means to opt out, such as a form that can be sent via electronic mail or a process at your web site, if the consumer agrees to the electronic delivery of information; or
            (D) Provide a toll-free telephone number that consumers may call to opt out.
            (iii) Unreasonable opt out means. You do not provide a reasonable means of opting out if:
            (A) The only means of opting out is for the consumer to write his or her own letter to exercise that opt out right; or
            (B) The only means of opting out as described in any notice subsequent to the initial notice is to use a check-off box that you provided with the initial notice but did not include with the subsequent notice.
            (iv) Specific opt out means. You may require each consumer to opt out through a specific means, as long as that means is reasonable for the consumer.
            (b) Same form as initial notice permitted. You may provide the opt out notice together with or on the same written or electronic form, as the initial notice you provide in accordance with § 160.4.
            (c) Initial notice required when opt out notice delivered subsequent to initial notice. If you provide the opt out notice after the initial notice in accordance with § 160.4, you must also include a copy of the initial notice with the opt out notice in writing, or, if the consumer agrees, electronically.
            (d) Joint relationships. (1) If two or more consumers jointly obtain a financial product or service from you, you may provide a single opt out notice; however, you must honor a request from one or more joint account holders for a separate opt out notice. Your opt out notice must explain how you will treat an opt out direction by a joint consumer.
            (2) Any of the joint consumers may exercise the right to opt out. You may either:
            (i) Treat an opt out direction by a joint consumer as applying to all of the associated joint consumers; or
            (ii) Permit each joint consumer to opt out separately.
            (3) If you permit each joint consumer to opt out separately, you must permit one of the joint consumers to opt out on behalf of all of the joint consumers.
            (4) You may not require all joint consumers to opt out before you implement any opt out direction.
            (5) Example. If John and Mary have a joint trading account with you and arrange for you to send statements to John's address, you may do any of the following, but you must explain in your opt out notice which opt out policy you will follow:
            (i) Send a single opt out notice to John's address, but you must accept an opt out direction from either John or Mary;
            (ii) Treat an opt out direction by either John or Mary as applying to the entire account. If you do so, and John opts out, you may not require Mary to opt out as well before implementing John's opt out direction; or
            (iii) Permit John and Mary to make different opt out directions. If you do so:
            (A) You must permit John and Mary to opt out for each other.
            (B) If both opt out, you must permit both to notify you in a single response (such as on a form or through a telephone call).
            (C) If John opts out and Mary does not, you may only disclose nonpublic personal information about Mary, but not about John, and not about John and Mary jointly.
            (e) Time to comply with opt out. You must comply with a consumer's opt out direction as soon as reasonably practicable after you receive it.
            
            (f) Continuing right to opt out. A consumer may exercise the right to opt out at any time.
            (g) Duration of consumer's opt out direction. (1) A consumer's direction to opt out under this section is effective until the consumer revokes it in writing, either by hard copy or, if the consumer agrees, electronically.
            (2) When a customer relationship terminates, the customer's opt out direction continues to apply to the nonpublic personal information that you collected during or related to that relationship. If the individual subsequently establishes a new customer relationship with you, the opt out direction that applied to the former relationship does not apply to the new relationship.
            (h) Delivery. When you are required by this section to deliver an opt out notice, you must deliver it according to § 160.9.
            (i) Model privacy form. Pursuant to § 160.2(a) of this part, a model privacy form that meets the notice content requirements of this section is included in appendix A of this part.
            [66 FR 21252, Apr. 27, 2001, as amended at 74 FR 62974, Dec. 1, 2009]
          
          
            § 160.8
            Revised privacy notices.
            (a) General rule. Except as otherwise authorized in this part, you must not, directly or through any affiliate, disclose any nonpublic personal information about a consumer to a nonaffiliated third party other than as described in the initial notice that you provided to that consumer under § 160.4, unless:
            (1) You have provided to the consumer a clear and conspicuous revised notice that accurately describes your policies and practices;
            (2) You have provided to the consumer a new opt out notice;
            (3) You have given the consumer a reasonable opportunity, before you disclose the information to the nonaffiliated third party, to opt out of the disclosure; and
            (4) The consumer does not opt out.
            (b) Examples. (1) Except as otherwise permitted by §§ 160.13, 160.14, and 160.15, you must provide a revised notice before you:
            (i) Disclose a new category of nonpublic personal information to any nonaffiliated third party;
            (ii) Disclose nonpublic personal information to a new category of nonaffiliated third party; or
            (iii) Disclose nonpublic personal information about a former customer to a nonaffiliated third party, if that former customer has not had the opportunity to exercise an opt out right regarding that disclosure.
            (2) A revised notice is not required if you disclose nonpublic personal information to a new nonaffiliated third party that you adequately described in your prior notice.
            (c) Delivery. When you are required to deliver a revised privacy notice by this section, you must deliver it according to § 160.9.
          
          
            § 160.9
            Delivering privacy and opt out notices.
            (a) How to provide notices. You must provide any privacy notices and opt out notices, including short-form initial notices that this part requires so that each consumer can reasonably be expected to receive actual notice in writing either in hard copy or, if the consumer agrees, electronically.
            (b)(1) Examples of reasonable expectation of actual notice. You may reasonably expect that a consumer will receive actual notice if you:
            (i) Hand-deliver a printed copy of the notice to the consumer;
            (ii) Mail a printed copy of the notice to the last known address of the consumer; or
            (iii) For the consumer who conducts transactions electronically, post the notice on the electronic site and require the consumer to acknowledge receipt of the notice as a necessary step to obtaining a particular financial service or product.
            (2) Examples of unreasonable expectation of actual notice. You may not, however, reasonably expect that a consumer will receive actual notice of your privacy policies and practices if you:

            (i) Only post a sign in your branch or office or generally publish advertisements of your privacy policies and practices; or
            
            (ii) Send the notice via electronic mail to a consumer who does not obtain a financial product or service from you electronically.
            (c) Annual notices only. You may reasonably expect that a consumer will receive actual notice of your annual privacy notice if:
            (1) The customer uses your web site to access financial products and services electronically and agrees to receive notices at the web site and you post your current privacy notice continuously in a clear and conspicuous manner on the web site; or
            (2) The customer has requested that you refrain from sending any information regarding the customer relationship, and your current privacy notice remains available to the customer upon request.
            (d) Oral description of notice insufficient. You may not provide any notice required by this part solely by orally explaining the notice, either in person or over the telephone.
            (e) Retention or accessibility of notices for customers. (1) For customers only, you must provide the initial notice required by § 160.4(a)(1), the annual notice required by § 160.5(a), and the revised notice required by § 160.8, so that the customer can retain them or obtain them later in writing or, if the customer agrees, electronically.
            (2) Examples of retention or accessibility. You provide a privacy notice to the customer so that the customer can retain it or obtain it later if you:
            (i) Hand-deliver a printed copy of the notice to the customer;
            (ii) Mail a printed copy of the notice to the last known address of the customer; or
            (iii) Make your current privacy notice available on a web site (or a link to another web site) for the customer who obtains a financial product or service electronically and agrees to receive the notice at the web site.
            (f) Joint notice with other financial institutions. You may provide a joint notice from you and one or more of your affiliates or other financial institutions, as identified in the notice, as long as the notice is accurate with respect to you and the other institutions.
            (g) Joint relationships. If two or more customers jointly obtain a financial product or service from you, you may satisfy the initial, annual, and revised notice requirements of paragraph (a) of this section by providing one notice to those customers jointly; however, you must honor a request by one or more joint account holders for a separate notice.
          
        
        
          Subpart B—Limits on Disclosures
          
            § 160.10
            Limits on disclosure of nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties.
            (a)(1) Conditions for disclosure. Except as otherwise authorized in this part, you may not, directly or through any affiliate, disclose any nonpublic personal information about a consumer to a nonaffiliated third party unless:
            (i) You have provided to the consumer an initial notice as required under § 160.4;
            (ii) You have provided to the consumer an opt out notice as required in § 160.7;
            (iii) You have given the consumer a reasonable opportunity, before you disclose the information to the nonaffiliated third party, to opt of the disclosure; and
            (iv) The consumer does not opt out.
            (2) Opt out definition. Opt out means a direction by the consumer that you not disclose nonpublic personal information about that consumer to a nonaffiliated third party, other than as permitted by §§ 160.13, 160.14 and 160.15.
            (3) Examples of reasonable opportunity to opt out. You provide a consumer with a reasonable opportunity to opt out if:
            (i) By mail. You mail the notices required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to the consumer and allow the consumer to opt out by mailing a form, calling a toll-free telephone number, or any other reasonable means within 30 days after the date you mailed the notices.
            (ii) By electronic means. A customer opens an on-line account with you and agrees to receive the notices required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section electronically, and you allow the customer to opt out by any reasonable means within 30 days after the date that the customer acknowledges receipt of the notices in conjunction with opening the account.
            
            (iii) Isolated transaction with consumer. For an isolated transaction with a consumer, you provide the consumer with a reasonable opportunity to opt out if you provide the notices required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section at the time of the transaction and request that the consumer decide, as a necessary part of the transaction, whether to opt out before completing the transaction.
            (b) Application of opt out to all consumers and all nonpublic personal information. (1) You must comply with this section, regardless of whether you and the consumer have established a customer relationship.
            (2) Unless you comply with this section, you may not, directly or through any affiliate, disclose any nonpublic personal information about a consumer that you have collected, regardless of whether you have collected it before or after receiving the direction to opt out from the consumer.
            (c) Partial opt out. You may allow a consumer to select certain nonpublic personal information or certain nonaffiliated third parties with respect to which the consumer wishes to opt out.
          
          
            § 160.11
            Limits on redisclosure and reuse of information.
            (a) (1) Information you receive under an exception. If you receive nonpublic personal information from a nonaffiliated financial institution under an exception in § 160.14 or § 160.15, your disclosure and use of that information is limited as follows:
            (i) You may disclose the information to the affiliate of the financial institution from which you received the information;
            (ii) You may disclose the information to your affiliates, but your affiliates may, in turn, disclose and use the information only to the extent that you may disclose and use the information; and
            (iii) You may disclose and use the information pursuant to an exception in § 160.14 or § 160.15 in the ordinary course of business to carry out the activity covered by the exception under which you received the information.
            (2) Example. If you receive a customer list from a nonaffiliated financial institution in order to provide account-processing services under the exception in § 160.14(a), you may disclose that information under any exception in § 160.14 or § 160.15 in the ordinary course of business in order to provide those services. For example, you could disclose that information in response to a properly authorized subpoena or in the ordinary course of business to your attorneys, accountants, and auditors. You could not disclose that information to a third party for marketing purposes or use that information for your own marketing purposes.
            (b)(1) Information you receive outside of an exception. If you receive nonpublic personal information from a nonaffiliated financial institution other than under an exception in § 160.14 or § 160.15, you may disclose the information only:
            (i) To the affiliates of the financial institution from which you received the information;
            (ii) To your affiliates, but your affiliates may, in turn, disclose the information only to the extent that you can disclose the information; and
            (iii) To any other person, if the disclosure would be lawful if made directly to that person by the financial institution from which you received the information.
            (2) Example. If you obtain a customer list from a nonaffiliated financial institution outside of the exceptions in §§ 160.14 and 160.15:
            (i) You may use that list for your own purposes;
            (ii) You may disclose that list to another nonaffiliated third party only if the financial institution from which you purchased the list could have lawfully disclosed that list to that third party. That is, you may disclose the list in accordance with the privacy policy of the financial institution from which you received the list as limited by the opt out direction of each consumer whose nonpublic personal information you intend to disclose, and you may disclose the list in accordance with an exception in §§ 160.14 and 160.15, such as in the ordinary course of business to your attorneys, accountants, or auditors.
            (c) Information you disclose under an exception. If you disclose nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party under an exception in § 160.14 or § 160.15, the third party may disclose and use that information only as follows:
            (1) The third party may disclose the information to your affiliates;
            (2) The third party may disclose the information to its affiliates, but its affiliates may, in turn, disclose and use the information only to the extent that the third party may disclose and use the information; and
            (3) The third party may disclose and use the information pursuant to an exception in § 160.14 or § 160.15 in the ordinary course of business to carry out the activity covered by the exception under which it received the information.
            (d) Information you disclose outside of an exception. If you disclose nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party other than under an exception in § 160.14 or § 160.15, the third party may disclose the information only:
            (1) To your affiliates;
            (2) To its affiliates, but its affiliates, in turn, may disclose the information only to the extent the third party can disclose the information; and
            (3) To any other person, if the disclosure would be lawful if you made it directly to that person.
          
          
            § 160.12
            Limits on sharing account number information for marketing purposes.
            (a) General prohibition on disclosure of account numbers. You must not, directly or through an affiliate, disclose, other than to a consumer reporting agency, an account number or similar form of access number or access code for a consumer's credit card account, deposit account or transaction account to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing through electronic mail to the consumer.
            (b) Exceptions. Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply if you disclose an account number or similar form of access number or access code:
            (1) To your agent or service provider solely in order to perform marketing for your own services or products, as long as the agent or service provider is not authorized to directly initiate charges to the account; or
            (2) To a participant in a private-label credit card program or an affinity or similar program where the participants in the program are identified to the customer when the customer enters into the program.
            (c) Example. An account number, or similar form of access number or access code, does not include a number or code in an encrypted form, as long as you do not provide the recipient with a means to decode the number or code.
          
        
        
          Subpart C—Exceptions
          
            § 160.13
            Exception to opt out requirements for service providers and joint marketing.
            (a) General rule. (1) The opt out requirements in §§ 160.7 and 160.10 do not apply when you provide nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party to perform services for you or functions on your behalf if you:
            (i) Provide the initial notice in accordance with § 160.4; and
            (ii) Enter into a contractual agreement with the third party that prohibits the third party from disclosing or using the information other than to carry out the purposes for which you disclosed the information, including use under an exception in § 160.14 or § 160.15 in the ordinary course of business to carry out those purposes.
            (2) Example. If you disclose nonpublic personal information under this section to a financial institution with which you perform joint marketing, your contractual agreement with that institution meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section if it prohibits the institution from disclosing or using the nonpublic personal information except as necessary to carry out the joint marketing or under an exception in § 160.14 or § 160.15 in the ordinary course of business to carry out that joint marketing.
            (b) Service may include joint marketing. The services a nonaffiliated third party performs for you under paragraph (a) of this section may include marketing of your own products or services or marketing of financial products or services offered pursuant to joint agreements between you and one or more financial institutions.
            (c) Definition of joint agreement. For purposes of this section, joint agreement means a written contract pursuant to which you and one or more financial institutions jointly offer, endorse or sponsor a financial product or service.
          
          
            § 160.14
            Exceptions to notice and opt out requirements for processing and servicing transactions.
            (a) Exceptions for processing and servicing transactions at consumer's request. The requirements for initial notice in § 160.4(a)(2), for the opt out in §§ 160.7 and 160.10, and for initial notice in § 160.13 in connection with service providers and joint marketing, do not apply if you disclose nonpublic personal information as necessary to effect, administer, or enforce a transaction that a consumer requests or authorizes, or in connection with:
            (1) Processing or servicing a financial product or service that a consumer requests or authorizes;
            (2) Maintaining or servicing the consumer's account with you, or with another entity as part of an extension of credit on behalf of such entity as part of a private label credit card program or other extension of credit on behalf of such entity; or
            (3) A proposed or actual securitization, secondary market sale or similar transaction related to a transaction of the consumer.
            (b) Necessary to effect, administer or enforce a transaction means that the disclosure is:
            (1) Required, or is one of the lawful or appropriate methods, to enforce your rights or the rights of other persons engaged in carrying out the financial transaction or providing the product or service; or
            (2) Required, or is a usual, appropriate or acceptable method:
            (i) To carry out the transaction or the product or service business of which the transaction is a part, and record, service or maintain the consumer's account in the ordinary course of providing the financial service or financial product;
            (ii) To administer or service benefits or claims relating to the transaction or the product or service business of which it is a part;
            (iii) To provide a confirmation, statement or other record of the transaction, or information on the status or value of the financial service or financial product to the consumer or the consumer's agent or broker;
            (iv) To accrue or recognize incentives or bonuses associated with the transaction that are provided by you or any other party;
            (v) In connection with:
            (A) The authorization, settlement, billing, processing, clearing, transferring, reconciling or collection of amounts charged, debited or otherwise paid using a debit, credit or other payment card, check or account number, or by other payment means;
            (B) The transfer of receivables, accounts or interests therein; or
            (C) The audit of debit, credit or other payment information.

            Other exceptions to notice and opt out requirements.
            (a) Exceptions to notice and opt out requirements. The requirements for initial notice in § 160.4(a)(2), for the opt out in §§ 160.7 and 160.10, and for initial notice in § 160.13 in connection with service providers and joint marketing do not apply when you disclose nonpublic personal information:
            (1) With the consent or at the direction of the consumer, provided that the consumer has not revoked the consent or direction;
            (2)(i) To protect the confidentiality or security or your records pertaining to the consumer, service, product or transaction;

            Protection of Fair Credit Reporting Act.

            Nothing in this part shall be construed to modify, limit or supersede the operation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq., and no inference shall be drawn on the basis of the provisions of this part regarding whether information is transaction or experience information under section 603 of that Act.

            Relation to state laws.
            (a) In general. This part shall not be construed as superseding, altering or affecting any statute, regulation, order or interpretation in effect in any state, except to the extent that such state statute, regulation, order or interpretation is inconsistent with the provisions of this part, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.
            (b) Greater protection under state law. For purposes of this section, a state statute, regulation, order or interpretation is not inconsistent with the provisions of this part if the protection such statute, regulation, order or interpretation affords any person is greater than the protection provided under this part, as determined by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, after consultation with the Commission, on its own motion or upon the petition of any interested party.

            B. General Instructions
            1. How the Model Privacy Form Is Used
            (a) The model form may be used, at the option of a financial institution, including a group of financial institutions that use a common privacy notice, to meet the content requirements of the privacy notice and opt-out notice set forth in §§ 160.6 and 160.7 of this part.
            (b) The model form is a standardized form, including page layout, content, format, style, pagination, and shading. Institutions seeking to obtain the safe harbor through use of the model form may modify it only as described in these Instructions.
            (c) Note that disclosure of certain information, such as assets, income, and information from a consumer reporting agency, may give rise to obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act [15 U.S.C. 1681-1681x] (FCRA), such as a requirement to permit a consumer to opt out of disclosures to affiliates or designation as a consumer reporting agency if disclosures are made to nonaffiliated third parties.
            (d) The word “customer” may be replaced by the word “member” whenever it appears in the model form, as appropriate.
            2. The Contents of the Model Privacy Form
            The model form consists of two pages, which may be printed on both sides of a single sheet of paper, or may appear on two separate pages. Where an institution provides a long list of institutions at the end of the model form in accordance with Instruction C.3(a)(1), or provides additional information in accordance with Instruction C.3(c), and such list or additional information exceeds the space available on page two of the model form, such list or additional information may extend to a third page.

            (1) Date last revised (upper right-hand corner).
            (2) Title.
            (3) Key frame (Why?, What?, How?).
            (4) Disclosure table (“Reasons we can share your personal information”).
            (5) “To limit our sharing” box, as needed, for the financial institution's opt-out information.

            (a) Easily readable type font. Financial institutions that use the model form must use an easily readable type font. While a number of factors together produce easily readable type font, institutions are required to use a minimum of 10-point font (unless otherwise expressly permitted in these Instructions) and sufficient spacing between the lines of type.
            (b) Logo. A financial institution may include a corporate logo on any page of the notice, so long as it does not interfere with the readability of the model form or the space constraints of each page.
            (c) Page size and orientation. Each page of the model form must be printed on paper in portrait orientation, the size of which must be sufficient to meet the layout and minimum font size requirements, with sufficient white space on the top, bottom, and sides of the content.
            (d) Color. The model form must be printed on white or light color paper (such as cream) with black or other contrasting ink color. Spot color may be used to achieve visual interest, so long as the color contrast is distinctive and the color does not detract from the readability of the model form. Logos may also be printed in color.
            (e) Languages. The model form may be translated into languages other than English.
            C. Information Required in the Model Privacy Form

In the middle column, each institution must provide a “Yes” or “No” response that accurately reflects its information sharing policies and practices with respect to the reason listed on the left. In the right column, each institution must provide in each box one of the following three (3) responses, as applicable, that reflects whether a consumer can limit such sharing: “Yes” if it is required to or voluntarily provides an opt-out; “No” if it does not provide an opt-out; or “We don't share” if it answers “No” in the middle column. Only the sixth row (“For our affiliates to market to you”) may be omitted at the option of the institution. See paragraph C.2(d)(6) of this Instruction.
            (d) Specific disclosures and corresponding legal provisions. (1) For our everyday business purposes. This reason incorporates sharing information under §§ 160.14 and 160.15 and with service providers pursuant to § 160.13 of this part other than the purposes specified in paragraphs C.2(d)(2) or C.2(d)(3) of these Instructions.
            (2) For our marketing purposes. This reason incorporates sharing information with service providers by an institution for its own marketing pursuant to § 160.13 of this part. An institution that shares for this reason may choose to provide an opt-out.
            (3) For joint marketing with other financial companies. This reason incorporates sharing information under joint marketing agreements between two or more financial institutions and with any service provider used in connection with such agreements pursuant to § 160.13 of this part. An institution that shares for this reason may choose to provide an opt-out.
            (4) For our affiliates' everyday business purposes—information about transactions and experiences. This reason incorporates sharing information specified in sections 603(d)(2)(A)(i) and (ii) of the FCRA. An institution that shares for this reason may choose to provide an opt-out.
            (5) For our affiliates' everyday business purposes—information about creditworthiness. This reason incorporates sharing information pursuant to section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) of the FCRA. An institution that shares for this reason must provide an opt-out.
            (6) For our affiliates to market to you. This reason incorporates sharing information specified in section 624 of the FCRA. This reason may be omitted from the disclosure table when: the institution does not have affiliates (or does not disclose personal information to its affiliates); the institution's affiliates do not use personal information in a manner that requires an opt-out; or the institution provides the affiliate marketing notice separately. Institutions that include this reason must provide an opt-out of indefinite duration. An institution not required to provide an opt-out under this subparagraph may elect to include this reason in the model form. Note: The CFTC's Regulations do not address the affiliate marketing rule.
            (7) For nonaffiliates to market to you. This reason incorporates sharing described in §§ 160.7 and 160.10(a) of this part. An institution that shares personal information for this reason must provide an opt-out.
            (e) To limit our sharing: A financial institution must include this section of the model form only if it provides an opt-out. The word “choice” may be written in either the singular or plural, as appropriate. Institutions must select one or more of the applicable opt-out methods described: telephone, such as by a toll-free number; a Web site; or use of a mail-in opt-out form. Institutions may include the words “toll-free” before telephone, as appropriate. An institution that allows consumers to opt out online must provide either a specific Web address that takes consumers directly to the opt-out page or a general Web address that provides a clear and conspicuous direct link to the opt-out page. The opt-out choices made available to the consumer who contacts the institution through these methods must correspond accurately to the “Yes” responses in the third column of the disclosure table. In the part titled “Please note” institutions may insert a number that is 30 or greater in the space marked “[30].” Instructions on voluntary or state privacy law opt-out information are in paragraph C.2(g)(5) of these Instructions.
            (f) Questions box. Customer service contact information must be inserted as appropriate, where [phone number] or [Web site] appear. Institutions may elect to provide either a phone number, such as a toll-free number, or a Web address, or both. Institutions may include the words “toll-free” before the telephone number, as appropriate.
            (g) Mail-in opt-out form. Financial institutions must include this mail-in form only if they state in the “To limit our sharing” box that consumers can opt out by mail. The mail-in form must provide opt-out options that correspond accurately to the “Yes” responses in the third column in the disclosure table. Institutions that require customers to provide only name and address may omit the section identified as “[account #].” Institutions that require additional or different information, such as a random opt-out number or a truncated account number, to implement an opt-out election should modify the “[account #]” reference accordingly. This includes institutions that require customers with multiple accounts to identify each account to which the opt-out should apply. An institution must enter its opt-out mailing address: in the far right of this form (see version 3); or below the form (see version 4). The reverse side of the mail-in opt-out form must not include any content of the model form.
            (1) Joint accountholder. Only institutions that provide their joint accountholders the choice to opt out for only one accountholder, in accordance with paragraph C.3(a)(5) of these Instructions, must include in the far left column of the mail-in form the following statement: “If you have a joint account, your choice(s) will apply to everyone on your account unless you mark below. Apply my choice(s) only to me.” The word “choice” may be written in either the singular or plural, as appropriate. Financial institutions that provide insurance products or services, provide this option, and elect to use the model form may substitute the word “policy” for “account” in this statement. Institutions that do not provide this option may eliminate this left column from the mail-in form.
            (2) FCRA Section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) opt-out. If the institution shares personal information pursuant to section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) of the FCRA, it must include in the mail-in opt-out form the following statement: “Do not share information about my creditworthiness with your affiliates for their everyday business purposes.”
            (3) FCRA Section 624 opt-out. If the institution incorporates section 624 of the FCRA in accord with paragraph C.2(d)(6) of these Instructions, it must include in the mail-in opt-out form the following statement: “Do not allow your affiliates to use my personal information to market to me.”
            (4) Nonaffiliate opt-out. If the financial institution shares personal information pursuant to § 160.10(a) of this part, it must include in the mail-in opt-out form the following statement: “Do not share my personal information with nonaffiliates to market their products and services to me.”
            (5) Additional opt-outs. Financial institutions that use the disclosure table to provide opt-out options beyond those required by Federal law must provide those opt-outs in this section of the model form. A financial institution that chooses to offer an opt-out for its own marketing in the mail-in opt-out form must include one of the two following statements: “Do not share my personal information to market to me.” or “Do not use my personal information to market to me.” A financial institution that chooses to offer an opt-out for joint marketing must include the following statement: “Do not share my personal information with other financial institutions to jointly market to me.”
            (h) Barcodes. A financial institution may elect to include a barcode and/or “tagline” (an internal identifier) in 6-point font at the bottom of page one, as needed for information internal to the institution, so long as these do not interfere with the clarity or text of the form.
            
            3. Page Two
            (a) General Instructions for the Questions. Certain of the Questions may be customized as follows:
            (1) “Who is providing this notice?” This question may be omitted where only one financial institution provides the model form and that institution is clearly identified in the title on page one. Two or more financial institutions that jointly provide the model form must use this question to identify themselves as required by § 160.9(f) of this part. Where the list of institutions exceeds four (4) lines, the institution must describe in the response to this question the general types of institutions jointly providing the notice and must separately identify those institutions, in minimum 8-point font, directly following the “Other important information” box, or, if that box is not included in the institution's form, directly following the “Definitions.” The list may appear in a multi-column format.
            (2) “How does [name of financial institution] protect my personal information?” The financial institution may only provide additional information pertaining to its safeguards practices following the designated response to this question. Such information may include information about the institution's use of cookies or other measures it uses to safeguard personal information. Institutions are limited to a maximum of 30 additional words.
            (3) “How does [name of financial institution] collect my personal information?” Institutions must use five (5) of the following terms to complete the bulleted list for this question: Open an account; deposit money; pay your bills; apply for a loan; use your credit or debit card; seek financial or tax advice; apply for insurance; pay insurance premiums; file an insurance claim; seek advice about your investments; buy securities from us; sell securities to us; direct us to buy securities; direct us to sell your securities; make deposits or withdrawals from your account; enter into an investment advisory contract; give us your income information; provide employment information; give us your employment history; tell us about your investment or retirement portfolio; tell us about your investment or retirement earnings; apply for financing; apply for a lease; provide account information; give us your contact information; pay us by check; give us your wage statements; provide your mortgage information; make a wire transfer; tell us who receives the money; tell us where to send the money; show your government-issued ID; show your driver's license; order a commodity futures or option trade. Institutions that collect personal information from their affiliates and/or credit bureaus must include after the bulleted list the following statement: “We also collect your personal information from others, such as credit bureaus, affiliates, or other companies.” Institutions that do not collect personal information from their affiliates or credit bureaus but do collect information from other companies must include the following statement instead: “We also collect your personal information from other companies.” Only institutions that do not collect any personal information from affiliates, credit bureaus, or other companies can omit both statements.
            (4) “Why can't I limit all sharing?” Institutions that describe state privacy law provisions in the “Other important information” box must use the bracketed sentence: “See below for more on your rights under state law.” Other institutions must omit this sentence.
            (5) “What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with someone else?” Only financial institutions that provide opt-out options must use this question. Other institutions must omit this question. Institutions must choose one of the following two statements to respond to this question: “Your choices will apply to everyone on your account.” or “Your choices will apply to everyone on your account—unless you tell us otherwise.” Financial institutions that provide insurance products or services and elect to use the model form may substitute the word “policy” for “account” in these statements.

Examples of the type of information that would fall within the definition of eligibility information include an affiliate's own transaction or experience information, such as information about a consumer's account history with that affiliate, and other information, such as information from credit bureau reports or applications. Eligibility information does not include aggregate or blind data that does not contain personal identifiers such as account numbers, names, or addresses.
          (l) FCRA. The term “FCRA” means the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.).
          (m) Financial product or service. The term “financial product or service” means any product or service that a futures commission merchant, retail foreign exchange dealer, commodity trading advisor, commodity pool operator, introducing broker, major swap participant or swap dealer could offer that is subject to the Commission's jurisdiction.
          (n) GLB Act. The term “GLB Act” means the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (Pub. L. 106-102, 113 Stat. 1338 (1999)).
          (o) Major swap participant. The term “major swap participant” has the same meaning as in section 1a(33) of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 1 et seq., as may be further defined by this title, and includes any person registered as such thereunder.
          (p) Person. The term “person” means any individual, partnership, corporation, trust, estate, cooperative, association, or other entity.
          (q) Pre-existing business relationship. The term “pre-existing business relationship” means a relationship between a person, or a person's licensed agent, and a consumer based on—
          (1) A financial contract between the person and the consumer which is in force on the date on which the consumer is sent a solicitation by this part;
          (2) The purchase, rental, or lease by the consumer of a persons' services or a financial transaction (including holding an active account or policy in force or having another continuing relationship) between the consumer and the person, during the 18-month period immediately preceding the date on which the consumer is sent a solicitation covered by this part; or
          (3) An inquiry or application by the consumer regarding a financial product or service offered by that person during the three-month period immediately preceding the date on which the consumer is sent a solicitation covered by this part.
          (r) Solicitation—(1) In general. The term “solicitation” means the marketing of a financial product or service initiated by an affiliate to a particular consumer that is—

          (i) Based on eligibility information communicated to that covered affiliate by an affiliate that has or previously had the pre-existing business relationship with a consumer as described in this part; and
          (ii) Intended to encourage the consumer to purchase or obtain such financial product or service. A solicitation does not include marketing communications that are directed at the general public.
          (2) Examples. Examples of what communications constitute solicitations include communications such as a telemarketing solicitation, direct mail, or e-mail, when those communications are directed to a specific consumer based on eligibility information. A solicitation does not include communications that are directed at the general public without regard to eligibility information, even if those communications are intended to encourage consumers to purchase financial products and services from the affiliate initiating the communications.
          (s) Swap dealer. The term “swap dealer” has the same meaning as in section 1a(49) of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 1 et seq., as may be further defined by this title, and includes any person registered as such thereunder.
        
        
          Subpart A—Business Affiliate Marketing Rules
          
            § 162.3
            Affiliate marketing opt out and exceptions.
            (a) Initial notice and opt out. A covered affiliate may not use eligibility information about a consumer that the covered affiliate receives from an affiliate with the consumer to make a solicitation for marketing purposes to such consumer unless—
            (1) It is clearly and conspicuously disclosed to the consumer in writing or if the consumer agrees, electronically, in a concise notice that the person may use shared eligibility information about that consumer received from an affiliate to make solicitations for marketing purposes to such consumer;
            (2) The consumer is provided a reasonable opportunity and a reasonable and simple method to opt out, or prohibit the covered affiliate from using eligibility information to make solicitations for marketing purposes to the consumer; and
            (3) The consumer has not opted out.
            (b) Persons responsible for satisfying the notice requirement. The notice required by this section must be provided:
            (1) By an affiliate that has or previously had a pre-existing business relationship with a consumer; or
            (2) As part of a joint notice from two or more members of an affiliated group of companies, provided that at least one of the affiliates on the joint notice has or previously had a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer.
            (c) Exceptions. These proposed regulations would not apply to the following covered affiliate:
            (1) A covered affiliate that has a pre-existing business relationship with a consumer;
            (2) Communications between an employer and employee-consumer (or his or her beneficiary) in connection with an employee benefit plan;
            (3) A covered affiliate that is currently providing services to the consumer;
            (4) If the consumer initiated the communication with the covered affiliate by oral, electronic, or written means;
            (5) If the consumer authorized or requested the covered affiliate's solicitation; or
            (6) If compliance by a person with these regulations would prevent that person's compliance with state insurance laws pertaining to unfair discrimination.
            (d) Making solicitations—(1) When a solicitation occurs. A covered affiliate makes a solicitation for marketing purposes if the person—
            (i) Receives eligibility information from an affiliate;
            (ii) Uses that eligibility information to do one or more of the following:
            (A) Identify the consumer or type of consumer to receive a solicitation;
            (B) Establish criteria used to select the consumer to receive a solicitation about the covered affiliate's financial products or services; or
            (C) Decide which of the services or contracts to market to the consumer or tailor the solicitation to that consumer; and

            (iii) As a result of the covered affiliate's use of the eligibility information, the consumer is provided a solicitation.
            
            (2) Receipt of eligibility information. A covered affiliate may receive eligibility information from an affiliate in various ways, including when the affiliate places that information into a common database that the covered affiliate may access.
            (3) Service providers. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(5) of this section, a covered affiliate receives or uses an affiliate's eligibility information if a service provider acting on the covered affiliate's behalf (regardless of whether such service provider is a third party or an affiliate of the covered affiliate) receives or uses that information in the manner described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (d)(1)(ii) of this section. All relevant facts and circumstances will determine whether a service provider is acting on behalf of a covered affiliate when it receives or uses an affiliate's eligibility information in connection with marketing the covered affiliate's financial products or services.
            (4) Use by an affiliate of its own eligibility information. Unless a covered affiliate uses eligibility information that the covered affiliate receives from an affiliate in the manner described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the covered affiliate does not make a solicitation subject to this subpart:
            (i) Uses its own eligibility information that it obtained in connection with a pre-existing business relationship it has or previously had with the consumer to market the covered affiliate's financial products or services to the consumer; or
            (ii) Directs its service provider to use the affiliate's own eligibility information that it obtained in connection with a pre-existing business relationship it has or previously had with the consumer to market the covered affiliate's financial products or services to the consumer, and the covered affiliate does not communicate directly with the service provider regarding that use.
            (5) Use of eligibility information by a service provider—(i) In general. A covered affiliate does not make a solicitation subject to this subpart if a service provider (including an affiliated or third-party service provider that maintains or accesses a common database that the covered affiliate may access) receives eligibility information from an affiliate that has or previously had a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and uses that eligibility information to market the covered affiliate's financial products or services to the consumer, so long as—
            (A) The affiliate controls access to and use of its eligibility information by the service provider (including the right to establish the specific terms and conditions under which the service provider may use such information to market the covered affiliate's financial products or services);
            (B) The affiliate establishes specific terms and conditions under which the service provider may access and use such affiliate's eligibility information to market the covered affiliate's financial products and services (or those of affiliates generally) to the consumer, such as the identity of the affiliated companies whose financial products or services may be marketed to the consumer by the service provider, the types of financial products or services of affiliated companies that may be marketed, and the number of times the consumer may receive marketing materials, and periodically evaluates the service provider's compliance with those terms and conditions;
            (C) The affiliate requires the service provider to implement reasonable policies and procedures designed to ensure that the service provider uses such affiliate's eligibility information in accordance with the terms and conditions established by such affiliate relating to the marketing of the covered affiliate's financial products or services;
            (D) The affiliate is identified on or with the marketing materials provided to the consumer; and
            (E) The covered affiliate does not directly use its affiliate's eligibility information in the manner described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
            (ii) Writing requirements. (A) The requirements of paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) and (C) of this section must be set forth in a written agreement between the affiliate that has or previously had a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and the service provider; and

            (B) The specific terms and conditions established by the affiliate as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section must be set forth in writing.
            (e) Relation to affiliate-sharing notice and opt out. Nothing in this rulemaking will limit the responsibility of a covered affiliate to comply with the notice and opt-out provisions under other privacy rules under the FCRA, the GLB Act or the CEA.
          
          
            § 162.4
            Scope and duration of opt out.
            (a) Scope of opt-out election—(1) In general. The consumer's election to opt out prohibits any covered affiliate subject to the scope of the opt-out notice from using eligibility information received from another affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer.
            (2) Continuing relationship—(i) In general. If the consumer establishes a continuing relationship with a covered affiliate or its affiliate, an opt-out notice may apply to eligibility information obtained in connection with—
            (A) A single continuing relationship or multiple continuing relationships that the consumer establishes with a covered affiliate or its affiliates, including continuing relationships established subsequent to delivery of the opt-out notice, so long as the notice adequately describes the continuing relationships covered by the opt out; or
            (B) Any other transaction between the consumer and the covered affiliate or its affiliates as described in the notice.
            (ii) Examples of a continuing relationship. A consumer has a continuing relationship with a covered affiliate or its affiliate if:
            (A) The covered affiliate is a futures commission merchant through whom a consumer has opened an account, or that carries the consumer's account on a fully-disclosed basis, or that effects or engages in commodity interest transactions with or for a consumer, even if the covered affiliate does not hold any assets of the consumer;
            (B) The covered affiliate is an introducing broker that solicits or accepts specific orders for trades;
            (C) The covered affiliate is a commodity trading advisor with whom a consumer has a contract or subscription, either written or oral, regardless of whether the advice is standardized, or is based on, or tailored to, the commodity interest or cash market positions or other circumstances or characteristics of the particular consumer;
            (D) The covered affiliate is a commodity pool operator, and accepts or receives from the consumer, funds, securities, or property for the purpose of purchasing an interest in a commodity pool;
            (E) The covered affiliate is a major swap participant that holds securities or other assets as collateral for a loan made to the consumer, even if the covered affiliate did not make the loan or do not affect any transactions on behalf of the consumer; or
            (F) The covered affiliate is a swap dealer that regularly effects or engages in swap transactions with or for a consumer even if the covered affiliate does not hold any assets of the consumer.
            (3) No continuing relationship—(i) In general. If there is no continuing relationship between a consumer and the covered affiliate or its affiliate, and the covered affiliate or its affiliate obtain eligibility information about a consumer in connection with a transaction with the consumer, such as an isolated transaction or a credit application that is denied, an opt-out notice provided to the consumer only applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with that transaction.
            (ii) Examples of no continuing relationship. A consumer does not have a continuing relationship with a covered affiliate or its affiliate if:
            (A) The covered affiliate has acted solely as a “finder” for a futures commission merchant, and the covered affiliate does not solicit or accept specific orders for trades; or
            (B) The covered affiliate has solicited the consumer to participate in a pool or to direct his or her account and he or she has not provided the covered affiliate with funds to participate in a pool or entered into any agreement with the covered affiliate to direct his or her account.
            (4) Menu of alternatives. A consumer may be given the opportunity to choose from a menu of alternatives when electing to prohibit solicitations, such as by electing to prohibit solicitations from certain types of affiliates covered by the opt-out notice but not other types of affiliates covered by the notice, electing to prohibit solicitations based on certain types of eligibility information but not other types of eligibility information, or electing to prohibit solicitations by certain methods of delivery but not other methods of delivery. However, one of the alternatives must allow the consumer to prohibit all solicitations from all of the affiliates that are covered by the notice.
            (5) Special rule for a notice following termination of all continuing relationships. A consumer must be given a new opt-out notice if, after all continuing relationships with the covered affiliate or its affiliate(s) are terminated, the consumer subsequently establishes another continuing relationship with the covered affiliate or its affiliate(s) and the consumer's eligibility information is to be used to make a solicitation. The new opt-out notice must apply, at a minimum, to eligibility information obtained in connection with the new continuing relationship. Consistent with paragraph b of this section, the consumer's decision not to opt out after receiving the new opt-out notice would not override a prior opt-out election by the consumer that applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with a terminated relationship, regardless of whether the new opt-out notice applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with the terminated relationship.
            (b) Duration of opt-out election. An opt-out election must be effective for a period of at least five years beginning when the consumer's opt-out election is received and implemented, unless the consumer subsequently revokes the opt-out election in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically. An opt-out election may be established for a period of more than five years or for an indefinite period unless revoked.
            (c) Time period in which a consumer can opt out. A consumer may opt out at any time.
            (d) No effect on opt-out period. An opt-out period may not be shortened by sending a renewal notice to the consumer before expiration of the opt-out period, even if the consumer does not renew the opt out.
          
          
            § 162.5
            Contents of opt-out notice; consolidated and equivalent notices.
            (a) Contents of the opt-out notice—(1) In general. An opt-out notice must be in writing, be clear and conspicuous, as well as concise, and must accurately disclose the following:
            (i) (A) The name of the affiliate that has or previously had a pre-existing business relationship with a consumer, which is providing the notice; or
            (B) If jointly provided jointly by multiple affiliates and each affiliate shares a common name, then the notice may indicate that it is being provided by multiple companies with the same name or multiple companies in the same group or family of companies. If the affiliates providing the notice do not share a common name, then the notice must either separately identify each affiliate by name or identify each of the common names used by those affiliates;
            (ii) The list of affiliates or types of affiliates whose use of eligibility information is covered by the notice, which may include companies that become affiliates after the notice is provided to the consumer;
            (iii) A general description of the types of eligibility information that may be used to make solicitations to the consumer;
            (iv) A statement that the consumer may elect to limit the use of eligibility information to make solicitations to the consumer;
            (v) A statement that the consumer's election will apply for the specified period of time and, if applicable, that the consumer will be allowed to renew the election once that period expires;
            (vi) If the notice is provided to consumers who have previously elected to opt out, that such consumer does not need to act again until the consumer receives a renewal notice; and
            (vii) A reasonable and simple method for the consumer to opt out.
            (2) Specifying length of time period. If consumer is granted an opt-out period longer than a five-year duration, the opt-out notice must specify the length of the opt-out period.
            (3) No revised notice for extension of opt-out period. The duration of an opt-out period may be increased for a period longer than the period specified in the opt-out notice without having to provide a revised notice of the increase to the consumer.
            (b) Joint relationships. (1) If two or more consumers jointly obtain a financial product or service, a single opt-out notice may be provided to joint consumers.
            (2) Any of the joint consumers may exercise the right to opt out on behalf of each joint consumer.
            (3) The opt-out election notice must explain how an opt-out election by a joint consumer will be treated. That is, the notice should specify whether an opt-out election by a joint consumer will be treated as applying to all of the associated joint consumers, or as applying to each joint consumer separately.
            (4) If the opt-out election notice provides that each joint consumer is permitted to opt out separately, one of the joint consumers must be permitted to opt out on behalf of all of the joint consumers and the joint consumer must be permitted to exercise his or her separate rights to opt out in a single response.
            (5) A covered affiliate cannot require all joint consumers to opt out before implementing any opt-out election.
            (c) Alternative contents. If the consumer is afforded a broader right to opt out of receiving marketing than is required by this subpart, the requirements of this section may be satisfied by providing the consumer with a clear, conspicuous, and concise notice that accurately discloses the consumer's opt-out rights.
            (d) Coordinated and consolidated consumer notices. A notice required by this subpart may be coordinated and consolidated with any other notice or disclosure required to be issued under any other provision of law by the covered affiliate providing the notice, including but not limited to notices in the FCRA or the GLB Act privacy notices.
            (e) Equivalent notices. A notice or disclosure that is equivalent to the notice required by this part in terms of content, and that is provided to a consumer together with a notice required by any other provision of law, satisfies the requirements of this section.
            (f) Model notices. Model notices are provided in appendix A of this part. These notices were meant to facilitate compliance with this subpart; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be interpreted to require persons subject to this part to use the model notices.
          
          
            § 162.6
            Reasonable opportunity to opt out.
            (a) In general. A covered affiliate must not use eligibility information about a consumer that the covered affiliate receives from an affiliate to make a solicitation to such consumer about the covered affiliate's financial products or services, unless the consumer is provided a reasonable opportunity to opt out, as required by this subpart.
            (b) Examples. A reasonable opportunity to opt out under this subpart is:
            (1) If the opt-out notice is mailed to the consumer, the consumer has 30 days from the date the notice is mailed to opt out.
            (2) If the opt-out notice is sent via electronic means to the consumer, the consumer has 30 days from the date the consumer acknowledges receipt to elect to opt out by any reasonable method.
            (3) If the opt-out notice is sent via e-mail (where the consumer has agreed to receive disclosures by e-mail), the consumer is given 30 days after the e-mail is sent to elect to opt out by any reasonable method.
            (4) If the opt-out notice provided to the consumer at the time of an electronic transaction, the consumer is required to decide, as a necessary part of proceeding with the transaction, whether to opt out before completing the transaction.
            (5) If the opt-out notice is provided during an in-person transaction, the consumer is required to decide, as a necessary part of completing the transaction, whether to opt out through a simple process.
            (6) If the opt-out notice is provided in conjunction with other privacy notices required by law, the consumer is allowed to exercise the opt-out election within a reasonable period of time and in the same manner as the opt out under that privacy notice.
          
          
            
            § 162.7
            Reasonable and simple methods of opting out.
            (a) In general. A covered affiliate shall be prohibited from using eligibility information about a consumer received from an affiliate to make a solicitation to the consumer about the covered affiliate's financial products or services, unless the consumer is provided a reasonable and simple method to opt out, as required by this subpart.
            (b) Examples. Reasonable and simple methods of opting out include:
            (1) Designating a check-off box in a prominent position on an opt-out election form;
            (2) Including a reply form and a self-addressed envelope (in a mailing);
            (3) Providing an electronic means, if the consumer agrees, that can be electronically mailed or processed through an Internet Web site;
            (4) Providing a toll-free telephone number; or
            (5) Exercising an opt-out election through whatever means are acceptable under a consolidated privacy notice required under other laws.
            (c) Specific opt-out method. Each consumer may be required to opt out through a specific method, as long as that method is acceptable under this subpart.
          
          
            § 162.8
            Acceptable delivery methods of opt-out notices.
            (a) In general. The opt-out notice must be provided so that each consumer can reasonably be expected to receive actual notice.
            (b) Electronic notices. For opt-out notices provided electronically, the notice may be provided in compliance with either the electronic disclosure provisions in § 1.4 of this title or the provisions in section 101 of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.
            
          
          
            § 162.9
            Renewal of opt out.
            (a) Renewal notice and opt-out requirement—(1) In general. Since the FCRA provides that opt-out elections can expire in a period of no less than five years, an affiliate that has or previously had a pre-existing business relationship with a consumer must provide a renewal notice to the consumer after such time in order to allow its affiliates to make solicitations. After the opt-out election period expires, its affiliates may make solicitations unless:
            (i) The consumer has been given a renewal notice that complies with the requirements of this section and §§ 162.6 through 162.8 of this subpart, and a reasonable opportunity and a reasonable and simple method to renew the opt-out election, and the consumer does not renew the opt out; or
            (ii) An exception in Sec. 162.3(c) of this subpart applies.
            (2) Renewal period. Each opt-out renewal must be effective for a period of at least five years as provided in § 162.4(b) of this subpart.
            (3) Affiliates who may provide the renewal notice. The notice required by this paragraph must be provided:
            (i) By the affiliate that provided the previous opt-out notice, or its successor; or
            (ii) As part of a joint renewal notice from two or more members of an affiliated group of companies, or their successors, that jointly provided the previous opt-out notice.
            (b) Contents of renewal or extension notice. The contents of the renewal notice must include all of the same contents of the initial notices, but also must include:
            (1) A statement that the consumer previously elected to limit the use of certain information to make solicitations to the consumer;
            (2) A statement that the consumer may elect to renew the consumer's previous election; and
            (3) If applicable, a statement that the consumer's election to renew will apply for a specified period of time stated in the notice and that the consumer will be allowed to renew the election once that period expires.
            (c) Timing of renewal notice. Renewal notices must be provided in a reasonable period of time before the expiration of the opt-out election period or any time after the expiration of the opt-out period, but before solicitations that would have been prohibited by the expired opt-out election are made to the consumer.
            (d) No effect on opt-out period. An opt-out period may not be shortened by sending a renewal notice to the consumer before the expiration of the opt-out period, even if the consumer does not renew the opt-out election.

            [Reserved]
          
        
        
          Subpart B—Disposal Rules
          
            § 162.21
            Proper disposal of consumer information.
            (a) In general. Any covered affiliate must adopt must adopt reasonable, written policies and procedures that address administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the protection of consumer information. These written policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to:
            (1) Insure the security and confidentiality of consumer information;
            (2) Protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of consumer information; and
            (3) Protect against unauthorized access to or use of consumer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any consumer.
            (b) Standard. Any covered affiliate under this part who maintains or otherwise possesses consumer information for a business purpose must properly dispose of such information by taking reasonable measures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of the information in connection with its disposal.
            (c) Examples. The following examples are “reasonable” disposal measures for the purposes of this subpart—
            (1) Implementing and monitoring compliance with policies and procedures that require the burning, pulverizing, or shredding of papers containing consumer information so that the information cannot practicably be read or reconstructed;
            (2) Implementing and monitoring compliance with policies and procedures that require the destruction or erasure of electronic media containing consumer information so that the information cannot practically be read or reconstructed; and
            (3) After due diligence, entering into and monitoring compliance with a written contract with another party engaged in the business of record destruction to dispose of consumer information in a manner that is consistent with this rule.

            (c) Periodic identification of covered accounts. Each financial institution or creditor must periodically determine whether it offers or maintains covered accounts.

            (1) The methods it provides to open its accounts;
            (2) The methods it provides to access its accounts; and
            (3) Its previous experiences with identity theft.
            (d) Establishment of an Identity Theft Prevention Program—(1) Program requirement. Each financial institution or creditor that offers or maintains one or more covered accounts must develop and implement a written Identity Theft Prevention Program that is designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of a covered account or any existing covered account. The Identity Theft Prevention Program must be appropriate to the size and complexity of the financial institution or creditor and the nature and scope of its activities.
            (2) Elements of the Identity Theft Prevention Program. The Identity Theft Prevention Program must include reasonable policies and procedures to:
            (i) Identify relevant Red Flags for the covered accounts that the financial institution or creditor offers or maintains, and incorporate those Red Flags into its Identity Theft Prevention Program;

            (ii) Detect Red Flags that have been incorporated into the Identity Theft Prevention Program of the financial institution or creditor;
            (iii) Respond appropriately to any Red Flags that are detected pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section to prevent and mitigate identity theft; and
            (iv) Ensure the Identity Theft Prevention Program (including the Red Flags determined to be relevant) is updated periodically, to reflect changes in risks to customers and to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft.
            (e) Administration of the Identity Theft Prevention Program. Each financial institution or creditor that is required to implement an Identity Theft Prevention Program must provide for the continued administration of the Identity Theft Prevention Program and must:

            (2) Involve the board of directors, an appropriate committee thereof, or a designated employee at the level of senior management in the oversight, development, implementation and administration of the Identity Theft Prevention Program;
            (3) Train staff, as necessary, to effectively implement the Identity Theft Prevention Program; and
            (4) Exercise appropriate and effective oversight of service provider arrangements.
            (f) Guidelines.

            § 162.31
            [Reserved]
          
          
            § 162.32
            Duties of card issuers regarding changes of address.
            (a) Scope. This section applies to a person described in § 162.30(a) that issues a debit or credit card (card issuer).
            (b) Definition of cardholder. For purposes of this section, a cardholder means a consumer who has been issued a credit or debit card.
            (c) Address validation requirements. A card issuer must establish and implement reasonable policies and procedures to assess the validity of a change of address if it receives notification of a change of address for a consumer's debit or credit card account and, within a short period of time afterwards (during at least the first 30 days after it receives such notification), the card issuer receives a request for an additional or replacement card for the same account. Under these circumstances, the card issuer may not issue an additional or replacement card, until, in accordance with its reasonable policies and procedures and for the purpose of assessing the validity of the change of address, the card issuer:
            (1)(i) Notifies the cardholder of the request:
            (A) At the cardholder's former address; or
            (B) By any other means of communication that the card issuer and the cardholder have previously agreed to use; and
            (ii) Provides to the cardholder a reasonable means of promptly reporting incorrect address changes; or
            (2) Otherwise assesses the validity of the change of address in accordance with the policies and procedures the card issuer has established pursuant to § 162.30.
            (d) Alternative timing of address validation. A card issuer may satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section if it validates an address pursuant to the methods in paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section when it receives an address change notification, before it receives a request for an additional or replacement card.
            (e) Form of notice. Any written or electronic notice that the card issuer provides under this paragraph must be clear and conspicuous and provided separately from its regular correspondence with the cardholder.

            Appendix A to Part 162—Sample Clauses
            A. Although use of the model forms is not required, use of the model forms in this appendix (as applicable) complies with the requirement in section 624 of the FCRA for clear, conspicuous, and concise notices.
            B. Certain changes may be made to the language or format of the model forms without losing the protection from liability afforded by use of the model forms. These changes may not be so extensive as to affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the language in the model forms. Persons making such extensive revisions will lose the safe harbor that this appendix provides. Acceptable changes include, for example:
            1. Rearranging the order of the references to “your income”, “your account history”, and “your credit score”.
            2. Substituting other types of information for “income”, “account history”, or “credit score” for accuracy, such as “payment history”, “credit history”, or “claims history”.
            3. Substituting a clearer and more accurate description of the affiliates providing or covered by the notice for phrases such as “the [ABC] group of companies,” including without limitation a statement that the entity providing the notice recently purchased the consumer's account.
            4. Substituting other types of affiliates covered by the notice for “commodity advisor”, “futures clearing merchant”, or “swap dealer” affiliates.
            5. Omitting items that are not accurate or applicable. For example, if a person does not limit the duration of the opt-out period, the notice may omit information about the renewal notice.
            6. Adding a statement informing consumers how much time they have to opt out before shared eligibility information may be used to make solicitations to them.
            7. Adding a statement that the consumer may exercise the right to opt out at any time.
            8. Adding the following statement, if accurate: “If you previously opted out, you do not need to do so again.”
            9. Providing a place on the form for the consumer to fill in identifying information, such as his or her name and address.

            Pt. 162, App. B
            Appendix B to Part 162—Interagency Guidelines on Identity Theft Detection, Prevention, and Mitigation
            Section 162.30 requires each financial institution or creditor that offers or maintains one or more covered accounts, as defined in § 162.30(b)(3), to develop and provide for the continued administration of a written Identity Theft Prevention Program to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of a covered account or any existing covered account. These guidelines are intended to assist financial institutions and creditors in the formulation and maintenance of an Identity Theft Prevention Program that satisfies the requirements of § 162.30.
            I. The Identity Theft Prevention Program
            In designing its Identity Theft Prevention Program, a financial institution or creditor may incorporate, as appropriate, its existing policies, procedures, and other arrangements that control reasonably foreseeable risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft.
            II. Identifying Relevant Red Flags
            (a) Risk factors. A financial institution or creditor should consider the following factors in identifying relevant Red Flags for covered accounts, as appropriate:
            (1) The types of covered accounts it offers or maintains;
            (2) The methods it provides to open its covered accounts;
            (3) The methods it provides to access its covered accounts; and
            (4) Its previous experiences with identity theft.
            (b) Sources of Red Flags. Financial institutions and creditors should incorporate relevant Red Flags from sources such as:
            (1) Incidents of identity theft that the financial institution or creditor has experienced;
            (2) Methods of identity theft that the financial institution or creditor has identified that reflect changes in identity theft risks; and
            (3) Applicable supervisory guidance.
            (c) Categories of Red Flags. The Identity Theft Prevention Program should include relevant Red Flags from the following categories, as appropriate. Examples of Red Flags from each of these categories are appended as Supplement A to this Appendix B.
            (1) Alerts, notifications, or other warnings received from consumer reporting agencies or service providers, such as fraud detection services;
            (2) The presentation of suspicious documents;
            (3) The presentation of suspicious personal identifying information, such as a suspicious address change;
            (4) The unusual use of, or other suspicious activity related to, a covered account; and
            (5) Notice from customers, victims of identity theft, law enforcement authorities, or other persons regarding possible identity theft in connection with covered accounts held by the financial institution or creditor.
            III. Detecting Red Flags
            The Identity Theft Prevention Program's policies and procedures should address the detection of Red Flags in connection with the opening of covered accounts and existing covered accounts, such as by:
            (a) Obtaining identifying information about, and verifying the identity of, a person opening a covered account; and
            (b) Authenticating customers, monitoring transactions, and verifying the validity of change of address requests, in the case of existing covered accounts.
            IV. Preventing and Mitigating Identity Theft
            The Identity Theft Prevention Program's policies and procedures should provide for appropriate responses to the Red Flags the financial institution or creditor has detected that are commensurate with the degree of risk posed. In determining an appropriate response, a financial institution or creditor should consider aggravating factors that may heighten the risk of identity theft, such as a data security incident that results in unauthorized access to a customer's account records held by the financial institution or creditor, or third party, or notice that a customer has provided information related to a covered account held by the financial institution or creditor to someone fraudulently claiming to represent the financial institution or creditor or to a fraudulent Internet Web site. Appropriate responses may include the following:
            (a) Monitoring a covered account for evidence of identity theft;
            (b) Contacting the customer;
            (c) Changing any passwords, security codes, or other security devices that permit access to a covered account;
            (d) Reopening a covered account with a new account number;
            (e) Not opening a new covered account;
            (f) Closing an existing covered account;
            (g) Not attempting to collect on a covered account or not selling a covered account to a debt collector;
            (h) Notifying law enforcement; or

            (i) Determining that no response is warranted under the particular circumstances.
            
            V. Updating the Identity Theft Prevention Program
            Financial institutions and creditors should update the Identity Theft Prevention Program (including the Red Flags determined to be relevant) periodically, to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft, based on factors such as:
            (a) The experiences of the financial institution or creditor with identity theft;
            (b) Changes in methods of identity theft;
            (c) Changes in methods to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft;
            (d) Changes in the types of accounts that the financial institution or creditor offers or maintains; and
            (e) Changes in the business arrangements of the financial institution or creditor, including mergers, acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, and service provider arrangements.
            VI. Methods for Administering the Identity Theft Prevention Program
            (a) Oversight of Identity Theft Prevention Program. Oversight by the board of directors, an appropriate committee of the board, or a designated senior management employee should include:
            (1) Assigning specific responsibility for the Identity Theft Prevention Program's implementation;
            (2) Reviewing reports prepared by staff regarding compliance by the financial institution or creditor with § 162.30; and
            (3) Approving material changes to the Identity Theft Prevention Program as necessary to address changing identity theft risks.
            (b) Reports. (1) In general. Staff of the financial institution or creditor responsible for development, implementation, and administration of its Identity Theft Prevention Program should report to the board of directors, an appropriate committee of the board, or a designated senior management employee, at least annually, on compliance by the financial institution or creditor with § 162.30.
            (2) Contents of report. The report should address material matters related to the Identity Theft Prevention Program and evaluate issues such as: The effectiveness of the policies and procedures of the financial institution or creditor in addressing the risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of covered accounts and with respect to existing covered accounts; service provider arrangements; significant incidents involving identity theft and management's response; and recommendations for material changes to the Identity Theft Prevention Program.
            (c) Oversight of service provider arrangements. Whenever a financial institution or creditor engages a service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more covered accounts the financial institution or creditor should take steps to ensure that the activity of the service provider is conducted in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft. For example, a financial institution or creditor could require the service provider by contract to have policies and procedures to detect relevant Red Flags that may arise in the performance of the service provider's activities, and either report the Red Flags to the financial institution or creditor, or to take appropriate steps to prevent or mitigate identity theft.
            VII. Other Applicable Legal Requirements
            Financial institutions and creditors should be mindful of other related legal requirements that may be applicable, such as:
            (a) For financial institutions and creditors that are subject to 31 U.S.C. 5318(g), filing a Suspicious Activity Report in accordance with applicable law and regulation;
            (b) Implementing any requirements under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-1(h) regarding the circumstances under which credit may be extended when the financial institution or creditor detects a fraud or active duty alert;
            (c) Implementing any requirements for furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2, for example, to correct or update inaccurate or incomplete information, and to not report information that the furnisher has reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate; and
            (d) Complying with the prohibitions in 15 U.S.C. 1681m on the sale, transfer, and placement for collection of certain debts resulting from identity theft.
            Supplement A to Appendix B
            In addition to incorporating Red Flags from the sources recommended in section II(b) of the Guidelines in Appendix B of this part, each financial institution or creditor may consider incorporating into its Identity Theft Prevention Program, whether singly or in combination, Red Flags from the following illustrative examples in connection with covered accounts:
            Alerts, Notifications or Warnings From a Consumer Reporting Agency
            1. A fraud or active duty alert is included with a consumer report.
            2. A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of credit freeze in response to a request for a consumer report.

            3. A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of address discrepancy, as defined in Sec. 603(f) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a(f)).
            
            4. A consumer report indicates a pattern of activity that is inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an applicant or customer, such as:
            a. A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
            b. An unusual number of recently established credit relationships;
            c. A material change in the use of credit, especially with respect to recently established credit relationships; or
            d. An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
            Suspicious Documents
            5. Documents provided for identification appear to have been altered or forged.
            6. The photograph or physical description on the identification is not consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the identification.
            7. Other information on the identification is not consistent with information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer presenting the identification.
            8. Other information on the identification is not consistent with readily accessible information that is on file with the financial institution or creditor, such as a signature card or a recent check.
            9. An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives the appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.
            Suspicious Personal Identifying Information
            10. Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when compared against external information sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For example:
            a. The address does not match any address in the consumer report; or
            b. The Social Security Number (SSN) has not been issued, or is listed on the Social Security Administration's Death Master File.
            11. Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and date of birth.
            12. Personal identifying information provided is associated with known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For example:
            a. The address on an application is the same as the address provided on a fraudulent application; or
            b. The phone number on an application is the same as the number provided on a fraudulent application.
            13. Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For example:
            a. The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or a prison; or
            b. The phone number is invalid, or is associated with a pager or answering service.
            14. The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons opening an account or other customers.
            15. The address or telephone number provided is the same as or similar to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large number of other persons opening accounts or by other customers.
            16. The person opening the covered account or the customer fails to provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in response to notification that the application is incomplete.
            17. Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with personal identifying information that is on file with the financial institution or creditor.
            18. For financial institutions or creditors that use challenge questions, the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot provide authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet or consumer report.
            Unusual Use of, or Suspicious Activity Related to, the Covered Account
            19. Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered account, the institution or creditor receives a request for a new, additional, or replacement means of accessing the account or for the addition of an authorized user on the account.
            20. A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly associated with known patterns of fraud. For example:

            a. The majority of available credit is used for cash advances or merchandise that is easily convertible to cash (e.g., electronics equipment or jewelry); or
            b. The customer fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments.
            21. A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:
            a. Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments;
            b. A material increase in the use of available credit;
            c. A material change in purchasing or spending patterns;
            d. A material change in electronic fund transfer patterns in connection with a deposit account; or
            e. A material change in telephone call patterns in connection with a cellular phone account.

            22. A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).
            23. Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the customer's covered account.
            24. The financial institution or creditor is notified that the customer is not receiving paper account statements.
            25. The financial institution or creditor is notified of unauthorized charges or transactions in connection with a customer's covered account.
            Notice From Customers, Victims of Identity Theft, Law Enforcement Authorities, or Other Persons Regarding Possible Identity Theft in Connection With Covered Accounts Held by the Financial Institution or Creditor
            26. The financial institution or creditor is notified by a customer, a victim of identity theft, a law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft.

          § 165.1
          General.
          Section 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act, entitled “Commodity Whistleblower Incentives and Protection,” requires the Commission to pay awards, subject to certain limitations and conditions, to whistleblowers who voluntarily provide the Commission with original information about violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. This part 165 describes the whistleblower program that the Commission intends to establish to implement the provisions of Section 23, and explains the procedures the whistleblower will need to follow in order to be eligible for an award. Whistleblowers should read these procedures carefully, because the failure to take certain required steps within the time frames described in this part may result in disqualification from receiving an award. Unless expressly provided for in this part, no person is authorized to make any offer or promise, or otherwise to bind the Commission with respect to the payment of any award or the amount thereof.
        
        
          § 165.2
          Definitions.
          As used in this part:
          (a) Action. The term “action” generally means a single captioned judicial or administrative proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing:
          (1) For purposes of making an award under § 165.7, the Commission will treat as a Commission action two or more administrative or judicial proceedings brought by the Commission if these proceedings arise out of the same nucleus of operative facts; or

          (2) For purposes of determining the payment on an award under § 165.14, the Commission will deem as part of the Commission action upon which the award was based any subsequent Commission proceeding that, individually, results in a monetary sanction of $1,000,000 or less, and that arises out of the same nucleus of operative facts.
          (b) Aggregate amount. The phrase “aggregate amount” means the total amount of an award granted to one or more whistleblowers pursuant to § 165.8.
          (c) Analysis. The term “analysis” means the whistleblower's examination and evaluation of information that may be generally available, but which reveals information that is not generally known or available to the public.
          (d) Collected by the Commission. The phrase “collected by the Commission” refers to any funds received, and confirmed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, in satisfaction of part or all of a civil monetary penalty, disgorgement obligation, or fine owed to the Commission.
          (e) Covered judicial or administrative action. The phrase “covered judicial or administrative action” means any judicial or administrative action brought by the Commission under the Commodity Exchange Act whose successful resolution results in monetary sanctions exceeding $1,000,000.
          (f) Fund. The term “Fund” means the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Customer Protection Fund.
          (g) Independent knowledge. The phrase “independent knowledge” means factual information in the whistleblower's possession that is not generally known or available to the public. The whistleblower may gain independent knowledge from the whistleblower's experiences, communications and observations in the whistleblower's personal business or social interactions. The Commission will not consider the whistleblower's information to be derived from the whistleblower's independent knowledge if the whistleblower obtained the information:
          (1) From sources generally available to the public such as corporate filings and the media, including the Internet;
          (2) Through a communication that was subject to the attorney-client privilege, unless the disclosure is otherwise permitted by the applicable federal or state attorney conduct rules;
          (3) In connection with the legal representation of a client on whose behalf the whistleblower, or the whistleblower's employer or firm, have been providing services, and the whistleblower seek to use the information to make a whistleblower submission for the whistleblower's own benefit, unless disclosure is authorized by the applicable federal or state attorney conduct rules;
          (4) Because the whistleblower was an officer, director, trustee, or partner of an entity and another person informed the whistleblower of allegations of misconduct, or the whistleblower learned the information in connection with the entity's processes for identifying, reporting, and addressing possible violations of law;
          (5) Because the whistleblower was an employee whose principal duties involved compliance or internal audit responsibilities; or
          (6) By a means or in a manner that is determined by a United States court to violate applicable Federal or state criminal law.
          (7) Exceptions. Paragraphs (g)(4) and (5) of this section shall not apply if:
          (i) The whistleblower has a reasonable basis to believe that disclosure of the information to the Commission is necessary to prevent the relevant entity from engaging in conduct that is likely to cause substantial injury to the financial interest or property of the entity or investors;
          (ii) The whistleblower has a reasonable basis to believe that the relevant entity is engaging in conduct that will impede an investigation of the misconduct; or
          (iii) At least 120 days have elapsed since the whistleblower provided the information to the relevant entity's audit committee, chief legal officer, chief compliance officer (or their equivalents), or the whistleblower's supervisor, or since the whistleblower received the information, if the whistleblower received it under circumstances indicating that the entity's audit committee, chief legal officer, chief compliance officer (or their equivalents), or the whistleblower's supervisor was already aware of the information.
          (h) Independent analysis. The phrase “independent analysis” means the whistleblower's own analysis, whether done alone or in combination with others.
          (i) Information that led to successful enforcement. The Commission will consider that the whistleblower provided original information that led to the successful enforcement of a judicial or administrative action, or related action, in the following circumstances:
          (1) The whistleblower gave the Commission original information that was sufficiently specific, credible, and timely to cause the Commission staff to commence an examination, open an investigation, reopen an investigation that the Commission had closed, or to inquire concerning different conduct as part of a current examination or investigation, and the Commission brought a successful judicial or administrative action based in whole or in part on conduct that was the subject of the whistleblower's original information; or
          (2) The whistleblower gave the Commission original information about conduct that was already under examination or investigation by the Commission, the Congress, any other authority of the federal government, a state Attorney General or securities regulatory authority, any registered entity, registered futures association, or self-regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)), foreign futures authority, or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (except in cases where the whistleblower was an original source of this information as defined in paragraph (l) of this section), and the whistleblower's submission significantly contributed to the success of the action.
          (3) The whistleblower reported original information through an entity's internal whistleblower, legal, or compliance procedures for reporting allegations of possible violations of law before or at the same time the whistleblower reported them to the Commission; the entity later provided the whistleblower's information to the Commission, or provided results of an audit or investigation initiated in whole or in part in response to information the whistleblower reported to the entity; and the information the entity provided to the Commission satisfies either paragraph (i)(1) or (2) of this section. Under this paragraph (i)(3), the whistleblower must also submit the same information to the Commission in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 165.3 within 180 days of providing it to the entity.
          (j) Monetary sanctions. The phrase “monetary sanctions,” when used with respect to any judicial or administrative action, or related action, means—
          (1) Any monies, including penalties, disgorgement, restitution, and interest ordered to be paid; and
          (2) Any monies deposited into a disgorgement fund or other fund pursuant to section 308(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7246(b)) as a result of such action or any settlement of such action.
          (k) Original information. The phrase “original information” means information that—
          (1) Is derived from the independent knowledge or independent analysis of a whistleblower;
          (2) Is not already known to the Commission from any other source, unless the whistleblower is the original source of the information;
          (3) Is not exclusively derived from an allegation made in a judicial or administrative hearing, in a governmental report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, unless the whistleblower is a source of the information; and
          (4) Is submitted to the Commission for the first time after July 21, 2010 (the date of enactment of the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010).
          (5) Original information shall not lose its status as original information solely because the whistleblower submitted such information prior to October 24, 2011, provided such information was submitted after July 21, 2010, the date of enactment of the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010. In order to be eligible for an award, a whistleblower who submits original information to the Commission after July 21, 2010, but prior to October 24, 2011, must comply with the procedure set forth in § 165.3(d).
          (l) Original source. The whistleblower must satisfy the whistleblower's status as the original source of information to the Commission's satisfaction.
          (1) Information obtained from another source. The Commission will consider the whistleblower to be an “original source” of the same information that the Commission obtains from another source if the information the whistleblower provide satisfies the definition of original information and the other source obtained the information from the whistleblower or the whistleblower's representative.
          (i) In order to be considered an original source of information that the Commission receives from Congress, any other federal, state or local authority, a foreign futures authority, any registered entity, registered futures association, or any self-regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)), the whistleblower must have voluntarily given such authorities the information within the meaning of this part. In determining whether the whistleblower is the original source of information, the Commission may seek assistance and confirmation from one of the other entities or authorities described in this paragraph (l)(1)(i).
          (ii) In the event that the whistleblower claims to be the original source of information that an authority or another entity, other than as set forth in paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section, provided to the Commission, the Commission may seek assistance and confirmation from such authority or other entity.
          (2) Information first provided to another authority or person. If the whistleblower provides information to Congress, any other federal, state, or local authority, a foreign futures authority, a registered entity, a registered futures association, a self-regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)), or to any of the persons described in paragraphs (g)(4) and (5) of this section, and the whistleblower, within 180 days, makes a submission to the Commission pursuant to § 165.3, as the whistleblower must do in order for the whistleblower to be eligible to be considered for an award, then, for purposes of evaluating the whistleblower's claim to an award under § 165.7, the Commission will consider that the whistleblower provided original information as of the date of the whistleblower's original disclosure, report, or submission to one of these other authorities or persons. The whistleblower must establish the whistleblower's status as the original source of such information, as well as the effective date of any prior disclosure, report, or submission, to the Commission's satisfaction. The Commission may seek assistance and confirmation from the other authority or person in making this determination.
          (3) Information already known by the Commission. If the Commission already knows some information about a matter from other sources at the time the whistleblower makes the whistleblower's submission, and the whistleblower is not an original source of that information, as described above, the Commission will consider the whistleblower an “original source” of any information the whistleblower separately provides that is original information that materially adds to the information that the Commission already possesses.
          (m) Related action. The phrase “related action,” when used with respect to any judicial or administrative action brought by the Commission under the Commodity Exchange Act, means any judicial or administrative action brought by an entity listed in § 165.11(a) that is based upon the original information voluntarily submitted by a whistleblower to the Commission pursuant to § 165.3 that led to the successful resolution of the Commission action.
          (n) Successful resolution. The phrase “successful resolution,” when used with respect to any judicial or administrative action brought by the Commission under the Commodity Exchange Act, includes any settlement of such action or final judgment in favor of the Commission. It shall also have the same meaning as “successful enforcement.”
          (o) Voluntary submission or voluntarily submitted. (1) The phrase “voluntary submission” or “voluntarily submitted” within the context of submission of original information to the Commission under this part, shall mean the provision of information made prior to any request from the Commission, Congress, any other federal or state authority, the Department of Justice, a registered entity, a registered futures association, or a self-regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)) to the whistleblower or anyone representing the whistleblower (such as an attorney) about a matter to which the information in the whistleblower's submission is relevant. If the Commission or any of these other authorities makes a request, inquiry, or demand to the whistleblower or the whistleblower's representative first, the whistleblower's submission will not be considered voluntary, and the whistleblower will not be eligible for an award, even if the whistleblower's response is not compelled by subpoena or other applicable law. For purposes of this paragraph (o), the whistleblower will be considered to have received a request, inquiry or demand if documents or information from the whistleblower is within the scope of a request, inquiry, or demand that the whistleblower's employer receives, unless, after receiving the documents or information from the whistleblower, the whistleblower's employer fails to provide the whistleblower's documents or information to the requesting authority in a timely manner.
          (2) In addition, the whistleblower's submission will not be considered voluntary if the whistleblower is under a pre-existing legal or contractual duty to report the violations that are the subject of the whistleblower's original information to the Commission, Congress, any other federal or state authority, the Department of Justice, a registered entity, a registered futures association, or a self-regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)), or a duty that arises out of a judicial or administrative order.
          (p) Whistleblower(s). (1) The term “whistleblower” or “whistleblowers” means any individual, or two (2) or more individuals acting jointly, who provides information relating to a potential violation of the Commodity Exchange Act to the Commission, in the manner established by § 165.3. A company or another entity is not eligible to be a whistleblower.
          (2) Prohibition against retaliation. The anti-retaliation protections under Section 23(h) of the Commodity Exchange Act apply whether or not the whistleblower satisfies the requirements, procedures and conditions to qualify for an award. For purposes of the anti-retaliation protections afforded by Section 23(h)(1)(A)(i) of the Commodity Exchange Act, the whistleblower is a whistleblower if:
          (i) The whistleblower possess a reasonable belief that the information the whistleblower is providing relates to a possible violation of the CEA, or the rules or regulations thereunder, that has occurred, is ongoing, or is about to occur; and
          (ii) The whistleblower provides that information in a manner described in § 165.3.
          [76 FR 53200, Aug. 25, 2011, as amended at 82 FR 24497, May 30, 2017]
        
        
          § 165.3
          Procedures for submitting original information.
          (a) A whistleblower will need to submit the whistleblower's information to the Commission. A whistleblower may submit the whistleblower's information:

          (1) By completing and submitting a Form TCR online and submitting it electronically through the Commission's Web site at http://www.cftc.gov, or the Commission's Whistleblower Program Web site at www.whistleblower.gov; or
          (2) By completing the Form TCR and mailing or faxing the form to the Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581, Fax (202) 418-5975.

          (b) Further, to be eligible for an award, the whistleblower must declare under penalty of perjury at the time the whistleblower submits the whistleblower's information pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section that the whistleblower's information is true and correct to the best of the whistleblower's knowledge and belief.
          
          (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, if the whistleblower submitted the whistleblower's original information to the Commission anonymously, then the whistleblower's identity must be disclosed to the Commission and verified in a form and manner acceptable to the Commission consistent with the procedure set forth in § 165.7(c) prior to Commission's payment of any award.
          (d) If the whistleblower submitted original information in writing to the Commission after July 21, 2010 (the date of enactment of the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010) but before the effective date of these rules, the whistleblower will be eligible for an award only in the event that the whistleblower provided the original information to the Commission in a format or manner other than that described in paragraph (a) of this section, the whistleblower submits a completed Form TCR within 120 days of the effective date of these rules and otherwise follows the procedures set forth above in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

          § 165.4
          Confidentiality.
          (a) In general. Section 23(h)(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act requires that the Commission not disclose information that could reasonably be expected to reveal the identity of a whistleblower, except that the Commission may disclose such information in the following circumstances, in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a):
          (1) When disclosure is required to a defendant or respondent in connection with a public proceeding that the Commission institutes or in another public proceeding that is filed by an authority to which the Commission provides the information, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section; or
          (2) When the Commission determines that it is necessary to accomplish the purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act and to protect customers, it may provide whistleblower information, without the loss of its status as confidential whistleblower information in the hands of the Commission, to: The Department of Justice; an appropriate department or agency of the Federal Government, acting within the scope of its jurisdiction; a registered entity, registered futures association, or a self-regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)); a State attorney general in connection with a criminal investigation; any appropriate State department or agency, acting within the scope of its jurisdiction; or a foreign futures authority; and, as set forth in section 23(h)(2)(C) of the Commodity Exchange Act, each such entity is required to maintain the information as confidential in accordance with the requirements of section 23(h)(2)(A) of the Commodity Exchange Act.

          [76 FR 53200, Aug. 25, 2011, as amended at 82 FR 24498, May 30, 2017]
        
        
          § 165.7
          Procedures for award applications in Commission actions and related actions, and Commission award determinations.

          (a) Whenever a Commission judicial or administrative action results in monetary sanctions totaling more than $1,000,000 (i.e., a covered judicial or administrative action) the Commission will publish on the Commission's Web site a “Notice of Covered Action.” Such Notice of Covered Action will be published subsequent to the entry of a final judgment or order that alone, or collectively with other judgments or orders previously entered in the Commission covered administrative or judicial action, exceeds $1,000,000 in monetary sanctions. The Commission will not contact whistleblower claimants directly as to Notices of Covered Actions; prospective claimants should monitor the Commission Web site for such Notices. A whistleblower claimant will have 90 days from the date of the Notice of Covered Action to file a claim for an award based on that action, or the claim will be barred.

          (b)(1) To file a claim for a whistleblower award, the whistleblower must file Form WB-APP, Application for Award for Original Information Provided Pursuant to Section 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act. The whistleblower must sign this form as the claimant and submit it to the Commission by mail or fax to Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street NW., Washington, DC 20581, Fax (202) 418-5975, or by completing and submitting the Form WB-APP online and submitting it electronically through the Commission's Web site at https://www.cftc.gov or the Commission's Whistleblower Program Web site at https://www.whistleblower.gov.
          
          (2) The Form WB-APP, including any attachments, must be received by the Commission within 90 calendar days of the date of the Notice of Covered Action or 90 calendar days following the date of a final judgment in a Related Action (or if the final judgment in a Related Action was issued prior to the action meeting the definition of Related Action, within 90 calendar days following the date the action satisfied the definition of Related Action, except in the circumstances described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section). One Form WB-APP may be filed in response to both a Notice of Covered Action and final judgment in a Related Action if the relevant time periods are applicable.
          (3) If a covered judicial or administrative action and Related Action have different final judgment dates or if there is no covered judicial or administrative action connected to a Related Action, a claimant, who wishes to file a claim for an award in both a covered judicial or administrative action and a Related Action, or in a Related Action that does not have a connected covered judicial or administrative action, must follow one of the following procedures depending on that claimant's particular situation.
          (i) If a final judgment imposing monetary sanctions in a Related Action has not been entered at the time the claimant submits a claim for an award in connection with a covered judicial or administrative action, the claimant must submit the claim for the Related Action on Form WB-APP within ninety (90) calendar days following the date of issuance of a final judgment in the Related Action.
          (ii) If a final judgment in a Related Action has been entered and a Notice of Covered Action for a related covered judicial or administrative action has not been published, a claimant for an award in both the covered judicial or administrative action and Related Action may submit the claims for both the Related Action and the covered judicial or administrative action within ninety (90) days of the date of the Notice of Covered Action. The claims may be submitted on the same Form WB-APP.

          (iii) If there is a final judgment in a Related Action that relates to a judicial or administrative action brought by the Commission under the Commodity Exchange Act that is not a covered judicial or administrative action, and therefore there is no Notice of Covered Action, a claimant for an award in connection with the Related Action must submit the claim in connection with the Related Action on Form WB-APP within ninety (90) calendar days following either:
          (A) The date of issuance of a final judgment in the Related Action, if that date is after the date of issuance of the final judgment in the related Commission judicial or administrative action; or

          (B) The date of issuance of the final judgment in the related Commission judicial or administrative action, i.e., the date the Related Action becomes a Related Action, if the date of issuance of the final judgment in the Related Action precedes the final judgment in the related Commission judicial or administrative action.
          (c) If the whistleblower provided the whistleblower's original information to the Commission anonymously pursuant to §§ 165.3 and 165.4 and:
          (1) The whistleblower is making the whistleblower's claim for a whistleblower award on a disclosed basis, the whistleblower must disclose the whistleblower's identity on the Form WB-APP. The whistleblower's identity must be verified in a form and manner that is acceptable to the Commission prior to the payment of any award; or
          (2) The whistleblower is making the whistleblower's claim for a whistleblower award on an anonymous basis, the whistleblower must be represented by counsel. The whistleblower must provide the whistleblower's counsel with a completed Form WB-APP that is signed by the whistleblower by no later than the date upon which the whistleblower's counsel submits to the Commission a copy of the Form WB-APP that does not disclose the whistleblower's identity and is signed solely by the whistleblower's counsel. In addition, the whistleblower's counsel must retain the signed original of the whistleblower's Form WB-APP in counsel's records. Upon request of the Commission staff, whistleblower's counsel must produce to the Commission the whistleblower's signed original WB-APP and the whistleblower's identity must be verified in a form and manner that is acceptable to the Commission prior to the payment of any award.
          (d) A claimant may withdraw a Form WB-APP by submitting a written request to the Whistleblower Office at any time during the review process.
          (e)(1) The Whistleblower Office may issue a Proposed Final Disposition for award applications that do not relate to a Notice of Covered Action, a final judgment in a Related Action, or a previously filed Form TCR without presentation of the award claim to the staff designated by the Director of the Division of Enforcement under § 165.15(a)(2) (“Claims Review Staff”). In such instances, the Whistleblower Office will inform the award claimant in writing that the claim does not relate to a Notice of Covered Action, a final judgment in a Related Action, or a previously filed Form TCR and will be rejected unless the claimant provides additional information. The claimant will have 30 days from the date of the written notice to respond and to correct the identified deficiencies. If the claimant does not respond in 30 days or if the response does not include information showing that the WB-APP relates to a Notice of Covered Action, a final judgment in a Related Action, or a previously filed Form TCR the Whistleblower Office will issue a Proposed Final Disposition. The claimant's failure to submit a timely response to the written notice from the Whistleblower Office will constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and the claimant will be prohibited from pursuing an appeal under § 165.13.

          (2) The Whistleblower Office will notify the Claims Review Staff of any Proposed Final Disposition under this paragraph (e). Within thirty (30) calendar days thereafter, any member of the Claims Review Staff may request that the Proposed Final Disposition be reviewed by the Claims Review Staff. If no member of the Claims Review Staff requests such a review within the 30-day period, then the Proposed Final Disposition will become the Final Order of the Commission. In the event that a member of the Claims Review Staff requests a review, the Claims Review Staff will review the record that the Whistleblower Office relied upon in making its determination and either remand to the Whistleblower Office for further action or issue a Final Order of the Commission, which could consist of the Proposed Final Disposition.
          (f)(1) In connection with each individual covered judicial or administrative action or final judgment in a Related Action, for which an award application is submitted, once the time for filing any appeals of the covered judicial or administrative action or the final judgment in the Related Action has expired (or, where an appeal is filed of the covered judicial or administrative action, or the final judgment in a Related Action, as applicable, and concluded), the Claims Review Staff designated under § 165.15(a)(2) will evaluate all timely whistleblower award claims submitted on Form WB-APP in response to a Notice of Covered Action, referenced in paragraph (a) of this section, or final judgment in a Related Action in accordance with the criteria set forth in this part.
          (2) The Whistleblower Office may require that the claimant provide additional information relating to the claimant's eligibility for an award or satisfaction of any of the conditions for an award, as set forth in § 165.5(b)(2). The Whistleblower Office may also request additional information from the claimant in connection with the claim for an award in a Related Action to demonstrate that the claimant directly (or through the Commission) voluntarily provided the governmental agency, regulatory authority or self-regulatory organization the original information that led to the Commission's successful covered action, and that the information provided by the claimant led to the successful enforcement of the Related Action. The Whistleblower Office may also, in its discretion, seek assistance and confirmation from the other agency in making this determination.
          (g)(1) Following Claims Review Staff evaluation, the Claims Review Staff will issue a Preliminary Determination setting forth a preliminary assessment as to whether the claim should be granted or denied and, if granted, setting forth the proposed award percentage amount. The Whistleblower Office will send a copy of the Preliminary Determination to the claimant.
          (2) The claimant may contest the Preliminary Determination made by the Claims Review Staff by submitting a written response to the Whistleblower Office setting forth the grounds for the claimant's objection to either the denial of an award or the proposed amount of an award. The response must be in the form and manner that the Whistleblower Office shall require. The claimant may also include documentation or other evidentiary support for the grounds advanced in the claimant's response. The claimant may also request a meeting with the Whistleblower Office within the timeframes provided in this paragraph (g), however such meetings are not required, and the Whistleblower Office may in its sole discretion deny the request.
          (i) Before determining whether to contest a Preliminary Determination, the claimant may, within thirty (30) days of the date of the Preliminary Determination, request that the Whistleblower Office make available for the claimant's review the materials from among those set forth in § 165.10 that formed the basis of the Claims Review Staff's Preliminary Determination.
          (ii) If the claimant decides to contest the Preliminary Determination, the claimant must submit the claimant's written response and supporting materials setting forth the grounds for the claimant's objection to either the denial of an award or the proposed amount of an award within sixty (60) calendar days of the date of the Preliminary Determination, or if a request to review materials used to make a Preliminary Determination is made pursuant to paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, then within sixty (60) calendar days of the Whistleblower Office making those materials available for the claimant's review. The claimant also may request a meeting with the Whistleblower Office within those same sixty (60) calendar days. However, such meetings are not required and the Whistleblower Office may in its sole discretion decline the request.

          (h) If the claimant fails to submit a timely response pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, then the Preliminary Determination will become the Final Order of the Commission (except where the Preliminary Determination recommended an award, in which case the Preliminary Determination will be deemed a Proposed Final Determination for purposes of paragraph (j) of this section). The claimant's failure to submit a timely response contesting a Preliminary Determination will constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and the claimant will be prohibited from pursuing an appeal under § 165.13.
          (i) If the claimant submits a timely response under paragraph (g) of this section, then the Claims Review Staff will consider the issues and grounds advanced in the claimant's response, along with any supporting documentation the claimant provided, and will make its Proposed Final Determination.
          (j) The Whistleblower Office will notify the Commission of each Proposed Final Determination. Within thirty (30) calendar days thereafter, any Commissioner may request that the Proposed Final Determination be reviewed by the Commission. If no Commissioner requests such a review within the 30-day period, then the Proposed Final Determination will become the Final Order of the Commission. In the event a Commissioner requests a review, the Commission will review the record that the staff relied upon in making its determinations, including the claimant's submissions to the Whistleblower Office, and issue its Final Order.
          (k) A Preliminary Determination, Proposed Final Disposition, or a Proposed Final Determination may be issued only after a review for legal sufficiency by the Office of the General Counsel.
          (l) The Office of the Secretariat will serve the claimant with the Final Order of the Commission.

          § 165.8
          Amount of award.
          If all of the conditions are met for a whistleblower award in connection with a covered judicial or administrative action or a related action, the Commission will then decide the amount of the award pursuant to the procedure set forth in § 165.7.
          (a) Whistleblower awards shall be in an aggregate amount equal to—
          (1) Not less than 10 percent, in total, of what has been collected of the monetary sanctions imposed in the covered judicial or administrative action or related actions; and
          (2) Not more than 30 percent, in total, of what has been collected of the monetary sanctions imposed in the covered judicial or administrative action or related actions.
          (b) If the Commission makes awards to more than one whistleblower in connection with the same action or related action, the Commission will determine an individual percentage award for each whistleblower, but in no event will the total amount awarded to all whistleblowers as a group be less than 10 percent or greater than 30 percent of the amount the Commission or the other authorities collect.
        
        
          § 165.9
          Criteria for determining amount of award.
          The determination of the amount of an award shall be in the discretion of the Commission. This discretion shall be exercised as prescribed by § 165.7.
          (a) In determining the amount of an award, the Commission shall take into consideration—
          (1) The significance of the information provided by the whistleblower to the success of the covered judicial or administrative action or related action;
          (2) The degree of assistance provided by the whistleblower and any legal representative of the whistleblower in a covered judicial or administrative action or related action;
          (3) The programmatic interest of the Commission in deterring violations of the Commodity Exchange Act by making awards to whistleblowers who provide information that leads to the successful enforcement of such laws;
          (4) Whether the award otherwise enhances the Commission's ability to enforce the Commodity Exchange Act, protect customers, and encourage the submission of high quality information from whistleblowers; and
          (5) Potential adverse incentives from oversize awards.
          (b) Factors that may increase the amount of a whistleblower's award. In determining whether to increase the amount of an award, the Commission will consider the following factors, which are not listed in order of importance.
          (1) Significance of the information provided by the whistleblower. The Commission will assess the significance of the information provided by a whistleblower to the success of the Commission action or related action. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:
          (i) The nature of the information provided by the whistleblower and how it related to the successful enforcement action, including whether the reliability and completeness of the information provided to the Commission by the whistleblower resulted in the conservation of Commission resources; and
          (ii) The degree to which the information provided by the whistleblower supported one or more successful claims brought in the Commission action or related action.
          (2) Assistance provided by the whistleblower. The Commission will assess the degree of assistance provided by the whistleblower and any legal representative of the whistleblower in the Commission action or related action. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:
          (i) Whether the whistleblower provided ongoing, extensive, and timely cooperation and assistance by, for example, helping to explain complex transactions, interpreting key evidence, or identifying new and productive lines of inquiry;
          (ii) The timeliness of the whistleblower's initial report to the Commission or to an internal compliance or reporting system of business organizations committing, or impacted by, the violations of the Commodity Exchange Act, where appropriate;
          (iii) The resources conserved as a result of the whistleblower's assistance;
          (iv) Whether the whistleblower appropriately encouraged or authorized others to assist the staff of the Commission who might otherwise not have participated in the investigation or related action;
          (v) The efforts undertaken by the whistleblower to remediate the harm caused by the violations of the Commodity Exchange Act, including assisting the authorities in the recovery of the fruits and instrumentalities of the violations; and
          (vi) Any unique hardships experienced by the whistleblower as a result of his or her reporting and assisting in the enforcement action.
          (3) Law enforcement interest. The Commission will assess its programmatic interest in deterring violations of the Commodity Exchange Act by making awards to whistleblowers who provide information that leads to the successful enforcement of such laws. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:
          (i) The degree to which an award enhances the Commission's ability to enforce the commodity laws;
          (ii) The degree to which an award encourages the submission of high quality information from whistleblowers by appropriately rewarding whistleblower submissions of significant information and assistance, even in cases where the monetary sanctions available for collection are limited or potential monetary sanctions were reduced or eliminated by the Commission because an entity self-reported a commodities violation following the whistleblower's related internal disclosure, report, or submission;
          (iii) Whether the subject matter of the action is a Commission priority, whether the reported misconduct involves regulated entities or fiduciaries, whether the whistleblower exposed an industry-wide practice, the type and severity of the commodity violations, the age and duration of misconduct, the number of violations, and the isolated, repetitive, or ongoing nature of the violations;
          (iv) The dangers to market participants or others presented by the underlying violations involved in the enforcement action, including the amount of harm or potential harm caused by the underlying violations, the type of harm resulting from or threatened by the underlying violations, and the number of individuals or entities harmed; and

          (v) The degree, reliability and effectiveness of the whistleblower's assistance, including the consideration of the whistleblower's complete, timely truthful assistance to the Commission and criminal authorities.
          
          (4) Participation in internal compliance systems. The Commission will assess whether, and the extent to which, the whistleblower and any legal representative of the whistleblower participated in internal compliance systems. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:
          (i) Whether, and the extent to which, a whistleblower reported the possible Commodity Exchange Act violations through internal whistleblower, legal or compliance procedures before, or at the same time as, reporting them to the Commission; and
          (ii) Whether, and the extent to which, a whistleblower assisted any internal investigation or inquiry concerning the reported Commodity Exchange Act violations.
          (c) Factors that may decrease the amount of a whistleblower's award. In determining whether to decrease the amount of an award, the Commission will consider the following factors, which are not listed in order of importance.
          (1) Culpability. The Commission will assess the culpability or involvement of the whistleblower in matters associated with the Commission's action or related actions. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:
          (i) The whistleblower's role in the Commodity Exchange Act violations;
          (ii) The whistleblower's education, training, experience, and position of responsibility at the time the violations occurred;
          (iii) Whether the whistleblower acted with scienter, both generally and in relation to others who participated in the violations;
          (iv) Whether the whistleblower financially benefitted from the violations;
          (v) Whether the whistleblower is a recidivist;
          (vi) The egregiousness of any wrongdoing committed by the whistleblower; and
          (vii) Whether the whistleblower knowingly interfered with the Commission's investigation of the violations or related enforcement actions.
          (2) Unreasonable reporting delay. The Commission will assess whether the whistleblower unreasonably delayed reporting the Commodity Exchange Act violations. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:
          (i) Whether the whistleblower was aware of the relevant facts but failed to take reasonable steps to report or prevent the violations from occurring or continuing;
          (ii) Whether the whistleblower was aware of the relevant facts but only reported them after learning about a related inquiry, investigation, or enforcement action; and
          (iii) Whether there was a legitimate reason for the whistleblower to delay reporting the violations.
          (3) Interference with internal compliance and reporting systems. The Commission will assess, in cases where the whistleblower interacted with his or her entity's internal compliance or reporting system, whether the whistleblower undermined the integrity of such system. In considering this factor, the Commission will take into account whether there is evidence provided to the Commission that the whistleblower knowingly:
          (i) Interfered with an entity's established legal, compliance, or audit procedures to prevent or delay detection of the reported Commodity Exchange Act violation;
          (ii) Made any material false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations that hindered an entity's efforts to detect, investigate, or remediate the reported Commodity Exchange Act violations; or
          (iii) Provided any false writing or document knowing the writing or document contained any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or entries that hindered an entity's efforts to detect, investigate, or remediate the reported Commodity Exchange Act violations.

(Neither the Commission nor the Claims Review Staff may rely upon information that the entity has not authorized the Commission to share with the applicant); and
          (9) Any other documents or materials including sworn declarations from third-parties that are received or obtained by the Whistleblower Office to assist the Commission resolve the applicant's award application, including information related to the claimant's eligibility.

          § 165.11
          Awards based upon related actions.
          (a) Provided that a whistleblower or whistleblowers comply with the requirements in §§ 165.3, 165.5 and 165.7, and pursuant to § 165.8, the Commission may grant an award based on the amount of monetary sanctions collected in a “Related Action” or “Related Actions”, where:
          (1) A “Related Action” is a judicial or administrative action that is brought by:
          (i) The Department of Justice;
          (ii) An appropriate department or agency of the Federal Government, acting within the scope of its jurisdiction;
          (iii) A registered entity, registered futures association, or self-regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a));
          (iv) A State criminal or appropriate civil agency, acting within the scope of its jurisdiction; or
          (v) A foreign futures authority; and
          (2) The “Related Action” is based on the original information that the whistleblower voluntarily submitted to the Commission and led to a successful resolution of the Commission judicial or administrative action.

          (b) The Commission will not make an award to a claimant for a final judgment in a Related Action if the claimant has already been granted an award by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for that same action pursuant to its whistleblower award program under section 21F of the Securities Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.). If the SEC has previously denied an award to the claimant for a judgment in a Related Action, the whistleblower will be precluded from relitigating any issues before the Commission that the SEC resolved against the claimant as part of the award denial.

          § 165.12
          Payment of awards from the Fund, financing of customer education initiatives, and deposits and credits to the Fund.
          (a) The Commission shall pay awards to whistleblowers from the Fund.
          (b) The Commission shall deposit into or credit to the Fund:
          (1) Any monetary sanctions collected by the Commission in any covered judicial or administrative action that is not otherwise distributed, or ordered to be distributed, to victims of a violation of the Commodity Exchange Act underlying such action, unless the balance of the Fund at the time the monetary sanctions are collected exceeds $100,000,000. In the event the Fund's value exceeds $100,000,000, any monetary sanctions collected by the Commission in a covered judicial or administrative action that is not otherwise distributed, or ordered to be distributed, to victims of violations of the Commodity Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder underlying such action, shall be deposited into the general fund of the U.S. Treasury.
          (2) In the event that the amounts deposited into or credited to the Fund under paragraph (b)(1) of this section are not sufficient to satisfy an award made pursuant to § 165.7, then, pursuant to Section 23(g)(3)(B) of the Commodity Exchange Act;
          (i) An amount equal to the unsatisfied portion of the award;
          (ii) Shall be deposited into or credited to the Fund;

          (iii) From any monetary sanction collected by the Commission in any judicial or administrative action brought by the Commission under the Commodity Exchange Act, regardless of whether it qualifies as a “covered judicial or administrative action”; provided, however, that such judicial or administrative action is based on information provided by a whistleblower.
          (c) Office of Customer Education and Outreach. The Commission shall undertake and maintain customer education initiatives through its Office of Customer Education and Outreach. The initiatives shall be designed to help customers protect themselves against fraud or other violations of the Commodity Exchange Act, or the rules or regulations thereunder. The Commission shall fund the initiatives and may utilize funds deposited into the Fund during any fiscal year in which the beginning (October 1) balance of the Fund is greater than $10,000,000. The Commission shall budget, on an annual basis, the amount used to finance customer education initiatives, taking into consideration the balance of the Fund.

          § 165.13
          Appeals.
          (a) Any Final Order of the Commission relating to a whistleblower award determination, including whether, to whom, or in what amount to make whistleblower awards, may be appealed to the appropriate court of appeals of the United States not more than 30 days after the Final Order of the Commission is issued, provided that administrative remedies have been exhausted.
          (b) The record on appeal shall consist of:
          (1) The Contents of Record for Award Determinations, as set forth in § 165.10. The record on appeal shall not include any pre-decisional or internal deliberative process materials that are prepared to assist the Commission or the Claims Review Staff in deciding the claim (including staff's draft Preliminary Determination or any Proposed Final Determination or staff's draft final determination); and

          § 165.14
          Procedures applicable to the payment of awards.

          (a) A recipient of a whistleblower award is entitled to payment on the award only to the extent that the monetary sanction upon which the award is based is collected in the Commission judicial or administrative action or in a related action.
          (b) Payment of a whistleblower award for a monetary sanction collected in a Commission action or related action shall be made within a reasonable time following the later of:
          (1) The date on which the monetary sanction is collected; or
          (2) The completion of the appeals process for all whistleblower award claims arising from:
          (i) The Notice of Covered Action, in the case of any payment of an award for a monetary sanction collected in a covered judicial or administrative action; or
          (ii) The related action, in the case of any payment of an award for a monetary sanction collected in a related action.
          (c) If there are insufficient amounts available in the Fund to pay the entire amount of an award payment within a reasonable period of time from the time for payment specified by paragraph (b) of this section, then subject to the following terms, the balance of the payment shall be paid when amounts become available in the Fund, as follows:
          (1) Where multiple whistleblowers are owed payments from the Fund based on awards that do not arise from the same Notice of Covered Action (or related action), priority in making these payments will be determined based upon the date that the Final Order of the Commission is made. If two or more of these Final Orders of the Commission are entered on the same date, then those whistleblowers owed payments will be paid on a pro rata basis until sufficient amounts become available in the Fund to pay their entire payments.
          (2) Where multiple whistleblowers are owed payments from the Fund based on awards that arise from the same Notice of Covered Action (or related action), they will share the same payment priority and will be paid on a pro rata basis until sufficient amounts become available in the Fund to pay their entire payments.
        
        
          § 165.15
          Administering the whistleblower program.
          (a) Specific authorities—(1) Payments, deposits, and credits. The Executive Director is authorized to deposit into or credit collected monetary sanctions to the Fund, and to make payment of awards therefrom, with the concurrence of the General Counsel and the Director of the Division of Enforcement, or of their respective designees.
          (2) Designation of claims review staff. The Claims Review Staff referenced in § 165.7 shall be composed of no fewer than three and no more than five staff members from any of the Commission's Offices or Divisions (except the Office of General Counsel) who have not had direct involvement in the underlying enforcement action, as designated by the Director of the Division of Enforcement in consultation with the Executive Director. The Claims Review Staff will always include at least one staff member who does not work in the Division of Enforcement.
          (3) Disclosure of whistleblower identifying information. The Director of the Division of Enforcement is authorized on behalf of the Commission to exercise its discretion to disclose whistleblower identifying information under § 165.4(a).
          (b) General authority to administer the program. The Director of the Division of Enforcement shall have general authority to administer the whistleblower program except as otherwise provided under this part.
          [82 FR 24501, May 30, 2017]
        
        
          § 165.16
          No immunity.

          The Commodity Whistleblower Incentives and Protections provisions set forth in Section 23(h) of Commodity Exchange Act and this part 165 do not provide individuals who provide information to the Commission with immunity from prosecution. The fact that an individual may become a whistleblower and assist in Commission investigations and enforcement actions does not preclude the Commission from bringing an action against the whistleblower based upon the whistleblower's own conduct in connection with violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and the Commission's regulations. If such an action is determined to be appropriate, however, the Commission's Division of Enforcement will take the whistleblower's cooperation into consideration in accordance with its sanction recommendations to the Commission.
        
        
          § 165.17
          Awards to whistleblowers who engage in culpable conduct.
          In determining whether the required $1,000,000 threshold has been satisfied for purposes of making any award, the Commission will not take into account any monetary sanctions that the whistleblower is ordered to pay, or that is ordered against any entity whose liability is based primarily on conduct that the whistleblower principally directed, planned, or initiated. Similarly, if the Commission determines that a whistleblower is eligible for an award, any amounts that the whistleblower or such an entity pay in sanctions as a result of the action or related actions will not be included within the calculation of the amounts collected for purposes of making payments pursuant to § 165.14.
        
        
          § 165.18
          Staff communications with whistleblowers from represented entities.
          If the whistleblower is a whistleblower who is a director, officer, member, agent, or employee of an entity that has counsel, and the whistleblower has initiated communication with the Commission relating to a potential violation of the Commodity Exchange Act, the Commission's staff is authorized to communicate directly with the whistleblower regarding the subject of the whistleblower's communication without seeking the consent of the entity's counsel.
        
        
          § 165.19
          Nonenforceability of certain provisions waiving rights and remedies or requiring arbitration of disputes.
          (a) Non-waiver. The rights and remedies provided for in this part may not be waived by any agreement, policy, form, or condition of employment, including by a predispute arbitration agreement. No predispute arbitration agreement shall be valid or enforceable if the agreement requires arbitration of a dispute arising under this part.
          (b) Protected communications. No person may take any action to impede an individual from communicating directly with the Commission's staff about a possible violation of the Commodity Exchange Act, including by enforcing, or threatening to enforce, a confidentiality agreement or predispute arbitration agreement with respect to such communications.

          § 165.20
          Whistleblower anti-retaliation protections.
          (a) In general. No employer may discharge, demote, suspend, directly or indirectly threaten or harass, or in any other manner discriminate against, a whistleblower in the terms and conditions of employment because of any lawful act done by the whistleblower—
          (1) In providing information to the Commission in accordance with this part; or
          (2) In assisting in any investigation or judicial or administrative action of the Commission based upon or related to such information.
          (b) Anti-retaliation enforcement. Section 23(h)(1)(A) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 26(h)(1)), including the rules in this part promulgated thereunder, shall be enforceable in an action or proceeding brought by the Commission including where retaliation is in response to a whistleblower providing information to the Commission after reporting the information through internal whistleblower, legal or compliance procedures.
          (c) Protections apply regardless of non-qualification. The anti-retaliation protections apply whether or not the whistleblower satisfies the requirements, procedures, and conditions to qualify for an award.

          Pt. 165, App. A
          Appendix A to Part 165—Guidance With Respect to the Protection of Whistleblowers Against Retaliation
          (a) In general. Section 23(h)(1) of Commodity Exchange Act prohibits employers from engaging in retaliation against whistleblowers. A violation of this provision could be addressed by a Commission enforcement action, or a lawsuit by an individual. Section 23(h)(1)(B) provides for a federal cause of action brought by the whistleblower against the employer, which must be filed in the appropriate district court of the United States within two (2) years of the employer's retaliatory act, and potential relief for prevailing whistleblowers, including reinstatement, back pay, and compensation for other expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees.
          (b) Enforcement—(1) Private cause of action. (i) An individual who alleges discharge, demotion, suspension, direct or indirect threats or harassment, or any other manner of discrimination in violation of section 23(h)(1)(A) of the Commodity Exchange Act may bring an action under section 23(h)(1)(B) of the Commodity Exchange Act in the appropriate district court of the United States for the relief provided in section 23(h)(1)(C) of the Commodity Exchange Act, unless the individual who is alleging discharge or other discrimination in violation of section 23(h)(1)(A) of the Commodity Exchange Act is an employee of the Federal Government, in which case the individual shall only bring an action under section 1221 of title 5, United States Code.
          (ii) Subpoenas. A subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a trial or hearing conducted under section 23(h)(1)(B)(ii) of the Commodity Exchange Act may be served at any place in the United States.
          (iii) Statute of limitations. A private cause of action under section 23(h)(1)(B) of the Commodity Exchange Act may not be brought more than 2 years after the date on which the violation reported in section 23(h)(1)(A) of the Commodity Exchange Act is committed.
          (iv) Relief. Relief for an individual prevailing in an action brought under section 23(h)(1)(B) of the Commodity Exchange Act shall include—
          (A) Reinstatement with the same seniority status that the individual would have had, but for the discrimination;
          (B) The amount of back pay otherwise owed to the individual, with interest; and
          (C) Compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discharge or discrimination, including litigation costs, expert witness fees, and reasonable attorney's fees.
          (2) Commission authority to bring action. The Commission may bring an enforcement action against an employer that retaliates against a whistleblower by discharge, demotion, suspension, direct or indirect threats or harassment, or any other manner of discrimination.

          Questions concerning this form may be directed to Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Whistleblower Office, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street NW., Washington, DC 20581.

          • If you are submitting information for the CFTC's whistleblower award program, you must submit your information using this Form TCR.

          • You may submit this form electronically, through the Web portal found on the CFTC's Web site at http://www.whistleblower.gov.

          • You have the right to submit information anonymously.

See 7 U.S.C. 26(h)(2); 17 CFR 165.4. However, in order to receive a whistleblower award, you will need to be identified to select CFTC staff for a final eligibility determination, and in unusual circumstances, you may need to be identified publicly for trial.

          Privacy Act Statement

          This notice is given under the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act requires that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) inform individuals of the following when asking for information. The solicitation of this information is authorized under the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 1 et seq. The information provided will enable the CFTC to determine the whistleblower award claimant's eligibility for payment of an award pursuant to Section 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act and Part 165 of the CFTC's regulations. This information will be used to investigate and prosecute violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and the CFTC's regulations. This information may be disclosed to federal, state, local or foreign agencies or other authorities responsible for investigating, prosecuting, enforcing or implementing laws, rules or regulations implicated by the information consistent with the confidentiality requirements set forth in Section 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act and Part 165 of the CFTC's regulations. The information will be maintained and additional disclosures may be made in accordance with System of Records Notices CFTC-49, “Whistleblower Records” (exempted), CFTC-10, “Investigatory Records” (exempted), and CFTC-16, “Enforcement Case Files.” The CFTC requests the last four digits of the claimant's Social Security Number for use as an individual identifier to administer and manage the whistleblower award program. Executive Order 9397 (November 22, 1943) allows federal agencies to use the Social Security Number as an individual identifier. Furnishing the information is voluntary. However, if an individual is providing information for the whistleblower award program, not providing required information may result in the individual not being eligible for award consideration.
          Questions concerning this form may be directed to Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Whistleblower Office, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street NW., Washington, DC 20581.
          Submission Procedures
          • This form must be used by persons making a claim for a whistleblower award in connection with information provided to the CFTC, or to another agency or organization in a related action. In order to be deemed eligible for an award, you must meet all the requirements set forth in Section 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act and Part 165 of the CFTC's regulations.
          • You must sign the Form WB-APP as the claimant. If you wish to submit the Form WB-APP anonymously, you must do so through an attorney, your attorney must sign the Counsel Certification Section of the Form WB-APP that is submitted to the CFTC, and you must give your attorney your original signed Form WB-APP so that it can be produced to the CFTC upon request.
          • During the whistleblower award claim process, your identity must be verified in a form and manner that is acceptable to the CFTC prior to the payment of any award.
          ○ If you are filing your claim in connection with information that you provided to the CFTC, then your Form WB-APP, and any attachments thereto, must be received by the CFTC within ninety (90) days of the date of the Notice of Covered Action, or the date of a final judgment in a related action to which the claim relates.
          ○ If you are filing your claim in connection with information that you provided to another agency or organization in a related action, then your Form WB-APP, and any attachments thereto, must be received by the CFTC as follows:
          • If a final order imposing monetary sanctions has been entered in a related action at the time that you submit your claim for an award in connection with a CFTC action, you may submit your claim for an award in that related action on the same Form WB-APP that you use for the CFTC action.
          • If a final order imposing monetary sanctions in a related action has not been entered at the time that you submit your claim for an award in connection with a CFTC action, you must submit your claim on Form WB-APP within ninety (90) days of the issuance of a final order imposing sanctions in the related action.

          • If a final order imposing monetary sanctions in a related action relates to a judicial or administrative action brought by the Commission under the Commodity Exchange Act that is not a covered judicial or administrative action, and therefore there would not be a Notice of Covered Action, you must submit your claim on Form WB-APP for an award in connection with the related action within ninety (90) calendar days following either (1) the date of issuance of a final order in the related action, if that date is after the date of issuance of the final judgment in the related Commission judicial or administrative action; or (2) the date of issuance of the final judgment in the related Commission judicial or administrative action, i.e., the date the related action becomes a related action, if the date of issuance of the final order in the related action precedes the final judgment in the related Commission judicial or administrative action.

          This section is optional.

          (A) Arises out of any transaction executed on or subject to the rules of a designated contract market,
          
          (B) Is executed or effected through a member of such facility, a participant transacting on or through such facility or an employee of such facility, and

          (2) The term customer as used in this section includes any person for or on behalf of whom a member of a designated contract market, or a participant transacting on or through such designated contract market, effects a transaction on such contract market, except another member of or participant in such designated contract market.

          (b) Voluntariness. The use by customers of dispute settlement procedures shall be voluntary as provided in paragraphs (c) and (g) of this section.
          (c) Customers. No Commission registrant shall enter into any agreement or understanding with a customer in which the customer agrees, prior to the time a claim or grievance arises, to submit such claim or grievance to any settlement procedure except as follows:
          (1) Signing the agreement must not be made a condition for the customer to utilize the services offered by the Commission registrant.
          (2) If the agreement is contained as a clause or clauses of a broader agreement, the customer must separately endorse the clause or clauses containing the cautionary language and provisions specified in this section.

          (3) The agreement may not require any customer to waive the right to seek reparations under section 14 of the Act and part 12 of this chapter. Accordingly, such customer must be advised in writing that he or she may seek reparations under section 14 of the Act by an election made within 45 days after the Commission registrant notifies the customer that arbitration will be demanded under the agreement. This notice must be given at the time when the Commission registrant notifies the customer of an intention to arbitrate. The customer must also be advised that if he or she seeks reparations under section 14 of the Act and the Commission declines to institute reparations proceedings, the claim or grievance will be subject to the pre-existing arbitration agreement and must also be advised that aspects of the claim or grievance that are not subject to the reparations procedure (i.e., do not constitute a violation of the Act or rules thereunder) may be required to be submitted to the arbitration or other dispute settlement procedure set forth in the pre-existing arbitration agreement.
          (4) The agreement must advise the customer that, at such time as he or she may notify the Commission registrant that he or she intends to submit a claim to arbitration, or at such time as such person notifies the customer of its intent to submit a claim to arbitration, the customer will have the opportunity to elect a qualified forum for conducting the proceeding.
          (5) Election of forum. (i) Within ten business days after receipt of notice from the customer that he or she intends to submit a claim to arbitration, or at the time a Commission registrant notifies the customer of its intent to submit a claim to arbitration, the Commission registrant must provide the customer with a list of organizations whose procedures meet Acceptable Practices established by the Commission for dispute resolution, together with a copy of the rules of each forum listed. The list must include:
          (A) The designated contract market, if applicable and if available, upon which the transaction giving rise to the dispute was executed or could have been executed;
          (B) A registered futures association; and
          (C) At least one other organization that will provide the customer with the opportunity to select the location of the arbitration proceeding from among several major cities in diverse geographic regions and that will provide the customer with the choice of a panel or other decision-maker composed of at least one or more persons, of which at least a majority are not members or associated with a member of the designated contract market, if applicable, or employee thereof, and that are not otherwise associated with the designated contract market (mixed panel), if applicable: Provided, however, that the list of qualified organizations provided by a Commission registrant that is a floor broker need not include a registered futures association unless a registered futures association has been authorized to act as a decision-maker in such matters.
          (ii) The customer shall, within forty-five days after receipt of such list, notify the opposing party of the organization selected. A customer's failure to provide such notice shall give the opposing party the right to select an organization from the list.
          (6) Fees. The agreement must acknowledge that the Commission registrant will pay any incremental fees that may be assessed by a qualified forum for provision of a mixed panel, unless the arbitrators in a particular proceeding determine that the customer has acted in bad faith in initiating or conducting that proceeding.
          (7) Cautionary Language. The agreement must include the following language printed in large boldface type:
          
          
            
              Three Forums Exist for the Resolution of Commodity Disputes: Civil Court litigation, reparations at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and arbitration conducted by a self-regulatory or other private organization.
            
            The CFTC recognizes that the opportunity to settle disputes by arbitration may in some cases provide many benefits to customers, including the ability to obtain an expeditious and final resolution of disputes without incurring substantial costs. The CFTC requires, however, that each customer individually examine the relative merits of arbitration and that your consent to this arbitration agreement be voluntary.
            By signing this agreement, you: (1) May be waiving your right to sue in a court of law; and (2) are agreeing to be bound by arbitration of any claims or counterclaims which you or [name] may submit to arbitration under this agreement. You are not, however, waiving your right to elect instead to petition the CFTC to institute reparations proceedings under Section 14 of the Commodity Exchange Act with respect to any dispute that may be arbitrated pursuant to this agreement. In the event a dispute arises, you will be notified if [name] intends to submit the dispute to arbitration. If you believe a violation of the Commodity Exchange Act is involved and if you prefer to request a section 14 “Reparations” proceeding before the CFTC, you will have 45 days from the date of such notice in which to make that election.
            You need not sign this agreement to open or maintain an account with [name]. See 17 CFR 166.5.
          
          
          (d) Enforceability. A dispute settlement procedure may require parties utilizing such procedure to agree, under applicable state law, submission agreement or otherwise, to be bound by an award rendered in the procedure, provided that the agreement to submit the claim or grievance to the procedure was made in accordance with paragraph (c) or (g) of this section or that the agreement to submit the claim or grievance was made after the claim or grievance arose. Any award so rendered shall be enforceable in accordance with applicable law.
          (e) Time limits for submission of claims. The dispute settlement procedure established by a designated contract market shall not include any unreasonably short limitation period foreclosing submission of customers' claims or grievances or counterclaims.
          (f) Counterclaims. A procedure established by a designated contract market under the Act for the settlement of customers' claims or grievances against a member or employee thereof may permit the submission of a counterclaim in the procedure by a person against whom a claim or grievance is brought. The designated contract market may permit such a counterclaim where the counterclaim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject of the customer's claim or grievance and does not require for adjudication the presence of essential witnesses, parties, or third persons over whom the designated contract market does not have jurisdiction. Other counterclaims arising out of a transaction subject to the Act and rules promulgated thereunder for which the customer utilizes the services of the registrant may be permissible where the customer and the registrant have agreed in advance to require that all such submissions be included in the proceeding, and if the aggregate monetary value of the counterclaims is capable of calculation.
          (g) Eligible contract participants. A person who is an “eligible contract participant” as defined in section 1a(12) of the Act may negotiate any term of an agreement or understanding with a Commission registrant in which the eligible contract participant agrees, prior to the time a claim or grievance arises, to submit such claim or grievance to any settlement procedure provided for in the agreement.

          Subpart A—Standards Governing Commission Review of Applications for Registration as a Futures Association Under Section 17 of the Act
          
            § 170.1
            Demonstration of purposes (section 17(b)(1) of the Act).
            A futures association must demonstrate that it will be able to carry out the purposes of section 17 of the Act. Since a basic purpose of a futures association is to regulate the practices of its members, an association should demonstrate that it will require its members to adhere to regulatory requirements governing their business practices at least as stringent as those imposed by the Commission. For example, the association should be prepared to establish and maintain in accordance with § 1.52 of this chapter, a financial compliance program for those members of the association who are futures commission merchants.
          
          
            
            § 170.2
            Membership restrictions (section 17(b)(2) of the Act).
            If it appears to the Commission to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest and to carry out the purposes of section 17 of the Act, a futures association may restrict its membership to individuals registered by the Commission in a particular capacity or to individuals doing business in a particular geographical region or to firms having a particular level of capital assets or which engage in a specified amount of business per year.
            [48 FR 35305, Aug. 3, 1983]
          
          
            § 170.3
            Fair and equitable representation of members (section 17(b)(5) of the Act).
            A futures association must assure fair and equitable representation of the views and interests of all association members in the procedures providing for the adoption, amendment or repeal of any association rule, in an association's procedure for the selection of association officers and directors and in all other phases of the association's affairs and activities, including disciplinary and membership hearings. No single group or class of association members shall dominate or otherwise exercise disproportionate influence on any governing board of an association or on any disciplinary or membership panel of such an association. Non-members of the association shall be represented wherever practicable on any board or hearing panel of the association.
          
          
            § 170.4
            Allocation of dues (section 17(b)(6) of the Act).
            Dues imposed on members of a futures association must be allocated equitably among members and may not be structured in a manner constituting a barrier to entry of any person seeking to engage in commodity-related business activities.
          
          
            § 170.5
            Prevention of fraudulent and manipulative practices (section 17(b)(7) of the Act).
            A futures association must establish and maintain a program for the protection of customers and option customers, including the adoption of rules to protect customers and option customers and customer funds and to promote fair dealing with the public. These rules shall set forth the ethical standards for members of the association in their business dealings with the public. An applicant association must also demonstrate its capability to foster a professional atmosphere among its members, including an acceptance of an adherence to the ethical standards, and to monitor and enforce compliance with the customer and option customer protection program and rules.

            Disciplinary proceedings (sections 17(b)(8) and (b)(9) of the Act).
            A futures association must provide a fair and orderly procedure with respect to disciplinary actions brought against association members or persons associated with members. These rules governing such disciplinary actions shall contain, at a minimum, the procedural safeguards contained in section 17(b)(9) of the Act. In addition, an association, in disciplining its members should demonstrate that it will:
            (a) Take vigorous action against those who engage in activities in violation of association rules;
            (b) Conduct proceedings in a manner consistent with the fundamental elements of due process; and
            (c) Impose discipline which is fair and has a reasonable basis in fact.

            § 170.7
            Membership denial (section 17(b)(9) of the Act).

            A futures association must provide a fair and orderly procedure for processing membership applications and for affording any person to be denied membership an opportunity to submit evidence in response to the grounds for denial stated by the association. The procedures governing denials of membership in the association shall contain, at a minimum, the procedural safeguards contained in section 17(b)(9) of the Act.

            Settlement of customer disputes (section 17(b)(10) of the Act).
            A futures association must be able to demonstrate its capacity to promulgate rules and to conduct proceedings that provide a fair, equitable and expeditious procedure, through arbitration or otherwise, for the voluntary settlement of a customer's claim or grievance brought against any member of the association or any employee of a member of the association. Such rules shall conform to and be consistent with section 17(b)(10) of the Act and be consistent with the guidelines and acceptable practices for dispute resolution found within appendix A and appendix B to part 38 of this chapter.

            § 170.9
            General standard.
            An applicant seeking registration as a futures association by the Commission must demonstrate the association's ability to comply with standards and requirements set forth in this part. The applicant must also demonstrate its ability to satisfy the provisions of section 17 of the Act as well as other applicable legal considerations, including that the association will promote fair and open competition among its members and will conduct its affairs consistent with the public interest to be protected by the antitrust laws. The Commission shall not register an applicant association unless the Commission finds that the applicant has satisfied the conditions and requirements of section 17 of the Act and of this part and that registration will be in the public interest.
          
          
            § 170.10
            Proficiency examinations (sections 4p and 17(p) of the Act).

            A futures association may prescribe different training standards and proficiency examinations for persons registered in more than one capacity: Provided, That nothing contained in the Act or these regulations, including any exemption from registration for persons registered in another capacity, shall be deemed to preclude the establishment of training standards and a proficiency examination requirement for functions performed in such other capacity.

            (a) Any association seeking registration by the Commission as a futures association must file with the Commission a letter requesting that the association be registered by the Commission as a futures association and accompany the letter with the following: (1) The constitution, charter or articles of incorporation of the association, (2) the bylaws of the association, (3) any other rules, resolutions or regulations of the association corresponding to the foregoing, (4) a detailed description of the association's organization, membership and rules of procedure and (5) a detailed statement of the association's capability to comply with the provisions of section 17 of the Act and this part. This letter and the accompanying information shall be considered as the registration statement of the association. This letter and the accompanying information shall be filed with the Secretariat of the Commission at Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581.
            (b) At any time after an applicant's registration statement has been filed, the applicant association shall submit to the Commission any supporting or additional information concerning the application of the association as the Commission may request.

            (c) If it appears to the Commission, after reviewing any registration statement filed by an applicant association, that the applicant has not satisfied the requirements for registration set forth in section 17 of the Act or of this part, the Commission may, in its discretion, notify the applicant in writing to that effect. Such notice shall specify those requirements of section 17 or of this part which do not appear to have been satisfied and shall afford the applicant a period of at least 60 days in which to respond to the Commission's notice by demonstrating or achieving compliance with the requirements specified by the Commission or otherwise. An applicant may withdraw its registration statement from Commission consideration at any time within such 60 day period.

Unless specifically excluded by subsection (b), this part governs review by the Commission, pursuant to sections 17(h), (i) and (o) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”), as amended, of any disciplinary action, membership denial action, registration action or member responsibility action taken by the National Futures Association or any registered futures association. Unless specifically indicated, references in this part to the National Futures Association shall also include any other registered futures association.
            (b) Matters excluded. The Commission will not review under these rules the following decisions by the National Futures Association:
            (1) A decision in a disciplinary action if the party aggrieved by the decision knowingly failed to pursue the right to appeal an adverse decision to the Appeals Committee of the National Futures Association and there are no extraordinary circumstances that otherwise warrant Commission consideration of the aggrieved party's appeal;
            (2) A decision in an arbitration action brought pursuant to section 17(b)(10) of the Act or any rule of the National Futures Association;
            (3) Suspension of a member based solely on that member's failure to pay National Futures Association dues;
            (4) A decision to disqualify any member for service on the National Futures Association Board of Directors, Business Conduct Committees, Hearing Committee or arbitration panels pursuant to the standards for service adopted by the National Futures Association to implement Commission rule 1.63;

            (5) Suspension of a member or a person associated with a member based solely on that person's failure to pay an arbitration award or a settlement agreement resulting from an arbitration action brought pursuant to section 17(b)(10) of the Act or rules and regulations of the National Futures Association, or a settlement agreement resulting from a mediation proceeding sponsored by the National Futures Association, unless there are extraordinary circumstances that involve something more than the ministerial application of a predetermined sanction, or raise a colorable claim that the National Futures Assocaition has acted arbitrarily.
            (c) Appeals from excluded decisions. If the General Counsel, or any employee under the General Counsel's supervision as the General Counsel may designate, determines that a notice of appeal submitted to the Commission is from a decision that is excluded from review under this part, the notice of appeal may be stricken and ordered to be returned to the aggrieved party who submitted it.
            (d) Applicability of these part 171 rules. Unless otherwise ordered, these rules will apply in their entirety to all appeals and matters relating thereto filed on or after October 31, 1990. Any part 171 proceeding commenced prior to October 31, 1990 continues to be governed by the procedures established in former subpart F of part 3 of the Commission's regulations, if applicable, or by the procedures established for that proceeding by Commission order. Parties to any proceeding pending on October 31, 1990 may, within 30 days after October 31, 1990 by written stipulation executed by all parties, and filed with the Proceedings Clerk before the Commission's final decision is rendered, elect to have the matter governed by the provisions of these part 171 rules.

            (c) Sanctions. (1) Upon receipt of an ex parte communication knowingly made or knowingly caused to be made by a party in violation of the prohibition contained in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Commission may, to the extent consistent with the interests of justice and the policies of the Act, require the party to show cause why his claim or interest in the proceeding should not be dismissed, denied, disregarded, or otherwise adversely affected on account of such violation.

            (2) Any Commissioner, member of a Commissioner's personal staff or Commission decisional employee who knowingly makes or knowingly causes to be made, or who knowingly solicits or knowingly causes the solicitation of, an ex parte communication which violates the prohibitions contained in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be deemed to have engaged in conduct of the type proscribed by 17 CFR 140.735-3(b)(3).
            (d) Applicability of prohibitions and sanctions against ex parte communications.

The prohibitions of this section shall remain in effect until a final order has been entered in the proceeding which is no longer subject to review by the Commission or to review by any court.
            (ii) The Commission may, by specific order entered in a particular proceeding, determine that these prohibitions shall commence from some date prior, or shall continue until a date subsequent, to the times specified in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section.
            (2) The sanctions in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall not apply to a person making a prohibited communication (or causing it to be made) absent evidence that the person acted with actual or constructive knowledge that the person receiving the communication was a Commissioner, member of the personal staff of a Commissioner or a Commission decisional employee.

            Settlement.
            At any time before the Commission has reached a final determination in a proceeding, the parties may request dismissal of the appeal based on a settlement agreement.

            (b) Debarment of counsel or representative during the course of a proceeding. Whenever, while a proceeding is pending before the Commission, the Commission finds that a person acting as counsel or representative for any party to the proceeding is guilty of contemptuous conduct, the Commission may order that such person be precluded from further acting as counsel or representative in a proceeding subject to these rules. The Commission may suspend the proceedings for a reasonable time for the purpose of enabling the party to obtain other counsel or representative.
            (c) Withdrawal from representation. Withdrawal from representation of a party will be only by leave of the Commission. Such leave to withdraw may be subject to conditions including submission of an affidavit averring that the party represented has actual knowledge of the withdrawal and providing the name and address of a successor counsel (or representative) or a statement that the represented party has determined to proceed pro se. If the party proceeds pro se, the statement shall include the address where the party can thereafter be served.
          
          
            
            § 171.14
            Waiver of rules.
            To prevent undue hardship on any party or for other good cause shown, the Commission may waive any rule in this part in a particular case and may order proceedings in accordance with its direction. Such an order shall be based upon a determination that no party will be prejudiced thereby and that the ends of justice will be served. Reasonable notice will be given to all parties of any action taken pursuant to this paragraph.

            (b) Content of the notice. At a minimum, the notice shall provide the following information:
            (1) The names of the parties to the proceeding;
            (2) The date the notice was served and the effective date of the decision;
            (3) A statement informing the parties of their right to appeal the decision to the Commission pursuant to § 171.28 as well as their right to seek a stay of the effective date of the decision pursuant to § 171.27.
            (4) For a disciplinary action:
            (i) A statement setting forth the relevant acts of practices engaged in or omitted by the parties to the proceeding;
            (ii) A statement setting forth the specific rule or rules of the association violated by the relevant acts or practices or omissions to act of the parties to the proceeding;
            (iii) A statement setting forth the penalty imposed and the basis for its imposition.

(1) If the National Futures Association issues a notice of a final decision subject to these rules that is not substantially consistent with the requirements of this section, and the record does not establish that the errors therein are harmless, the notice may be stricken.

            (2) When a notice is struck, the final decision of the National Futures Association shall not be effective until a proper notice is served.
          
          
            § 171.22
            Effective date of final decisions in disciplinary, membership denial and registration actions.
            (a) General rule. A final decision of the National Futures Association in a disciplinary action, membership denial action or registration action shall be effective thirty days after service of the notice described in § 171.21.
            (b) Petitions for stay pending review or for an emergency effective date—(1) Stay pending review. Within ten days of service of the notice described in § 171.21, any aggrieved party may seek from the Commission a stay pending consideration of the merits of an appeal by filing and serving an appropriate petition. The mere filing of such a petition shall not stay the effective date of the decision. The burden of persuasion shall rest with the party seeking the stay. If the Commission does not grant the petition prior to the effective date of the decision under review, it shall be deemed denied. All petitions for stay must be accompanied by a notice of appeal.
            (2) Emergency effective date. Within ten days of service of the notice described in § 171.21, the National Futures Association may seek from the Commission an order establishing an emergency effective date for the decision by filing and serving an appropriate petition.

            (3) Contents of petition for stay and petition for an emergency effective date. A petition for stay or for an emergency effective date shall be in writing. Material factual allegations shall be supported by an affidavit or other sworn statement unless the parties stipulate that the material facts are not in dispute.
            (4) Response. Within five days of the service of the petition, a party may file in opposition to the petition. Material factual allegations shall be supported by an affidavit or other sworn statement unless the parties stipulate that the material facts are not in dispute.
            (c) Standards for determining petitions for a stay or an emergency effective date petition. In reviewing petitions filed under this seciton, the Commission shall consider:
            (1) The likelihood that a challenge to the merits of the decision will be successful; and
            (2) The likelihood that the denial of the petition would result in irreparable harm to the petitioner; and
            (3) The effect a grant of the petition would have on the opposing party; and
            (4) The effect a grant or denial of the petition would have on the public interest.
            (d) Expedited consideration. If, in its view, it is necessary to protect the petitioner's right to a meaningful determination of the issues raised in the petition, the Commission may act upon a petition for a stay or for an emergency effective date prior to its receipt of an opposing party's response. Any party aggrieved by such expedited consideration may seek reconsideration within seven days of service of the decision.

          Subpart C—Commission Review of Final Decisions in Disciplinary, Membership Denial and Registration Actions
          
            § 171.30
            Scope of review.

            On review, the Commission may, in its discretion and after appropriate consideration of the notice given to the parties, consider sua sponte any issues arising from the record before it and may base its determination thereon. The Commission may also limit its consideration to those issues specifically raised in the parties' briefs, treating all other issues as waived.
          
          
            § 171.31
            Commission review in the absence of an appeal.
            (a) Request by Commission staff. At any time prior to the effective date of a final decision of the National Futures Association in a disciplinary, membership denial or registration action, the Division of Enforcement, the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight and the Division of Clearing and Risk or the Division of Market Oversight may file and serve a memorandum requesting the Commission to institute review of the National Futures Association proceeding. The filing of such a memorandum shall stay the effective date of the decision at issue for twenty days.
            (b) Response by the National Futures Association. The National Futures Association may file a response to the memorandum of the Commission staff within fifteen days of the service of the memorandum.
            (c) Commission determination of staff request. To preserve the status quo while it determines whether review is apropriate, the Commission may extend the stay of the effective date of the decision at issue for an additional 30 days. If the Commission decides to take review, the effective date of the decision at issue shall be stayed pending the decision of the Commission, unless otherwise ordered. The Commission shall by order establish the procedure for submission of both the record of the proceeding and the briefs of the parties to the proceeding.
            (d) Commission review on its own motion. At any time prior to the effective date of a final decision of the National Futures Association in a disciplinary, membership denial or registration action, the Commission may take review of a decision by issuing an appropriate order. If the Commission determines that it is appropriate to take review on its own motion, it shall by order establish the procedure for submission of both the record of the proceeding and the briefs of the parties.
            [55 FR 41068, Oct. 9, 1990, as amended at 67 FR 62353, Oct. 7, 2002; 78 FR 22419, Apr. 16, 2013]
          
          
            § 171.32
            Oral argument.
            (a) On motion of Commission. On its own motion, the Commission may, in its discretion, hear oral argument in a proceeding.
            (b) On request of party. Any party may file with the Proceedings Clerk a request in writing for the opportunity to present oral argument before the Commission, which the Commission may, in its discretion, grant or deny. A request under this paragraph must be filed concurrently with the party's brief.
            (c) Reporting and transcription. Oral argument before the Commission will be recorded and transcribed unless the Commission directs otherwise. In the event the Commission affords the parties the opportunity to present oral argument before the Commission, the oral argument will proceed in accordance with the provisions of § 10.103(b) of this chapter.
          
          
            § 171.33
            Final decision by the Commission.
            (a) Opinion and order. Upon review, the Commission may affirm, modify, set aside, or remand for further proceedings, in whole or in part, the decision of the National Futures Association. The Commission's decision will be contained in its opinion and order which will be based upon the record before it, including the record of the registered futures association proceeding, briefs submitted to the Commission by the parties and any oral argument made in accordance with § 171.32. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the opinion and order will constitute the final decision of the Commission, effective upon service on the parties. In the event the Commission is equally divided as to its decision, the decision of the National Futures Association shall be affirmed without a Commission opinion.
            (b) Order of summary affirmance. If the Commission finds that the result reached in the decision of the National Futures Association is substantially correct and that none of the arguments on appeal made by the appellant raise important questions of law or policy, the Commission may, by appropriate order, summarily affirm the decision without opinion. The decision of the National Futures Association shall constitute the Commission's final decision, effective upon service. Unless the Commission expressly indicates otherwise in its order, an order of summary affirmance does not reflect a Commission determination to adopt the rationale of the National Futures Association, and neither the order of summary affirmance nor the underlying order shall serve as Commission precedent in other proceedings.
          
          
            § 171.34
            Standards of review.
            (a) Disciplinary actions. In reviewing a final decision of the National Futures Association in a disciplinary action, the Commission shall affirm the order of the National Futures Association, unless the Commission finds that:
            (1) The proceedings were not conducted in a manner consistent with fundamental fairness;
            (2) The proceedings were not conducted in a manner consistent with the rules of the National Futures Association;
            (3) The weight of the evidence does not support the findings of the National Futures Association concerning the relevant acts or practices engaged in or omitted;
            (4) The determination that the acts or practices engaged in or omitted violated rules of the National Futures Association does not rest on a reasonable interpretation of the rules at issue;
            (5) The National Futures Association's application of its rules is not consistent with the purposes of the Act;
            (6) The National Futures Association's choice of sanction is excessive or oppressive in light of the violations found having due regard for the public interest.
            (b) Membership denial actions. In reviewing a final decision of the National Futures Association in a membership denial action, the Commission shall affirm the order of the National Futures Association, unless the Commission finds that:
            (1) The proceedings were not conducted in a manner consistent with fundamental fairness;
            (2) The proceedings were not conducted in a manner consistent with the rules of the National Futures Association;
            (3) The weight of the evidence does not support the findings made or adopted in the final decision;
            (4) The conclusion of the National Futures Association is not consistent with the purposes of the Act.
            (c) Registration actions. In reviewing a decision of the National Futures Association in a registration action, the Commission shall affirm the order of the National Futures Association unless the Commission finds that:
            (1) The proceedings were not conducted in a manner consistent with fundamental fairness;
            (2) The proceedings were not conducted in a manner consistent with the rules of the National Futures Association;

          Subpart D—Commission Review of Decisions by the National Futures Association In Member Responsibility Actions
          
            § 171.40
            Notice of the commencement of a member responsibility action.
            The notice of a Member Responsibility Action provided by the National Futures Association pursuant to its rules shall advise the affected parties of their right to petition the Commission pursuant to § 171.41 to stay the effective date of the action pending a hearing before the National Futures Association on the factual issues relevant to the suspension, restriction or remedial action ordered.
          
          
            § 171.41
            Petition for a stay of effective date of a member responsibility action pending a hearing by the National Futures Association.
            (a) Time to file. Within ten days after the National Futures Association serves the notice required by § 171.40, any party aggrieved by the National Futures Association's determination that the member responsibility action should be effective prior to the opportunity for a hearing on the factual issues relevant to the suspension, restriction or remedial action imposed may petition the Commission to stay its effectiveness pending completion of further proceedings by the National Futures Association. The burden of persuasion shall rest with the party seeking the stay.
            (b) Content. A petition for stay shall meet the content requirements set forth in § 171.22(b)(3).
            (c) Response. A response may be filed by the National Futures Association in accordance with § 171.22(b)(4).
            (d) Standards for granting petition for stay. In reviewing petitions to stay the effectiveness of the member responsibility action pending completion of further proceedings, the Commission shall consider:
            (1) Whether, in the circumstances presented, the notice and opportunity for a hearing provided by the National Futures Association are consistent with principles of fundamental fairness; and
            (2) The likelihood that the denial of the petition would result in irreparable harm to petitioner; and
            (3) The effect a grant of the petition would have on the interests of the National Futures Association; and
            (4) The effect a grant or denial of the petition would have on the public interest.
            (e) If the suspension, restriction or remedial action imposed by the National Futures Assocation in a member responsibility action is effective at the time a petition for a stay is filed with the Commission, the Commission shall not delay its decision on the petition to await the receipt of the National Futures Association's response. If the action is not effective at the time the petition is filed, the Commission will not act upon the petition prior to the receipt of a response from the National Futures Association unless, in its view, expedited action on the petition is necessary to protect petitioner's right to a meaningful determination of the right to a stay. If the Commission grants the petition prior to the receipt of the response of the National Futures Association, the association may seek reconsideration of the Commission's action within seven days of service of the decision.
            (f) Proceedings following Commission disposition. If the petition for a stay is denied, the National Futures Association shall continue its action in accordance with the applicable rules of the association. If the petition for a stay is granted, the action shall be remanded to the National Futures Association for further proceedings as provided in the Commission's decision. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, a stay issued pursuant to this section shall not deprive the National Futures Association of the authority, after conducting a hearing under the appropriate rules of the association, to make the suspension, restriction or remedial action ordered in the member responsibility action immediately effective at the time a final decision is issued.

            (a) When required. The National Futures Association shall promptly serve all parties, as well as the Proceeding Clerk and Secretary of the Commission, with a written notice of any final decision in a member responsibility action. The notice may be contained in the written decision issued by the National Futures Association. If the National Futures Association determines that the decision shall be effective upon issuance, in addition to serving a written notice, it shall also contact the parties and the Proceedings Clerk by telephone to inform them of its determination.

            (b) Contents. A petition for a stay shall be in writing. Material factual allegations shall be supported by an affidavit or other sworn statement unless the parties stipulate that the material facts are not in dispute.
            (c) Response. Within five days of the service of the petition, the National Futures Association may file an opposition to the petition. Material factual allegations shall be supported by an affidavit or other sworn statement unless the parties stipulate that the material facts are not in dispute.
            (d) Standards for determining petitions for a stay. In reviewing petitions filed under this section, the Commission shall consider:
            (1) The likelihood that petitioner's challenge to the merits of the decision will be successful; and
            (2) The likelihood that the denial of the petition would result in irreparable harm to the petitioner; and
            (3) The effect a grant of the petition would have on the National Futures Association; and

The trustee for a commodity broker must immediately use its best efforts to effect a transfer in accordance with § 190.06 (e) and (f) no later than the seventh calendar day after the order for relief of the open commodity contracts and equity held by the commodity broker for or on behalf of its customers.
          (2) Involuntary cases. A commodity broker against which an involuntary petition in bankruptcy is filed, or the trustee if a trustee has been appointed in such case, must use its best efforts to effect a transfer in accordance with § 190.06 (e) and (f) of all open commodity contracts and equity held by the commodity broker for or on behalf of its customers and such other property as the Commission in its discretion may authorize, on or before the seventh calendar day after the filing date, and immediately cease doing business: Provided, however, That the commodity broker may trade for liquidation only, unless otherwise directed by the Commission, by any applicable self-regulatory organization or by the court: And, Provided further, That if the commodity broker demonstrates to the Commission within such period that it was in compliance with the segregation and financial requirements of this chapter on the filing date, and the Commission determines, in its sole discretion, that such transfer or liquidation is neither appropriate nor in the public interest, the commodity broker may continue in business subject to applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and of this chapter.
          (f) Liquidation or offset. After entry of the order for relief and subject to paragraph (e) of this section, which requires the trustee to attempt to make certain transfers permitted by § 190.06 and section 764(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, the following commodity contracts and other property held by or for the account of a debtor must be liquidated or offset by the trustee promptly and in an orderly manner, subject to limit moves and to applicable procedures under the Bankruptcy Code:
          (1) Open commodity contracts. All open commodity contracts except:
          (i) Dealer option contracts, if the dealer option grantor is not the debtor, which cannot be transferred on or before the seventh calendar day after the order for relief; and
          (ii) Specifically identifiable commodity contracts as defined in § 190.01(kk)(2) for which an instruction prohibiting liquidation is noted prominently in the accounting records of the debtor and timely received under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an open commodity contract must be offset if: such contract is a futures contract or a Cleared Swaps contract which cannot be settled in cash and which would otherwise remain open either beyond the last day of trading (if applicable), or the first day on which notice of intent to deliver may be tendered with respect thereto, whichever occurs first; such contract is a long option on a physical commodity which cannot be settled in cash and would be automatically exercised, has value and would remain open beyond the last day for exercise; such contract is a short option on a physical commodity which cannot be settled in cash; or, as otherwise specified in these rules.
          (2) Specifically identifiable property other than open commodity contracts. Specifically identifiable property other than open commodity contracts to the extent that:
          (i) The fair market value of such property is less than 90% of its fair market value on the date of entry of the order for relief; or
          (ii) The trustee has not received instructions to return, or has not returned, such property upon the terms contained in § 190.08(d)(1) on or before the end of the period set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
          (3) All other property. All other property not required to be transferred or returned pursuant to customer instructions which has not been liquidated in accordance with paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section.
          (g) Treatment of open commodity contracts—(1) Margin payments by the trustee. Prior to the primary liquidation date, the trustee may make variation and maintenance margin payments to a commodity broker carrying the account of the debtor, as appropriate, pending liquidation of any open commodity contracts required to be liquidated under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, whether or not such contracts are specifically identifiable to a particular customer: Provided, That:
          (i) No payments may be made on behalf of accounts which are in deficit,
          (ii) No payments may be made on behalf of non-public customers or the debtor from funds which are segregated for the benefit of public customers,
          (iii) The trustee must make margin payments if payments of margin are received from customers after bankruptcy in response to margin calls, and
          (iv) No payments need be made to restore initial margin.
          (2) Margin calls. The trustee, or in the case of an involuntary bankruptcy, the commodity broker against which the petition is filed or the trustee if a trustee has been appointed, must issue margin calls with respect to any account in which the funded balance less the value on the date of return or transfer of any property previously returned or transferred does not equal or exceed:
          (i) 100% of the maintenance margin requirements of the applicable designated contact market or swap execution facility, if any, with respect to the open commodity contracts in such account; or
          (ii) If there are no such maintenance margin requirements, 100% of the clearing organization margin requirements applicable to the open commodity contracts in such account; or
          (iii) If there are no maintenance margin requirements or clearing organization margin requirements, then 50% of the initial margin applicable to the open commodity contracts in such account;
          
            Provided, That no margin calls need be made by the trustee to restore initial margin. A margin call for such accounts should be made as soon as possible following the order for relief and the trustee shall be authorized, but not obligated, to liquidate any account for which such margin call is not met within a reasonable time as defined in § 190.04(e)(4): Provided, That the trustee must immediately liquidate any account which is in deficit.
          (3) Margin payments by the customer. The full amount of any margin payment by a customer in response to a margin call under paragraph (g)(2) of this section must be credited to the funded balance of the particular account for which it was made.
          [48 FR 8739, Mar. 1, 1983, as amended at 67 FR 58298, Sept. 13, 2002; 77 FR 6378, 6379, Feb. 7, 2012]
        
        
          § 190.03
          Operation of the debtor's estate subsequent to the primary liquidation date.
          Subsequent to the primary liquidation date, accounts which contain open commodity contracts not required to be liquidated under § 190.02 (f)(1) shall be operated by the trustee as follows:
          (a) Operation of accounts held open for transfer—(1) Establishment of transfer accounts. On the primary liquidation date, the trustee must generate a new statement of account for each class of account of a customer which contains a commodity contract not required to be liquidated under § 190.02(f)(1). The opening balance of such statement must be equal to its funded balance, less the value on the date of its transfer or return of any property transferred or returned with respect to the net equity claim for such account prior to the primary liquidation date.
          (2) Accounting for transfer accounts. The opening balance of any statement generated on the primary liquidation date in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be adjusted for operations on or subsequent to the primary liquidation date in the same manner as the equity in a commodity contract account maintained for or on behalf of a customer would adjusted in the ordinary course of business prior to the filing date: Provided, however, That such statement of account must also be adjusted to reflect certain adjustments to the funded balance in accordance with § 190.07(c)(2), such that the balance in that account will always be equal to the funded balance of the claimant's net equity claim adjusted for corrections and subsequent operations less the value on the date of transfer or return of any property transferred or returned with respect to that claim prior to the primary liquidation date.
          (3) Margin calls. The trustee must promptly issue margin calls with respect to any account referred to under paragraph (a)(1) of this section in which the balance does not equal or exceed 100% of the maintenance margin requirements of the applicable designated contact market or swap execution facility, if any, with respect to the open commodity contracts in such account, or if there are no such maintenance margin requirements, 100% of the clearing organization's initial margin requirements applicable to the open commodity contracts in such account, or if there are no such maintenance margin requirements or clearing organization initial margin requirements, then 50% of the customer initial margin applicable to the commodity contracts in such account: Provided, That no margin calls need be made to restore customer initial margin.
          (4) Margin payments. The trustee may make variation or maintenance margin payments to the broker carrying any account referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section as appropriate if such payments do not exceed the balance of the statement of account generated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to which such contracts are credited. Any customer for which commodity contracts remain open subsequent to the primary liquidation date will not be relieved of the obligation to make margin payments by reason of the bankruptcy of the commodity broker: Provided, That the full amount of any margin payment made by a customer subsequent to the primary liquidation date must be credited to the account referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for which it was made.
          (5) Distribution. No distribution of equity may be made to or on behalf of customers by the trustee with respect to an account established in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section and to § 190.08(d).
          (b) Liquidation of open commodity contracts. Commodity contracts held open by the trustee in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be liquidated promptly and in an orderly manner, if:
          (1) Any payment of margin would result in a deficit in the account in which they are held;
          (2) The customer for, or on whose behalf, the account is held fails to meet a margin call within a reasonable time;
          (3) The trustee has received no customer instructions with respect to such contract by the sixth calendar day after entry of the order for relief;
          (4) The commodity contract has not been transferred in accordance with § 190.08(d)(2) on or before the seventh calendar day after entry of the order for relief; or
          (5) The commodity contract would otherwise remain open (e.g., because it cannot be settled in cash) beyond the last day of trading in such contract (if applicable) or the first day on which notice of delivery may be tendered with respect to such contract, whichever occurs first.
          (c) Liquidation of specifically identifiable property other than open commodity contracts. All specifically identifiable property other than open commodity contracts which have not been liquidated prior to the primary liquidation date, and for which no customer instructions have been timely received must be liquidated, to the extent reasonably possible, no later than the sixth calendar day after final publication of the notice referred to in § 190.02(b)(1). All other specifically identifiable property must be liquidated or returned, to the extent reasonably possible, no later than the seventh calendar day after final publication of such notice.
          [48 FR 8739, Mar. 1, 1983, as amended at 77 FR 6378, 6380, Feb. 7, 2012]
        
        
          § 190.04
          Operation of the debtor's estate—general.
          (a) Compliance with the Act and regulations. Except as specifically provided otherwise in this part, the trustee shall comply with all of the provisions of the Act and of the regulations thereunder as if it were the debtor.
          (b) Computation of funded balance. Using the information available, the trustee must compute a funded balance for each customer account which contains open commodity contracts as of the close of business each day subsequent to the order for relief until the final liquidation date. Such computation must be completed prior to noon on the next business day.
          (c) Records—(1) Maintenance. Subject to the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code, records of the computations required by this part shall be maintained in accordance with § 1.31 of this chapter by the trustee for the greater of the period required by § 1.31 of this chapter or for a period of one year after the close of the bankruptcy proceeding for which they were compiled.
          (2) Accessibility. The records required to be maintained by paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be available during business hours to the Court, parties in interest, the Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice. At any time on or after the filing date, the commodity broker, or the trustee if a trustee has been appointed, shall be required to give the Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice immediate access to all records of the debtor, including records required to be retained in accordance with § 1.31 of this chapter and all other records of the commodity broker, whether or not the Act or this chapter would require such records to be maintained by the commodity broker.
          (d) Liquidation—(1) Order of Liquidation—(i) In the Market. Liquidation of open commodity contracts held for a house account or customer account by or on behalf of a commodity broker which is a debtor shall be accomplished pursuant to the rules of a clearing organization, a designated contract market, or a swap execution facility, as applicable. Such rules shall ensure that the process for liquidating open commodity contracts, whether for the house account or the customer account, results in competitive pricing, to the extent feasible under market conditions at the time of liquidation. Such rules must be submitted to the Commission for approval, pursuant to section 5c(c) of the Act, and be approved by the Commission. Alternatively, such rules must otherwise be submitted to and approved by the Commission (or its delegate pursuant to § 190.10(d) of this part) prior to their application.
          (ii) Book entry. Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, in appropriate cases, upon application by the trustee or the affected clearing organization, the Commission may permit open commodity contracts to be liquidated, or settlement on such contracts to be made, by book entry. Such book entry shall offset open commodity contracts, whether matched or not matched on the books of the commodity broker, using the settlement price for such commodity contracts as determined by the clearing organization. Such settlement price shall be determined by the rules of the clearing organization, which shall ensure that such settlement price is established in a competitive manner, to the extent feasible under market conditions at the time of liquidation. Such rules must be submitted to the Commission for approval pursuant to section 5c(c) of the Act, and be approved by the Commission. Alternatively, such rules must otherwise be approved by the Commission (or its delegate pursuant to § 190.10(d) of this part) prior to their application.
          (2) Liquidation only. Nothing in this part shall be interpreted to permit the trustee to purchase or sell new commodity contracts for customers of the debtor except to offset open commodity contracts or to transfer any transferable notice received by the debtor or the trustee under any commodity contract: Provided, however, That the trustee may, in its discretion and with approval of the Commission, cover uncovered inventory or commodity contracts of the debtor which cannot be liquidated immediately because of price limits or other market conditions, or may take an offsetting position in a new month or at a strike price for which limits have not been reached.
          (3) Exception to Liquidation Only. Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the trustee may, with the written permission of the Commission, operate the business of the debtor in the ordinary course, including the purchase or sale of new commodity contracts on behalf of the customers of the debtor under appropriate circumstances, as determined by the Commission.
          (e) Other matters—(1) Determination as to bona fide hedges. In determining which commodity contracts are eligible to be held open for transfer pursuant to customer instruction, the trustee may rely on the designation in the accounting records of the commodity broker that the account for or on behalf of which the contract is held is a hedging account. Commodity contracts maintained in a hedging account may be treated by the trustee as specifically identifiable.
          (2) Disbursements. The trustee shall make no disbursements to customers prior to final distribution except with approval of the court or in accordance with § 190.08(d).
          (3) Investment. The trustee shall promptly invest the equity resulting from the liquidation of commodity contracts, and the proceeds of the liquidation of specifically identifiable property, in obligations of the United States and obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, and may similarly invest any customer equity in accounts which remain open in accordance with § 190.03: Provided, That such obligations are maintained in a depository located in the United States, its territories or possessions.
          (4) Margin calls—reasonable time. Except as otherwise provided in this part, a reasonable time for meeting margin calls made by the trustee shall be deemed to be one hour, or such greater period not to exceed one business day, as the trustee may determine in its sole discretion.
          (5) Management of Long Option Contracts. Subject to the applicable liquidation provisions the trustee must use its best efforts to assure that a long option contract with value does not expire worthless.

          § 190.05
          Making and taking delivery on commodity contracts.
          (a) General. (1) In the event that the trustee is unable to liquidate an open commodity contract subject to physical delivery or an option on a physical commodity, which cannot be settled in cash, prior to the last day of trading in that contract as required by §§ 190.02(f)(1) and 190.03(b)(5), the trustee must use its best efforts to prevent property which is to be delivered for or on behalf of a customer to fulfill that contract, or property for which delivery is being taken with respect to a customer pursuant to that contract, from becoming part of the debtor's estate.
          (2) Delivery account shall mean any account prominently designated as such in the records of the debtor which contains only the specifically identifiable property associated with delivery set forth in § 190.01(kk) (3), (4), and (5), except that with respect to § 190.01(kk) (4) and (5), delivery need not be made or taken and exercise need not be effected for such property to be included in a delivery account.
          (3) The portion of the price or the proceeds of a commodity contract upon delivery which is not specifically identifiable property under § 190.01(kk) (4) and (5) must be distributed pro rata under section 766(h) of the Code.
          (b) Rules for deliveries on behalf of a customer of a debtor. Except in the case of a commodity contract which is settled in cash, each designated contract market, swap execution facility, or clearing organization shall adopt, maintain in effect and enforce rules which have been submitted in accordance with section 5c(c) of the Act for approval by the Commission, which:
          (1) Permit the making and taking of delivery to fulfill a commodity contract for a physical commodity or an option on a physical commodity, which has not become part of the debtor's estate on the date of the entry of the order for relief but with respect to which commodity contract:
          (i) Trading has ceased on the date of the entry of the order for relief;
          (ii) Notice of delivery has been tendered on or before the date of the entry of the order for relief; or,

          (iii) Trading ceases before it can be liquidated by the trustee, to be effected directly between the customer of the debtor and the person identified by the clearing organization as the party to whom delivery should be made or from whom delivery should be taken by such customer of the debtor without intervention of the trustee and without including such physical commodity or the payment for such physical commodity in any bankruptcy distribution: Provided, however, That a customer shall not be relieved of his obligation to make or take delivery for the sole reason that delivery must be made or taken from a commodity broker which is a debtor; and
          (2) Recognize that the equity of a customer of the debtor in a commodity contract upon which delivery is made or taken must be included in the net equity claim of that customer and, as such, can only be distributed pro rata at the time of, and as part of, any distributions to customers made by the trustee.
          (c) Delivery made or taken within the debtor's estate. (1) Any property in a delivery account which is part of the debtor's estate on the date of the order for relief may be returned under the terms set forth in § 190.08(d)(1)(ii).
          (2) If the property to be delivered is part of the debtor's estate on the date of the order for relief and a customer of the debtor is required to make delivery, the trustee must make delivery in the same manner as if no bankruptcy had occurred and the party by whom delivery is taken must pay the full notice price or strike price for delivery.

          (3) If delivery is to be made or taken on behalf of a house account the trustee must either make or take delivery, as the case may be, on behalf of the debtor's estate: Provided, That if the trustee, at any time, takes delivery of a physical commodity, the trustee must convert that physical commodity to cash as promptly as possible.

          § 190.06
          Transfers.
          (a) Transfer rules. No clearing organization or other self-regulatory organization may adopt, maintain in effect or enforce rules which:
          (1) Are inconsistent with the provisions of this part;
          (2) Interfere with the acceptance by its members of open commodity contracts and the equity margining or securing such contracts from futures commission merchants, or persons which are required to be registered as futures com-mission merchants, which are required to transfer accounts pursuant to § 1.17(a)(4) of this chapter; or

          (3) Prevent the acceptance by its members of transfers of open commodity contracts and the equity margining or securing such contracts from futures commission merchants with respect to which a petition in bankruptcy has been filed, if such transfers have been approved by the Commission. Provided, however, that this paragraph shall not limit the exercise of any contractual right of a clearing organization or other registered entity to liquidate open commodity contracts.
          (b) Notice. Unless notice has been filed pursuant to § 1.65(b) of this chapter, if a futures commission merchant, or a person required to be registered as a futures commission merchant, intends to transfer commodity contracts held by or for a commodity broker from or for the account of a customer to another person registered as a futures commission merchant after a petition in bankruptcy has been filed by or against such commodity broker, the transferor must notify the Commission no later than is required under § 190.02(a)(2).
          (c) Financial requirements for transferees. (1) No transfer may be made which would cause the transferee to be in violation of the minimum financial requirements set forth in this chapter.
          (2) A transferee may accept a transfer of open commodity contracts even though the money, securities and other property eligible for transfer under the regulations contained in this part is insufficient to fully margin such positions, if the transferee agrees to accept the transfer subject to any loss due to the failure to recover such deficiency from the customers whose contracts it has accepted or from the estate of the debtor.
          (3) The transferee of a commodity contract for which notice is given under § 190.06(b)(2) must keep that contract open one business day after its receipt, unless the customer for whom the transfer is made fails to respond within a reasonable time to a margin call for the difference between the margin transferred with such contract and the margin which such transferee would require with respect to a similar commodity contract held for the account of a customer in the ordinary course of business.
          (4) No commission may be collected by the transferor with respect to the transfer of an open commodity contract for which notice is given under § 190.06(b)(2).
          (d) Customer instructions—(1) Customer instructions. A commodity broker must provide an opportunity for each customer to specify when undertaking its first hedging contract whether, in the event of bankruptcy, such customer prefers that open commodity contracts held in a hedging account be liquidated by the trustee without seeking customer instructions. Such commodity broker may obtain evidence of the customer instructions as provided in § 1.55(d) of this chapter.
          (2) Record of customer instructions. Each futures commission merchant must indicate prominently in the accounting records in which it maintains open trade balances any customer accounts which are hedging accounts for which the customer has not specified that it prefers open contracts to be liquidated in bankruptcy by the trustee without instruction.
          (e) Eligibility for transfer under section 764(b) of the Bankruptcy Code—(1) Accounts eligible for transfer. Subject to the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section, all accounts are eligible for transfer after the filing date pursuant to section 764(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, except:
          (i) House accounts or the accounts of general partners of the debtor if the debtor is a partnership;
          (ii) Leverage accounts, if the debtor is the leverage transaction merchant with respect to such accounts;
          (iii) Dealer option accounts, if the debtor is the dealer option grantor with respect to such accounts; or
          (iv) Accounts which are in deficit.
          (2) Amount of equity which may be transferred. In no case may money, securities or property be transferred in respect of any eligible account if the value of such money, securities or property would exceed the funded balance of such account based on available information as of the calendar day immediately preceding transfer less the value on the date of return or transfer of any property previously returned or transferred with respect thereto.
          (f) Special rules for transfers under section 764(b) of the Bankruptcy Code—(1) Dealer options—(i) Eligibility for transfer. Prior to exercise, any dealer option contract held by or for the account of a debtor which is a futures commission merchant from or for the account of a customer may be transferred even if the funded balance available for transfer which is attributable to such contract does not equal 100% of the portion of the purchase price required to be segregated with respect to such contract: Provided, That a dealer option contract will be eligible for transfer only if any deficiency in the funded balance of the customer account in which it is held is not due to amounts owed by such customer to the debtor; and, Provided further, That the transferee of any dealer option contract need not segregate more than an amount equal to that portion of the purchase price due the grantor which is transferred with the contract which should be equal to the grantor's funded balance in the portion of the purchase price segregated less any reasonable reserve established by the trustee for the nonrecovery of overpayments.
          (ii) Obligation of the dealer option grantor. In the event of the transfer of a dealer option contract pursuant to this section, the failure of the debtor futures commission merchant to segregate 100% of the purchase price due the grantor for such contract, or the failure of the dealer option grantor to collect 100% of such purchase price due the grantor, shall not excuse the dealer option grantor from its obligation to perform such contract in full upon its exercise, without any setoff or set aside for the premium deficiency.
          (2) Clearing organizations. Commodity contracts held by a clearing organization which is a debtor may not be transferred.
          (3) Partial transfers—(i) Of the customer estate. If all eligible customer accounts held by a debtor cannot be transferred under this section, a partial transfer may nonetheless be made. The Commission will not disapprove such a transfer for the sole reason that it was a partial transfer if it would prefer the transfer of accounts, the liquidation of which could adversely affect the market or the bankrupt estate. Any dealer option contract held by or for the account of a debtor which is a futures commission merchant from or for the account of a customer which has not previously been transferred, and is eligible for transfer, must be transferred on or before the seventh calendar day after entry of the order for relief.
          
          (ii) Of a customer account. If all of a customer's open commodity contracts cannot be transferred under this section, a partial transfer of contracts may be made. A partial transfer may be effected by liquidating that portion of the open commodity contracts held by a customer which represents sufficient equity to permit the transfer of the remainder. If any commodity contracts to be transferred in a partial transfer are part of a spread or straddle, both sides of such spread or straddle must be transferred or neither side may be transferred.
          (g) Prohibition on avoidance of transfers under section 764(b) of the Bankruptcy Code—(1) Pre-relief transfers. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section, the following transfers may not be avoided by a trustee:
          (i) The transfer of commodity contract accounts prior to the entry of the order for relief in compliance with § 1.17(a)(4) of this chapter unless such transfer is disapproved by the Commission; or
          (ii) The transfer prior to the order for relief by a public customer, including a transfer by a public customer which is a commodity broker, of commodity contract accounts held from or for the account of such customer by or on behalf of the debtor unless:
          (A) The customer acted in collusion with the debtor or its principals to obtain a greater share of the bankrupt estate than that to which it would be entitled in a bankruptcy distribution; or
          (B) The transfer is disapproved by the Commission.
          (iii) The transfer prior to the order for relief by a clearing organization of one or more accounts held for or on behalf of customers of the debtor, provided that (I) the money, securities, or other property accompanying such transfer did not exceed the funded balance of each account based on available information as of the close of business on the business day immediately preceding such transfer less the value on the date of return or transfer of any property previously returned or transferred thereto, and (II) the transfer is not disapproved by the Commission.
          (2) Post-relief transfers. On or after the entry of the order for relief, the following transfers to one or more transferees may not be avoided by the trustee:
          (i) The transfer of a customer account eligible to be transferred under paragraph (e) or (f) of this section made by the trustee of the commodity broker or by any self-regulatory organization of the commodity broker:
          (A) On or before the seventh calendar day after the entry of the order for relief; and
          (B) The Commission is notified in accordance with § 190.02(a)(2) prior to the transfer and does not disapprove the transfer; or
          (ii) The transfer of a customer account at the direction of the Commission on or before the seventh calendar day after the order for relief upon such terms and conditions as the Commission may deem appropriate and in the public interest.
          (3) Withdrawals prior to bankruptcy. The withdrawal or settlement of a commodity contract account by a public customer including a public customer which is a commodity broker, prior to the filing date may not be avoided by a trustee unless:
          (i) The customer making the withdrawal or settlement acted in collusion with the debtor or its principals to obtain a greater share of the bankruptcy estate than that to which such customer would be entitled in a bankruptcy distribution; or
          (ii) The withdrawal or settlement is disapproved by the Commission.
          (h) Commission action. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in appropriate cases and to protect the public interest, the Commission may:
          (1) Prohibit the transfer of customer accounts; or
          (2) Permit transfers of accounts which do not comply with the requirements of this section.

          § 190.07
          Calculation of allowed net equity.
          Allowed net equity shall be computed as follows:
          (a) Allowed claim. The allowed net equity claim of a customer shall be equal to the aggregate of the funded balances of such customer's net equity claim for each account class plus or minus the adjustments specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
          (b) Net equity. Net equity means the total claim of a customer against the estate of the debtor based on the commodity contracts held by the debtor for or on behalf of such customer less any indebtedness of the customer to the debtor. Net equity shall be calculated as follows:
          (1) Step 1—Equity determination. Determine the equity balance of each customer account by computing, with respect to such account, the sum of:
          (i) The ledger balance;
          (ii) The open trade balance; and
          (iii) The current realizable market value, determined as of the close of the market on the last preceding market day, of any securities or other property held by or for the debtor from or for such account, plus accrued interest, if any.
          (A) For the purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), the ledger balance of a customer account shall be calculated by adding:
          (1) Cash deposited to purchase, margin, guarantee, secure, or settle a commodity contract;
          (2) Except as is otherwise provided in this chapter, the cash proceeds of such cash, or of securities or other property referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section held from or for the customer by or for the account of the commodity broker; and
          (3) Gains realized on trades, and
          (B) Subtracting from the result:
          (1) Losses realized on trades;
          (2) Disbursements to or on behalf of the customer; and
          (3) The normal costs attributable to the payment of commissions, brokerage, interest, taxes, storage, transaction fees, insurance and other costs and charges lawfully incurred in connection with the purchase, sale, exercise, or liquidation of any commodity contract in such account. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), the open trade balance of a customer's account shall be computed by subtracting the unrealized loss in value of the open commodity contracts held by or for such account from the unrealized gain in value of the open commodity contracts held by or for such account. In calculating the ledger balance or open trade balance of any customer, exclude any security futures products, any gains or losses realized on trades in such products, any property received to margin, guarantee or secure such products (including interest thereon or the proceeds thereof), to the extent any of the foregoing are held in a securities account, and any disbursements to or on behalf of such customer in connection with such products or such property held in a securities account.
          (2) Step 2—Customer determination (aggregation). Aggregate the credit and debit equity balances of all accounts of the same class held by a customer in the same capacity. Paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(xiii) of this section prescribe which accounts must be treated as being held in the same capacity and which accounts must be treated as being held in a separate capacity.
          (i) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(2), all accounts which are maintained with a debtor in a person's name and which, under this paragraph (b)(2), are deemed to be held by that person in its individual capacity shall be deemed to be held in the same capacity.
          (ii) An account maintained with a debtor by a guardian, custodian, or conservator for the benefit of a ward, or for the benefit of a minor under the Uniform Gift to Minors Act, shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from accounts held by such guardian, custodian or conservator in its individual capacity.
          (iii) An account maintained with a debtor in the name of an executor or administrator of an estate shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from accounts held by such executor or administrator in its individual capacity.
          (iv) Subject to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, an account maintained with a debtor in the name of a decedent, in the name of the decedent's estate, or in the name of the executor or administrator of such estate shall be deemed to be accounts held in the same capacity.

          (v) An account maintained with a debtor by a trustee shall be deemed to be held in the individual capacity of the grantor of the trust unless the trust is created by a valid written instrument for a purpose other than avoidance of an offset under the regulations contained in this part. A trust account which is not deemed to be held in the individual capacity of its grantor under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from accounts held in an individual capacity by the trustee, by the grantor or any successor in interest of the grantor, or by any trust beneficiary, and from accounts held by any other trust.
          (vi) An account maintained with a debtor by a corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from accounts held by the shareholders, partners or members of such corporation, partnership or unincorporated association, if such entity was created for purposes other than avoidance of an offset under the regulations contained in this part.
          (vii) A hedging account of a person shall be deemed to be held in the same capacity as a speculative account of such person.

          (viii) Subject to paragraph (b)(2)(ix) of this section, the futures accounts, leverage accounts, options accounts, foreign futures accounts, delivery accounts (as defined in § 190.05(a)(2)), and cleared swaps accounts of the same person shall not be deemed to be held in separate capacities: Provided, however, that such accounts may be aggregated only in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
          (ix) An omnibus customer account of a futures commission merchant maintained with a debtor shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from the house account and any other omnibus customer account of such futures commission merchant.

          (x) A joint account maintained with the debtor shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from any account held in an individual capacity by the participants in such account, from any account held in an individual capacity by a commodity pool operator or commodity trading advisor for such account, and from any other joint account: Provided, however, That if such account is not transferred in accordance with § 190.06, it shall be deemed to be held in the same capacity as any other joint account held by identical participants and a participant's percentage interest therein shall be deemed to be held in the same capacity as any account held in an individual capacity by such participant.
          (xi) An account maintained with a debtor in the name of a plan which, on the filing date, has in effect a registration statement in accordance with the requirements of section 1031 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the regulations thereunder shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from an account held in an individual capacity by the plan administrator, any employer, employee, participant, or beneficiary with respect to such plan.
          (xii) Except as otherwise provided in this section, an account maintained with a debtor by an agent or nominee for a principal or a beneficial owner shall be deemed to be an account held in the individual capacity of such principal or beneficial owner.
          (xiii) With respect to the cleared swaps account class, each individual customer account within each omnibus customer account referred to in paragraph (ix) of this section shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from each other such individual customer account; subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (xii) of this paragraph (b)(2).
          (xiv) Accounts held by a customer in separate capacities shall be deemed to be accounts of different customers. The burden of proving that an account is held in a separate capacity shall be upon the customer.
          (3) Step 3—Setoffs. (i) The net equity of one customer account may not be offset against the net equity of any other customer.

          (ii) Any obligation which is not required to be included in computing the equity of a customer under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but which is owed by such customer to the debtor must be deducted from any obligation not required to be included in computing the equity of a customer which is owed by such debtor to the customer. If the former amount exceeds the latter, the excess must be deducted from the equity balance of the customer obtained after performing the preceding calculations required by paragraph (b) of this section: Provided, That if the customer owns more than two classes of accounts the excess must be offset against each positive equity balance in the same proportion as that positive equity balance bears to the total of all positive equity balances of accounts of different classes held by such customer.

          (iii) A negative equity balance obtained with respect to one customer account class must be set off against a positive equity balance in any other account class of such customer held in the same capacity: Provided, That if a customer owns more than two classes of accounts such balance must be offset against each positive equity balance in the same proportion as that positive equity balance bears to the total of all positive equity balances in accounts of different classes held by such customer.
          (iv) To the extent any indebtedness of the debtor to the customer which is not required to be included in computing the equity of such customer under paragraph (b)(1) of this section exceeds such indebtedness of the customer to the debtor, the customer claim therefor will constitute a general creditor's claim rather than a customer property claim, and the net equity therefor shall be separately calculated.
          (v) The rules pertaining to separate capacities and permitted setoffs contained in this section must be applied subsequent to the entry of an order for relief; prior to the filing date, the provisions of § 1.22 of this chapter and of sections 4d(a)(2) and 4d(f) of the Act (and, in each case, the regulations promulgated thereunder) shall govern what setoffs are permitted.
          (4) Step 4—Correction for distributions. The value on the date of transfer or distribution of any property transferred or distributed subsequent to the filing date and prior to the primary liquidation data with respect to each class of account held by a customer must be added to the equity obtained for that customer for accounts of that class after performing the steps contained in paragraphs (b)(1)-(3) of this section: Provided, however, That if all accounts for which there are customer claims of record and 100% of the equity pertaining thereto are transferred in accordance with § 190.06 and section 764(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, net equity shall be computed based solely upon those customer claims, if any, filed subsequent to bankruptcy which are not claims of record on the filing date.
          (5) Step 5—Correction for subsequent events. Compute any adjustments to Steps 1 through 4 of this paragraph (b) required to correct misestimates or errors including, without limitation, corrections for subsequent events such as the liquidation of unliquidated claims at a value different from the estimated value previously used in computing net equity.
          (6) Step 6—Net equity of accounts which remain open subsequent to the primary liquidation date. If the accounts of a customer contain commodity contracts which remain open subsequent to the primary liquidation date, the trustee must adjust the net equity obtained for that customer pursuant to the steps contained in paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) of this section as provided in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.
          (c) Calculation of funded balance. “Funded balance” means a customer's pro rata share of the customer estate with respect to each account class available as of the primary liquidation date for distribution to customers of the same class.
          (1) The funded balance of any customer claim shall be computed by:
          (i) Multiplying the ratio of the amount of the net equity claim less the amounts referred to in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section of such customer for any account class bears to the sum of the net equity claims less the amounts referred to in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section of all customers for accounts of that class by the sum of:

          (A) The value of the money, securities or property segregated on behalf of all accounts of the same class less the amounts referred to in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section;
          
          (B) The value of any money, securities or property which must be allocated under § 190.08 to customer accounts of the same class; and
          (C) The amount of any add-back required under paragraph (b)(4) of this section; and
          (ii) Then adding 100% of any margin payment made between the entry of the order for relief and the primary liquidation date.
          (2) Corrections to funded balance. The funded balance must be adjusted, as of the primary liquidation date, to correct for subsequent events including, without limitation:
          (i) Added claimants;
          (ii) Disallowed claims;
          (iii) Liquidation of unliquidated claims at a value other than their estimated value;
          (iv) Recovery of property; and
          (v) Deficits generated by the continued operation of accounts after the primary liquidation date which cannot be fully adjusted under paragraph (d) of this section.
          (d) Adjustments to funded balance for operations subsequent to the primary liquidation date. If accounts of a customer contain commodity contracts which remain open subsequent to the primary liquidation date, the funded balance for each class must be adjusted until liquidation or transfer of all such open commodity contracts of that customer of the same class, as follows:
          (1) Unrealized and realized gains and any receipts of margin with respect thereto must be added to the funded balance;
          (2) Unrealized and realized losses, and the normal costs attributable to the payment of commissions, brokerage, interest, taxes, storage, transaction fees and other costs and charges lawfully incurred with respect to the maintenance or liquidation of such open commodity contracts, and any distributions must be subtracted from the funded balance; and
          (3) Subject to claims against the trustee for failure to liquidate, any deficit which is not recovered from the customer on whose behalf it is incurred must be charged against the funded balance of each account which remained open on the date the deficit occurred in the same proportion as the funded balance of each account bears to all the funded balances of all accounts which remained open on that date.
          (e) Valuation. In computing net equity, commodity contracts and other property held by or for a commodity broker must be valued as provided in this paragraph (e): Provided, however, that for all commodity contracts other than those listed in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if identical commodity contracts, securities, or other property are liquidated on the same date, but cannot be liquidated at the same price, the trustee may use the weighted average of the liquidation prices in computing the net equity of each customer holding such contracts, securities, or property.
          (1) Commodity Contracts. Unless otherwise specified in this paragraph (e), the value of an open commodity contract shall be equal to the settlement price as calculated by the clearing organization pursuant to its rules: Provided, that such rules must either be submitted to the Commission, pursuant to section 5c(c)(4) of the Act and be approved by the Commission, or such rules must be otherwise approved by the Commission (or its delegate pursuant to § 190.10(d) of this part) prior to their application; Provided, further, that if such contract is transferred its value shall be determined as of the end of the settlement cycle in which it is transferred; and Provided, finally, that if such contract is liquidated, its value shall be equal to the net proceeds of liquidation.
          (2) Principal contracts. The valuation date of principal contracts which are not transferred shall be the date of the order for relief unless there is specific property which constitutes cover by the principal for the principal contract in which case it shall be the date of liquidation of the cover. For purposes of valuing contracts for which there is no established secondary market:
          (i) Cash price series approved by Commission. The market value of the physical commodity which is the subject of a principal contract shall be computed using a cash price series approved by the Commission for use by the dealer option grantor, in the case of dealer options, and by the leverage transaction merchant, in the case of leverage contracts.
          (ii) No cash price series approved by Commission. If no applicable cash price series has been submitted to the Commission, or if such a cash price series has been submitted, but has not been approved by the Commission, the market value of the physical commodity which is the subject of a principal contract shall be equal to the lesser of:
          (A) The market value of the physical commodity as of the close of business on the local cash market most proximate to the debtor's principal place of business; or

          (B) The spot month settlement price on a designated contract market which trades contracts in that physical commodity most proximate to the debtor's principal place of business: Provided, That where there is more than one local market as described in paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) (A) or (B) of this section, the trustee should use the most active market.
          (iii) Special rule for valuing dealer options. A dealer option which is in-the-money will be deemed to have been exercised for purposes of determining its value which shall be equal to the greater of:
          (A) The in-the-money amount; or

          (B) The premium paid for such option divided by the number of days contained in the option period and multiplied by the number of days remaining in such period on the liquidation date: Provided, That in the trustee's sole discretion, the trustee may reduce such value to an amount which does not exceed the average of the premiums recently paid for similar options granted by the same grantor.
          Any time value not reflected in this computation claimed by a customer must be treated as a general creditor's claim.
          (iv) Special rule for valuing leverage contracts. Notwithstanding paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section, if the records of the debtor are not sufficient to substantiate customer claims for profits and to identify the owners of contracts with losses, the liquidation value of a leverage contract shall be deemed to be an amount equal to the total deposit made by a customer in respect to such contract.
          (3) Bucketed contracts. The value of a commodity contract which has not been established in fact shall be deemed to be equal to the value of the total deposit made by a customer in respect to such contract.
          (4) Securities. The value of a listed security shall be equal to the closing price for such security on the exchange upon which it is traded. The value of all securities not traded on an exchange shall be equal in the case of a long position, to the average of the bid prices for long positions, and in the case of a short position, to the average of the asking prices for the short positions. If liquidated prior to the primary liquidation date, the value of such security shall be equal to the net proceeds of its liquidation. Securities which are not publicly traded shall be valued by the trustee, subject to approval of the court, using such professional assistance as the trustee deems necessary in its sole discretion under the circumstances.
          (5) Property. Cash commodities held in inventory, as collateral or otherwise, shall be valued at their fair market value. Subject to the other provisions of this paragraph (e), all other property shall be valued by the trustee subject to approval by the court, using such professional assistance as the trustee deems necessary in its sole discretion under the circumstances: Provided, however, That if such property is sold, its value for purposes of the calculations required by this part shall be the net proceeds of such sale: Provided further, That the sale is made in compliance with all applicable statutes, rules and orders of any court or governmental entity with jurisdiction thereover.

          § 190.08
          Allocation of property and allowance of claims.

          The property of the debtor's estate must be allocated among account classes and between customer classes as provided in this section, except for special distributions required under appendix B to this part. The property so allocated will constitute a separate estate of the customer class and the account class to which it is allocated, and will be designated by reference to such customer class and account class.
          (a) Scope of customer property. (1) Customer property includes the following:
          (i) All cash, securities, or other property or the proceeds of such cash, securities or other property received, acquired, or held by or for the account of the debtor, from or for the account of a customer, including a non-public customer, which is:
          (A) Property received, acquired or held to margin, guarantee, secure, purchase or sell a commodity contract;
          (B) Open commodity contracts;
          (C) Warehouse receipts, bills of lading, or other documents of title or property held or acquired by the debtor to fulfill a commodity contract;
          (D) Profits or contractual rights accruing to a customer as the result of a commodity contract;
          (E) The full proceeds of a letter of credit if such letter of credit was received, acquired or held to margin, guarantee, secure, purchase or sell a commodity contract;
          (F) To the extent not otherwise included, securities held in a portfolio margining account carried as a futures account or a cleared swaps customer account;
          (G) Property hypothecated under § 1.30 of this chapter to the extent that the value of such property exceeds the proceeds of any loan of margin made with respect thereto, and
          (ii) All cash, securities, or other property which:
          (A) Is segregated on the filing date;
          (B) Is a security owned by the debtor to the extent there are customer claims for securities of the same class and series of an issuer;
          (C) Is specifically identifiable to a customer;
          (D) Is property of a type described in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section which has been withdrawn and subsequently is recovered by the avoidance powers of the trustee;
          (E) Represents recovery of any debit balance, margin deficit, or other claim of the debtor against a customer account;
          (F) Was unlawfully converted but is part of the debtor's estate;
          (G) Is property of the debtor that any applicable law, rule, regulation, or order requires to be set aside for the benefit of customers, unless including such property in the customer estate would not significantly increase the customer estate;
          (H) Is property of the debtor's estate recovered by the Commission in any proceeding brought against the principals, agents, or employees of the debtor;
          (I) Is proceeds from the investment of customer property by the trustee pending final distribution; or
          (J) Is cash, securities or other property of the debtor's estate, including the debtor's trading or operating accounts and commodities of the debtor held in inventory, but only to the extent that the property enumerated in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(E) and (a)(1)(ii)(A) through (a)(1)(ii)(H) of this section is insufficient to satisfy in full all claims of public customers.
          (2) Customer property will not include:
          (i) Claims against the debtor for damages for any wrongdoing of the debtor, including claims for misrepresentation or fraud, or for any violation of the Act or of the regulations thereunder;
          (ii) Other claims for property which are not based upon property received, acquired or held by or for the account of the debtor, from or for the account of the customer;
          (iii) Forward contracts;
          (iv) Property delivered to or from a customer to or by another customer to fulfill a commodity contract held for or on behalf of either customer by the debtor if such delivery is effected pursuant to § 190.05 by a commodity broker other than the debtor;
          (v) Property deposited by a customer with a commodity broker after the entry of an order for relief which is not necessary to meet the maintenance margin requirements applicable to the accounts of such customer;

          (vi) Property hypothecated pursuant to § 1.30 of this chapter to the extent of the loan of margin with respect thereto; and
          
          (vii) Money, securities or property held to margin, guarantee or secure security futures products, or accruing as a result of such products, if held in a securities account.
          (b) Allocation of property between customer classes. No portion of the customer estate may be allocated to pay non-public customer claims until all public customer claims have been satisfied in full. Any property segregated on behalf of non-public customers must be treated initially as part of the public customer estate and allocated under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
          (c) Allocation of property among account classes—(1) Segregated property. Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, property held by or for the account of a customer, which is segregated on behalf of a specific account class, or readily traceable on the filing date to customers of such account class, must be allocated to the customer estate of the account class for which it is segregated or to which it is readily traceable.
          (2) All other property. Money, securities and property received from or for the account of customers on behalf of any account class which is recovered on behalf of the customer estate and which cannot be allocated in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, must be allocated as of the primary liquidation date in the following order:
          (i) To the estate of the account class for which, after the allocation required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the percentage of each public customer net equity claim which is funded is the lowest, until the funded percentage of net equity claims of such class equals the percentage of each public customer's net equity claim which is funded for the account class with the next lowest percentage of the funded claims; and then
          (ii) To the estate of the two account classes referred to in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section so that the percentage of the net equity claims which are funded for each class remains equal until the percentage of each public customer net equity claim which is funded equals the percentage of each public customer net equity claim which is funded for the account class with the next lowest percentage of funded claims, and so forth, until the percentage of each public customer net equity claim which is funded is equal for all classes of accounts; and then,
          (iii) Among account classes in the same proportion as the public customer net equity claims for each such account class bears to the total of public customer net equity claims of all account classes until the public customer claims of each account class are paid in full; and, thereafter,
          (iv) To the non-public customer estate for each account class in the same order as is prescribed in paragraphs (c)(2) (i) to (iii) of this section for the allocation of the customer estate among account classes.
          (d) Distribution of customer property—(1) Return or transfer of specifically identifiable property other than a commodity contract. Specifically identifiable property other than an open commodity contract not required to be liquidated under § 190.02(f)(2) may be returned or transferred on behalf of the customer to which it is identified:
          (i) If it is margining an open commodity contract, only if cash is first deposited with the trustee in an amount equal to the greater of the full fair market value of such property on the return date or the balance due on the return date on any loan by the debtor to the customer for which such property constitutes security; or

          (ii) If it is not so margining an open contract, at the option of the customer, either pursuant to the terms of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, or pursuant to the following terms: such customer first deposits cash with the trustee in an amount equal to the amount by which the greater of the value of the specifically identifiable property to be transferred or returned on the date of such transfer or return or the balance due on the return date on any loan by the debtor to the customer for which such property constitutes security, together with any other disbursements made, or to be made, to such customer, plus a reasonable reserve in the trustee's sole discretion, exceeds the estimated aggregate of the funded balances for each class of account of such customer less the value on the date of its transfer or return of any property transferred or returned prior to the primary liquidation date with respect to the customer's net equity claim for such account; Provided, That adequate security for the nonrecovery of any overpayments by the trustee is provided to the debtor's estate by the customer.
          (2) Transfers of specifically identifiable commodity contracts under section 766 of the Bankruptcy Code. Any specifically identifiable commodity contract which is not required to be liquidated under § 190.02(f)(1) or § 190.03(b), and which is not otherwise liquidated, may be transferred on behalf of a customer: Provided, That such customer must first deposit cash with the trustee in an amount equal to the amount by which the equity to be transferred to margin such contract together with any other transfers or returns of specifically identifiable property or disbursements made, or to be made, to such customer, plus a reasonable reserve in the trustee's sole discretion, exceeds the estimated aggregate of the funded balances for each class of account of such customer less the value on the date of its transfer or return of any property transferred or returned prior to the primary liquidation date with the respect to the customer's net equity claim for such account: and, Provided further, That adequate security for the nonrecovery of any overpayments by the trustee is provided to the debtor's estate by the customer.
          (3) Distribution in kind of specifically identifiable securities. If any securities of a customer would have been specifically identifiable under § 190.01(kk)(6) if that customer had had no open commodity contracts, the customer may request that the trustee purchase or otherwise obtain the largest whole number of like-kind securities, with a fair market value (inclusive of transaction costs) which does not exceed that portion of such customer's allowed net equity claim that constitutes a claim for securities, if like-kind securities can be purchased in a fair and orderly manner.
          (4) Proof of customer claim. No distribution shall be made pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(3) of this section prior to receipt of a completed proof of customer claim as described in § 190.02(d).
          (5) No differential distributions. No further disbursements may be made to customers for whom transfers have been made pursuant to § 190.06 and paragraph (d)(2) of this section, until a percentage of each net equity claim equivalent to the percentage distributed to such customers is distributed to all public customers. Partial distributions, other than the transfers referred to in § 190.06 and paragraph (d)(2) of this section, made prior to the final net equity determination date must be made pursuant to a preliminary plan of distribution approved by the court, upon notice to the parties and to all customers, which plan requires adequate security to the debtor's estate for the nonrecovery of any overpayments by the trustee and distributes an equal percentage of net equity to all public customers.
          (6) Margin payments. The trustee may make margin payments on behalf of any account which do not exceed the funded balance of that account.

          Pt. 190, App. A
          Appendix A to Part 190—Bankruptcy Forms
          Bankruptcy Appendix Form 1—Operation of the Debtor's Estate—Schedule of Trustee's Duties
          For the convenience of a prospective trustee, the Commission has constructed an approximate schedule of important duties which the trustee should perform during the early stages of a commodity broker bankruptcy proceeding. The schedule includes duties required by this part, subchapter IV of chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code as well as certain practical suggestions, but it is only intended to highlight the more significant duties and is not an exhaustive description of all the trustee's responsibilities. It also assumes that the commodity broker being liquidated is an FCM. Moreover, it is important to note that the operating facts in a particular bankruptcy proceeding may vary the schedule or obviate the need for any of the particular activities.
          All Cases
          Date of Order for Relief
          1. Assure that the commodity broker has notified the Commission, its designated self-regulatory organization (“DSRO”) (if any), and all applicable clearing organizations of which it is a member that a petition or order for relief has been filed (§ 190.02(a)(1)).
          2. Attempt to effectuate the transfer of entire customer accounts wherein the commodity contracts are transferred together with the money, securities, or other property margining, guaranteeing, or securing the commodity contracts (hereinafter the “transfer”).
          3. Attempt to estimate shortfall of customer funds segregated pursuant to sections 4d(a) and (b) of the Act; customer funds segregated pursuant to section 4f of the Act; and the foreign futures or foreign options secured amount, as defined in § 1.3 of this chapter.
          a. The trustee should:
          i. Contact the DSRO (if any) and the clearing organizations and attempt to effectuate a transfer with such shortfall under section 764(b) of the Code; notify the Commission for assistance (§ 190.02(a)(2) and (e)(1), § 190.06(b)(2), (e), (f)(3), (g)(2), and (h)) but recognize that if there is a substantial shortfall, a transfer of such funds or amounts is highly unlikely.
          ii. If a transfer cannot be effectuated, liquidate all customer commodity contracts that are margined, guaranteed, or secured by funds or amounts with such shortfall, except dealer options and specifically identifiable commodity contracts which are bona fide hedging positions (as defined in § 190.01(kk)(2)) with instructions not to be liquidated. (See §§ 190.02(f) and 190.06(d)(1)). (In this connection, depending upon the size of the debtor and other complications of liquidation, the trustee should be aware of special liquidation rules, and in particular the availability under certain circumstances of book-entry liquidation (§ 190.04(d)(1)(ii)).
          b. If there is a small shortfall in any of the funds or amounts listed in paragraph 2, negotiate with the clearing organization to effect a transfer; notify the Commission (§§ 190.02(a)(2) and (e)(1), 190.06(b)(2), (e), (f)(3), (g)(2), and (h)).

          4. Whether or not a transfer has occurred, liquidate or offset open commodity contracts not eligible for transfer (e.g., deficit accounts) (§ 190.06(e)(1)).
          5. Offset all futures contracts and Cleared Swaps contracts which cannot be settled in cash and which would otherwise remain open either beyond the last day of trading (if applicable) or the first day on which notice of intent to deliver may be tendered with respect thereto, whichever occurs first; offset all long options on a physical commodity which cannot be settled in cash, have value and would be automatically exercised or would remain open beyond the last day of exercise; and offset all short options on a physical commodity which cannot be settled in cash (§ 190.02(f)(1)).
          6. Compute estimated funded balance for each customer commodity contract account containing open commodity contracts (§ 190.04(b)) (daily thereafter).
          7. Make margin calls if necessary (§ 190.02(g)(1)) (daily thereafter).
          8. Liquidate or offset any open commodity contact account for which a customer has failed to meet a margin call (§ 190.02(f)(1)) (daily thereafter).
          9. Commence liquidation or offset of specifically identifiable property described in § 190.02(f)(2)(i) (property which has lost 10% or more of value) (and as appropriate thereafter).
          10. Commence liquidation or offset of property described in § 190.02(f)(3) (“all other property”).
          11. Be aware of any contracts in delivery position and rules pertaining to such contracts (§ 190.05).
          First Calendar Day After the Entry of an Order for Relief
          1. If a transfer occurred on the date of entry of the order for relief:
          a. Liquidate any remaining open commodity contracts, except any dealer option or specifically identifiable commodity contract [hedge] (See § 190.01(kk)(2) and § 190.02(f)(1)), and not otherwise transferred in the transfer.
          b. Primary liquidation date for transferred or liquidated commodity contracts (§ 190.01(ff)).

          2. If no transfer has yet been effected, continue attempt to negotiate transfer of open commodity contracts and dealer options (§ 190.02(c)(1)).
          3. Provide the clearing organization or Collecting Futures Commission Merchant (as such term is defined in § 22.1) with assurances to prevent liquidation of open commodity contract accounts available for transfer at the customer's instruction or liquidate all open commodity contracts except those available for transfer at a customer's instruction and dealer options.
          Second Calendar Day After the Entry of an Order for Relief
          If no transfer has yet been effected, request directly customer instructions regarding transfer of open commodity contracts and publish notice for customer instructions regarding the return of specifically identifiable property other than commodity contracts (§§ 190.02(b) (1) and (2)).
          Third Calendar Day After the Entry of an Order for Relief
          1. Second publication date for customer instructions (§ 190.02(b)(1)) (publication is to be made on two consecutive days, whether or not the second day is a business day).
          2. Last day on which to notify the Commission with regard to whether a transfer in accordance with section 764(b) of the Bankruptcy Code will take place (§ 190.02(a)(2) and § 190.06(e)).
          Sixth Calendar Day After the Entry of an Order for Relief
          Last day for customers to instruct the trustee concerning open commodity contracts (§ 190.02(b)(2)).

          2. Transfer all open dealer option contracts which have not previously been transferred (§ 190.06(f)(3)(i)).
          3. Primary liquidation date (§ 190.01(ff)) (assuming no transfers and liquidation effected for all open commodity contracts for which no customer instructions were received by the sixth calendar day).
          4. Establishment of transfer accounts (§ 190.03(a)(1)) (assuming this is the primary liquidation date); mark such accounts to market (§ 190.03(a)(2)) (daily thereafter until closed).
          5. Liquidate or offset all remaining open commodity contracts (§ 190.02(b)(2)).
          6. If not done previously, notify customers of bankruptcy and request customer proof of claim (§ 190.02(b)(4)).
          Eighth Calendar Day After the Entry of an Order for Relief

          Complete liquidation to the extent reasonably possible of specifically identifiable property which has yet to be liquidated and for which no customer instructions have been received (§ 190.03(c)).

          1. Within one calendar day after notice of receipt of filing of the petition in bankruptcy, the trustee should assure that proper notification has been given to the Commission, the commodity broker's designated self-regulatory organization (§ 190.02(a)(1)) (if any), and all applicable clearing organizations; margin calls should be issued if necessary (§ 190.02(g)(2)).

          2. On or before the seventh calendar day after the filing of a petition in bankruptcy, the trustee should use his best efforts to effect a transfer in accordance with § 190.06(e) and (f) of all open commodity contracts and equity held for or on behalf of customers of the commodity broker (§ 190.02(e)(2)) unless the debtor can provide certain assurances to the trustee.
          Bankruptcy Appendix Form 2— Request for Instructions Concerning Non-Cash Property Deposited With (Commodity Broker)
          
            Please take notice: On (date), a petition in bankruptcy was filed by [against] (commodity broker). Those customers of (commodity broker) who deposited certain kinds of non-cash property (see below) with (commodity broker) may instruct the trustee of the estate to return their property to them as provided below.

          As no customer may obtain more than his or her proportionate share of the property available to satisfy customer claims, if you instruct the trustee to return your property to you, you will be required to pay the estate, as a condition to the return of your property, an amount determined by the trustee. If your property is not margining an open contract, this amount will approximate the difference between the market value of your property and your pro rata share of the estate, as estimated by the trustee. If your property is margining an open commodity contract, this amount will be approximately the full fair market value of the property on the date of its return.
          Kinds of Property to Which This Notice Applies

          1. Any security deposited as margin which, as of (date petition was filed), was securing an open commodity contract and is:
          
          —registered in your name,
          —not transferrable by delivery, and
          —not a short-term obligation.
          2. Any fully-paid, non-exempt security held for your account in which there were no open commodity contracts as of (date petition was filed). (Rather than the return, at this time, of the specific securities you deposited with (commodity broker), you may instead request now, or at any later time, that the trustee purchase “like-kind” securities of a fair market value which does not exceed your proportionate share of the estate).
          3. Any warehouse receipt, bill of lading or other document of title deposited as margin which, as of (date petition was filed), was securing an open commodity contract and—can be identified in (commodity broker)'s records as being held for your account, and—is neither in bearer form nor otherwise transferable by delivery.
          4. Any warehouse receipt bill of lading or other document of title, or any commodity received, acquired or held by (commodity broker) to make or take delivery or exercise from or for your account and which—can be identified in (commodity broker)'s records as received from or for your account as held specifically for the purpose of delivery or exercise.
          5. Any cash or other property deposited to make or take delivery on a commodity contract may be eligible to be returned. The trustee should be contacted directly for further information if you have deposited such property with (commodity broker) and desire its return.
          
            Instructions must be received by (the 5th calendar day after 2d publication date) or the trustee will liquidate your property. (If you own such property but fail to provide the trustee with instructions, you will still have a claim against (commodity broker) but you will not be able to have your specific property returned to you).
          
          
            Note:
            Prior to receipt of your instructions, circumstances may require the trustee to liquidate your property, or transfer your property to another broker if it is margining open commodity contracts. If your property is transferred and your instructions were received within the required time, your instructions will be forwarded to the new broker.
          
          
          
            Instructions should be directed to: (Trustee's name, address, and/or telephone).
          
            Even if you request the return of your property, you must also pay the trustee the amount he specifies and provide the trustee with proof of your claim before (the 7th calendar day after 2d publication date) or your property will be liquidated. (Upon receipt of customer instructions to return property, the trustee will mail the sender a form which describes the information he must provide to substantiate his claim).
          
          
            Note:
            The trustee is required to liquidate your property despite the timely receipt of your instructions, money, and proof of claim if, for any reason, your property cannot be returned by (close of business on the 7th calendar day after 2d publication date).
          
          Bankruptcy Appendix Form 3—Request for Instructions Concerning Transfer of Your Hedge Contracts Held by (Commodity Broker)
          United States Bankruptcy Court __District of __In re __, Debtor, No. __.
          
            Please take notice: On (date), a petition in bankruptcy was filed by [against] (commodity broker).
          
          You indicated when your hedge account was opened that the commodity contracts in your hedge account should not be liquidated automatically in the event of the bankruptcy of (commodity broker), and that you wished to provide instructions at this time concerning their disposition.
          
            Instructions to transfer your commodity contracts and a cash deposit (as described below) must be received by the trustee by (the 6th calendar day after entry of order for relief) or your commodity contracts will be liquidated.
          
            If you request the transfer of your commodity contracts, prior to their transfer, you must pay the trustee in cash an amount determined by the trustee which will approximate the difference between the value of the equity margining your commodity contracts and your pro rata share of the estate plus an amount constituting security for the nonrecovery of any overpayments. In your instructions, you should specify the broker to which you wish your commodity contracts transferred.
          Be further advised that prior to receipt of your instructions, circumstances may, in any event, require the trustee to liquidate or transfer your commodity contracts. If your commodity contracts are so transferred and your instructions are received, your instructions will be forwarded to the new broker.

          Note also that the trustee is required to liquidate your positions despite the timely receipt of your instructions and money if, for any reason, you have not made arrangements to transfer and/or your contracts are not transferred by (7 calendar days after entry of order for relief).
          
            Instructions should be sent to: (Trustee's or designee's name, address, and/or telephone). [Instructions may also be provided by phone].

          Pt. 190, App. B
          Appendix B to Part 190—Special Bankruptcy Distributions
          Framework 1—Special Distribution of Customer Funds for Futures Contracts When FCM Participated in Cross-Margining
          The Commission has established the following distributional convention with respect to “customer funds” (as § 1.3 of this chapter defines such term) for futures contracts held by a futures commission merchant (FCM) that participated in a cross-margining (XM) program which shall apply if participating market professionals sign an agreement that makes reference to this distributional rule and the form of such agreement has been approved by the Commission by rule, regulation or order:

          All customer funds for futures contracts held in respect of XM accounts, regardless of the product that customers holding such accounts are trading, are required by Commission order to be segregated separately from all other customer segregated funds. For purposes of this distributional rule, XM accounts will be deemed to be commodity interest accounts and securities held in XM accounts will be deemed to be received by the FCM to margin, guarantee or secure commodity interest contracts. The maintenance of property in an XM account will result in subordination of the claim for such property to certain non-XM customer claims and thereby will operate to cause such XM claim not to be treated as a customer claim for purposes of the Securities Investors Protection Act and the XM securities to be excluded from the securities estate. This creates subclasses of futures customer accounts, an XM account and a non-XM account (a person could hold each type of account), and results in two pools of segregated funds belonging to futures customers: An XM pool and a non-XM pool. In the event that there is a shortfall in the non-XM pool of customer class segregated funds and there is no shortfall in the XM pool of customer segregated funds, all futures customer net equity claims, whether or not they arise out of the XM subclass of accounts, will be combined and will be paid pro rata out of the total pool of available XM and non-XM customer funds for futures contracts. In the event that there is a shortfall in the XM pool of customer segregated funds and there is no shortfall in the non-XM pool of customer segregated funds, then futures customer net equity claims arising from the XM subclass of accounts shall be satisfied first from the XM pool of customer segregated funds, and futures customer net equity claims arising from the non-XM subclass of accounts shall be satisfied first from the non-XM customer segregated funds. Furthermore, in the event that there is a shortfall in both the non-XM and XM pools of customer segregated funds: (1) If the non-XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation requirement in the non-XM pool is greater than or equal to the XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation requirement in the XM pool, all futures customer net equity claims will be paid pro rata; and (2) if the XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation requirement in the XM pool is greater than the non-XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation requirement of the non-XM pool, non-XM futures customer net equity claims will be paid pro rata out of the available non-XM segregated funds, and XM futures customer net equity claims will be paid pro rata out of the available XM segregated funds. In this way, non-XM customers will never be adversely affected by an XM shortfall.
          The following examples illustrate the operation of this convention. The examples assume that the FCM has two customers, one with exclusively XM accounts and one with exclusively non-XM accounts. However, the examples would apply equally if there were only one customer, with both an XM account and a non-XM account.
