      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

            <P>(iv) For purposes of this section, average daily trading volume shall be calculated monthly, using data for the most recent six-month period. If the data justify a higher or lower speculative limit for a security future, the designated contract market may raise or lower the position limit for that security future effective no earlier than the day after it has provided notification to the Commission and to the public under the submission requirements of § 41.24. If the data require imposition of a reduced position limit for a security future, the designated contract market may permit any trader holding a position in compliance with the previous position limit, but in excess of the reduced limit, to maintain such position through the expiration of the security futures contract; <E T="03">provided,</E> that the designated contract market does not find that the position poses a threat to the orderly expiration of such contract.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Final settlement prices for security futures products.</E> (1) The final settlement price of a cash-settled security futures product must fairly reflect the opening price of the underlying security or securities;</P>
            <P>(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if an opening price for one or more securities underlying a security futures product is not readily available, the final settlement price of the security futures product shall fairly reflect:</P>
            <P>(i) The price of the underlying security or securities during the most recent regular trading session for such security or securities; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The next available opening price of the underlying security or securities.</P>
            <P>(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, if a derivatives clearing organization registered under Section 5b of the Act or a clearing agency exempt from registration pursuant to Section 5b(a)(2) of the Act, to which the final settlement price of a security futures product is or would be reported determines, pursuant to its rules, that such final settlement price is not consistent with the protection of customers and the public interest, taking into account such factors as fairness to buyers and sellers of the affected security futures product, the maintenance of a fair and orderly market in such security futures product, and consistency of interpretation and practice, the clearing organization shall have the authority to determine, under its rules, a final settlement price for such security futures product.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Special requirements for physical delivery contracts.</E> For security futures products settled by actual delivery of the underlying security or securities, payment and delivery of the underlying security or securities must be effected through a clearing agency that is registered pursuant to section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</P>
            <P>(d) The Commission may exempt a designated contract market from the provisions of paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) of this section, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, if the Commission determines that such exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of customers. An exemption granted pursuant to this paragraph shall not operate as an exemption from any Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Any exemption that may be required from such rules must be obtained separately from the Securities and Exchange Commission.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Prohibition of dual trading in security futures products by floor brokers.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) Trading session means hours during which a designated contract market is scheduled to trade continuously during a trading day, as set forth in its rules, including any related post settlement trading session. A designated contract market may have more than one trading session during a trading day.</P>
            <P>(2) Member shall have the meaning set forth in section 1a(24) of the Act.</P>

            <P>(3) Broker association includes two or more designated contract market members with floor trading privileges <PRTPAGE P="16"/>of whom at least one is acting as a floor broker who:</P>
            <P>(i) Engage in floor brokerage activity on behalf of the same employer;</P>
            <P>(ii) Have an employer and employee relationship which relates to floor brokerage activity;</P>
            <P>(iii) Share profits and losses associated with their brokerage or trading activity; or</P>
            <P>(iv) Regularly share a deck of orders.</P>
            <P>(4) Customer means an account owner for which a trade is executed other than:</P>
            <P>(i) An account in which such floor broker has any interest;</P>
            <P>(ii) An account for which a floor broker has discretion;</P>
            <P>(iii) An account controlled by a person with whom a floor broker has a relationship through membership in a broker association;</P>
            <P>(iv) A house account of the floor broker's clearing member; or</P>
            <P>(v) An account for another member present on the floor of a designated contract market or an account controlled by such other member.</P>
            <P>(5) Dual trading means the execution of customer orders by a floor broker through open outcry during the same trading session in which the floor broker executes directly or by initiating and passing to another member, either through open outcry or through a trading system that electronically matches bids and offers pursuant to a predetermined algorithm, a transaction for the same security futures product on the same designated contract market for an account described in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (v) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Dual trading prohibition.</E> (1) No floor broker shall engage in dual trading in a security futures product on a designated contract market, except as otherwise provided under paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) A designated contract market operating an electronic market or electronic trading system that provides market participants with a time or place advantage or the ability to override a predetermined algorithm must submit an appropriate rule proposal to the Commission consistent with the procedures set forth in § 40.5. The proposed rule must prohibit electronic market participants with a time or place advantage or the ability to override a predetermined algorithm from trading a security futures product for accounts in which these same participants have any interest during the same trading session that they also trade the same security futures product for other accounts. This paragraph, however, is not applicable with respect to execution priorities or quantity guarantees granted to market makers who perform that function, or to market participants who receive execution priorities based on price improvement activity, in accordance with the rules governing the designated contract market.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Rules prohibiting dual trading</E>—(1) <E T="03">Designated contract markets.</E> Prior to listing a security futures product for trading on a trading floor where bids and offers are executed through open outcry, a designated contract market:</P>
            <P>(i) Must submit to the Commission in accordance with § 40.6, a rule prohibiting dual trading, together with a written certification that the rule complies with the Act and the regulations thereunder, including this section; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Must obtain Commission approval of such rule pursuant to § 40.5.</P>
            <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Specific permitted exceptions.</E> Notwithstanding the applicability of a dual trading prohibition under paragraph (b) of this section, dual trading may be permitted on a designated contract market pursuant to one or more of the following specific exceptions:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Correction of errors.</E> To offset trading errors resulting from the execution of customer orders, <E T="03">provided,</E> that the floor broker must liquidate the position in his or her personal error account resulting from that error through open outcry or through a trading system that electronically matches bids and offers as soon as practicable, but, except as provided herein, not later than the close of business on the business day following the discovery of error. In the event that a floor broker is unable to offset the error trade because the daily price fluctuation limit is reached, a trading halt is imposed by the designated contract market, or an emergency is declared pursuant to the <PRTPAGE P="17"/>rules of the designated contract market, the floor broker must liquidate the position in his or her personal error account resulting from that error as soon as practicable thereafter.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Customer consent.</E> To permit a customer to designate in writing not less than once annually a specifically identified floor broker to dual trade while executing orders for such customer's account. An account controller acting pursuant to a power of attorney may designate a dual trading broker on behalf of its customer, provided, that the customer explicitly grants in writing to the individual account controller the authority to select a dual trading broker.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Spread transactions.</E> To permit a broker who unsuccessfully attempts to leg into a spread transaction for a customer to take the executed leg into his or her personal account and to offset such position, provided, that a record is prepared and maintained to demonstrate that the customer order was for a spread.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Market emergencies.</E> To address emergency market conditions resulting in a temporary emergency action as determined by a designated contract market.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Rules permitting specific exceptions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Designated contract markets.</E> Prior to permitting dual trading under any of the exceptions provided in paragraphs (d)(1)-(4) of this section, a designated contract market:</P>
            <P>(i) Must submit to the Commission in accordance with § 40.6, a rule permitting the exception(s), together with a written certification that the rule complies with the Act and the regulations thereunder, including this section; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Must obtain Commission approval of such rule pursuant to § 40.5.</P>
            <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Unique or special characteristics of agreements, contracts or transactions, or of designated contract markets.</E> Notwithstanding the applicability of a dual trading prohibition under paragraph (b) of this section, dual trading may be permitted on a designated contract market to address unique or special characteristics of agreements, contracts, or transactions, or of the designated contract market as provided herein. Any rule of a designated contract market that would permit dual trading when it would otherwise be prohibited, based on a unique or special characteristic of agreements, contracts, or transactions, or of the designated contract market must be submitted to the Commission for prior approval under the procedures set forth in § 40.5. The rule submission must include a detailed demonstration of why an exception is warranted.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Where security futures products may be held.</E> (1) A person registered with the Commission as a futures commission merchant pursuant to section 4f(a)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”) and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) as a broker or dealer pursuant to section 15(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Securities Exchange Act”) (“Full FCM/Full BD”) may hold all of a customer's security futures products in a futures account, all of a customer's security futures products in a securities account, or some of a customer's security futures products in a futures account and other security futures products of the same customer in a securities account. A person registered with the Commission as a futures commission merchant pursuant to section 4f(a)(2) of the CEA (a notice-registered FCM) may hold a customer's security futures products only in a securities account. A person registered with the SEC as a broker or dealer pursuant to section 15(b)(11) of the Securities Exchange Act (a notice-registered broker-dealer) may hold a customer's security futures products only in a futures account.</P>
            <P>(2) A Full FCM/Full BD shall establish written policies or procedures for determining whether customer security futures products will be placed in a futures account and/or a securities account and, if applicable, the process by which a customer may elect the type or types of account in which security futures products will be held (including the procedure to be followed if a customer fails to make an election of account type).</P>

            <P>(ii) A description of the protections provided by the requirements set forth under Securities Exchange Act Rule 15c3-3 and the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 applicable to a securities account;</P>
            <P>(iii) A statement indicating whether the customer's security futures products will be held in a futures account and/or a securities account, or whether the firm permits customers to make or change an election of account type; and</P>
            <P>(iv) A statement that, with respect to holding the customer's security futures products in a securities account or a futures account, the alternative regulatory scheme is not available to the customer in connection with that account.</P>

            <P>(2) Where a customer account containing an open security futures product position is transferred to a futures commission merchant, that futures commission merchant may instead provide the statements described in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) and (b)(1)(iv) above no later than ten business days after the date the account is transferred.<PRTPAGE P="21"/>
            </P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Changes in account type.</E> A Full FCM/Full BD may change the type of account in which a customer's security futures products will be held; provided, that:</P>

            <P>(iii) Cash, securities, or other assets deposited as margin for the positions in an account are not permitted to be withdrawn from the account at any time that:</P>

            <P>(B) The withdrawal, together with other transactions, deposits, and withdrawals on the same day, would create or increase a margin deficiency if the margin equity securities were valued at their Regulation T collateral value.</P>
            <P>(2) All security futures transactions and related transactions on any day shall be combined to determine the amount of a special margin requirement. Additional margin deposited to satisfy a special margin requirement shall be valued at an amount no greater than its Regulation T collateral value.</P>
            <P>(3) If the alternative collateral valuation method set forth in paragraph (e) of this section is used with respect to an account in which security futures or related positions are carried:</P>
            <P>(i) An account that is transferred from one security futures intermediary to another may be treated as if it had been maintained by the transferee from the date of its origin, if the transferee accepts, in good faith, a signed statement of the transferor (or, if that is not practicable, of the customer), that any margin call issued under this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49) has been satisfied; and</P>
            <P>(ii) An account that is transferred from one customer to another as part of a transaction, not undertaken to avoid the requirements of this Regulation (Subpart E, §§ 41.42 through 41.49), may be treated as if it had been maintained for the transferee from the date of its origin, if the security futures intermediary accepts in good faith and keeps with the transferee account a signed statement of the transferor describing the circumstances for the transfer.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Guarantee of accounts.</E> No guarantee of a customer's account shall be given any effect for purposes of determining whether the required margin in an account is satisfied, except as permitted under applicable margin rules.</P>

The reporting obligations of registered entities and swap counterparties with respect to swaps executed prior to the applicable compliance date and in existence on or after July 21, 2010, the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, are set forth in part 46 of this chapter. This section and § 45.3 establish the general swap data reporting obligations of swap dealers, major swap participants, non-SD/MSP counterparties, swap execution facilities, designated contract markets, and derivatives clearing organizations to report swap data to a swap data repository.

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Continuation data reporting method generally.</E> For each swap, regardless of asset class, reporting counterparties and derivatives clearing organizations required to report swap continuation data must do so in a manner sufficient to ensure that all data in the swap data repository concerning the swap remains current and accurate, and includes all changes to the primary economic terms of the swap occurring during the existence of the swap. Reporting entities and counterparties fulfill this obligation by reporting either life cycle event data or state data for the swap within the applicable deadlines set forth in this section. Reporting counterparties and derivatives clearing organizations required to report swap continuation data for a swap may fulfill their obligation to report either life cycle event data or state data by reporting:</P>
          <P>(1) Life cycle event data to a swap data repository that accepts only life cycle event data reporting;</P>

          <P>(2) <E T="03">Valuation data reporting.</E> Valuation data for the swap must be reported by the derivatives clearing organization, as reporting counterparty, daily.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Continuation data reporting for original swaps.</E> For all original swaps, required continuation data, including terminations, must be reported to the <PRTPAGE P="79"/>swap data repository to which the swap that was accepted for clearing was reported pursuant to § 45.3(a) through (d) in the manner provided in § 45.13(b) and in this section, and must be accepted and recorded by such swap data repository as provided in § 49.10 of this chapter.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Life cycle event data or state data reporting.</E> The derivatives clearing organization that accepted the swap for clearing must report to the swap data repository either:</P>

          <P>(ii) All state data for the swap, reported daily.</P>
          <P>(2) In addition to all other necessary continuation data fields, life cycle event data and state data must include all of the following:</P>

          <P>(1) <E T="03">Life cycle event data or state data reporting.</E> The reporting counterparty for the swap must report to the swap data repository either all life cycle event data for the swap or all state data for the swap, within the applicable deadline set forth in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.</P>
          <P>(i) If the reporting counterparty is a swap dealer or major swap participant:</P>
          <P>(A) Life cycle event data must be reported on the same day that any life cycle event occurs, with the sole exception that life cycle event data relating to a corporate event of the non-reporting counterparty must be reported no later than the second business day after the day on which such event occurs.</P>

          <P>(B) State data must be reported daily.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Valuation data reporting.</E> Valuation data for the swap must be reported by the reporting counterparty for the swap as follows:</P>
          <P>(i) If the reporting counterparty is a swap dealer or major swap participant, the reporting counterparty must report all valuation data for the swap, daily.</P>
          <P>(ii) If the reporting counterparty is a non-SD/MSP counterparty, the reporting counterparty must report the current daily mark of the transaction as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. This report must be transmitted to the swap data repository within 30 calendar days of the end of each fiscal quarter. If a daily mark of the transaction is not available for the swap, the reporting counterparty satisfies this requirement by reporting the current valuation of the swap recorded on its books in accordance with applicable accounting standards.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Legal entity identifiers</SUBJECT>
          <P>Each counterparty to any swap subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission shall be identified in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting pursuant to this part by means of a single legal entity identifier as specified in this section.</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this section:</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Control</E> (“controlling,” “controlled by,” “under common control with”) means, for the purposes of § 45.6, the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting interest, by contract, or otherwise. A person is presumed to control another person if the person: is a director, general partner or officer exercising executive responsibility (or having similar status or functions); directly or indirectly has the right to vote 25 percent or more of a class of voting interest or has the power to sell or direct the sale of 25 percent or more of a class of voting interest; or, in the case of a partnership, has the right to receive upon dissolution, or has contributed, 25 percent or more of the capital.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Legal identifier system</E> means an LEI utility conforming with the requirements of this section that issues or is capable of issuing an LEI conforming with the requirements of this section, and is capable of maintaining LEI reference data as required by this section.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Level one reference data</E> means the minimum information needed to identify, on a verifiable basis, the legal entity to which a legal entity identifier is assigned. Level one reference data shall include, without limitation, all of the data elements included in ISO Standard 17442. Examples of level one reference data include, without limitation, a legal entity's official legal name, its place of incorporation, and the address and contact information of its corporate headquarters.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Level two reference data</E> means information concerning the corporate affiliations or company hierarchy relationships of the legal entity to which a legal entity identifier is assigned. Examples of level two reference data include, without limitation, the identity of the legal entity's ultimate parent.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Parent</E> means, for the purposes of § 45.6, a legal person that controls a counterparty to a swap required to be reported pursuant to this section, or that controls a legal entity identified or to be identified by a legal entity identifier provided by the legal identifier system designated by the Commission pursuant to this section.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Self-registration</E> means submission by a legal entity of its own level one or level two reference data, as applicable.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Third-party registration</E> means submission of level one or level two reference data, as applicable, for a legal entity that is or may become a swap counterparty, made by an entity or organization other than the legal entity identified by the submitted reference <PRTPAGE P="83"/>data. Examples of third-party registration include, without limitation, submission by a swap dealer or major swap participant of level one or level two reference data for its swap counterparties, and submission by a national numbering agency, national registration agency, or data service provider of level one or level two reference data concerning legal entities with respect to which the agency or service provider maintains information.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Ultimate parent</E> means, for the purposes of § 45.6, a legal person that controls a counterparty to a swap required to be reported pursuant to this section, or that controls a legal entity identified or to be identified by a legal entity identifier provided by the legal identifier system designated by the Commission pursuant to this section, and that itself has no parent.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">International standard for the legal entity identifier.</E> The legal entity identifier used in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting required by this part, following designation of the legal entity identifier system as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, shall be issued under, and shall conform to, ISO Standard 17442, Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), issued by the International Organisation for Standardisation.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Technical principles for the legal entity identifier.</E> The legal entity identifier used in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting required by this part shall conform to the technical principles set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Uniqueness.</E> Only one legal entity identifier shall be assigned to any legal entity, and no legal entity identifier shall ever be reused. Each entity within a corporate organization or group structure that acts as a counterparty in any swap shall have its own legal entity identifier.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Neutrality.</E> To ensure the persistence of the legal entity identifier, it shall have a format consisting of a single data field, and shall contain either no embedded intelligence or as little embedded intelligence as practicable. Entity characteristics of swap counterparties identified by legal entity identifiers shall constitute separate elements within a reference data system as set forth in paragraphs (a), (c)(2), (d), and (e) of this section.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Reliability.</E> The legal entity identifier shall be supported by a trusted and auditable method of verifying the identity of the legal entity to which it is assigned, both initially and at appropriate intervals thereafter. The issuer of legal entity identifiers shall maintain minimum reference or identification data sufficient to verify that a user has been correctly identified. Issuance and maintenance of the legal entity identifier, and storage and maintenance of all associated data, shall involve robust quality assurance practices and system safeguards. At a minimum, such system safeguards shall include the system safeguards applied to swap data repositories by part 49 of this chapter.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Open Source.</E> The schema for the legal entity identifier shall have an open standard that ensures to the greatest extent practicable that the legal entity identifier is compatible with existing automated systems of financial market infrastructures, market participants, and regulators.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Extensibility.</E> The legal entity identifier shall be capable of becoming the single international standard for unique identification of legal entities across the financial sector on a global basis. Therefore, it shall be sufficiently extensible to cover all existing and potential future legal entities of all types that may be counterparties to swap, OTC derivative, or other financial transactions; that may be involved in any aspect of the financial issuance and transactions process; or that may be subject to required due diligence by financial sector entities.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Persistence.</E> The legal entity identifier assigned to an entity shall persist despite all corporate events. When a corporate event results in a new entity, the new entity shall receive a new legal entity identifier, while the previous legal entity identifier or identifiers continue to identify the predecessor entity or entities in the record.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Governance principles for the legal entity identifier.</E> The legal entity identifier used in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting required by this part shall conform to the governance <PRTPAGE P="84"/>principles set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">International governance.</E> The issuance of the legal entity identifier used pursuant to this section, and any legal entity identifier utility formed for the purpose of issuing legal entity identifiers that are used pursuant to this section, shall be subject to international supervision as follows:</P>
          <P>(i) With respect to operations, by a governance structure that includes the Commission and other financial regulators in any jurisdiction requiring use of the legal entity identifier pursuant to applicable law. The governance structure shall have authority sufficient to ensure, and shall ensure, that issuance and maintenance of the legal entity identifier system adheres on an ongoing basis to the principles set forth in this section.</P>
          <P>(ii) With respect to adherence to ISO Standard 17442, by the International Organisation for Standardisation.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Reference data access.</E> Access to reference data associated with the legal entity identifier shall enable use of the legal entity identifier as a public good, while respecting applicable law regarding data confidentiality. Accordingly:</P>
          <P>(i) Reference data associated with the legal entity identifier that is public under applicable law shall be available publicly and free of charge. Such data shall include, without limitation, level one reference data (i.e., the minimum reference data needed to verify the identity of the legal entity receiving each legal entity identifier), and a current directory of all issued legal entity identifiers.</P>
          <P>(ii) Collection and maintenance of, and access to, reference data associated with the legal entity identifier shall comply with applicable laws on data protection and confidentiality.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Non-profit operation and funding.</E> Funding of both start-up and ongoing operation of the legal entity identifier system, including, without limitation, any legal entity identifier utility formed for the purpose of issuing legal entity identifiers that are used pursuant to this section, shall be conducted on a non-profit, reasonable cost-recovery basis, and shall be subject to international governance as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Unbundling and non-restricted use.</E> Issuance of the legal entity identifier shall not be tied to other services, if any, offered by the issuer, and information concerning the issuance process for new legal entity identifiers must be available publicly and free of charge. Restrictions shall not be imposed on use of the legal entity identifier by any person in its own products and services, or on use of the legal entity identifier and associated reference data by any financial regulator. Any intellectual property created as part of the legal entity identifier system shall be treated in a manner consistent with open source principles.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Commercial advantage prohibition.</E> The legal entity identifier utility providing legal entity identifiers for use in compliance with this part shall not make any commercial or business use (other than the operation of the utility) of any reference data associated with the legal entity identifier that is not available to the public free of charge. This restriction shall also apply to any entity or person that participates in the utility, that is legally or otherwise affiliated or associated with the utility, or that provides third-party services to the utility or to any component, partner, affiliate, or associate thereof.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Designation of the legal entity identifier system.</E> (1) The Commission shall determine, as provided in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, whether a legal entity identifier system that satisfies the requirements set forth in this section is available to provide legal entity identifiers for registered entities and swap counterparties required to comply with this part.</P>
          <P>(i) In making this determination, the Commission shall consider, without limitation, the following factors:</P>

          <P>(A) Whether the LEI provided by the LEI utility is issued under, and conforms to, <E T="03">ISO Standard 17442, Legal Entity Identifier (LEI).</E>
          </P>

          <P>(B) Whether the LEI provided by the LEI utility complies with all of the technical principles set forth in this rule.<PRTPAGE P="85"/>
          </P>
          <P>(C) Whether the LEI utility complies with all of the governance principles set forth in this rule.</P>
          <P>(D) Whether the LEI utility has demonstrated that it in fact can provide LEIs complying with this section for identification of swap counterparties in swap data reporting commencing as of the compliance dates set forth in § 45.5.</P>
          <P>(E) The acceptability of the LEI utility to industry participants required to use the LEI in complying with this part.</P>
          <P>(ii) In making this determination, the Commission shall consider all candidates meeting the criteria set forth in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, but shall not consider any candidate that does not demonstrate that it in fact can provide LEIs for identification of swap counterparties in swap data reporting commencing as of the compliance dates set forth in this part.</P>
          <P>(iii) The Commission shall make this determination at a time it believes is sufficiently prior to the compliance dates set forth this part to enable issuance of LEIs far enough in advance of those compliance dates to enable compliance with this part.</P>

          <P>(2) If the Commission determines pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section that such a legal entity identifier system is available, the Commission shall designate the legal entity identifier system as the provider of legal entity identifiers to be used in recordkeeping and swap data reporting pursuant to this part, by means of a Commission order that is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and on the Web site of the Commission, as soon as practicable after such determination is made. The order shall include notice of this designation, the contact information of the LEI utility, and information concerning the procedure and requirements for obtaining legal entity identifiers.</P>

          <P>(3) If the Commission determines pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section that such a legal entity identifier system is not yet available, the Commission shall publish notice of the determination in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and on the Web site of the Commission, as soon as practicable after the determination is made. If the Commission later determines, pursuant to paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, that such a legal entity identifier system has become available, the Commission shall designate the legal entity identifier system as the provider of legal entity identifiers to be used in recordkeeping and swap data reporting pursuant to this part, by means of a Commission order that is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and on the Web site of the Commission, as soon as practicable after such determination is made. The order shall include notice of this designation, the contact information of the LEI utility, and information concerning the procedure and requirements for obtaining legal entity identifiers.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Reference data reporting</E>—(1) <E T="03">Reporting of level one reference data.</E> Level one reference data for each counterparty to any swap subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission shall be reported, by means of self-registration, third-party registration, or both, into a public level one reference database maintained by the issuer of the legal entity identifier designated by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. Such level one reference data shall be reported at a time sufficient to ensure that the counterparty's legal entity identifier is available for inclusion in recordkeeping and swap data reporting as required by this section. All subsequent changes and corrections to level one reference data previously reported shall be reported to the issuer, by means of self-registration, third-party registration, or both, as soon as technologically practicable following occurrence of any such change or discovery of the need for a correction.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Reporting of level two reference data.</E> (i) Level two reference data for each counterparty to any swap subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, consisting of the identity of the counterparty's ultimate parent, shall be reported, by means of self-registration, third-party registration, or both, into a level two reference database. Where applicable law forbids such reporting, that fact and the citation of the law in question shall be reported in place of the data to which such law applies.<PRTPAGE P="86"/>
          </P>
          <P>(ii) All non-public level two reference data reported to the level two reference database shall be confidential, non-public, and available only to financial regulators in any jurisdiction requiring use of the legal entity identifier pursuant to applicable law.</P>

          <P>(iii) The Commission shall determine the location of the level two reference database by means of a Commission order that is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and on the Web site of the Commission, as soon as practicable after such determination is made. The order shall include notice of the location of the level two reference database, and information concerning the procedure and requirements for reporting level two reference data to the database.</P>
          <P>(iv) The obligation to report level two reference data does not apply until the Commission has determined the location of the level two reference database as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section.</P>
          <P>(v) After the Commission determines the location of the level two reference database pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, required level two reference data shall be reported at a time sufficient to ensure that it is included in the database when the counterparty's legal entity identifier is included in recordkeeping and swap data reporting as required by this section.</P>
          <P>(vi) All subsequent changes and corrections to required level two reference data previously reported shall be reported into the level two reference database, by means of self-registration, third-party registration, or both, as soon as technologically practicable following occurrence of any such change or discovery of the need for a correction.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Use of the legal entity identifier system by registered entities and swap counterparties.</E> (1) When a legal entity identifier system has been designated by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, each registered entity and swap counterparty shall use the legal entity identifier provided by that system in all recordkeeping and swap data reporting pursuant to this part.</P>
          <P>(2) Before a legal entity identifier system has been designated by the Commission, each registered entity and swap counterparty shall use a substitute counterparty identifier created and assigned by a swap data repository in all recordkeeping and swap data reporting pursuant to this part, as follows:</P>
          <P>(i) When a swap involving one or more counterparties for which no substitute counterparty identifier has yet been created and assigned is reported to a swap data repository, the swap data repository shall create a substitute counterparty identifier for each such counterparty as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, and assign the substitute counterparty identifier to that counterparty, as soon as technologically practicable after that swap is first reported to the swap data repository. In lieu of creating a substitute identifier as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii), the swap data repository may assign a unique substitute identifier provided by a third party service provider, if such identifier complies with all of the principles for LEIs set forth in this part.</P>
          <P>(ii) Each such substitute counterparty identifier created by a swap data repository shall consist of a single data field that contains two components, including:</P>

          <SUBJECT>Unique product identifiers.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Each swap subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission shall be identified in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting pursuant to this part by means of a unique product identifier and product classification system as specified in this section. Each swap sufficiently standardized to receive a unique product identifier shall be identified by a unique product identifier. Each swap not sufficiently standardized for this purpose shall be identified by its description using the product classification system.</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirements for the unique product identifier and product classification system.</E> The unique product identifier and product classification system shall identify and describe the swap asset class and the sub-type within that asset class to which the swap belongs, and the underlying product for the swap, with sufficient distinctiveness and specificity to enable the Commission and other financial regulators to fulfill their regulatory responsibilities and to assist in real time reporting of swaps as provided in the Act and part 43 of this chapter. The level of distinctiveness and specificity which the unique product identifier will provide shall be determined separately for each swap asset class.</P>

          <P>(2) When the Commission determines that such a unique product identifier and product classification system is available, the Commission shall designate the unique product identifier and product classification system to be used in recordkeeping and swap data reporting pursuant to this part, by means of a Commission order that is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and on the Web site of the Commission, as soon as practicable after such determination is made. The order shall include notice of this designation, the contact information of the issuer of such unique product identifiers, and information concerning the procedure and requirements for obtaining unique product identifiers and using the product classification system.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Use of the unique product identifier and product classification system by registered entities and swap counterparties.</E> (1) When a unique product identifier and product classification system has been designated by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, each registered entity and swap <PRTPAGE P="88"/>counterparty shall use the unique product identifier and product classification system in all recordkeeping and swap data reporting pursuant to this part.</P>
          <P>(2) Before a unique product identifier and product classification system has been designated by the Commission, each registered entity and swap counterparty shall use the internal product identifier or product description used by the swap data repository to which a swap is reported in all recordkeeping and swap data reporting pursuant to this part.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Reporting for pre-enactment and transition swaps in existence on or after April 25, 2011</E>—(1) <E T="03">Initial data report.</E> For each pre-enactment swap or transition swap in existence on or after April 25, 2011, the reporting counterparty shall report electronically to a swap data repository (or to the Commission if no swap data repository for swaps in the asset class in question is available), on the compliance date, the following:</P>
          <P>(i) All of the minimum primary economic terms data specified in appendix 1 to this part that were in the possession of the reporting counterparty on or after April 25, 2011;</P>

          <P>(ii) Swap continuation data reporting is not required for a pre-enactment or transition swap in existence on or after April 25, 2011, that has been cleared by a designated clearing organization.<PRTPAGE P="106"/>

          <P>(3) <E T="03">Data reporting for multi-asset swaps and mixed swaps.</E> (i) For each pre-enactment or transition swap in existence on or after April 25, 2011, that is a multi-asset swap, all data required to be reported by this part shall be reported to a single swap data repository that accepts swaps in the asset class treated as the primary asset class involved in the swap by the reporting counterparty making the first report of required swap creation data pursuant to this section.</P>
          <P>(ii) For each pre-enactment or transition swap in existence on or after April 25, 2011, that is a mixed swap, all data required to be reported pursuant to this part shall be reported to a swap data repository registered with the Commission and to a security-based swap data repository registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This requirement may be satisfied by reporting the mixed swap to a swap data repository or security-based swap data repository registered with both Commissions.</P>

The obligation to report continuation data as required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section with respect to a swap for which a voluntary early submission is made commences on the applicable compliance date. However, the reporting counterparty may submit continuation data at any time after a voluntary early submission made pursuant to this paragraph, if the swap data repository is prepared to accept such continuation data, and if that repository has registered with the Commission as a swap data repository as of the applicable compliance date.</P>

          <P>(a) By the compliance date, the reporting counterparty (as defined by part 45 of this chapter) for each pre-enactment or transition swap in existence on or after April 25, 2011, for which an initial data report is required by this part 46, shall obtain for itself a legal entity identifier as provided in § 45.6 of this chapter (or if the Commission has not yet designated a legal entity identifier system, a substitute counterparty identifier as provided in § 45.6(f) of this chapter), and shall include its own legal entity identifier (or substitute counterparty identifier) in the initial data report concerning the swap. With respect to the legal entity identifier (or substitute counterparty identifier) of the reporting counterparty, the reporting counterparty and the swap data repository to which the swap is reported shall comply thereafter with all unique identifier requirements of § 45.6 of this chapter.</P>

Upon receipt of the non-reporting counterparty's legal entity identifier (or substitute counterparty identifier), the reporting counterparty shall provide it to the swap data repository to which swap data for the swap was reported. Thereafter, with respect to the legal entity identifier (or substitute counterparty identifier) of the non-reporting counterparty, the counterparties to the swap and the swap data repository to which it is reported shall comply with all requirements of § 45.6 of this chapter.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 46.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Determination of which counterparty must report.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Determination of which counterparty must report swap data concerning each pre-enactment or transition swap shall be made as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) If only one counterparty is a swap dealer, the swap dealer shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.</P>
          <P>(2) If neither party is an swap dealer, and only one counterparty is an major swap participant, the major swap participant shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.</P>
          <P>(3) If both counterparties are non-SD/MSP counterparties, and only one counterparty is a financial entity as defined in CEA section 2(h)(7)(C), the counterparty that is a financial entity shall be the reporting counterparty.</P>
          <P>(4) For each pre-enactment swap or transition swap for which both counterparties are swap dealers, or both counterparties are major swap participants, or both counterparties are non-SD/MSP counterparties that are financial entities as defined in CEA section 2(h)(7)(C), or both counterparties are non-SD/MSP counterparties and neither counterparty is a financial entity as defined in CEA section 2(h)(7)(C), the counterparties shall agree which counterparty shall fulfill reporting obligations with respect to that swap; and the counterparty so selected shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.</P>

          <P>(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, for pre-enactment or transition swaps for which both counterparties are non-SD/MSP counterparties, if <PRTPAGE P="108"/>only one counterparty is a U.S. person, that counterparty shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.</P>
          <P>(b) For pre-enactment and transition swaps in existence as of the compliance date, determination of the reporting counterparty shall be made by applying the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to the current counterparties to the swap as of the compliance date, regardless of whether either or both were original counterparties to the swap when it was first executed.</P>
          <P>(c) For pre-enactment and transition swaps for which reporting is required, but which have expired or been terminated prior to the compliance date, determination of the reporting counterparty shall be made by applying the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section to the counterparties to the swap as of the date of its expiration or termination (except for determination of a counterparty's status as an SD or MSP, which shall be made as of the compliance date), regardless of whether either or both were original counterparties to the swap when it was first executed.</P>
          <P>(d) After the initial report required by § 46.3 is made, if a reporting counterparty selected pursuant to this section ceases to be a counterparty to a swap due to an assignment or novation, the reporting counterparty for reporting of required swap continuation data following the assignment or novation shall be selected from the two current counterparties as provided in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section.</P>
          <P>(1) If only one counterparty is a swap dealer, the swap dealer shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.</P>
          <P>(2) If neither counterparty is a swap dealer, and only one counterparty is a major swap participant, the major swap participant shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.</P>
          <P>(3) If both counterparties are non-SD/MSP counterparties, and only one counterparty is a U.S. person, that counterparty shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.</P>
          <P>(4) In all other cases, the counterparty that replaced the previous reporting counterparty by reason of the assignment or novation shall be the reporting counterparty, unless otherwise agreed by the counterparties.</P>

The foreign board of trade can make available for trading by direct access the additional contracts ten business days after the date of receipt by the Commission of the written request, unless the Commission notifies the foreign board of trade that additional time is needed to complete its review of policy or other issues pertinent to the additional contracts. A registered foreign board of trade may list for trading by direct access an additional futures or option contract on a non-narrow-based security index pursuant to the Commission certification procedures set forth in § 30.13(d) and appendix D to part 30 of this chapter.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Procedures for registration.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Application procedures.</E> (1) An applicant, person or entity desiring to be registered as a swap data repository shall file electronically an application for registration on Form SDR provided in appendix A to this part, with the Secretary of the Commission at its headquarters in Washington, DC in a format and in the manner specified by the Secretary of the Commission in accordance with the instructions contained therein.</P>
          <P>(2) The application shall include information sufficient to demonstrate compliance with core principles specified in Section 21 of the Act and the regulations thereunder. Form SDR consists of instructions, general questions and a list of Exhibits (documents, information and evidence) required by the Commission in order to determine whether an applicant is able to comply with the core principles. An application will not be considered to be materially complete unless the applicant has submitted, at a minimum, the exhibits as required in Form SDR. If the application is not materially complete, the Commission shall notify the applicant that the application will not be deemed to have been submitted for purposes of the 180-day review procedures.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">180-Day review procedures.</E> The Commission will review the application for registration as a swap data repository within 180 days of the date of the filing of such application. In considering an application for registration as a swap data repository, the staff of the Commission shall include in its review, an applicant's past relevant submissions and compliance history. At or prior to the conclusion of the 180-day period, the Commission will either by order grant registration; extend, by order, the 180-day review period for good cause; or deny the application for registration as a swap data repository. The 180-day review period shall commence once a completed submission on <PRTPAGE P="155"/>Form SDR is submitted to the Commission. The determination of when such submission on Form SDR is complete shall be at the sole discretion of the Commission. If deemed appropriate, the Commission may grant registration as a swap data repository subject to conditions. If the Commission denies an application for registration as a swap data repository, it shall specify the grounds for such denial. In the event of a denial of registration for a swap data repository, any person so denied shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the Commission.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Standard for approval.</E> The Commission shall grant the registration of a swap data repository if the Commission finds that such swap data repository is appropriately organized, and has the capacity: to ensure the prompt, accurate and reliable performance of its functions as a swap data repository; comply with any applicable provisions of the Act and regulations thereunder; carry out its functions in a manner consistent with the purposes of Section 21 of the Act and the regulations thereunder; and operate in a fair, equitable and consistent manner. The Commission shall deny registration of a swap data repository if it appears that the application is materially incomplete; fails in form or substance to meet the requirements of Section 21 of the Act and part 49; or is amended or supplemented in a manner that is inconsistent with this § 49.3. The Commission shall notify the applicant seeking registration that the Commission is denying the application setting forth the deficiencies in the application, and/or the manner in which the application fails to meet the requirements of this part.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Amendments and annual filing.</E> If any information reported on Form SDR or in any amendment thereto is or becomes inaccurate for any reason, whether before or after the application for registration has been granted, the swap data repository shall promptly file an amendment on Form SDR updating such information. In addition, the swap data repository shall annually file an amendment on Form SDR within 60 days after the end of each fiscal year.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Service of process.</E> Each swap data repository shall designate and authorize on Form SDR an agent in the United States, other than a Commission official, who shall accept any notice or service of process, pleadings, or other documents in any action or proceedings brought against the swap data repository to enforce the Act and the regulations thereunder.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Provisional registration.</E> The Commission, upon the request of an applicant, may grant provisional registration of a swap data repository if such applicant is in substantial compliance with the standards set forth in paragraph (a)(4) of this section and is able to demonstrate operational capability, real-time processing, multiple redundancy and robust security controls. Such provisional registration of a swap data repository shall expire on the earlier of: the date that the Commission grants or denies registration of the swap data repository; or the date that the Commission rescinds the temporary registration of the swap data repository. This paragraph (b) shall terminate within such time as determined by the Commission. A provisional registration granted by the Commission does not affect the right of the Commission to grant or deny permanent registration as provided under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Withdrawal of application for registration.</E> An applicant for registration may withdraw its application submitted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section by filing with the Commission such a request. Withdrawal of an application for registration shall not affect any action taken or to be taken by the Commission based upon actions, activities, or events occurring during the time that the application for registration was pending with the Commission, and shall not prejudice the filing of a new application by such applicant.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Reinstatement of dormant registration.</E> Before accepting or re-accepting swap transaction data, a dormant registered swap data repository as defined in § 40.1(e) of this chapter shall reinstate its registration under the procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section; provided, however, that an application for reinstatement may rely <PRTPAGE P="156"/>upon previously submitted materials that still pertain to, and accurately describe, current conditions.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Delegation of authority.</E> (1) The Commission hereby delegates, until it orders otherwise, to the Director of the Division of Market Oversight or the Director's delegates, with the consultation of the General Counsel or the General Counsel's delegates, the authority to notify an applicant seeking registration as a swap data repository pursuant to Section 21 of the Act that the application is materially incomplete and the 180-day period review period is extended.</P>
          <P>(2) The Director of the Division of Market Oversight may submit to the Commission for its consideration any matter which has been delegated in this paragraph.</P>
          <P>(3) Nothing in this paragraph prohibits the Commission, at its election, from exercising the authority delegated in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Request for confidential treatment.</E> An applicant for registration may request confidential treatment for materials submitted in its application as set forth in §§ 40.8 and 145.9 of this chapter. The applicant shall identify with particularity information in the application that will be subject to a request for confidential treatment.</P>

The request to withdraw shall be made by a person duly authorized by the registrant and shall specify:</P>
          <P>(i) The name of the registrant for which withdrawal of registration is being requested;</P>
          <P>(ii) The name, address and telephone number of the swap data repository that will have custody of data and records of the registrant;</P>

          <P>(iv) A statement that the custodial swap data repository is authorized to make such data and records available in accordance with § 1.44.</P>
          <P>(2) Prior to filing a request to withdraw, a registered swap data repository shall file an amended Form SDR to update any inaccurate information. A withdrawal of registration shall not affect any action taken or to be taken by the Commission based upon actions, activities or events occurring during the time that the facility was designated by the Commission.</P>
          <P>(b) A notice of withdrawal from registration filed by a swap data repository shall become effective for all matters (except as provided in this paragraph (b)) on the 60th day after the filing thereof with the Commission, within such longer period of time as to which such swap data repository consents or which the Commission, by order, may determine as necessary or appropriate in the public interest.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Revocation of Registration for False Application.</E> If, after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission finds that any registered swap data repository has obtained its registration by making any false or misleading statements with respect to any material fact or has violated or failed to comply with any provision of the Act and regulations thereunder, the Commission, by order, may revoke the registration. Pending final determination whether any registration shall be revoked, the Commission, by order, may suspend such registration, if such suspension appears to the Commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to be necessary or appropriate and in the public interest.</P>

The swap data repository shall notify the Commission of the consummation of the transaction on the day in which it occurs.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Certification.</E> (1) Upon a transfer of an equity interest of ten percent or more in a registered swap data repository, the registered swap data repository shall file with the Secretary of the Commission at its headquarters in Washington, <E T="03">DC</E> in a format and in the manner specified by the Secretary of the Commission, a certification that the registered swap data repository meets all of the requirements of Section 21 of the Act and Commission regulations adopted thereunder, no later than two business days, as defined in § 40.1 of this chapter, following the date on which the equity interest of ten percent or more was acquired. Such certification shall state whether changes to any aspects of the swap data repository's operations were made as a result of such change in ownership, and include a description of any such change(s).</P>
          <P>(2) The certification required under this paragraph may rely on and be supported by reference to an application for registration as a swap data repository or prior filings made pursuant to a rule submission requirement, along with any necessary new filings, including new filings that provide any and all material updates of prior submissions.</P>

          <P>(a) In the event of a corporate transaction, such as a re-organization, merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other similar corporate event, that creates a new entity, in which the swap data repository continues to operate, the swap data repository shall request a transfer of the registration, rules, and other matters, no later than 30 days after the succession. The registration of the predecessor shall be deemed to remain effective as the registration of the successor if the successor, within 30 days after such succession, files an application for registration on Form SDR, and the predecessor files a request for vacation of registration on Form SDR <E T="03">provided, however,</E> that the registration of the predecessor swap data repository shall cease to be effective 90 days after the application for registration on Form SDR is filed by the successor swap data repository.</P>
          <P>(b) If the succession is based solely on a change in the predecessor's date or state of incorporation, form of organization, or composition of a partnership, the successor may, within 30 days after the succession, amend the registration of the predecessor swap data repository on Form SDR to reflect these changes. This amendment shall be an application for registration filed by the predecessor and adopted by the successor.</P>

          <P>(2) <E T="03">Exception.</E> (A) The swap dealer, counterparty or any other registered entity that submits the swap data maintained by the registered swap data repository may permit the commercial or business use of that data by express written consent.</P>
          <P>(B) Swap data repositories shall not as a condition of the reporting of swap transaction data require a reporting party to consent to the use of any reported data for commercial or business purposes.</P>
          <P>(3) Swap data repositories responsible for the public dissemination of real-time swap data shall not make commercial use of such data prior to its public dissemination.</P>

Such duties and obligations include, without limitation: The duties set forth in § 49.19, and maintenance of a comprehensive audit trail. The swap data repository's business continuity-disaster recovery plan and resources generally should enable resumption of the swap data repository's operations and resumption of ongoing fulfillment of the swap data repository's duties and obligations during the next business day following the disruption. A swap data repository shall update its business continuity-disaster recovery plan and emergency procedures at a frequency determined by an appropriate risk analysis, but at a minimum no less frequently than annually.</P>
          <P>(e) Registered swap data repositories determined by the Commission to be critical swap data repositories are subject to more stringent requirements as set forth below.</P>
          <P>(1) Each swap data repository that the Commission determines is critical must maintain a disaster recovery plan and business continuity and disaster recovery resources, including infrastructure and personnel, sufficient to enable it to achieve a same-day recovery time objective in the event that its normal capabilities become temporarily inoperable for any reason up to and including a wide-scale disruption.</P>
          <P>(2) A same-day recovery time objective is a recovery time objective within the same business day on which normal capabilities become temporarily inoperable for any reason up to and including a wide-scale disruption.</P>
          <P>(3) To ensure its ability to achieve a same-day recovery time objective in the event of a wide-scale disruption, each swap data repository that the Commission determines is critical must maintain a degree of geographic dispersal of both infrastructure and personnel such that:</P>
          <P>(i) Infrastructure sufficient to enable the swap data repository to meet a same-day recovery time objective after interruption is located outside the relevant area of the infrastructure the entity normally relies upon to conduct activities necessary to the reporting, recordkeeping and/or dissemination of swap data, and does not rely on the same critical transportation, telecommunications, power, water, or other critical infrastructure components the entity normally relies upon for such activities; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Personnel sufficient to enable the swap data repository to meet a same-day recovery time objective, after interruption of normal swap data reporting, recordkeeping and/or dissemination by a wide-scale disruption affecting the relevant area in which the personnel the entity normally relies upon to engage in such activities are located, live and work outside that relevant area.</P>
          <P>(4) Each swap data repository that the Commission determines is critical must conduct regular, periodic tests of its business continuity and disaster recovery plans and resources and its capacity to achieve a same-day recovery time objective in the event of a wide-scale disruption. The swap data repository shall keep records of the results of such tests, and make the results available to the Commission upon request.</P>

          <P>(f) A registered swap data repository that is not determined by the Commission to be a critical swap data repository satisfies the requirement to be able to resume operations and resume ongoing fulfillment of the swap data <PRTPAGE P="174"/>repository's duties and obligations during the next business day following a disruption by maintaining either:</P>
          <P>(1) Infrastructure and personnel resources of its own that are sufficient to ensure timely recovery and resumption of its operations, duties and obligations as a registered swap data repository following any disruption of its operations; or</P>
          <P>(2) Contractual arrangements with other registered swap data repositories or disaster recovery service providers, as appropriate, that are sufficient to ensure continued fulfillment of all of the swap data repository's duties and obligations following any disruption of its operations, both with respect to all swaps reported to the swap data repository and with respect to all swap data contained in the swap data repository.</P>
          <P>(g) A registered swap data repository shall notify Commission staff promptly of all:</P>
          <P>(1) Systems malfunctions;</P>
          <P>(2) Cyber security incidents or targeted threats that actually or potentially jeopardize automated system operation, reliability, security, or capacity; and</P>
          <P>(3) Any activation of the swap data repository's business continuity-disaster recovery plan.</P>
          <P>(h) A registered swap data repository shall give Commission staff timely advance notice of all:</P>
          <P>(1) Planned changes to automated systems that may impact the reliability, security, or adequate scalable capacity of such systems; and</P>
          <P>(2) Planned changes to the swap data repository's program of risk analysis and oversight.</P>
          <P>(i) As part of a swap data repository's obligation to produce books and records in accordance with §§ 1.31 and 45.2 of this chapter, and § 49.12, a swap data repository shall provide to the Commission the following system safeguards-related books and records, promptly upon the request of any Commission representative:</P>
          <P>(1) Current copies of its business continuity-disaster recovery plans and other emergency procedures;</P>
          <P>(2) All assessments of its operational risks or system safeguards-related controls;</P>
          <P>(3) All reports concerning system safeguards testing and assessment required by this chapter, whether performed by independent contractors or by employees of the swap data repository; and</P>
          <P>(4) All other books and records requested by Commission staff in connection with Commission oversight of system safeguards pursuant to the Act or Commission regulations, or in connection with Commission maintenance of a current profile of the swap data repository's automated systems.</P>
          <P>(5) Nothing in paragraph (i) of this section shall be interpreted as reducing or limiting in any way a swap data repository's obligation to comply with §§ 1.31 and 45.2 of this chapter, or with § 49.12.</P>
          <P>(j) A swap data repository shall conduct regular, periodic, objective testing and review of its automated systems to ensure that they are reliable, secure, and have adequate scalable capacity. It shall also conduct regular, periodic testing and review of its business continuity-disaster recovery capabilities.

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Article Two: Confidentiality of Swap Data</HD>
          <P>5. ABC will be acting within the scope of its jurisdiction in requesting Swap Data and employs procedures to maintain the confidentiality of Swap Data and any information and analyses derived therefrom (collectively, the “Confidential Information”). ABC undertakes to notify the CFTC and each relevant SDR promptly of any change to ABC's scope of jurisdiction.</P>

          <P>d. Prevent the disclosure of aggregated Confidential Information; provided, however, that ABC is permitted to disclose any sufficiently aggregated Confidential Information that is anonymized to prevent identification, through disaggregation or otherwise, of a market participant's business transactions, trade data, market positions, customers or counterparties;</P>
          <P>e. Prohibit use of the Confidential Information by ABC personnel for any improper purpose, including in connection with trading for their personal benefit or for the benefit of others or with respect to any commercial or business purpose; and</P>
          <P>f. Include a process for monitoring compliance with the confidentiality safeguards described herein and for promptly notifying the CFTC, and each SDR from which ABC has received Swap Data, of any violation of such safeguards or failure to fulfill the terms of this Arrangement.</P>
          <P>7. Except as provided in Paragraphs 6.d. and 8, ABC will not onward share or otherwise disclose any Confidential Information.</P>
          <P>8. ABC undertakes that:</P>
          <P>a. If a department, central bank, or agency of the Government of the United States, it will not disclose Confidential Information except in an action or proceeding under the laws of the United States to which it, the CFTC, or the United States is a party;</P>

          <P>b. If a department or agency of a State or political subdivision thereof, it will not disclose Confidential Information except in connection with an adjudicatory action or proceeding brought under the Act or the laws of [<E T="03">name of either the State or the State and political subdivision</E>] to which it is a party; or</P>

          <P>c. If a foreign futures authority or a department, central bank, ministry, or agency of a foreign government or subdivision thereof, or any other Foreign Regulator, as defined in Commission Regulation 49.2(a)(5), it will not disclose Confidential Information except in connection with an adjudicatory action or proceeding brought under the laws of [<E T="03">name of country, political subdivision, or (if a supranational organization) supranational lawmaking body</E>] to which it is a party.</P>
          <P>9. Prior to complying with any legally enforceable demand for Confidential Information, ABC will notify the CFTC of such demand in writing, assert all available appropriate legal exemptions or privileges with respect to such Confidential Information, and use its best efforts to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information.</P>
          <P>10. ABC acknowledges that, if it does not fulfill the terms of this Arrangement, the CFTC may direct any registered SDR to suspend or revoke ABC's access to Swap Data.</P>

          <P>11. ABC will comply with all applicable security-related requirements imposed by an SDR in connection with access to Swap Data <PRTPAGE P="191"/>maintained by the SDR, as such requirements may be revised from time to time.</P>
          <P>12. ABC will promptly destroy all Confidential Information for which it no longer has a need or which no longer falls within the scope of its jurisdiction, and will certify to the CFTC, upon request, that ABC has destroyed such Confidential Information.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Article Three: Administrative Provisions</HD>
          <P>13. This Arrangement may be amended with the written consent of the Authorities.</P>

          <P>15. On the date this Arrangement is signed by the Authorities, it will become effective and may be provided to any registered SDR that holds and maintains Swap Data that falls within the scope of ABC's jurisdiction.</P>
          <P>16. This Arrangement will expire 30 days after any Authority gives written notice to the other Authority of its intention to terminate the Arrangement. In the event of termination of this Arrangement, Confidential Information will continue to remain confidential and will continue to be covered by this Arrangement.</P>

          <P>[Exhibit A: Description of Scope of Jurisdiction. If ABC is not enumerated in Commission Regulations 49.17(b)(1)(i)-(vi), it must attach the Determination Order received from the Commission pursuant to Commission Regulation 49.17(h). If ABC is enumerated in Commission Regulations 49.17(b)(1)(i)-(vi), it must attach a sufficiently detailed description of the scope of ABC's jurisdiction as it relates to Swap Data maintained by SDRs. In both cases, the description of the scope of jurisdiction must include elements allowing SDRs to establish, without undue obstacles, objective parameters for determining whether a particular Swap Data request falls within such scope of jurisdiction. Such elements could include LEIs of all jurisdictional entities and could also include UPIs of all jurisdictional products or, if no CFTC-approved UPI and product classification system is yet available, the internal product identifier or product description used by an SDR from which Swap Data is to be sought.]</P>

            <P>(a) The prohibition contained in § 75.10(a)(1) does not apply to the ownership by a banking entity of an interest in, or sponsorship of, any issuer if:</P>
            <P>(1) The issuer was established, and the interest was issued, before May 19, 2010;</P>
            <P>(2) The banking entity reasonably believes that the offering proceeds received by the issuer were invested primarily in Qualifying TruPS Collateral; and</P>
            <P>(3) The banking entity acquired such interest on or before December 10, 2013 (or acquired such interest in connection with a merger with or acquisition of a banking entity that acquired the interest on or before December 10, 2013).</P>
            <P>(b) For purposes of this § 75.16, <E T="03">Qualifying TruPS Collateral</E> shall mean any trust preferred security or subordinated debt instrument issued prior to May 19, 2010 by a depository institution holding company that, as of the end of any reporting period within 12 months immediately preceding the issuance of such trust preferred security or subordinated debt instrument, had total consolidated assets of less than $15,000,000,000 or issued prior to May 19, 2010 by a mutual holding company.</P>
            <P>(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a banking entity may act as a market maker with respect to the interests of an issuer described in paragraph (a) of this section in accordance with the applicable provisions of §§ 75.4 and 75.11.</P>
            <P>(d) Without limiting the applicability of paragraph (a) of this section, the Board, the FDIC and the OCC will make public a non-exclusive list of issuers that meet the requirements of paragraph (a).

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 75—Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements for Covered Trading Activities</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Purpose</HD>
            <P>a. This appendix sets forth reporting and recordkeeping requirements that certain banking entities must satisfy in connection with the restrictions on proprietary trading set forth in subpart B of this part (“proprietary trading restrictions”). Pursuant to § 75.20(d), this appendix generally applies to a banking entity that, together with its affiliates and subsidiaries, has significant trading assets and liabilities. These entities are required to (i) furnish periodic reports to the Commission regarding a variety of quantitative measurements of their covered trading activities, which vary depending on the scope and size of covered trading activities, and (ii) create and maintain records documenting the preparation and content of these reports. The requirements of this appendix must be incorporated into the banking entity's internal compliance program under § 75.20 and Appendix B of this part.</P>
            <P>b. The purpose of this appendix is to assist banking entities and the Commission in:</P>
            <P>(i) Better understanding and evaluating the scope, type, and profile of the banking entity's covered trading activities;</P>
            <P>(ii) Monitoring the banking entity's covered trading activities;</P>
            <P>(iii) Identifying covered trading activities that warrant further review or examination by the banking entity to verify compliance with the proprietary trading restrictions;</P>
            <P>(iv) Evaluating whether the covered trading activities of trading desks engaged in market making-related activities subject to § 75.4(b) are consistent with the requirements governing permitted market making-related activities;</P>
            <P>(v) Evaluating whether the covered trading activities of trading desks that are engaged in permitted trading activity subject to § 75.4, 75.5, or 75.6(a) and (b) (i.e., underwriting and market making-related related activity, risk-mitigating hedging, or trading in certain government obligations) are consistent with the requirement that such activity not result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies;</P>
            <P>(vi) Identifying the profile of particular covered trading activities of the banking entity, and the individual trading desks of the banking entity, to help establish the appropriate frequency and scope of examination by the Commission of such activities; and</P>
            <P>(vii) Assessing and addressing the risks associated with the banking entity's covered trading activities.</P>

            <P>c. The quantitative measurements that must be furnished pursuant to this appendix are <E T="03">not</E> intended to serve as a dispositive tool for the identification of permissible or impermissible activities.</P>
            <P>d. In order to allow banking entities and the Agencies to evaluate the effectiveness of these metrics, banking entities must collect and report these metrics for all trading desks beginning on the dates established in § 75.20. The Agencies will review the data collected and revise this collection requirement as appropriate based on a review of the data collected prior to September 30, 2015.</P>

            <P>e. In addition to the quantitative measurements required in this appendix, a banking entity may need to develop and implement other quantitative measurements in order to effectively monitor its covered trading activities for compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part and to have an effective compliance program, as required by § 75.20 and Appendix B of this part. The effectiveness of particular quantitative measurements may differ based on the profile of the banking entity's businesses in general and, more specifically, of the particular trading desk, including types of instruments traded, <PRTPAGE P="235"/>trading activities and strategies, and history and experience (e.g., whether the trading desk is an established, successful market maker or a new entrant to a competitive market). In all cases, banking entities must ensure that they have robust measures in place to identify and monitor the risks taken in their trading activities, to ensure that the activities are within risk tolerances established by the banking entity, and to monitor and examine for compliance with the proprietary trading restrictions in this part.</P>
            <P>f. On an ongoing basis, banking entities must carefully monitor, review, and evaluate all furnished quantitative measurements, as well as any others that they choose to utilize in order to maintain compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part. All measurement results that indicate a heightened risk of impermissible proprietary trading, including with respect to otherwise-permitted activities under §§ 75.4 through 75.6(a) and (b), or that result in a material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies, must be escalated within the banking entity for review, further analysis, explanation to the Commission, and remediation, where appropriate. The quantitative measurements discussed in this appendix should be helpful to banking entities in identifying and managing the risks related to their covered trading activities.</P>

            <P>i. <E T="03">Description:</E> For purposes of this appendix, Risk and Position Limits are the constraints that define the amount of risk that a trading desk is permitted to take at a point in time, as defined by the banking entity for a specific trading desk. Usage represents the portion of the trading desk's limits that are accounted for by the current activity of the desk. Risk and position limits and their usage are key risk management tools used to control and monitor risk taking and include, but are not limited, to the limits set out in §§ 75.4 and 75.5. A number of the metrics that are described below, including “Risk Factor Sensitivities” and “Value-at-Risk and Stress Value-at-Risk,” relate to a trading desk's risk and position limits and are useful in evaluating and setting these limits in the broader context of the trading desk's overall activities, particularly for the market making activities under § 75.4(b) and hedging activity under § 75.5. Accordingly, the limits required under §§ 75.4(b)(2)(iii) and 75.5(b)(1)(i) must meet the applicable requirements under §§ 75.4(b)(2)(iii) and 75.5(b)(1)(i) <PRTPAGE P="236"/>and also must include appropriate metrics for the trading desk limits including, at a minimum, the “Risk Factor Sensitivities” and “Value-at-Risk and Stress Value-at-Risk” metrics except to the extent any of the “Risk Factor Sensitivities” or “Value-at-Risk and Stress Value-at-Risk” metrics are demonstrably ineffective for measuring and monitoring the risks of a trading desk based on the types of positions traded by, and risk exposures of, that desk.</P>
            <P>ii. <E T="03">General Calculation Guidance:</E> Risk and Position Limits must be reported in the format used by the banking entity for the purposes of risk management of each trading desk. Risk and Position Limits are often expressed in terms of risk measures, such as VaR and Risk Factor Sensitivities, but may also be expressed in terms of other observable criteria, such as net open positions. When criteria other than VaR or Risk Factor Sensitivities are used to define the Risk and Position Limits, both the value of the Risk and Position Limits and the value of the variables used to assess whether these limits have been reached must be reported.</P>
            <P>iii. <E T="03">Calculation Period:</E> One trading day.</P>
            <P>iv. <E T="03">Measurement Frequency:</E> Daily.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Risk Factor Sensitivities</HD>
            <P>i. <E T="03">Description:</E> For purposes of this appendix, Risk Factor Sensitivities are changes in a trading desk's Comprehensive Profit and Loss that are expected to occur in the event of a change in one or more underlying variables that are significant sources of the trading desk's profitability and risk.</P>
            <P>ii. <E T="03">General Calculation Guidance:</E> A banking entity must report the Risk Factor Sensitivities that are monitored and managed as part of the trading desk's overall risk management policy. The underlying data and methods used to compute a trading desk's Risk Factor Sensitivities will depend on the specific function of the trading desk and the internal risk management models employed. The number and type of Risk Factor Sensitivities that are monitored and managed by a trading desk, and furnished to the Commission, will depend on the explicit risks assumed by the trading desk. In general, however, reported Risk Factor Sensitivities must be sufficiently granular to account for a preponderance of the expected price variation in the trading desk's holdings.</P>
            <P>A. Trading desks must take into account any relevant factors in calculating Risk Factor Sensitivities, including, for example, the following with respect to particular asset classes:</P>
            <P>• <E T="03">Commodity derivative positions:</E> risk factors with respect to the related commodities set out in § 20.2 of this chapter, the maturity of the positions, volatility and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), and the maturity profile of the positions;</P>
            <P>• <E T="03">Credit positions:</E> risk factors with respect to credit spreads that are sufficiently granular to account for specific credit sectors and market segments, the maturity profile of the positions, and risk factors with respect to interest rates of all relevant maturities;</P>
            <P>• <E T="03">Credit-related derivative positions:</E> risk factor sensitivities, for example credit spreads, shifts (parallel and non-parallel) in credit spreads—volatility, and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), and the maturity profile of the positions;</P>
            <P>• <E T="03">Equity derivative positions:</E> risk factor sensitivities such as equity positions, volatility, and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), and the maturity profile of the positions;</P>
            <P>• <E T="03">Equity positions:</E> risk factors for equity prices and risk factors that differentiate between important equity market sectors and segments, such as a small capitalization equities and international equities;</P>
            <P>• <E T="03">Foreign exchange derivative positions:</E> risk factors with respect to major currency pairs and maturities, exposure to interest rates at relevant maturities, volatility, and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), as well as the maturity profile of the positions; and</P>
            <P>• <E T="03">Interest rate positions, including interest rate derivative positions:</E> risk factors with respect to major interest rate categories and maturities and volatility and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), and shifts (parallel and non-parallel) in the interest rate curve, as well as the maturity profile of the positions.</P>
            <P>B. The methods used by a banking entity to calculate sensitivities to a common factor shared by multiple trading desks, such as an equity price factor, must be applied consistently across its trading desks so that the sensitivities can be compared from one trading desk to another.</P>
            <P>iii. <E T="03">Calculation Period:</E> One trading day.</P>

            <P>i. <E T="03">Description:</E> For purposes of this appendix, Value-at-Risk (“VaR”) is the commonly used percentile measurement of the risk of future financial loss in the value of a given set of aggregated positions over a specified period of time, based on current market conditions. For purposes of this appendix, Stress Value-at-Risk (“Stress VaR”) is the percentile measurement of the risk of future financial loss in the value of a given set of aggregated positions over a specified period of time, based on market conditions during a period of significant financial stress.<PRTPAGE P="237"/>
            </P>
            <P>ii. <E T="03">General Calculation Guidance:</E> Banking entities must compute and report VaR and Stress VaR by employing generally accepted standards and methods of calculation. VaR should reflect a loss in a trading desk that is expected to be exceeded less than one percent of the time over a one-day period. For those banking entities that are subject to regulatory capital requirements imposed by a Federal banking agency, VaR and Stress VaR must be computed and reported in a manner that is consistent with such regulatory capital requirements. In cases where a trading desk does not have a standalone VaR or Stress VaR calculation but is part of a larger aggregation of positions for which a VaR or Stress VaR calculation is performed, a VaR or Stress VaR calculation that includes only the trading desk's holdings must be performed consistent with the VaR or Stress VaR model and methodology used for the larger aggregation of positions.</P>

            <P>i. <E T="03">Description:</E> For purposes of this appendix, Comprehensive Profit and Loss Attribution is an analysis that attributes the daily fluctuation in the value of a trading desk's positions to various sources. First, the daily profit and loss of the aggregated positions is divided into three categories: (i) Profit and loss attributable to a trading desk's existing positions that were also positions held by the trading desk as of the end of the prior day (“existing positions”); (ii) profit and loss attributable to new positions resulting from the current day's trading activity (“new positions”); and (iii) residual profit and loss that cannot be specifically attributed to existing positions or new positions. The sum of (i), (ii), and (iii) must equal the trading desk's comprehensive profit and loss at each point in time. In addition, profit and loss measurements must calculate volatility of comprehensive profit and loss (i.e., the standard deviation of the trading desk's one-day profit and loss, in dollar terms) for the reporting period for at least a 30-, 60- and 90-day lag period, from the end of the reporting period, and any other period that the banking entity deems necessary to meet the requirements of the rule.</P>
            <P>A. The comprehensive profit and loss associated with existing positions must reflect changes in the value of these positions on the applicable day. The comprehensive profit and loss from existing positions must be further attributed, as applicable, to changes in (i) the specific Risk Factors and other factors that are monitored and managed as part of the trading desk's overall risk management policies and procedures; and (ii) any other applicable elements, such as cash flows, carry, changes in reserves, and the correction, cancellation, or exercise of a trade.</P>
            <P>B. The comprehensive profit and loss attributed to new positions must reflect commissions and fee income or expense and market gains or losses associated with transactions executed on the applicable day. New positions include purchases and sales of financial instruments and other assets/liabilities and negotiated amendments to existing positions. The comprehensive profit and loss from new positions may be reported in the aggregate and does not need to be further attributed to specific sources.</P>
            <P>C. The portion of comprehensive profit and loss that cannot be specifically attributed to known sources must be allocated to a residual category identified as an unexplained portion of the comprehensive profit and loss. Significant unexplained profit and loss must be escalated for further investigation and analysis.</P>
            <P>ii. <E T="03">General Calculation Guidance:</E> The specific categories used by a trading desk in the attribution analysis and amount of detail for the analysis should be tailored to the type and amount of trading activities undertaken by the trading desk. The new position attribution must be computed by calculating the difference between the prices at which instruments were bought and/or sold and the prices at which those instruments are marked to market at the close of business on that day multiplied by the notional or principal amount of each purchase or sale. Any fees, commissions, or other payments received (paid) that are associated with transactions executed on that day must be added (subtracted) from such difference. These factors must be measured consistently over time to facilitate historical comparisons.</P>

A trade count based ratio must be computed that records the number of transactions involving a counterparty that is a customer of the trading desk and the number of transactions involving a counterparty that is not a customer of the trading desk. A value based ratio must be computed that records the value of transactions involving a counterparty that is a customer of the trading desk and the value of transactions involving a counterparty that is not a customer of the trading desk.</P>
            <P>ii. <E T="03">General Calculation Guidance:</E> For purposes of calculating the Customer-Facing Trade Ratio, a counterparty is considered to be a customer of the trading desk if the counterparty is a market participant that makes use of the banking entity's market making-related services by obtaining such services, responding to quotations, or entering into a continuing relationship with respect to such services. However, a trading desk or other organizational unit of another banking entity would not be a client, customer, or counterparty of the trading desk if the other entity has trading assets and liabilities of $50 billion or more as measured in accordance with § 75.20(d)(1) unless the trading desk documents how and why a particular trading desk or other organizational unit of the entity should be treated as a client, customer, or counterparty of the trading desk. Transactions conducted anonymously on an exchange or similar trading facility that permits trading on behalf of a broad range of market participants would be considered transactions with customers of the trading desk. For derivatives, other than options, and interest rate derivatives, value means gross notional value, for options, value means delta adjusted notional value, and for interest rate derivatives, value means 10-year bond equivalent value.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Overview</HD>
            <P>Section 75.20(c) requires certain banking entities to establish, maintain, and enforce an enhanced compliance program that includes the requirements and standards in this Appendix as well as the minimum written policies and procedures, internal controls, management framework, independent testing, training, and recordkeeping provisions outlined in § 75.20. This Appendix sets forth additional minimum standards with respect to the establishment, oversight, maintenance, and enforcement by these banking entities of an enhanced internal compliance program for ensuring and monitoring compliance with the prohibitions and restrictions on proprietary trading and covered fund activities and investments set forth in section 13 of the BHC Act and this part.</P>
            <P>a. This compliance program must:</P>
            <P>1. Be reasonably designed to identify, document, monitor, and report the permitted trading and covered fund activities and investments of the banking entity; identify, monitor and promptly address the risks of these covered activities and investments and potential areas of noncompliance; and prevent activities or investments prohibited by, or that do not comply with, section 13 of the BHC Act and this part;</P>
            <P>2. Establish and enforce appropriate limits on the covered activities and investments of the banking entity, including limits on the size, scope, complexity, and risks of the individual activities or investments consistent with the requirements of section 13 of the BHC Act and this part;</P>
            <P>3. Subject the effectiveness of the compliance program to periodic independent review and testing, and ensure that the entity's internal audit, corporate compliance and internal control functions involved in review and testing are effective and independent;</P>

            <P>4. Make senior management, and others as appropriate, accountable for the effective implementation of the compliance program, <PRTPAGE P="239"/>and ensure that the board of directors and chief executive officer (or equivalent) of the banking entity review the effectiveness of the compliance program; and</P>
            <P>5. Facilitate supervision and examination by the Agencies of the banking entity's permitted trading and covered fund activities and investments.</P>

A banking entity must devote adequate resources and use knowledgeable personnel in conducting, supervising and managing its trading activities, and promote consistency, independence and rigor in implementing its risk controls and compliance efforts. The compliance program must be updated with a frequency sufficient to account for changes in the activities of the banking entity, results of independent testing of the program, identification of weaknesses in the program, and changes in legal, regulatory or other requirements.</P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Trading Desks:</E> The banking entity must have written policies and procedures governing each trading desk that include a description of:</P>
            <P>i. The process for identifying, authorizing and documenting financial instruments each trading desk may purchase or sell, with separate documentation for market making-related activities conducted in reliance on § 75.4(b) and for hedging activity conducted in reliance on § 75.5;</P>

Risk assessments must take into account both the risks inherent in the trading activity and the strength and effectiveness of controls designed to mitigate those risks;</P>
            <P>vi. How the risks allocated to each trading desk will be measured;</P>
            <P>vii. Why the allocated risks levels are appropriate to the activities authorized for the trading desk;</P>

            <P>2. <E T="03">Description of risks and risk management processes:</E> The compliance program for the banking entity must include a comprehensive description of the risk management program for the trading activity of the banking entity. The compliance program must also include a description of the governance, approval, reporting, escalation, review and other processes the banking entity will use to reasonably ensure that trading activity is conducted in compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part. Trading activity in similar financial instruments should be subject to similar governance, limits, testing, controls, and review, unless the banking entity specifically determines to establish different limits or processes and documents those differences. Descriptions must include, at a minimum, the following elements:</P>

            <P>i. A description of the supervisory and risk management structure governing all trading activity, including a description of processes <PRTPAGE P="240"/>for initial and senior-level review of new products and new strategies;</P>

            <P>vi. The role of the audit, compliance, risk management and other relevant units for conducting independent testing of trading and hedging activities, techniques and strategies.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Authorized risks, instruments, and products.</E> The banking entity must implement and enforce limits and internal controls for each trading desk that are reasonably designed to ensure that trading activity is conducted in conformance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part and with the banking entity's written policies and procedures. The banking entity must establish and enforce risk limits appropriate for the activity of each trading desk. These limits should be based on probabilistic and non-probabilistic measures of potential loss (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Value-at-Risk and notional exposure, respectively), and measured under normal and stress market conditions. At a minimum, these internal controls must monitor, establish and enforce limits on:</P>
            <P>i. The financial instruments (including, at a minimum, by type and exposure) that the trading desk may trade;</P>
            <P>ii. The types and levels of risks that may be taken by each trading desk; and</P>

            <P>ii. The manner in which the banking entity will identify the risks arising in connection with and related to the individual or aggregated positions, contracts or other holdings of the banking entity that are to be hedged and determine that those risks have been properly and effectively hedged;</P>
            <P>iii. The level of the organization at which hedging activity and management will occur;</P>
            <P>iv. The manner in which hedging strategies will be monitored and the personnel responsible for such monitoring;</P>
            <P>v. The risk management processes used to control unhedged or residual risks; and</P>
            <P>vi. The process for developing, documenting, testing, approving and reviewing all hedging positions, techniques and strategies permitted for each trading desk and for the banking entity in reliance on § 75.5.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Analysis and quantitative measurements.</E> The banking entity must perform robust analysis and quantitative measurement of its trading activities that is reasonably designed to ensure that the trading activity of each trading desk is consistent with the banking entity's compliance program; monitor and assist in the identification of potential and actual prohibited proprietary trading activity; and prevent the occurrence of prohibited proprietary trading. Analysis and models used to determine, measure and limit risk must be rigorously tested and be reviewed by management responsible for trading activity to ensure that trading activities, limits, strategies, and hedging activities do not understate the risk and exposure to the banking entity or allow prohibited proprietary trading. This review should include periodic and independent back-testing and revision of activities, limits, strategies and hedging as appropriate to contain risk and ensure compliance. In addition to the quantitative measurements reported by any banking entity subject to Appendix A of this part, each banking entity must develop and implement, to the extent appropriate to facilitate compliance with this part, additional quantitative measurements specifically tailored to the particular risks, practices, and strategies of its trading desks. The banking entity's analysis and quantitative measurements must incorporate the quantitative measurements reported by the banking entity pursuant to Appendix A of this part (if applicable) and include, at a minimum, the following:</P>
            <P>i. Internal controls and written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure the accuracy and integrity of quantitative measurements;</P>
            <P>ii. Ongoing, timely monitoring and review of calculated quantitative measurements;</P>

            <P>iii. The establishment of numerical thresholds and appropriate trading measures for each trading desk and heightened review of trading activity not consistent with those <PRTPAGE P="241"/>thresholds to ensure compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part, including analysis of the measurement results or other information, appropriate escalation procedures, and documentation related to the review; and</P>

            <P>iv. Immediate review and compliance investigation of the trading desk's activities, escalation to senior management with oversight responsibilities for the applicable trading desk, timely notification to the Commission, appropriate remedial action (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> divesting of impermissible positions, cessation of impermissible activity, disciplinary actions), and documentation of the investigation findings and remedial action taken when quantitative measurements or other information, considered together with the facts and circumstances, or findings of internal audit, independent testing or other review suggest a reasonable likelihood that the trading desk has violated any part of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Other Compliance Matters.</E> In addition to the requirements specified above, the banking entity's compliance program must:</P>
            <P>i. Identify activities of each trading desk that will be conducted in reliance on exemptions contained in §§ 75.4 through 75.6, including an explanation of:</P>
            <P>A. How and where in the organization the activity occurs; and</P>
            <P>B. Which exemption is being relied on and how the activity meets the specific requirements for reliance on the applicable exemption;</P>
            <P>ii. Include an explanation of the process for documenting, approving and reviewing actions taken pursuant to the liquidity management plan, where in the organization this activity occurs, the securities permissible for liquidity management, the process for ensuring that liquidity management activities are not conducted for the purpose of prohibited proprietary trading, and the process for ensuring that securities purchased as part of the liquidity management plan are highly liquid and conform to the requirements of this part;</P>
            <P>iii. Describe how the banking entity monitors for and prohibits potential or actual material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies presented by each trading desk that relies on the exemptions contained in §§ 75.3(d)(3) and 75.4 through 75.6, which must take into account potential or actual exposure to:</P>
            <P>A. Assets whose values cannot be externally priced or, where valuation is reliant on pricing models, whose model inputs cannot be externally validated;</P>
            <P>B. Assets whose changes in value cannot be adequately mitigated by effective hedging;</P>
            <P>C. New products with rapid growth, including those that do not have a market history;</P>
            <P>D. Assets or strategies that include significant embedded leverage;</P>
            <P>E. Assets or strategies that have demonstrated significant historical volatility;</P>
            <P>F. Assets or strategies for which the application of capital and liquidity standards would not adequately account for the risk; and</P>
            <P>G. Assets or strategies that result in large and significant concentrations to sectors, risk factors, or counterparties;</P>
            <P>iv. Establish responsibility for compliance with the reporting and recordkeeping requirements of subpart B of this part and § 75.20; and</P>

The compliance program must describe procedures for identifying and remedying violations of section 13 of the BHC Act and this part, and must include, at a minimum, a requirement to promptly document, address and remedy any violation of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part, and document all proposed and actual remediation efforts. The compliance program must include specific written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to assess the extent to which any activity indicates that modification to the banking entity's compliance program is warranted and to ensure that appropriate modifications are implemented. The written policies and procedures must provide for prompt notification to appropriate management, including senior management and the board of directors, of any material weakness or significant deficiencies in the design or implementation of the compliance program of the banking entity.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">b. Covered Fund Activities or Investments</HD>
            <P>A banking entity must establish, maintain and enforce a compliance program that includes written policies and procedures that are appropriate for the types, size, complexity and risks of the covered fund and related activities conducted and investments made, by the banking entity.</P>

            <P>2. <E T="03">Identification of covered fund activities and investments.</E> The banking entity's compliance program must identify, document and map each unit within the organization that is permitted to acquire or hold an interest in any covered fund or sponsor any covered fund and map each unit to the division, business line, or other organizational structure that will be responsible for managing and overseeing that unit's activities and investments.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Explanation of compliance.</E> The banking entity's compliance program must explain how:</P>
            <P>i. The banking entity monitors for and prohibits potential or actual material conflicts of interest between the banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties related to its covered fund activities and investments;</P>
            <P>ii. The banking entity monitors for and prohibits potential or actual transactions or activities that may threaten the safety and soundness of the banking entity related to its covered fund activities and investments; and</P>
            <P>iii. The banking entity monitors for and prohibits potential or actual material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies presented by its covered fund activities and investments, taking into account potential or actual exposure to:</P>
            <P>A. Assets whose values cannot be externally priced or, where valuation is reliant on pricing models, whose model inputs cannot be externally validated;</P>
            <P>B. Assets whose changes in values cannot be adequately mitigated by effective hedging;</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requests for exemptive, no-action and interpretative letters.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For the purpose of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Exemptive letter</E> means a written grant of relief issued by the staff of a Division of the Commission from the applicability of a specific provision of the Act or of a rule, regulation or order issued thereunder by the Commission. An exemptive letter may only be issued by staff of a Division when the Commission itself has exemptive authority and that authority has been delegated by the Commission to the Division in question. An exemptive letter binds the Commission and its staff with respect to the relief provided therein. Only the Beneficiary may rely upon the exemptive letter.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">No-action letter</E> means a written statement issued by the staff of a Division of the Commission or of the Office of the General Counsel that it will not recommend enforcement action to the Commission for failure to comply with a specific provision of the Act or of a Commission rule, regulation or order if a proposed transaction is completed or a proposed activity is conducted by the Beneficiary. A no-action letter represents the position only of the Division that issued it, or the Office of the General Counsel if issued thereby. A no-action letter binds only the issuing Division or the Office of the General Counsel, as applicable, and not the Commission or other Commission staff. Only the Beneficiary may rely upon the no-action letter.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Interpretative letter</E> means written advice or guidance issued by the staff of a Division of the Commission or the Office of the General Counsel. An interpretative letter binds only the issuing Division or the Office of the General Counsel, as applicable, and does not bind the Commission or other Commission staff. An interpretative letter may be relied upon by persons in addition to the Beneficiary.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Letter</E> means an exemptive, no-action or interpretative letter.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Division</E> means the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight, the Division of Clearing and Risk or the Division of Market Oversight.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> (1) Issuance of a Letter is entirely within the discretion of Commission staff.</P>

            <P>(3) The request must relate to a proposed transaction or a proposed activity. Absent extraordinary circumstances, Commission staff will not issue a Letter based upon transactions or activities that have been completed or activities that have been conducted prior to the date upon which the request is filed with the Commission.</P>

            <P>(4) The request must be made by or on behalf of the person whose activities or transactions are the subject of the request. Commission staff will not respond to a request for a Letter that is made by or on behalf of an unidentified person.<PRTPAGE P="258"/>
            </P>
            <P>(5)(i) The request must set forth as completely as possible all material facts and circumstances giving rise to the request.</P>

            <P>(ii) Commission staff will not respond to a request based on a hypothetical situation. However, a requester may set forth one or more alternative structures or fact situations for a proposed transaction or activity; <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the request complies with this section with respect to each alternative structure or fact situation.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Information requirements.</E> Each request for a Letter must comply with the following information requirements:</P>
            <P>(1)(i) A request made by the person on whose behalf the Letter is sought must contain:</P>

            <P>(ii) When made by a requester other than the person on whose behalf the Letter is sought, the request must contain:</P>
            <P>(A) The name, main business address and main business telephone number of the requester;</P>
            <P>(B) The name and, if applicable, the National Futures Association registration identification number of the person on whose behalf the Letter is sought; and</P>

            <FP>and</FP>
            <P>(ii) An undertaking made by the person on whose behalf the Letter is sought or by that person's authorized representative that, if at any time prior to issuance of a Letter, any material representation made in the request ceases to be true and complete, the person who made the undertaking will ensure that Commission staff is informed promptly in writing of all materially changed facts and circumstances. If a material change in facts or circumstances occurs subsequent to issuance of a Letter, the person on whose behalf the Letter is sought (or that person's authorized representative at the time of the change) must promptly so inform Commission staff.</P>
            <P>(4) The request must identify the type of relief requested and Letter sought and must clearly state why a Letter is needed. The request must identify all relevant legal and factual issues and discuss the legal and public policy bases supporting issuance of the Letter.</P>

Citation of a representative sample of prior Letters is sufficient <PRTPAGE P="259"/>where a comprehensive recitation of prior Letters on a given topic would be repetitious or would not assist the staff in considering the request.</P>
            <P>(7) Requests may ask that, if the requested exemptive relief, no-action position or interpretative guidance is denied, the staff consider granting alternative relief or adopting an alternative position.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Filing requirements.</E> Each request for a Letter must comply with the following filing requirements:</P>

A member or employee considering such arrangements should consult with the Office of General Counsel in advance for approval. Should a member or employee gain knowledge of an actual futures, commodity option, or swap transaction entered into by an operation described in paragraph (c) of this section that has already taken place and the market position represented by that transaction remains open, he or she should promptly report that fact and all other details to the General Counsel and seek advice as to what action, including recusal from any particular matter that will have a direct and predictable effect on the financial interest in question, may be appropriate.</P>

            </FTNT>
            <P>(2) The acceptance or exercise of any stock option or similar right granted by an employer as part of a compensation package to a spouse or minor child or other related member of the immediate household of a member or employee, or to the exercise of any stock option or similar right granted to the member or employee by a previous employer prior to commencement of the member's or employee's tenure with the Commission as part of such member's or employee's compensation package from such previous employer;</P>

            <P>(e) <E T="03">No prohibition on stocks or funds.</E> Nothing in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section shall prohibit a member or employee from purchasing, selling, or retaining any share that represents ownership of a publicly-owned corporation or interest in a publicly-available pooled investment vehicle containing any such shares (such as a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund) other than one operated by a person who is a commodity pool operator with respect to such pooled investment vehicle, regardless of whether any security futures product may at any time be or have been based upon shares of such corporation or pooled investment vehicle, and regardless of whether such pooled investment vehicle may, by design or effect, track or follow any group of securities that also underlies a futures contract.</P>

            <P>(C) Any agent or representative of any such unit or such organization, while acting as such.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Gift</E> means a tangible or intangible present (other than a decoration) tendered by, or received from, a foreign government, except grants and other forms of assistance to which section 108A of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 applies.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Decoration</E> means an order, device, medal, badge, insignia, emblem, or award tendered by, or received from, a foreign government.</P>

            <P>(b) Commission members and employees shall not:</P>
            <P>(1) Request or otherwise encourage the tender of a gift or decoration;</P>

            <P>(c) Gifts which may be accepted:</P>
            <P>(1) Commission members and employees may accept and retain gifts of minimal value tendered or received as a souvenir or mark of courtesy from a foreign government without further approval. If the value of a gift is uncertain, the recipient shall be responsible for establishing that it is of minimal value, as defined in this section. Documentary evidence may be required in support of the valuation.</P>
            <P>(2) Commission members and employees may accept, on behalf of the United States, gifts of more than minimal value tendered or received from a foreign government when it appears that to refuse the gift would likely cause offense or embarrassment or otherwise adversely affect the foreign relations of the United States. When a tangible gift of more than minimal value is accepted on behalf of the United States, it becomes the property of the United States.</P>
            <P>(3) Commission members and employees may accept a gift of more than minimal value where such gift is in the nature of an educational scholarship or medical treatment.</P>
            <P>(4) Within 60 days after accepting a tangible gift of more than minimal value, other than a gift described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, a Commission member or employee shall file a statement with the Executive Director of the Commission which shall include the following information:</P>
            <P>(A) The name and position of the Commission member or employee;</P>
            <P>(B) A brief description of the gift and the circumstances justify acceptance;</P>
            <P>(C) The identity, if known, of the foreign government and the name and position of the individual who presented the gift;</P>
            <P>(D) The date of acceptance of the gift;</P>
            <P>(E) The estimated value in the United States of the gift at the time of acceptance; and</P>
            <P>(F) The disposition or current location of the gift.</P>

            <P>(5) Commission members and employees are authorized to accept from a foreign government gifts of travel or gifts of expenses for travel taking place entirely outside the United States, such as transportation, food and lodging, of <PRTPAGE P="266"/>more than minimal value if the acceptance is approved by the Executive Director, upon a finding that it is consistent with the interests of the Commission. Either prior to or within 30 days after accepting each gift of travel or gift of travel expenses pursuant to this paragraph, the Commission member or employee concerned shall file a statement with the Executive Director containing the following information:</P>
            <P>(A) The name and position of the Commission member or employee;</P>
            <P>(B) A brief description of the gift and the circumstances justifying acceptance;</P>
            <P>(C) The identity, if known, of the foreign government and the name and position of the individual who presented the gift; and</P>
            <P>(D) The date of acceptance.</P>
            <P>(6) Not later than January 31 of each year the Executive Director shall compile a listing of all statements filed during the preceding year by Commission members and employees pursuant to paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(5) of this section and shall transmit the listing to the Secretary of State.</P>
            <P>(d) Commission members or employees may accept, retain and wear decorations tendered by a foreign government in recognition of active field service in time of combat operations or awarded for other outstanding or unusually meritorious performance, subject to the approval of the Executive Director. Without this approval, the decoration is deemed to have been accepted on behalf of the United States, shall become the property of the United States, and shall be deposited by the employee, within 60 days of acceptance, with the Executive Director for official use or forwarding to the Administrator of General Services for disposal in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section. Under normal circumstances, it can be expected that a Commission member or employee will be notified of the intent of a foreign government to award him or her or a spouse or dependent a decoration for outstanding or unusually meritorious service sufficiently in advance so that the approval required can be sought prior to its acceptance. A request for the approval of the Executive Director shall be submitted in writing, stating the nature of the decoration and the reason why it is being awarded. Whenever possible, the request should also be accompanied by a statement from the foreign government, preferably in the form of the citation, which shows the basis for the tender of the award, whether it is in recognition of active field service in time of combat operations or for other outstanding or unusually meritorious performance.</P>
            <P>(e) Within 60 days after acceptance of a tangible gift of more than minimal value or a decoration for which the Executive Director has not given approval, a Commission member or employee shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Deposit the gift or decoration for disposal with the Executive Director; or</P>
            <P>(2) Subject to the approval of the Commission, upon the recommendation of the Executive Director, deposit the gift or decoration with the Commission for official use.</P>
            <FP>A gift or decoration may be retained for official use if the Commission determines that it can be properly displayed in an area accessible to employees and members of the public. Within 30 days after termination of the official use of a gift, the Executive Director shall forward the gift to the Administrator of General Services in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.</FP>
            <P>(f) Whenever possible, gifts and decorations that have been deposited with the Executive Director for disposal shall be returned to the donor. The Executive Director, in coordination with the Office of the General Counsel, shall examine the circumstances surrounding the donation, assessing whether any adverse effect on the foreign relations of the United States might result from the return of the gift or decoration to the donor. The appropriate Department of State officials shall be consulted if a question of adverse effect on United States foreign relations arises.</P>

            <P>(g) Gifts and decorations that have not been returned to the donor, retained for official use, or for which official use has terminated, shall be forwarded by the Executive Director to the Administrator of General Services for transfer, donation, or other disposal in accordance with the provisions of <PRTPAGE P="267"/>the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, and 5 U.S.C. 7342.</P>
            <P>(h) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 7342(h), the U.S. Attorney General may bring a civil action in any United States district court against any Commission member or employee who knowingly solicits or accepts a gift from a foreign government not consented to by the Congress of the United States in 5 U.S.C. 7342, or who fails to deposit or report such gift as required by 5 U.S.C. 7342. The court may assess a penalty against such Commission member or employee in any amount not exceeding the retail value of the gift improperly solicited or received plus $5,000.</P>
            <P>(i) A violation of the requirements set forth in this section by a Commission employee may be cause for appropriate disciplinary action which may be in addition to any penalty prescribed by law.</P>
            <P>(j)(1) The burden of proving minimal value shall be on the recipient. In the event of a dispute over the value of a gift, the Executive Director shall arrange for an outside appraiser to determine whether the gift is of more or less than minimal value.</P>
            <P>(2) When requested by the Administrator of Government Services, the Executive Director shall arrange for an appraisal of a gift or decoration.</P>
            <P>(k) No appropriated funds of the Commission may be used to buy any tangible gift of more than minimal value for any foreign individual, unless the gift has been approved by Congress.</P>

            <P>(1) Coordinate the agency's counseling services and assure that counseling and interpretations on questions of conflict of interests and other matters covered by the regulations in this subpart are available as needed to Regional Deputy Counselors, who shall be appointed by the General Counsel, in coordination with the Chairman of the Commission, for each Regional Office of the Commission;</P>
            <P>(2) Render authoritative advice and guidance on matters covered by the regulations in this subpart which are presented to him or her by employees in the Washington, DC headquarters office; and</P>
            <P>(3) Receive information on, and resolve or forward to the Commission for consideration, any conflict of interests or apparent conflict of interests which appears in the annual financial disclosure (Standard Form 278 or Standard Form 450), or is disclosed to the General Counsel by a member or employee pursuant to § 140.735-2a(d) of this part, or otherwise is made known to the General Counsel.</P>

            <P>(i) A conflict of interests or apparent conflict of interests is considered resolved by the General Counsel when the affected member or employee has executed an ethics agreement pursuant to 5 CFR 2634.801 <E T="03">et seq.</E> to undertake specific actions in order to <E T="03">resolve</E> the actual or apparent conflict.</P>
            <P>(ii) If, after advice and guidance from the General Counsel, a member or employee does not execute an ethics agreement, the conflict of interests is considered unresolved and must be referred to the Commission for resolution or further action consistent with 18 U.S.C. 208 and 28 U.S.C. 535.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Where an unresolved conflict of interests or apparent conflict of interests is to be forwarded to the Commission by the General Counsel,</E> the General Counsel will promptly notify the affected member or employee in writing of his or her <PRTPAGE P="271"/>intent to forward the matter to the Commission. Any member or employee so affected will be afforded an opportunity to be heard by the Commission through written submission.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Regional Deputy Counselors.</E> Regional Deputy Counselors shall:</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 141.1</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) This regulation provides procedures for the collection by administrative offset of a federal employee's salary without his/her consent to satisfy certain debts owed to the federal government. These regulations apply to employees of other federal agencies and current employees of the Commission who owe debts to the Commission and to current employees of the Commission who owe debts to other federal agencies. This regulation does not apply when the employee consents to recovery from his/her current pay account.</P>
          <P>(b) This regulation does not apply to debts or claims arising under:</P>

          <P>(1) The Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, 26 U.S.C. 1 <E T="03">et seq.</E>;</P>
          <P>(2) The Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 301 <E T="03">et seq.</E>;</P>
          <P>(3) The tariff laws of the United States; or</P>
          <P>(4) Any case where a collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute.</P>

          <P>(c) This regulation does not apply to any adjustment to pay arising out of an employee's selection of coverage or <PRTPAGE P="272"/>a change in coverage under a federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less.</P>

          <P>(d) This regulation does not preclude the compromise, suspension, or termination of collection action where appropriate under the standards implementing the Federal Claims Collection Act, 31 U.S.C. 3711 <E T="03">et seq.</E>, 4 CFR parts 101 through 105, 45 CFR part 1177.</P>
          <P>(e) This regulation does not preclude an employee from requesting waiver of an overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584, 10 U.S.C. 2774 or 32 U.S.C. 716 or in any way questioning the amount or validity of the debt by submitting a subsequent claim to the General Accounting Office in accordance with General Accounting Office procedures. This regulation does not preclude an employee from requesting a waiver pursuant to other statutory provisions applicable to the particular debt being collected. Neither the requesting of a waiver nor the filing of a claim with the General Accounting Office will affect the amount or validity of the debt being collected until a waiver has been granted or the debt has been determined to be for an incorrect amount or invalid.</P>

          <P>(f) Matters not addressed in these regulations should be reviewed in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards at 4 CFR 101.1 <E T="03">et seq.</E>

          <P>This part sets forth the policy and procedure with respect to the indemnification of Commission employees who are sued in their individual capacities and suffer an adverse judgment as a result of conduct taken within the scope of employment. (For purposes of this part the term Commission employees includes all present and former Commissioners and employees of the Commission). This part is intended to provide indemnification for adverse judgments for constitutional and federal statutory torts excepted from the Federal Tort Claims Act exclusive remedy provision 28 U.S.C. 2679(b) (as amended by the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-694)). In any lawsuit which is filed against the employee alleging a common law tort occurring within the scope of employment, the United States may be substituted for the individual employee and any liability which may be found will be assessed against the government, pursuant to the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988.</P>

          <P>(b) The Commission may settle or compromise a personal damage claim against its employee by the payment of available funds, at any time, provided the alleged conduct giving rise to the personal damage claim was taken within the scope of employment and that such settlement is in the interest of the United States as determined by the Commission in its discretion.</P>
          <P>(c) Absent exceptional circumstances, as determined by the Commission, the Commission will not entertain a request either to agree to indemnify or to settle a personal damage claim before entry of an adverse verdict, judgment or monetary award.</P>

          <P>(d) When an employee of the Commission becomes aware that an action may be or has been filed against the employee in his or her individual capacity as a result of conduct taken within the scope of his or her employment, the employee should immediately notify the Commission's Office of General Counsel that such an action is pending or threatened.<PRTPAGE P="276"/>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
          <P>This part provides procedures that the Commission will use to collect debts owed the United States arising from activities under the Commission's jurisdiction. As applicable, these procedures are based upon, and conform to, the Federal Claims Collection Act, as amended, 31 U.S.C. 3701-3720E; the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 31 CFR Parts 900-905, issued by the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Justice; administrative wage garnishment regulations issued by the Department of the Treasury, 31 CFR 285.11; and other laws applicable to the collection of non-tax debts owed to the United States arising from activities under the Commission's jurisdiction. Subpart A describes procedures for collection by offset against obligations of the United States to the debtor, by compromise, and by referral to the Department of Justice for litigation. It also sets forth the Commission's policy on collecting interest on unpaid claims, the method used in calculating such interest, and the maximum inflation-adjusted civil monetary penalties that may be assessed and enforced for each violation of the Commodity Exchange Act or regulations or orders of the Commission promulgated thereunder. Subpart B describes procedures for collection by administrative garnishment of the debtor's wages.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Notice of claim.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Commission will send a written notice to any person who owes payment to the United States under this part, stating the basis for the claim, the interest, penalties, and administrative costs that may be imposed for non-payment, and the date full payment is due.</P>

            <P>(b) If the claim is disputed, the debtor shall respond to the notice in writing and state the reasons for non-payment. If the claim is not disputed but full payment is not made by the date indicated in the notice, the debtor <PRTPAGE P="277"/>shall state the reasons for the failure to make full payment.</P>
            <P>(c) If no response or an unsatisfactory response is received by the date indicated in the notice, the Commission may take further action as appropriate under the Commodity Exchange Act or regulations thereunder, or under 31 CFR parts 900-905 or the Federal Claims Collection Act as amended, 31 U.S.C. 3701-3720E.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The Commission will assess interest on unpaid claims. The rate of interest assessed shall be the rate of the current value of funds to the U.S. Treasury (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the Treasury tax and loan account rate) as prescribed and published by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Commission will charge penalty fees of not more than 6 percent per year on any portion of a claim that is delinquent for more than 90 days. The Commission will also impose actual administrative costs to cover the processing and handling of delinquent claims.</P>
            <P>(b) Interest on claims will be charged and will run from the date the notice of claim is mailed if the amount of the claim is not paid within 30 days from that date. Interest will be calculated only on the principal of the claim. The rate of interest charged is the rate in effect on the date from which interest begins to run. The rate will remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness.</P>
            <P>(c) The Commission may waive in whole or in part interest, penalty charges or administrative costs if it finds that:</P>
            <P>(1) The debtor is unable to pay any significant sum within a reasonable period of time;</P>
            <P>(2) Collection of interest or penalty charges jeopardizes collection of the principal of the claim; or</P>
            <P>(3) It is in the best interests of the United States.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Collection by offset.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Whenever feasible, the Commission will collect claims under this part by means of administrative offset against obligations of the United States to the debtor.</P>
            <P>(b) The Commission will notify the debtor in writing of its intent to use offset procedures to collect the debt unless the debtor agrees to repayment. The notice to the debtor shall include the type and amount of the claim and an explanation of the debtor's rights for records and review under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a).</P>
            <P>(c) The Commission will seek to coordinate administrative offset with other federal agencies in accordance with 4 CFR part 102.</P>

            <P>The Commission may settle claims not exceeding $100,000 (excluding interest) by compromise at less than the principal amount of the claim if—</P>
            <P>(a) The debtor shows an inability to pay the full amount within a reasonable period of time;</P>
            <P>(b) The Government would be unable to enforce collection in full through litigation or administrative means within a reasonable period of time;</P>
            <P>(c) The cost of collecting the claim in full is not justified by the amount of the claim; or</P>
            <P>(d) The Commission's enforcement policy would be served by settlement of the claim for less than the full amount.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Inflation-adjusted civil monetary penalties.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Statutory inflation adjustment of civil monetary penalties.</E> The Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended, requires annual inflation adjustments to the civil monetary penalties imposed under the Commodity Exchange Act for violations that occurred on or after November 2, 2015. The Commission will publish notice of these adjusted penalty amounts in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The inflation adjustment is calculated by multiplying the maximum dollar amount of the civil monetary penalty for the previous calendar year by the cost-of-living inflation adjustment multiplier provided by the Office Management and Budget, which is based on the change in the Consumer Price Index, and rounding the total to the nearest dollar. Set forth in the charts in paragraph (b) of this section are the inflation adjusted penalty amounts for violations occurring on or after November 2, 2015 and the penalty amounts for violations that occurred prior to November 2, 2015. These penalty charts are also available on the Commission's website at: <E T="03">http://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/Enforcement/InflationAdjustedCivilMonetaryPenalties/index.htm.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">2019 Inflation adjustment.</E> The maximum amount of each civil monetary penalty in the following charts applies to penalties assessed after January 15, 2019:</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 145.7</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Requests for Commission records and copies thereof.</SUBJECT>

          <P>Requests for Commission records and copies thereof shall specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) of the response. The <PRTPAGE P="287"/>Commission will accommodate requesters as to form or format if the record is readily available in that form or format. When requesters do not specify the form or format of the response, the Commission will respond in the form or format in which the document is most accessible to the Commission.</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Public inquiries and inspection of public records.</E> Information concerning the nature and extent of available public records may be obtained in person, by telephone, via Internet (<E T="03">http://www.cftc.gov</E>), or by writing to the Commission offices designated in §§ 145.2 and 145.6.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Requests for nonpublic records.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section with respect to public records, all requests for records maintained by the Commission shall be in writing, shall be addressed to the Office of General Counsel of the Commission and shall be clearly marked “Freedom of Information Act Request.”</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Misdirected written requests.</E> The Commission cannot ensure that a timely or satisfactory response will be given to requests for records that are directed to the Commission other than in the manner prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section. Any misdirected written request for nonpublic records should be promptly forwarded to the Office of General Counsel of the Commission. Misdirected requests for nonpublic records will be considered to have been received for purposes of this section only when they actually have been received by the Office of General Counsel.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Description of requested records.</E> Each written request for Commission records made under paragraph (b) of this section shall reasonably describe the records sought with sufficient specificity to permit the records to be located among the records maintained by or for the Commission. The Commission staff may communicate with the requester (by telephone when practicable) in an effort to reduce the administrative burden of processing a broad request and to minimize fees for copying and search services.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Description of requester and intended use of requested records.</E> In each request for records, requesters shall reasonable identify themselves as a commercial user, educational institution, noncommercial scientific institution, or representative of the news media if one of these categories is applicable. The requester shall describe the use to which the records will be put.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Request for existing records.</E> The Commission's response to a request for nonpublic records will encompass all nonpublic records identifiable as responsive to the request that are in existence on the date that the written request is received by the Office of General Counsel. The Commission need not create a new record in response to a FOIA request.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Fee agreement.</E> A request for copies of records pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section must indicate the requester's agreement to pay all fees that are associated with the processing of the request, in accordance with the rates set forth in appendix B to this part, or the requester's intention to limit the fees incurred to a stated amount. If the requester states a fee limitation, no work will be done that will result in fees beyond the stated amount. A requester who seeks a waiver or reduction of fees pursuant to paragraph (b) of appendix B of this part must show that such a waiver or reduction would be in the public interest. If the Office of General Counsel receives a request for records under paragraph (b) of this section from a requester who has not paid fees from a previous request in accordance with appendix B of this part, the staff will decline to process the request until such fees have been paid.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Initial determination, denials.</E> (1) With respect to any request for nonpublic records as defined in § 145.0(c), the Compliance Staff of the Commission will forward the request to the Commission divisions or offices likely to maintain records that are responsive to the request. If a responsive record is located, the Compliance Staff will, in consultation with the Commission office in which the record was located, determine whether to comply with such request. The Compliance Staff may, in their discretion, determine whether to comply with any portion of a request for nonpublic records before <PRTPAGE P="288"/>considering the remainder of the request. The Compliance Staff will inform the requester of the availability of the Commission's FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance.</P>
          <P>(2) Where it is determined to deny, in whole or in part, a request for nonpublic records, the Compliance Staff will notify the requester of the denial, citing applicable exemptions of the Freedom of Information Act or other provisions of law that require or allow the records to be withheld. The Compliance Staff's response to the FOIA request should describe in general terms what categories of documents are being withheld under which applicable FOIA exemption or exemptions. The Compliance Staff's response will include a statement notifying the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the Commission's FOIA Public Liaison and the National Archives and Records Administration's Office of Government Information Services. The Compliance Staff, in denying an initial request for records, is not required to provide the requester with an inventory of those documents determined to be exempt from disclosure.</P>
          <P>(3) The Compliance Staff will issue an initial determination with respect to a FOIA request within twenty business days after receipt by the Office of General Counsel. In unusual circumstances, as defined in this paragraph, the prescribed time limit may be extended by written notice to the person making a request for a record or a copy. The notice shall set forth the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. Where the extension exceeds ten business days, the Compliance Staff will provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. The Compliance Staff or the FOIA Public Liaison is available to assist the requester in unusual circumstances. The Compliance Staff will notify the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services. As used in this paragraph, “unusual circumstances” means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of a particular request:</P>
          <P>(i) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;</P>
          <P>(ii) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request;</P>
          <P>(iii) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components in the Commission having substantial subject matter interest therein;</P>
          <P>(iv) The need to coordinate a response with several Commission offices;</P>
          <P>(v) The need to obtain records currently being used by members of the Commission, the Commission staff, or the public;</P>
          <P>(vi) The need to respond to a large number of previously-filed FOIA requests.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Administrative review.</E> (1) Any person who has been notified pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section that his request for records has been denied in whole or in part may file an application for review as set forth below.</P>
          <P>(2) An application for review must be received by the Office of General Counsel within 90 days of the date of the denial by the Compliance Staff. This 90-day period shall not begin to run until the Compliance Staff has issued an initial determination with respect to all portions of the request for nonpublic records. An application for review shall be in writing and shall be marked “Freedom of Information Act Appeal” and be sent to the Commission's Office of General Counsel. If the appeal involves information as to which the FOIA requester has received a detailed written justification of a request for confidential treatment pursuant to § 145.9(e), the requester must also serve a copy of the appeal on the submitter of the information.</P>

          <P>(3) The applicant must attach to the application for review a copy of all correspondence relevant to the request, <PRTPAGE P="289"/>
            <E T="03">i.e.,</E> the initial request, any correspondence amending or modifying the request, and all correspondence from the staff responding to the request.</P>
          <P>(4) The application for review shall state such facts and cite such legal or other authorities as the applicant may consider appropriate. The application may, in addition, include a description of the general benefit to the public from disclosure of that information.</P>
          <P>(5) If the appeal involves information that is subject to a petition for confidential treatment filed under § 145.9, the submitter of the information shall have an opportunity to respond in writing to the appeal within 10 business days of the date of filing the appeal. Any response shall be sent to the Commission's Office of General Counsel. Copies shall be sent to the person requesting the information.</P>
          <P>(6) The General Counsel, or his or her designee, shall have the authority to consider all appeals under this section from initial determinations of the Compliance Staff of the Commission. The General Counsel, or his or her designee, may:</P>
          <P>(i) Determine either to affirm or to reverse the initial determination in whole or in part;</P>
          <P>(ii) Determine to disclose a record, even if exempt, if good cause for doing so either is shown by the application or otherwise appears;</P>
          <P>(iii) Remand the matter to the Compliance Staff—</P>
          <P>(A) To correct a deficiency in the initial processing of the request, or</P>
          <P>(B) When an investigation as to which the staff originally claimed exemption from mandatory disclosure on the basis of 5 U.S.C. 555(b)(7)(A) or 7 U.S.C. 12(a) is subsequently closed; or</P>
          <P>(iv) Refer the matter to the Commission for a decision.</P>
          <P>(7) If the initial denial of the request for nonpublic records is reversed, the Office of General Counsel shall, in writing, advise the requester that the records will be available on or after a specified date. If, on appeal, the denial of access to a record is affirmed in whole or in part, the person who requested the information shall be notified in writing of:</P>
          <P>(i) The reasons for the denial,</P>
          <P>(ii) The mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation, and</P>
          <P>(iii) The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4) providing for judicial review of a determination to withhold records.</P>
          <P>(j) <E T="03">Expedited processing.</E> A request may be given expedited processing if the requester demonstrates a compelling need for the requested records. For purposes of this provision, the term “compelling need” means: That a failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or with respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged federal government activity. A requester who seeks expedited processing must demonstrate a compelling need by submitting a statement that is certified by the requester to be true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief. The Compliance Staff will determine whether to provide expedited processing, and notice of the determination will be provided to requester, within ten days after the date of the request. If the request for expedited processing is denied, the requester may file an appeal with the Office of General Counsel within ten days of the date of the denial by the Compliance Staff. The Office of General Counsel will respond to the appeal within ten days after the date of the appeal.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Petition for confidential treatment of information submitted to the Commission.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This section provides a procedure by which persons submitting information in any form to the Commission can request that the information not be disclosed pursuant to a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. This section does not affect the Commission's right, authority, or obligation to disclose information in any other context.</P>

          <P>(c) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The following definitions apply to this section:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Submitter.</E> A “submitter” is any person who submits any information or material to the Commission or who permits any information or material to be submitted to the Commission. For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section only, “submitter” includes any person whose information has been submitted to a designated contract market, derivatives clearing organization, swap execution facility, swap data repository or registered futures association that in turn has submitted the information to the Commission.</P>

          <P>(d) <E T="03">Written request for confidential treatment.</E> (1) Any submitter may request in writing that the Commission afford confidential treatment under the Freedom of Information Act to any information that he or she submits to the Commission. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, no oral requests for confidential treatment will be accepted by the Commission. The submitter shall specify the grounds on which confidential treatment is being requested but need not provide a detailed written justification of the request unless required to do so under paragraph (e) of this section. Confidential treatment may be requested only on the grounds that disclosure:</P>
          <P>(i) Is specifically exempted by a statute that either requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such manner as to leave no discretion on the issue or establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.</P>
          <P>(ii) Would reveal the submitter's trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information.</P>
          <P>(iii) Would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the submitter's personal privacy.</P>
          <P>(iv) Would reveal investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes whose disclosure would deprive the submitter of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication.</P>
          <P>(v) Would reveal investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes whose disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the submitter.</P>

          <P>(vi) Would reveal investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes when disclosure would interfere with enforcement proceedings or disclose investigative techniques and procedures, <E T="03">provided,</E> that the claim may be made only by a designated contract market, derivatives clearing organization, swap execution facility, swap data repository or registered futures association with regard to its own investigatory records.</P>
          <P>(2) The original of any written request for confidential treatment must be sent to the Assistant Secretary of the Commission for FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts Compliance. A copy of any request for confidential treatment shall be sent to the Commission division or office receiving the original of any material for which confidential treatment is being sought.</P>

          <P>(3) A request for confidential treatment shall be clearly marked “FOIA Confidential Treatment Request” and shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of the submitter. The submitter is responsible for informing the Assistant Secretary of the <PRTPAGE P="291"/>Commission for FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts Compliance of any changes in his or her name, address, and telephone number.</P>
          <P>(4) A request for confidential treatment should accompany the material for which confidential treatment is being sought. If a request for confidential treatment is filed after the filing of such material, the submitter shall have the burden of showing that it was not possible to request confidential treatment for that material at the time the material was filed. A request for confidential treatment of a future submission will not be processed. All records which contain information for which a request for confidential treatment is made or the appropriate segregable portions thereof should be marked by the person submitting the records with a prominent stamp, typed legend, or other suitable form of notice on each page or segregable portion of each page stating “Confidential Treatment Requested by [name].” If such marking is impractical under the circumstances, a cover sheet prominently marked “Confidential Treatment Requested by [name]” should be securely attached to each group of records submitted for which confidential treatment is requested. Each of the records transmitted in this matter should be individually marked with an identifying number and code so that they are separately identifiable. In some circumstances, such as when a person is testifying in the course of a Commission investigation or providing documents requested in the course of a Commission inspection, it may be impractical to submit a written request for confidential treatment at the time the information is first provided to the Commission. In no circumstances can the need to comply with the requirements of this section justify or excuse any delay in submitting information to the Commission. Rather, in such circumstances, the person testifying or otherwise submitting information should inform the Commission employee receiving the information, at the time the information is submitted or as soon thereafter as practicable, that the person is requesting confidential treatment for the information. The person shall then submit a written request for confidential treatment within 30 days of the submission of the information. If access is requested under the Freedom of Information Act with respect to material for which no timely request for confidential treatment has been made, it may be presumed that the submitter of the information has waived any interest in asserting that the material is confidential.</P>
          <P>(5) A request for confidential treatment shall state the length of time for which confidential treatment is being sought.</P>
          <P>(6) A request for confidential treatment (as distinguishing from the material that is the subject of the request) shall be considered a public document. When a submitter deems it necessary to include, in its request for confidential treatment, information for which it seeks confidential treatment, the submitter shall place that information in an appendix to the request.</P>
          <P>(7) On 10 business days notice from the Assistant Secretary, a submitter shall submit a detailed written justification of a request for confidential treatment, as specified in paragraph (e) of this section. Upon request and for good cause shown, the Assistant Secretary may grant an extension of such time. The Assistant Secretary will notify the submitter that failure to provide timely a detailed written justification will be deemed a waiver of the submitter's opportunity to appeal an adverse determination.</P>
          <P>(8)(i) Requests for confidential treatment for any reasonably segregable material that is not exempt from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, as implemented in § 145.5, shall be summarily rejected under § 145.9(d)(9). Requests for confidential treatment of public information contained in financial reports as specified in § 1.10 shall not be processed. A submitter has the burden of specifying clearly and precisely the material that is the subject of the confidential treatment request. A submitter may be able to meet this burden in various ways, including:</P>
          <P>(A) Segregating material for which confidential treatment is being sought;</P>

          <P>(B) Submitting two copies of the submission: a copy from which material for which confidential treatment is <PRTPAGE P="292"/>being sought has been obliterated, deleted, or clearly marked and an unmarked copy; and</P>
          <P>(C) Clearly describing the material within a submission for which confidential treatment is being sought.</P>
          <P>(ii) A submitter shall not employ a method of specifying the material for which confidential treatment is being sought if that method makes it unduly difficult for the Commission to read the full submission, including all portion claimed to be confidential, in its entirely.</P>
          <P>(9) If a submitter fails to follow the procedures set forth in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(8) of this section, the Assistant Secretary of the Commission for FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts Compliance or his or her designee may summarily reject the submitter's request for confidential treatment with leave to the submitter to refile a proper petition. Failure of the Assistant Secretary or his or her designee summarily to reject a confidential treatment request pursuant to this paragraph shall not be construed to indicate that the submitter has complied with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(8) of this section.</P>
          <P>(10) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(9) of this section, no determination with respect to any request for confidential treatment will be made until the Commission receives a Freedom of Information Act request for the material for which confidential treatment is being sought.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Detailed written justification of request for confidential treatment.</E> (1) If the Assistant Secretary or his or her designee determines that a FOIA request seeks material for which confidential treatment has been requested pursuant to § 145.9, the Assistant Secretary or his or her designee shall require the submitter to file a detailed written justification of the confidential request within ten business days (unless under § 145.9(d)(7) an extension of time has been granted) of that determination unless, pursuant to an earlier FOIA request, a prior determination to release or withhold the material has been made, the submitter has already provided sufficient information to grant the request for confidential treatment; or the material is otherwise in the public domain. The detailed written justification shall be filed with the Assistant Secretary of the Commission for FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts Compliance. It shall be clearly marked “Detailed Written Justification of FOIA Confidential Treatment Request” and shall contain the request number supplied by the Commission. The submitter shall also send a copy of the detailed written justification to the FOIA requester at the address specified by the Commission.</P>
          <P>(2) The period for filing a detailed written justification may be extended upon request and for good cause shown.</P>
          <P>(3) The detailed written justification of the confidential treatment request shall contain:</P>
          <P>(i) The reasons, referring to the specific exemptive provisions of the Freedom of Information Act listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, why the information that is the subject of the FOIA request should be withheld from access under the Freedom of Information Act;</P>
          <P>(ii) The applicability of any specific statutory or regulatory provisions that govern or may govern the treatment of the information;</P>
          <P>(iii) The existence and applicability of prior determinations by the Commission, other federal agencies, or courts concerning the specific exemptive provisions of the Freedom of Information Act pursuant to which confidential treatment is being requested. Submitters shall satisfy any evidentiary burdens imposed upon them by applicable Freedom of Information Act case law.</P>
          <P>(iv) Such additional facts and authorities as the submitter may consider appropriate.</P>
          <P>(4) The detailed written justification of a confidential treatment request shall be accompanied by affidavits to the extent necessary to establish the facts necessary to satisfy the submitter's evidentiary burden.</P>

          <P>(5) The detailed written justification of a confidential treatment request (as distinguished from the material that is the subject of the request) shall be considered a public document. However, a submitter will be permitted to submit <PRTPAGE P="293"/>to the Commission supplementary confidential affidavits with his or her detailed written justification if that is the only way in which he or she can convincingly demonstrate that the material that is the subject of the confidential treatment request should not be disclosed to the FOIA requester.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Initial determination with respect to petition for confidential treatment.</E> (1) The Assistant Secretary for FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts Compliance or his or her designee, in consultation with the Office in which the record was located, shall issue an initial determination with respect to a confidential treatment request for material that is responsive to the FOIA request. This determination shall be issued at the same time as the initial determination with respect to the FOIA request. <E T="03">See</E> § 145.7(g). To the extent that the initial determination grants a confidential treatment request in full or in part, it should specify the FOIA exemptions upon which this determination is based and briefly describe the material to which each exemption applies. <E T="03">See</E> § 145.7(g)(2). To the extent that the initial determination denies confidential treatment to any material for which confidential treatment was requested, it should briefly describe the material for which confidential treatment is denied.</P>
          <P>(2) If the Assistant Secretary or his or her designee determines that a confidential treatment request shall be denied in full or in part, the submitter shall be informed of his or her right to appeal to the Commission's General Counsel in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (g) of this section. The material for which confidential treatment was denied shall be released to the FOIA requester if the submitter does not file an appeal within 10 business days of the date on which his or her request was denied.</P>
          <P>(3) If the Assistant Secretary or his or her designee determines that a confidential treatment request shall be granted in full or in part, the FOIA requester shall be informed of his or her right to appeal to the Commission's General Counsel in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 145.7(h).</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Appeal from initial determination that confidential treatment is not warranted.</E> (1) An appeal from an initial determination to deny a confidential treatment request in full or in part shall be filed with the General Counsel of the Commission. No disclosure of the material that is the subject of the appeal shall be made until the appeal is resolved. If both a submitter and a FOIA requester appeal to the General Counsel from a partial grant and partial denial of a confidential treatment request, those appeals shall be consolidated.</P>
          <P>(2) Any appeal of a denial of a request for confidential treatment shall be in writing, and shall be clearly marked “FOIA Confidential Treatment Appeal.” The appeal shall include a copy of the initial determination and shall clearly indicate the portions of the initial determination from which an appeal is being taken.</P>
          <P>(3) The appeal shall be sent to the Commission's Office of General Counsel. A copy of the appeal shall be sent to the FOIA requester. The General Counsel or his or her designee shall have the authority to consider all appeals from initial determinations of the Assistant Secretary of the Commission for FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts compliance. The General Counsel may, in his sole and unfettered discretion, refer such appeals and questions concerning stays under paragraph (g)(10) of this section to the Commission for decision.</P>
          <P>(4) In the appeal, the submitter may supply additional substantiation for his or her request for confidential treatment, including additional affidavits and additional legal argument. Such submissions shall be governed by paragraph (e)(5) of this section.</P>
          <P>(5) The FOIA requester shall have an opportunity to respond in writing to the appeal within 10 business days of the date of filing of the FOIA Confidential Treatment Appeal. The FOIA requester need not respond, however. Any response shall be sent to the Commission's Office of General Counsel. A copy shall be sent to the submitter.</P>
          <P>(6) All FOIA Confidential Treatment Appeals and all responses thereto shall be considered public documents.</P>

          <P>(7) The General Counsel will make a determination with respect to any appeal within twenty business days after <PRTPAGE P="294"/>receipt by the Office of General Counsel of such appeal or within such extended period as may be permitted in accordance with the standards set forth in § 145.7(g)(3). Although other procedures may be employed, to the extent possible the General Counsel will decide the appeal on the basis of the affidavits and other documentary evidence submitted by the submitter and the FOIA requests.</P>
          <P>(8) The General Counsel or his or her designee shall have the authority to remand any matter to the Assistant Secretary of the Commission for FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts Compliance to correct deficiencies in the initial processing of the confidential treatment request.</P>
          <P>(9) If the General Counsel or his or her designee denies a confidential treatment appeal in full or in part, the information for which confidential treatment is denied shall be disclosed to the FOIA requester 10 business days later, subject to any stay entered pursuant to paragraph (g)(10) of this section.</P>
          <P>(10) The General Counsel or his or here designee shall have the authority to enter and vacate stays as set forth below. If, within 10 business days of the date of issuance of a determination by the General Counsel or his or her designee to disclose information for which a submitter sought confidential treatment, the submitter commences an action in federal court concerning that determination, the General Counsel will stay the public disclosure of the information pending final judicial resolution of the matter. The General Counsel or his or her designee may vacate a stay entered under this section, either on his or her own motion or at the request of the FOIA requester. If such a stay is vacated, the information will be released to the requester 10 business days after the submitter is notified of this action, unless a court orders otherwise.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Extensions of time limits.</E> Any time limit under this section may be extended for good cause shown, in the discretion of the Commission, the Commission's General Counsel, or the Assistant Secretary of the Commission for FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts Compliance.</P>
          <P>(i) A submitter whose confidential treatment request has been upheld by the Commission shall, upon request of the General Counsel, aid the Commission in defending a court action to compel the Commission to disclose the information subject to the confidential treatment request. If the submitter is unwilling to aid the Commission in this regard, the General Counsel may, in appropriate cases, make the information available to the public.</P>

          <EAR>Pt. 145, App. B</EAR>
          <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix B to Part 145—Schedule of Fees</HD>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Charges for requests.</E> The following charges may be made where applicable for responding to requests for records.</P>
          <P>(1) $4.75 for each quarter hour spent by clerical personnel in searching for or reviewing records.</P>
          <P>(2) When a search or review cannot be performed by clerical personnel, $10.25 for each quarter hour spent by professional personnel in searching or reviewing records.</P>
          <P>(3) When searches require the expertise of a computer specialist, staff time for programming and performing searches will be charged at $10.25 per quarter hour. For searches of records stored on personal computers used as workstations by Commission staff and shared access network servers, the computer processing time is included in the search time for the staff member using the workstation as set forth in paragraph (a) of this appendix.</P>
          <P>(4) Document duplication, including computer printouts, will be charged at $0.15 per page.</P>
          <P>(5) For copies of materials other than paper records, the requester will be charged the actual cost of materials and reproduction, including the time of clerical personnel at a rate of $4.75 per quarter hour.</P>
          <P>(6) When a request has been made and granted to examine Commission records at an office of the Commission other than the office in which the records are routinely maintained, the requester:</P>
          <P>(i) Will reimburse the Commission for the actual cost of transporting the records; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Will be charged at a rate of $4.75 for each quarter hour spent by clerical personnel in preparing the records for transit.</P>
          <P>(7) For certifying that requested records are true copies, the charge will be $3.00 per certification.</P>
          <P>(8) Upon request, records will be mailed by means of overnight or express mail at the fee of $10.00 per package mailed.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Waiver or reduction of fees.</E> Fees will be waived or reduced by the Commission if:</P>
          <P>(1) The fee is less than or equal to $10.00, the approximate cost to the Commission of collecting the fee; or,</P>
          <P>(2) If the Commission determines that the disclosure of the information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Applicability of fees.</E> Fees shall be charged even if no records are ultimately furnished to the requester. Fees apply to various types of requests as follows.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial use request.</E> Fees for search time, review time and duplication of records will be charged to requests from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a user or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Educational institution or noncommercial scientific institution.</E> Only duplication fees <PRTPAGE P="296"/>will be charged to schools or to organizations which operate solely for the purpose of scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. No charge will be made for the first 100 pages duplicated or for search or review time.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Representative of the news media.</E> Only duplication fees will be charged to any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. No charge will be made for the first 100 pages duplicated or for search or review time.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Other requesters.</E> Fees for search time and duplication will be charged to requesters who are not covered by one of the categories above. No charge will be made for the first two hours of search time, the first 100 pages of duplication, or for review time. If the search is for records stored in a computer format, a combination of computer operation charges and search time charges will be waived up to the equivalent of two hours of professional search time.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Aggregation of requests.</E> For purposes of determining fees, the Commission may aggregate reasonably related requests if multiple requests are made within a 30-day period or if there is a solid basis for believing that multiple requests were made solely to avoid fees.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Notification of fees.</E> A request for Commission records may state that the party is willing to pay fees up to a stated limit for services to be provided in searching, reviewing and duplicating requested records. If such a statement is made, no work will be done that will result in fees beyond the stated limit without written authorization. If no limit is stated, no work will be done that will result in fees in excess of $25.00 without written authorization from the requester.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Advance payment of fees.</E> The Commission may request advance payment of all or part of the fee (i) when fees are expected to exceed $250; or (ii) when a requester has previously failed to pay fees in a timely fashion.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Payment of fees.</E> Payment should be made by check or money order payable to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Interest on fees.</E> The Commission will begin charging interest on unpaid bills starting on the 31th day following the day on which the bill was sent. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Collection of fees.</E> If fees not paid, the Commission may disclose debts to appropriate authorities for collection or to consumer reporting agencies.</P>

          <P>(a) This part contains the rules of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission implementing the Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-579, 5 U.S.C. 552a). These rules apply to all records maintained by this Commission which are not excepted or exempted as set forth in § 146.12, insofar as they contain personal information concerning an individual, identify that individual by name or other symbol and are contained in a system of records from which information is retrieved by the individual's name or identifying symbol. Among the primary purposes of these rules are to permit individuals to determine whether information about them is contained in Commission files and, if so, to obtain access to that information; to establish procedures whereby individuals may have inaccurate and incomplete information corrected; and, to restrict access by unauthorized persons to that information.</P>

          <P>(b) In this part the Commission is also exempting certain Commission systems of records from some of the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 <PRTPAGE P="297"/>that would otherwise be applicable to those systems. These exemptions are authorized under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k).</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 146.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Procedures for identifying the individual making the request.</SUBJECT>
          <P>When a request for information or for access to records has been made pursuant to § 146.3, before information is given or access is granted pursuant to § 146.5 of these rules the Commission shall require reasonable identification of the person making the request to insure that information is given and records are disclosed only to the proper person.</P>
          <P>(a) An individual may establish his identity by:</P>
          <P>(1) Submitting with his request for information or for access a photocopy of two pieces of identification bearing his name and signature, one of which shall bear his current home or business address; or</P>
          <P>(2) Appearing at any office of the Commission (located at the addresses set forth in § 145.6 of these rules) during the regular working hours for that office and presenting either:</P>
          <P>(i) One piece of identification containing a photograph and signature, such as a drivers license or passport or</P>
          <P>(ii) Two pieces of identification bearing his name and signature, one of which shall bear his current home or business address; or</P>
          <P>(3) Providing such other proof of identity as the Commission deems satisfactory in the circumstances of a particular request.</P>
          <P>(b) If the Executive Director or other designated Commission official determines that the data in a requested record is so sensitive that unauthorized access could cause harm or embarrassment to the person whose record is involved, or if the person making the request is unable to produce satisfactory evidence of identity under paragraph (a) of this section, the individual making the request may be required to submit a notarized statement attesting to his identity and that he is familiar with and understands the criminal penalties provided under section 1001 of title 18 of the U.S. Code for making false statements to a Government agency and under the Privacy Act, section 552a(i)(3) of title 5 of the U.S. Code, for obtaining records under false pretenses.

          <P>(c) The parent or guardian of a minor or a person judicially determined to be incompetent, in addition to establishing the identity of the person he represents as described in the previous paragraphs of this section, shall establish his own identity and his parentage or guardianship by furnishing a copy of a birth certificate showing parentage or a court order establishing the guardianship.</P>

          <P>(d) Nothing in this section shall preclude the Commission from requiring additional identification before granting access to the records if there is reason to believe that the person making the request may not be the individual to whom the record pertains, or where the sensitivity of the data warrants it.<PRTPAGE P="299"/>
          </P>
          <P>(e) The requirements of this section shall not apply if the records involved would be available to any person pursuant to the Commission's rules under the Freedom of Information Act as set forth in part 145 of this chapter.</P>

          <P>(b) Access will generally be granted in the office of the Commission where the records are maintained during normal business hours, but for good cause shown the Commission may grant access at another office of the Commission or at different times for the convenience of the individual making the request.</P>
          <P>(c) Where a document containing information about an individual also contains information not pertaining to him, the portion not pertaining to the individual shall not be disclosed to him except to the extent the information is available to any person under the Freedom of Information Act. If the records sought cannot be provided for review and copying in a meaningful form, the Commission shall provide to the individual a report of the information concerning the individual contained in the record or records which shall be complete and accurate in all material aspects.</P>

          <P>(e) Requests for copies of documents may be directed to the FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Acts compliance staff, Office of the Secretariat, or to the member of the Commission's staff through whom arrangements for access were made.</P>

          <P>(e) Upon receipt of a request for amendment the Executive Director of the Commission or a person designated by the Executive Director shall promptly determine whether the record is materially inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, or is irrelevant or not timely, as claimed by the individual, and, if so, shall cause the record to be amended in accordance with the individual's request.</P>
          <P>(f) If the Executive Director or designee grants the request to amend the record, the individual shall promptly be advised of the decision and of the action taken, and notice shall be given of the correction and its substance to each person or agency to whom the record had previously been disclosed, as shown on the record of disclosures maintained in accordance with § 146.6(c).</P>
          <P>(g) If the Executive Director or designee disagrees in whole or in part with a request for amendment of a record, the individual shall promptly be notified of the complete or partial denial of his request and the reasons for the refusal.

          <P>(h) If a request is received for amendment of a record prepared by another agency which is in the possession or control of the Commission, the request for amendment will be forwarded to that agency. If that agency determines that the correction should be made, the Commission will amend its records accordingly and notify the individual making the request for amendment of the change.

          <SUBJECT>Exemptions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Investigatory materials compiled for law enforcement purposes are exempt from portions of the Privacy Act of 1974 and of these rules as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, on the basis and to the extent that individual access to these files could impair the effectiveness and orderly conduct of the Commission's regulatory and enforcement program. Materials exempted under this paragraph are contained in the system of records entitled “Exempted Investigatory Records” and/or in the system of records entitled “Exempted Closed Commission Meetings.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, no record which has served as a basis for denying an individual a right, privilege, or benefit to which he would otherwise be eligible, shall be maintained in this system, unless the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to the effective date of this section, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence. For records of this type, if practicable, material identifying the confidential source shall be extracted or summarized in a manner which protects the source and the summary or extract shall be maintained in a comparable nonexempted system of records.</P>
          <P>(b) Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for employment with the Commission are exempt from portions of the Privacy Act of 1974 and of these rules as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, to the extent that it identifies a confidential source. This is done in order to encourage persons from whom information is sought to provide information to the Commission which, absent assurances of confidentiality, they would be unwilling to give. However, if practicable, material identifying a confidential source shall be extracted or summarized in a manner which protects the source and the summary or extract shall be maintained in a non-exempt system containing the same category of record. Materials exempted under this paragraph are included in the system of records entitled “Exempted Employee Background Investigation Material” and/or in the system of records entitled “Exempted Closed Commission Meetings.”</P>
          <P>(c) The systems set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are hereby exempted from the provisions of sections 552a(c), (3)(d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (e)(4)(I) and (f) of title 5 of the U.S. Code (the Privacy Act of 1974), and are also exempted from the following sections of these rules: § 146.3 (requests for information and for access); § 146.5 (access to records); § 146.6(d) (accounting of disclosures to be made available to the individual); § 146.11(a) (7), (8), (9) (content of the system notice); and § 146.7(a) (relevancy of records).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose of these rules.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called “the Act” in this part), provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are prevailing private parties in adjudicatory proceedings before the Commission. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over the Commission, unless the Commission's position was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this part describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the Commission will use to make them.</P>

            <SUBJECT>When the Act applies.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The Act applies to any covered adjudicatory proceeding pending before the Commission on or after October 1, 1981. This includes proceedings begun before October 1, 1981, if final Commission action has not been taken before that date. Awards may be sought for fees and other expenses incurred before October 1, 1981, in any such covered proceeding.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Proceedings covered.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The Act applies to adjudicatory proceedings conducted by the Commission. These are adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of the Commission or any other agency of the United States, or any component of an agency, is presented by an attorney or other representative who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding. Reparation proceedings under section 14 of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 18, Commission review of exchange disciplinary and access denial actions under section 8c of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 12c, and registered futures association disciplinary and membership denial actions under section 17 of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 21, are not covered by the Act. Proceedings brought to determine whether or not to grant or renew registrations pursuant to sections 8a or 17(<E T="03">o</E>), of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 8, 12a and 21(<E T="03">o</E>), or contract market designations pursuant to section 6(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 8 (a), are excluded, but proceedings brought to suspend or revoke registrations or contract market designations are covered if they are otherwise adjudicatory proceedings. For the Commission, the types of proceedings generally covered are adjudicatory proceedings as defined in § 10.2(b) of this chapter; part 14 proceedings, if they involve a hearing, are also covered.</P>
            <P>(b) The Commission's decision not to identify a type of proceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing of an application by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the Act; whether the proceeding is covered will then be an issue for resolution in the proceedings on the application.</P>
            <P>(c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include only fees and expenses related to covered issues.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 148.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Eligibility of applicants.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses under the Act, the applicant must be a party to the adjudicatory proceeding for which it seeks an award. The term “party” is defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3). The applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart and in subpart B.</P>
            <P>(b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;</P>
            <P>(2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business interests, and not more that 500 employees;</P>
            <P>(3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 employees;</P>
            <P>(4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 employees; and</P>
            <P>(5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or public or private organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million and not more than 500 employees.</P>
            <P>(c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the adjudicatory proceeding was initiated.</P>
            <P>(d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered as an “individual” rather than a “sole owner of an unincorporated business” if the issues on which the applicant prevails are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business interests.</P>

            <P>(e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly perform services for compensation for the applicant, under the applicant's direction and control. The term “employee” also embraces all the agents of an applicant, by whatever title or label they may be known, for whose acts or omissions the applicant may be held liable under the Commodity Exchange Act. <E T="03">See</E> 7 U.S.C. 4. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis.</P>
            <P>(f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this part, unless the Presiding Officer determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the Presiding Officer may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.</P>
            <P>(g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding on behalf of one or more other persons or entitles that would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Standards for awards.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and expenses incurred in connection with an adjudicatory proceeding, or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position of the Commission was substantially justified. The position of the Commission includes, in addition to the position taken by the Commission in the adversary adjudication, the action or failure to act by the Commission upon which the adversary adjudication is based. The burden of proof that an award should not be made to an eligible prevailing applicant is on the Commission.</P>

            <P>(b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly or unreasonably protracted the adjudicatory <PRTPAGE P="315"/>proceeding or if special circumstances make the award sought unjust.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Allowable fees and expenses.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents and expert witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at a reduced rate to the applicant.</P>
            <P>(b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules may exceed $75 per hour. No award to compensate an expert witness may exceed the maximum daily rate prescribed for GS-18 under section 5332 of title 5 of the U.S. Code. However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.</P>
            <P>(c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent or expert witness, the Presiding Officer shall consider the following:</P>
            <P>(1) If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or her customary fee for similar services, or, if an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;</P>
            <P>(2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily performs services;</P>
            <P>(3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;</P>
            <P>(4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the adjudicatory proceeding; and</P>
            <P>(5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services provided.</P>
            <P>(d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, test, project or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.</P>

            <P>(a) If warranted by an increase in the cost of living or by special circumstances (such as limited availability of attorneys qualified to handle certain types of proceedings), the Commission may adopt regulations providing that attorney fees may be awarded at a rate higher than $75 per hour in some or all of the types of proceedings covered by this part. The Commission will conduct any rulemaking proceedings for this purpose under the informal rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553.</P>
            <P>(b) Any person may file with the Commission a petition for rulemaking to increase the maximum rate for attorney fees, in accordance with § 13.2 of this chapter.</P>

            <P>If an applicant is entitled to an award because it prevails over another agency of the United States that participates in an adjudicatory proceeding before the Commission and takes a postion that is not substantially justified, the award or an appropriate portion of the award shall be made against that agency.</P>

The application shall show that the applicant has prevailed and identify the position of the Commission or other agency that the applicant alleges was not substantially justified. Unless the applicant is an individual, the application shall also state the number of employees of the applicant and describe briefly the type and purpose of its organization or business.</P>

            <P>(b) The application shall also include a statement that the applicant's net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or $7 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). <PRTPAGE P="316"/>However, an applicant may omit this statement if:</P>
            <P>(1) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) or, in the case of a tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under such section; or</P>
            <P>(2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)).</P>
            <P>(c) The application shall state the amount of fees and expenses for which an award is sought.</P>
            <P>(d) The application may also include any other matters that the applicant wishes the Commission to consider in determining whether and in what amount an award should be made.</P>
            <P>(e) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an authorized officer or attorney of the applicant. It shall also contain or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the application is true and correct.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Net worth exhibit.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Each applicant except a qualified tax-exempt organization or cooperative association must provide with its application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as defined in § 148.4(f) of this part) when the adjudicatory proceeding was initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this part. The Presiding Officer may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.</P>
            <P>(b) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public record of the adjudicatory proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit that portion of the exhibit directly to the Presiding Officer in a sealed envelope labeled “Confidential Financial Information,” accompanied by a motion to withhold the information from public disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of the specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9), why public disclosure of the information would adversely affect the applicant, and why disclosure is not required in the public interest. The material in question shall be served on counsel representing the Commission or other agency against which the applicant seeks an award, but need not be served on any other party to the adjudicatory proceeding. If the Presiding Officer finds that the information should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in the public record of the adjudicatory proceeding. Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the exhibit shall be disposed of in accordance with the Commission's established procedures under the Freedom of Information Act as provided in part 145 of this chapter. For that purpose, the applicant shall file a copy of its motion with the Commission's Freedom of Information Act Compliance Staff in the Office of the Secretariat, Washington, DC.</P>

A separate itemized statement shall be submitted for each professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the application, showing the hours spent in connection with the proceeding by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, the rate at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount paid or payable by the applicant or by <PRTPAGE P="317"/>any other person or entity for the services provided.

            <P>(a) Either the applicant or counsel for the Commission or for another relevant agency may appeal the initial decision on the fee application by complying with the requirements of this section. An appealing party shall serve upon opposing parties and shall file with the Proceedings Clerk a notice of appeal within fifteen (15) days after service of the initial decision.

The failure of a party timely to file and serve a notice of appeal in accordance with this paragraph, or to perfect the appeal in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, shall constitute a voluntary waiver of any objection to the initial decision, and of all further administrative or judicial review under these rules and the Equal Access to Justice Act.</P>

            <P>(b) An appeal shall be perfected by the appealing party by timely filing with the Proceedings Clerk an appeal brief which meets the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section. An original and one copy of the appeal brief shall be filed within thirty (30) days after filing of the notice of appeal. By motion of the appealing party, the Commission may, for good cause <PRTPAGE P="319"/>shown, extend the time for filing the appeal brief. If the appeal brief is not filed within the time prescribed in this subparagraph, the Commission may, upon its own motion or upon motion by a party, dismiss the appeal, in which event the initial decision shall become the final decision and order of the Commission, effective upon service of the order of dismissal.</P>
            <P>(c) The opposing party may, within thirty (30) days after service of the appeal brief, file an original and one copy of an answering brief, and serve one copy thereof, unless the time limit is extended by the Commission upon motion of the party and for good cause shown.</P>
            <P>(d) Parties filing an appeal brief or answering brief shall meet the requirements of § 10.12 of this chapter as to form.

          <P>Except as otherwise provided in § 149.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
          <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>

          <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where <PRTPAGE P="323"/>agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 149.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 149.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 149.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
          <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
          <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
          <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
          <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
          <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

          <P>(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.</P>
          <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
          <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.</P>
          <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
          <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.</P>
          <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
          <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
          <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 149.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

          <P>(B) Trade pursuant to separately developed and independent trading systems;</P>
          <P>(C) Have and enforce written procedures to preclude each from having knowledge of, gaining access to, or receiving data about, trades of the other.

          <P>(3) <E T="03">Exemption for accounts held by futures commission merchants.</E> A futures commission merchant or any affiliate of a futures commission merchant need not aggregate positions it holds in a <PRTPAGE P="329"/>discretionary account, or in an account which is part of, or participates in, or receives trading advice from a customer trading program of a futures commission merchant or any of the officers, partners, or employees of such futures commission merchant or of its affiliates, if:</P>
          <P>(i) A person other than the futures commission merchant or the affiliate directs trading in such an account;</P>
          <P>(ii) The futures commission merchant or the affiliate maintains only such minimum control over the trading in such an account as is necessary to fulfill its duty to supervise diligently trading in the account;</P>
          <P>(iii) Each trading decision of the discretionary account or the customer trading program is determined independently of all trading decisions in other accounts which the futures commission merchant or the affiliate holds, has a financial interest of 10 percent or more in, or controls; and</P>
          <P>(iv) The futures commission merchant or the affiliate has complied with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Exemption for accounts carried by an independent account controller.</E> An eligible entity need not aggregate its positions with the eligible entity's client positions or accounts carried by an authorized independent account controller, as defined in § 150.1(e), except for the spot month in physical-delivery commodity contracts, provided that the eligible entity has complied with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, and that the overall positions held or controlled by such independent account controller may not exceed the limits specified in § 150.2.</P>

          <P>(A) Have, and enforce, written procedures to preclude the affiliated entities from having knowledge of, gaining access to, or receiving data about, trades of the other. Such procedures must include security arrangements, including separate physical locations, which would maintain the independence of their activities; provided, however, that such procedures may provide for the disclosure of information which is reasonably necessary for an eligible entity to maintain the level of control consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities to the managed positions and accounts<E T="03"/> and necessary to fulfill its duty to supervise diligently the trading done on its behalf;</P>
          <P>(B) Trade such accounts pursuant to separately developed and independent trading systems;</P>
          <P>(C) Market such trading systems separately; and</P>
          <P>(D) Solicit funds for such trading by separate disclosure documents that meet the standards of § 4.24 or § 4.34 of this chapter, as applicable, where such disclosure documents are required under part 4 of this chapter.</P>
          <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Exemption for underwriting.</E> A person need not aggregate the positions or accounts of an owned entity if the ownership or equity interest is based on the ownership of securities constituting the whole or a part of an unsold allotment to or subscription by such person as a participant in the distribution of such securities by the issuer or by or through an underwriter.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Exemption for broker-dealer activity.</E> A broker-dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or similarly registered with a foreign regulatory authority, need not aggregate the positions or accounts of an owned entity if the ownership or equity interest is based on the ownership of securities acquired in the normal course of business as a dealer, <E T="03">provided that</E> such person does not have actual knowledge of the trading decisions of the owned entity.</P>
          <P>(7) <E T="03">Exemption for information sharing restriction.</E> A person need not aggregate the positions or accounts of an owned entity if the sharing of information associated with such aggregation (such as, only by way of example, information reflecting the transactions and positions of a such person and the owned entity) creates a reasonable risk that either person could violate state or federal law or the law of a foreign jurisdiction, or regulations adopted thereunder, provided that such person does not have actual knowledge of information associated with such aggregation, <PRTPAGE P="330"/>and provided further that such person has filed a prior notice pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section and included with such notice a written memorandum of law explaining in detail the basis for the conclusion that the sharing of information creates a reasonable risk that either person could violate state or federal law or the law of a foreign jurisdiction, or regulations adopted thereunder. However, the exemption in this paragraph shall not apply where the law or regulation serves as a means to evade the aggregation of accounts or positions. All documents submitted pursuant to this paragraph shall be in English, or if not, accompanied by an official English translation.</P>
          <P>(8) <E T="03">Exemption for affiliated entities.</E> After a person has filed a notice under paragraph (c) of this section, another person need not file a separate notice identifying any position or account identified in such notice filing, provided that:</P>
          <P>(i) Such other person has an ownership or equity interest of 10 percent or greater in the person that filed the notice, or the person that filed the notice has an ownership or equity interest of 10 percent or greater in such other person, or an ownership or equity interest of 10 percent or greater is held in such other person by a third person who holds an ownership or equity interest of 10 percent or greater in the person that has filed the notice (in any such case, the ownership or equity interest may be held directly or indirectly);</P>
          <P>(ii) Such other person complies with the conditions applicable to the exemption specified in such notice filing, other than the filing requirements; and</P>
          <P>(iii) Such other person does not otherwise control trading of any account or position identified in such notice filing.</P>
          <P>(iv) Upon call by the Commission, any person relying on the exemption in this paragraph (b)(8) shall provide to the Commission such information concerning the person's claim for exemption. Upon notice and opportunity for the affected person to respond, the Commission may amend, suspend, terminate, or otherwise modify a person's aggregation exemption for failure to comply with the provisions of this section.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice filing for exemption.</E> (1) Persons seeking an aggregation exemption under paragraph (b)(1)(ii), (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), or (b)(7) of this section shall file a notice with the Commission, which shall be effective upon submission of the notice (or earlier, as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section), and shall include:</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 150.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Exchange-set speculative position limits.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Exchange limits.</E> Each contract market as a condition of designation under part 5, appendix A, of this chapter shall be bylaw, rule, regulation, or resolution limit the maximum number of contracts a person may hold or control, separately or in combination, net long or net short, for the purchase or sale of a commodity for future delivery or, on a futures-equivalent basis, options thereon. This section shall not apply to a contract market for which position limits are set forth in § 150.2 of this part or for a futures or option contract market on a major foreign currency, for which there is no legal impediment to delivery and for which there exists a highly liquid cash market. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a contract market from fixing different and separate position limits for different types of futures contracts based on the same commodity, or from fixing different position limits for different futures or for different delivery months, or from exempting positions which are normally known in the trade as “spreads, straddles, or arbitrage,” of from fixing limits which apply to such positions which are different from limits fixed for other positions.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Levels at designation.</E> At the time of its initial designation, a contract market must provide for speculative position limit levels as follows:</P>

          <P>(1) For physical delivery contracts, the spot month limit level must be no greater than one-quarter of the estimated spot month deliverable supply, calculated separately for each month to be listed, and for cash settled contracts, the spot month limit level must be no greater than necessary to minimize the potential for manipulation or distortion of the contract's or the underlying commodity's price;<PRTPAGE P="332"/>
          </P>
          <P>(2) Individual nonspot or all-months-combined levels must be no greater than 1,000 contracts for tangible commodities other than energy products;</P>
          <P>(3) Individual nonspot or all-months-combined levels must be no greater than 5,000 contracts for energy products and nontangible commodities, including contracts on financial products.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Adjustments to levels.</E> Contract markets may adjust their speculative limit levels as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) For physical delivery contracts, the spot month limit level must be no greater than one-quarter of the estimated spot month deliverable supply, calculated separately for each month to be listed, and for cash settled contracts, the spot month limit level must be no greater than necessary to minimize the potential for manipulation or distortion of the contract's or the underlying commodity's price; and</P>
          <P>(2) Individual nonspot or all-months-combined levels must be no greater than 10% of the average combined futures and delta-adjusted option month-end open interest for the most recent calendar year up to 25,000 contracts with a marginal increase of 2.5% thereafter or be based on position sizes customarily held by speculative traders on the contract market, which shall not be extraordinarily large relative to total open positions in the contract, the breadth and liquidity of the cash market underlying each delivery month and the opportunity for arbitrage between the futures market and the cash market in the commodity underlying the futures contract.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Hedge exemption.</E> (1) No exchange bylaw, rule, regulation, or resolution adopted pursuant to this section shall apply to bona fide hedging positions as defined by a contract market in accordance with the definition of <E T="03">bona fide hedging transactions and positions for excluded commodities</E> in § 1.3 of this chapter. <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> that the contract market may limit bona fide hedging positions or any other positions which have been exempted pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section which it determines are not in accord with sound commercial practices or exceed an amount which may be established and liquidated in orderly fashion.</P>
          <P>(2) Traders must apply to the contract market for exemption from its speculative position limit rules. In considering whether to grant such an application for exemption, contract markets must take into account the factors contained in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Trader accountability exemption.</E> Twelve months after a contract market's initial listing for trading or at any time thereafter, contract markets may submit for Commission approval under section 5a(a)(12) of the Act and § 1.41(b) of this chapter a bylaw, rule, regulation, or resolution, substituting for the position limits required under paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section an exchange rule requiring traders to be accountable for large positions as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) For futures and option contracts on a financial instrument or product having an average open interest of 50,000 contracts and an average daily trading volume of 100,000 contracts and a very highly liquid cash market, an exchange bylaw, regulation or resolution requiring traders to provide information about their position upon request by the exchange;</P>
          <P>(2) For futures and option contracts on a financial instrument or product or on an intangible commodity having an average moth-end open interest of 50,000 and an average daily volume of 25,000 contracts and a highly liquid cash market, an exchange bylaw, regulation or resolution requiring traders to provide information about their position upon request by the exchange and to consent to halt increasing further a trader's positions if so ordered by the exchange;</P>

          <P>(3) For futures and option contracts on a tangible commodity, including but not limited to metals, energy products, or international soft agricultural products, having an average month-end open interest of 50,000 contracts and an average daily volume of 5,000 contracts and a liquid cash market, an exchange bylaw, regulation or resolution requiring traders to provide information about their position upon request by the exchange and to consent to halt increasing further a trader's positions if <PRTPAGE P="333"/>so ordered by the exchange, <E T="03">provided, however,</E> such contract markets are not exempt from the requirement of paragraphs (b) or (c) that they adopt an exchange bylaw, regulation or resolution setting a spot month speculative position limit with a level no grater than one quarter of the estimated spot month deliverable supply;</P>
          <P>(4) For purposes of this paragraph, trading volume and open interest shall be calculated by combining the month-end futures and its related option contract, on a delta-adjusted basis, for all months listed during the most recent calendar year.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Other exemptions.</E> Exchange speculative position limits adopted pursuant to this section shall not apply to any position acquired in good faith prior to the effective date of any bylaw, rule, regulation, or resolution which specifies such limit or to a person that is registered as a futures commission merchant or as a floor broker under authority of the Act except to the extent that transactions made by such person are made on behalf of or for the account or benefit of such person. In addition to the express exemptions specified in this section, a contract market may propose such other exemptions from the requirements of this section consistent with the purposes of this section and shall submit such rules Commission review under section 5a(1)(12) of the Act and § 1.41(b) of this chapter.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Aggregation.</E> In determining whether any person has exceeded the limits established under this section, all positions in accounts for which such person by power of attorney or otherwise directly or indirectly controls trading shall be included with the positions held by such person; such limits upon positions shall apply to positions held by two or more person acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding, the same as if the positions were held by a single person.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Positions to be aggregated.</E> The position limits set forth in § 151.4 shall apply to all positions in accounts for which any person by power of attorney or otherwise directly or indirectly holds positions or controls trading and to positions held by two or more persons acting pursuant to an expressed or implied agreement or understanding the same as if the positions were held by, or the trading of the position were done by, a single individual.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Ownership of accounts generally.</E> For the purpose of applying the position limits set forth in § 151.4, except for the ownership interest of limited partners, shareholders, members of a limited liability company, beneficiaries of a trust or similar type of pool participant in a commodity pool subject to the provisos set forth in paragraph (c) of this section or in accounts or positions in multiple pools as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, any person holding positions in more than one account, or holding accounts or positions in which the person by power of attorney or otherwise directly or indirectly has a 10 percent or greater ownership or equity interest, must aggregate all such accounts or positions.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Ownership by limited partners, shareholders or other pool participants.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section, a person that is a limited partner, shareholder or other similar type of pool participant with an ownership or equity interest of 10 percent or greater in a pooled account or positions who is also a principal or affiliate of the operator of the pooled account must aggregate the pooled account or positions with all other accounts or positions owned or controlled by that person, unless:</P>
          <P>(i) The pool operator has, and enforces, written procedures to preclude the person from having knowledge of, gaining access to, or receiving data about the trading or positions of the pool;</P>
          <P>(ii) The person does not have direct, day-to-day supervisory authority or control over the pool's trading decisions; and</P>
          <P>(iii) The pool operator has complied with the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section on behalf of the person or class of persons.</P>
          <P>(2) A commodity pool operator having ownership or equity interest of 10 percent or greater in an account or positions as a limited partner, shareholder or other similar type of pool participant must aggregate those accounts or positions with all other accounts or positions owned or controlled by the commodity pool operator.</P>
          <P>(3) Each limited partner, shareholder, or other similar type of pool participant having an ownership or equity interest of 25 percent or greater in a commodity pool the operator of which is exempt from registration under § 4.13 of this chapter must aggregate the pooled account or positions with all other accounts or positions owned or controlled by that person.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Identical trading.</E> Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, for the purpose of applying the position limits set forth in § 151.4, any person that holds or controls the trading of positions, by power of attorney or otherwise, in more than one account, or that holds or controls trading of accounts or positions in multiple pools <PRTPAGE P="347"/>with identical trading strategies must aggregate all such accounts or positions that a person holds or controls.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Trading control by futures commission merchants.</E> The position limits set forth in § 151.4 shall be construed to apply to all positions held by a futures commission merchant or its separately organized affiliates in a discretionary account, or in an account which is part of, or participates in, or receives trading advice from a customer trading program of a futures commission merchant or any of the officers, partners, or employees of such futures commission merchant or its separately organized affiliates, unless:</P>
          <P>(1) A trader other than the futures commission merchant or the affiliate directs trading in such an account;</P>
          <P>(2) The futures commission merchant or the affiliate maintains only such minimum control over the trading in such an account as is necessary to fulfill its duty to supervise diligently trading in the account; and</P>
          <P>(3) Each trading decision of the discretionary account or the customer trading program is determined independently of all trading decisions in other accounts which the futures commission merchant or the affiliate holds, has a financial interest of 10 percent or more in, or controls.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Independent Account Controller.</E> An eligible entity need not aggregate its positions with the eligible entity's client positions or accounts carried by an authorized independent account controller, as defined in § 151.1, except for the spot month provided in physical-delivery Referenced Contracts, provided, however, that the eligible entity has complied with the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section, and that the overall positions held or controlled by such independent account controller may not exceed the limits specified in § 151.4.</P>
          <P>(1) Additional requirements for exemption of Affiliated Entities. If the independent account controller is affiliated with the eligible entity or another independent account controller, each of the affiliated entities must:</P>
          <P>(i) Have, and enforce, written procedures to preclude the affiliated entities from having knowledge of, gaining access to, or receiving data about, trades of the other. Such procedures must include document routing and other procedures or security arrangements, including separate physical locations, which would maintain the independence of their activities; provided, however, that such procedures may provide for the disclosure of information which is reasonably necessary for an eligible entity to maintain the level of control consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities and necessary to fulfill its duty to supervise diligently the trading done on its behalf;</P>
          <P>(ii) Trade such accounts pursuant to separately developed and independent trading systems;</P>
          <P>(iii) Market such trading systems separately; and</P>

          <P>(g) <E T="03">Exemption for underwriting.</E> Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this section, a person need not aggregate the positions or accounts of an owned entity if the ownership interest is based on the ownership of securities constituting the whole or a part of an unsold allotment to or subscription by such person as a participant in the distribution of such securities by the issuer or by or through an underwriter.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Notice filing for exemption.</E> (1) Persons seeking an aggregation exemption under paragraph (c), (e), (f), or (i) of this section shall file a notice with the Commission, which shall be effective upon submission of the notice, and shall include:</P>

          <P>(2) Upon call by the Commission, any person claiming an aggregation exemption under this section shall provide to the Commission such information concerning the person's claim for exemption. Upon notice and opportunity for the affected person to respond, the Commission may amend, suspend, terminate, or otherwise modify a person's <PRTPAGE P="348"/>aggregation exemption for failure to comply with the provisions of this section.</P>
          <P>(3) In the event of a material change to the information provided in the notice filed under this paragraph, an updated or amended notice shall promptly be filed detailing the material change.</P>

          <P>(i) <E T="03">Exemption for federal law information sharing restriction.</E> Notwithstanding any provision of this section, a person is not subject to the aggregation requirements of this section if the sharing of information associated with such aggregation would cause either person to violate Federal law or regulations adopted thereunder and provided that such a person does not have actual knowledge of information associated with such aggregation. Provided, however, that such person file a prior notice with the Commission detailing the circumstances of the exemption and an opinion of counsel that the sharing of information would cause a violation of Federal law or regulations adopted thereunder.</P>

          <P>(ii) For purposes of excluded commodities, no designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility by law, rule, regulation, or resolution adopted pursuant to this section shall apply to any transaction or position within the definition of <E T="03">bona fide hedging transactions and positions for excluded commodities</E> in § 1.3 of this chapter; <E T="03">provided, however,</E> that the designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility may limit bona fide hedging positions that it determines are not in accord with sound commercial practices or exceed an amount which may be established and liquidated in an orderly fashion.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> Persons seeking to establish eligibility for an exemption must comply with the procedures of the designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility for granting exemptions from its speculative position limit rules.

          <P>(3) Any person that is registered as a futures commission merchant or floor broker under authority of the Act, except to the extent that transactions made by such person are made on behalf of or for the account or benefit of such person.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Ongoing responsibilities.</E> Nothing in this part shall be construed to affect any provisions of the Act relating to manipulation or corners or to relieve any designated contract market, swap execution facility that is a trading facility, or governing board of a designated contract market or swap execution facility that is a trading facility from its responsibility under other provisions of the Act and regulations.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Compliance date.</E> The compliance date of this section shall be 60 days after the term “swap” is further defined under the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010.

          <EAR>Pt. 151, App. B</EAR>
          <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix B to Part 151—Examples of Bona Fide Hedging Transactions and Positions</HD>
          <P>A non-exhaustive list of examples of bona fide hedging transactions or positions under § 151.5 is presented below. A transaction or position qualifies as a bona fide hedging transaction or position when it meets the requirements under § 151.5(a)(1) and one of the enumerated provisions under § 151.5(a)(2). With respect to a transaction or position that does not fall within an example in this appendix , a person seeking to rely on a bona fide hedging exemption under § 151.5 may seek guidance from the Division of Market Oversight.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">1. Royalty Payments</HD>
          <P>a. <E T="03">Fact Pattern:</E> In order to develop an oil field, Company A approaches Bank B for financing. To facilitate the loan, Bank B first establishes an independent legal entity commonly known as a special purpose vehicle (SPV). Bank B then provides a loan to the SPV. Payments of principal and interest from the SPV to the Bank are based on a fixed price for crude oil. The SPV in turn makes a production loan to Company A. The terms of the production loan require Company A to provide the SPV with volumetric production payments (VPPs) based on the SPV's share of the production and the prevailing price of crude oil. Because the price of crude may fall, the SPV reduces that risk by entering into a NYMEX Light Sweet Crude Oil crude oil swap with Swap Dealer C. The swap requires the SPV to pay Swap Dealer C the floating price of crude oil and for Swap Dealer C to pay a fixed price. The notional quantity for the swap is equal to the expected production underlying the VPPs to the SPV.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Analysis:</E> The swap between Swap Dealer C and the SPV meets the general requirements for bona fide hedging transactions (§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and the specific requirements for royalty payments (§ 151.5(a)(2)(vi)). The VPPs that the SPV receives represent anticipated royalty payments from the oil field's production. The swap represents a substitute for transactions to be made in the physical marketing channel. The SPV's swap position qualifies as a hedge because it is <PRTPAGE P="353"/>economically appropriate to the reduction of risk. The SPV is reasonably certain that the notional quantity of the swap is equal to the expected production underlying the VPPs. The swap reduces the risk associated with a change in value of a royalty asset. The fluctuations in value of the SPV's anticipated royalties are substantially related to the fluctuations in value of the NYMEX Light Sweet Crude Oil Referenced Contract swap with Swap Dealer C. The risk-reducing position will not qualify as a bona fide hedge in a physical-delivery Referenced Contract during the spot month.</P>
          <P>b. <E T="03">Continuation of Fact Pattern:</E> Swap Dealer C offsets the risk associated with the swap to the SPV by selling Referenced Contracts. The notional quantity of the Referenced Contracts sold by Swap Dealer C exactly matches the notional quantity of the swap with the SPV.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Analysis:</E> Because the SPV enters the swap as a bona fide hedger under § 151.5(a)(2)(vi), the offset of the risk of the swap in a Referenced Contract by Swap Dealer C qualifies as a bona fide hedging transaction under § 151.5(a)(3). As provided in § 151.5(a)(3), the risk reducing position of Swap Dealer C does not qualify as a bona fide hedge in a physical-delivery Referenced Contract during the spot month.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">2. Sovereigns</HD>
          <P>a. <E T="03">Fact Pattern:</E> A Sovereign induces a farmer to sell his anticipated production of 100,000 bushels of corn forward to User A at a fixed price for delivery during the expected harvest. In return for the farmer entering into the fixed-price forward sale, the Sovereign agrees to pay the farmer the difference between the market price at the time of harvest and the price of the fixed-price forward, in the event that the market price is above the price of the forward. The fixed-price forward sale of 100,000 bushels of corn reduces the farmer's downside price risk associated with his anticipated agricultural production. The Sovereign faces commodity price risk as it stands ready to pay the farmer the difference between the market price and the price of the fixed-price contract. To reduce that risk, the Sovereign purchases 100,000 bushels of Chicago Board of Trade (“CBOT”) Corn Referenced Contract call options.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Analysis:</E> Because the Sovereign and the farmer are acting together pursuant to an express agreement, the aggregation provisions of § 151.7 and § 151.5(b) apply and they are treated as a single person. Taking the positions of the Sovereign and farmer jointly, the risk profile of the combination of the forward sale and the long call is approximately equivalent to the risk profile of a synthetic long put.<SU>521</SU>
            <FTREF/> A synthetic long put may be a bona fide hedge for anticipated production. Thus, that single person satisfies the general requirements for bona fide hedging transactions (§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and specific requirements for anticipated agricultural production (§ 151.5(a)(2)(i)(B)). The synthetic long put is a substitute for transactions that the farmer will make at a later time in the physical marketing channel after the crop is harvested. The synthetic long put reduces the price risk associated with anticipated agricultural production. The size of the hedge is equivalent to the size of the Sovereign's risk exposure. As provided under § 151.5(a)(2)(i)(B), the Sovereign's risk-reducing position will not qualify as a bona fide hedge in a physical-delivery Referenced Contract during the last five trading days.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">3. Services</HD>
          <P>a. <E T="03">Fact Pattern:</E> Company A enters into a risk service agreement to drill an oil well with Company B. The risk service agreement provides that a portion of the revenue receipts to Company A depends on the value of the oil produced. Company A is concerned that the price of oil may fall resulting in lower anticipated revenues from the risk service agreement. To reduce that risk, Company A sells 5,000 NYMEX Light Sweet Crude Oil Referenced Contracts, which is equivalent to the firm's anticipated share of the oil produced.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Analysis:</E> Company A's hedge of a portion of its revenue stream from the risk service agreement meets the general requirements for bona fide hedging (§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and the specific provisions for services (§ 151.5(a)(2)(vii)). Selling NYMEX Light Sweet Crude Oil Referenced Contracts is a substitute for transactions to be taken at a later time in the physical marketing channel once the oil is produced. The Referenced Contracts sold by Company A are economically appropriate to the reduction of risk because the total notional quantity of the Referenced Contracts sold by Company A equals its share of the expected quantity of future production under the risk service agreement. Because the price of oil may fall, the transactions in Referenced Contracts arise from a potential reduction in the value of the service that Company A is providing to Company B. The contract for services involves the production of a commodity underlying the NYMEX Exchange Light Sweet Crude Oil Referenced Contract. As provided under § 151.5(a)(2)(vii), the risk reducing position will not qualify as a bona fide hedge during <PRTPAGE P="354"/>the spot month of the physical-delivery Referenced Contract.</P>
          <P>b. <E T="03">Fact Pattern:</E> A City contracts with Firm A to provide waste management services. The contract requires that the trucks used to transport the solid waste use natural gas as a power source. According to the contract, the City will pay for the cost of the natural gas used to transport the solid waste by Firm A. In the event that natural gas prices rise, the City's waste transport expenses rise. To mitigate this risk, the City establishes a long position in NYMEX Natural Gas Referenced Contracts that is equivalent to the expected use of natural gas over the life of the service contract.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Analysis:</E> This transaction meets the general requirements for bona fide hedging transaction (§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and the specific provisions for services (§ 151.5(a)(2)(vii)). Because the City is responsible for paying the cash price for the natural gas used to power the trucks that transport the solid waste under the services agreement, the long hedge is a substitute for transactions to be taken at a later time in the physical marketing channel. The transaction is economically appropriate to the reduction of risk because the total notional quantity of the positions Referenced Contracts purchased equals the expected use of natural gas over the life of the contract. The positions in Referenced Contracts reduce the risk associated with an increase in anticipated liabilities that the City may incur in the event that the price of natural gas increases. The service contract involves the use of a commodity underlying a Referenced Contract. As provided under § 151.5(a)(2)(vii), the risk reducing position will not qualify as a bona fide hedge during the spot month of the physical-delivery Referenced Contract.</P>
          <P>c. <E T="03">Fact Pattern:</E> Natural Gas Producer A induces Pipeline Operator B to build a pipeline between Producer A's natural gas wells and the Henry Hub pipeline interconnection by entering into a fixed-price contract for natural gas transportation that guarantees a specified quantity of gas to be transported over the pipeline. With the construction of the new pipeline, Producer A plans to deliver natural gas to Henry Hub at a price differential between his gas wells and Henry Hub that is higher than its transportation cost. Producer A is concerned, however, that the price differential may decline. To lock in the price differential, Producer A decides to sell outright NYMEX Henry Hub Natural Gas Referenced Contract cash-settled futures contracts and buy an outright swap that NYMEX Henry Hub Natural Gas at his gas wells.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Analysis:</E> This transaction satisfies the general requirements for a bona fide hedge exemption (§§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and specific provisions for services (§ 151.5(a)(2)(vii)).<SU>522</SU>

            <FTREF/> The hedge represents a substitute for transactions to be taken in the future (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> selling natural gas at Henry Hub). The hedge is economically appropriate to the reduction of risk that the location differential will decline, provided the hedge is not larger than the quantity equivalent of the cash market commodity to be produced and transported. As provided under § 151.5(a)(2)(vii), the risk reducing position will not qualify as a bona fide hedge during the spot month of the physical-delivery Referenced Contract.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>522</SU> Note that in addition to the use of Referenced Contracts, Producer A could have hedged this risk by using a basis contract, which is excluded from the definition of Referenced Contracts.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">4. Lending a Commodity</HD>
          <P>a. <E T="03">Fact Pattern:</E> Bank B lends 1,000 ounces of gold to Jewelry Fabricator J at LIBOR plus a differential. Under the terms of the loan, Jewelry Fabricator J may later purchase the gold at a differential to the prevailing price of Commodity Exchange, Inc. (“COMEX”) Gold (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> an open-price purchase agreement embedded in the terms of the loan). Jewelry Fabricator J intends to use the gold to make jewelry and reimburse Bank B for the loan using the proceeds from jewelry sales. Because Bank B is concerned about its potential loss if the price of gold drops, it reduces the risk of a potential loss in the value of the gold by selling COMEX Gold Referenced Contracts with an equivalent notional quantity of 1,000 ounces of gold.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Analysis:</E> This transaction meets the general bona fide hedge exemption requirements (§§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and the specific requirements associated with owing a cash commodity (§ 151.5(a)(2)(i)). Bank B's short hedge of the gold represents a substitute for a transaction to be made in the physical marketing channel. Because the total notional quantity of the amount of gold contracts sold is equal to the amount of gold that Bank B owns, the hedge is economically appropriate to the reduction of risk. Finally, the transactions in Referenced Contracts arise from a potential change in the value of the gold owned by Bank B.</P>
          <P>b. <E T="03">Fact Pattern:</E> Silver Processor A agrees to purchase scrap metal from a Scrap Yard that will be processed into 5,000 ounces of silver. To finance the purchase, Silver Processor A borrows 5,000 ounces of silver from Bank B and sells the silver in the cash market. Using the proceeds from the sale of silver in the cash market, Silver Processor A pays the Scrap Yard for the scrap metal containing 5,000 ounces of silver at a negotiated discount from the current spot price. To <PRTPAGE P="355"/>repay Bank B, Silver Processor A may either: Provide Bank B with 5,000 ounces of silver and an interest payment based on a differential to LIBOR; or repay the Bank at the current COMEX Silver settlement price plus an interest payment based on a differential to LIBOR (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> an open-price purchase agreement). Silver Processor A processes and refines the scrap to repay Bank B. Although Bank B has lent the silver, it is still exposed to a reduction in value if the price of silver falls. Bank B reduces the risk of a possible decline in the value of their silver asset over the loan period by selling COMEX Silver Referenced Contracts with a total notional quantity equal to 5,000 ounces.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Analysis:</E> This transaction meets the general requirements for a bona fide hedging transaction (§§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and specific provisions for owning a commodity (§ 151.5(a)(2)(i)). Bank B's hedge of the silver that it owns represents a substitute for a transaction in the physical marketing channel. The hedge is economically appropriate to the reduction of risk because the bank owns 5,000 ounces of silver. The hedge reduces the risk of a potential change in the value of the silver that it owns.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">5. Processor Margins</HD>
          <P>a. <E T="03">Fact Pattern:</E> Soybean Processor A has a total throughput capacity of 100 million tons of soybeans per year. Soybean Processor A “crushes” soybeans into products (soybean oil and meal). It currently has 20 million tons of soybeans in storage and has offset that risk through fixed-price forward sales of the amount of products expected to be produced from crushing 20 million tons of soybeans, thus locking in the crushing margin on 20 million tons of soybeans. Because it has consistently operated its plant at full capacity over the last three years, it anticipates purchasing another 80 million tons of soybeans over the next year. It has not sold the crushed products forward. Processor A faces the risk that the difference in price between soybeans and the crushed products could change such that crush products (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the crush spread) will be insufficient to cover its operating margins. To lock in the crush spread, Processor A purchases 80 million tons of CBOT Soybean Referenced Contracts and sells CBOT Soybean Meal and Soybean Oil Referenced Contracts, such that the total notional quantity of soybean meal and oil Referenced Contracts equals the expected production from crushing soybeans into soybean meal and oil respectively.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Analysis:</E> These hedging transactions meet the general requirements for bona fide hedging transactions (§§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and the specific provisions for unfilled anticipated requirements and unsold anticipated agricultural production (§§ 151.5(a)(2)(i)-(ii)). Purchases of soybean Referenced Contracts qualify as bona fide hedging transaction provided they do not exceed the unfilled anticipated requirements of the cash commodity for one year (in this case 80 million tons). Such transactions are a substitute for purchases to be made at a later time in the physical marketing channel and are economically appropriate to the reduction of risk. The transactions in Referenced Contracts arise from a potential change in the value of soybeans that the processor anticipates owning. The size of the permissible hedge position in soybeans must be reduced by any inventories and fixed-price purchases because they are no longer unfilled requirements. As provided under § 151.5(a)(2)(ii)(C), the risk reduction position that is not in excess of the anticipated requirements for soybeans for that month and the next succeeding month qualifies as a bona fide hedge during the last five trading days provided it is not in a physical-delivery Referenced Contract.</P>

          <P>Given that Soybean Processor A has purchased 80 million tons worth of CBOT Soybean Referenced Contracts, it can reduce its processing risk by selling soybean meal and oil Referenced Contracts equivalent to the expected production. The sale of CBOT Soybean, Soybean Meal, and Soybean Oil contracts represents a substitute for transactions to be taken at a later time in the physical marketing channel by the soybean processor. Because the amount of soybean meal and oil Referenced Contracts sold forward by the soybean processor corresponds to expected production from 80 million tons of soybeans, the hedging transactions are economically appropriate to the reduction of risk in the conduct and management of the commercial enterprise. These transactions arise from a potential change in the value of soybean meal and oil that is expected to be produced. The size of the permissible hedge position in the products must be reduced by any fixed-price sales because they are no longer <E T="03">unsold</E> production. As provided under § 151.5(a)(2)(i)(B), the risk reducing position does not qualify as a bona fide hedge in a physical-delivery Referenced Contract during the last five trading days in the event the anticipated crushed products have not been produced.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">6. Portfolio Hedging</HD>
          <P>a. <E T="03">Fact Pattern:</E> It is currently January and Participant A owns five million bushels of corn located in its warehouses. Participant A has entered into fixed-price forward sale contracts with several processors for a total of five million bushels of corn that will be delivered in May of this year. Participant A has separately entered into fixed-price purchase contracts with several merchandisers for a total of two million bushels of corn to be delivered in March of this year. Participant A's gross long cash position is equal to <PRTPAGE P="356"/>seven million bushels of corn. Because Participant A has sold forward five million bushels of corn, its net cash position is equal to long two million bushels of corn. To reduce its price risk, Participant A chooses to sell the quantity equivalent of two million bushels of CBOT Corn Referenced Contracts.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Analysis:</E> The cash position and the fixed-price forward sale and purchases are all in the same crop year. Participant A currently owns five million bushels of corn and has effectively sold that amount forward. The firm is concerned that the remaining amount—two million bushels worth of fixed-price purchase contracts—will fall in value. Because the firm's net cash position is equal to long two million bushels of corn, the firm is exposed to price risk. Selling the quantity equivalent of two million bushels of CBOT Corn Referenced Contracts satisfies the general requirements for bona fide hedging transactions (§§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and the specific provisions associated with owning a commodity (§ 151.5(a)(2)(i)).<SU>523</SU>
            <FTREF/> Participant A's hedge of the two million bushels represents a substitute to a fixed-price forward sale at a later time in the physical marketing channel. The transaction is economically appropriate to the reduction of risk because the amount of Referenced Contracts sold does not exceed the quantity equivalent risk exposure (on a net basis) in the cash commodity in the current crop year. Lastly, the hedge arises from a potential change in the value of corn owned by Participant A.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>523</SU> Participant A could also choose to hedge on a gross basis. In that event, Participant A would sell the quantity equivalent of seven million bushels of March Chicago Board of Trade Corn Referenced Contracts, and separately purchase the quantity equivalent of five million bushels of May Chicago Board of Trade Corn Referenced Contracts.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">7. Anticipated Merchandising</HD>
          <P>a. <E T="03">Fact Pattern:</E> Elevator A, a grain merchandiser, owns a 31 million bushel storage facility. The facility currently has 1 million bushels of corn in storage. Based upon its historical purchasing and selling patterns for the last three years, Elevator A expects that in September it will enter into fixed-price forward purchase contracts for 30 million bushels of corn that it expects to sell in December. Currently the December corn futures price is substantially higher than the September corn futures price. In order to reduce the risk that its unfilled storage capacity will not be utilized over this period and in turn reduce Elevator A's profitability, Elevator A purchases the quantity equivalent of 30 million bushels of September CBOT Corn Referenced Contracts and sells 30 million bushels of December CBOT Corn Referenced Contracts.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Analysis:</E> This hedging transaction meets the general requirements for bona fide hedging transactions (§§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and specific provisions associated with anticipated merchandising (§ 151.5(a)(2)(v)). The hedging transaction is a substitute for transactions to be taken at a later time in the physical marketing channel. The hedge is economically appropriate to the reduction of risk associated with the firm's unfilled storage capacity because: (1) The December CBOT Corn futures price is substantially above the September CBOT Corn futures price; and (2) Elevator A reasonably expects to engage in the anticipated merchandising activity based on a review of its historical purchasing and selling patterns at that time of the year. The risk arises from a change in the value of an asset that the firm owns. As provided by § 151.5(a)(2)(v), the size of the hedge is equal to the firm's unfilled storage capacity relating to its anticipated merchandising activity. The purchase and sale of offsetting Referenced Contracts are in different months, which settle in not more than twelve months. As provided under § 151.5(a)(2)(v), the risk reducing position will not qualify as a bona fide hedge in a physical-delivery Referenced Contract during the last 5 trading days of the September contract.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">8. Aggregation of Persons</HD>
          <P>a. <E T="03">Fact Pattern:</E> Company A owns 100 percent of Company B. Company B buys and sells a variety of agricultural products, such as wheat and cotton. Company B currently owns 1 million bushels of wheat. To reduce some of its price risk, Company B decides to sell the quantity equivalent of 600,000 bushels of CBOT Wheat Referenced Contracts. After communicating with Company B, Company A decides to sell the quantity equivalent of 400,000 bushels of CBOT Wheat Referenced Contracts.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Analysis:</E> Because Company A owns more than 10 percent of Company B, Company A and B are aggregated together as one person under § 151.7. Under § 151.5(b), entities required to aggregate accounts or positions under § 151.7 shall be considered the same person for the purpose of determining whether a person or persons are eligible for a bona fide hedge exemption under paragraph § 151.5(a). The sale of wheat Referenced Contracts by Company A and B meets the general requirements for bona fide hedging transactions (§§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and the specific provisions for owning a cash commodity (§ 151.5(a)(2)(i)). The transactions in Referenced Contracts by Company A and B represent a substitute for transactions to be taken at a later time in the physical marketing channel. The transactions in Referenced Contracts by Company A and B are economically appropriate to the reduction of <PRTPAGE P="357"/>risk because the combined total of 1,000,000 bushels of CBOT Wheat Referenced Contracts sold by Company A and Company B does not exceed the 1,000,000 bushels of wheat that is owned by Company A. The risk exposure for Company A and B results from a potential change in the value of wheat.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">9. Repurchase Agreements</HD>
          <P>a. <E T="03">Fact Pattern:</E> When Elevator A purchased 500,000 bushels of wheat in April it decided to reduce its price risk by selling the quantity equivalent of 500,000 bushels of CBOT Wheat Referenced Contracts. Because the price of wheat has steadily risen since April, Elevator A has had to make substantial maintenance margin payments. To alleviate its concern about further margin payments, Elevator A decides to enter into a repurchase agreement with Bank B. The repurchase agreement involves two separate contracts: A fixed-price sale from Elevator A to Bank B at today's spot price; and an open-priced purchase agreement that will allow Elevator A to repurchase the wheat from Bank B at the prevailing spot price three months from now. Because Bank B obtains title to the wheat under the fixed-price purchase agreement, it is exposed to price risk should the price of wheat drop. It therefore decides to sell the quantity equivalent of 500,000 bushels of CBOT Wheat Referenced Contracts.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Analysis:</E> Bank B's hedging transaction meets the general requirements for bona fide hedging transactions (§§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and the specific provisions for owning the cash commodity (§ 151.5(a)(2)(i)). The sale of Referenced Contracts by Bank B is a substitute for a transaction to be taken at a later time in the physical marketing channel either to Elevator A or to another commercial party. The transaction is economically appropriate to the reduction of risk in the conduct and management of the commercial enterprise of Bank B because the notional quantity of Referenced Contracts sold by Bank B is not larger than the quantity of cash wheat purchased by Bank B. Finally, the purchase of CBOT Wheat Referenced Contracts reduces the risk associated with owning cash wheat.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">10. Inventory</HD>
          <P>a. <E T="03">Fact Pattern:</E> Copper Wire Fabricator A is concerned about possible reductions in the price of copper. Currently it is November and it owns inventory of 100,000 pounds of copper and 50,000 pounds of finished copper wire. Currently, deferred futures prices are lower than the nearby futures price. Copper Wire Fabricator A expects to sell 150,000 pounds of finished copper wire in February. To reduce its price risk, Copper Wire Fabricator A sells 150,000 pounds of February COMEX Copper Referenced Contracts.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Analysis:</E> The Copper Wire Fabricator A's hedging transaction meets the general requirements for bona fide hedging transactions (§§ 151.5(a)(1)(i)-(iii)) and the provisions for owning a commodity (§ 151.5(a)(2)(i)(A)). The sale of Referenced Contracts represents a substitute for transactions to be taken at a later time. The transactions are economically appropriate to the reduction of risk in the conduct and management of the commercial enterprise because the price of copper could drop further. The transactions in Referenced Contracts arise from a possible reduction in the value of the inventory that it owns.</P>

          <P>Each contract market shall adopt rules which shall, at a minimum, with respect to each member of the contract market acting as a floor broker:</P>

          <P>(a) Prohibit such member from purchasing any commodity for future delivery, purchasing any call option, or selling any put option, for his own account or for any account in which he <PRTPAGE P="358"/>has an interest, while holding an order of another person for the (1) purchase of any future, (2) purchase of any call option, or (3) sale of any put option, in the same commodity which is executable at the market price or at the price at which such purchase or sale can be made for the member's own account or any account in which he has an interest.</P>
          <P>(b) Prohibit such member from selling any commodity for future delivery, selling any call option, or purchasing any put option, for his own account or for any account in which he has an interest, while holding an order of another person for the (1) sale of any future, (2) sale of any call option, or (3) purchase of any put option, in the same commodity which is executable at the market price or at the price at which such sale or purchase can be made for the member's own account or any account in which he has an interest.</P>
          <P>(c) Prohibit such member from executing any transaction for any account of another person for which buying and/or selling orders can be placed or originated, or for which transactions can be executed, by such member without the prior specific consent of the account owner, regardless of whether the general authorization for such orders or transactions is pursuant to a written agreement, except that orders for such an account may be placed with another member for execution.</P>
          <P>(d) Prohibit such member from disclosing at any time that he is holding an order of another person or from divulging any order revealed to him by reason of his relationship to such other person, except pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section or at the request of an authorized representative of the Commission or the contract market.</P>
          <P>(e) Prohibit such member from taking, directly or indirectly, the other side of any order of another person revealed to him by reason of his relationship to such other person, except with such other person's prior consent and in conformity with contract market rules approved by the Commission.</P>
          <P>(f) Prohibit such member from making any purchase or sale which has been directly or indirectly prearranged.</P>
          <P>(g) Prohibit such member from allocating trades among accounts except in accordance with rules of the contract market which have been approved by the Commission.</P>
          <P>(h) Prohibit such member from withholding or withdrawing from the market any order or part of an order of another person for the convenience of another member.</P>
          <P>(i) Require that every execution of a transaction on the floor by such member be confirmed promptly with the opposite floor broker or floor trader; such confirmation shall identify price or premium, quantity, future or commodity option and respective clearing members. In the event a contract market cannot require prompt identification of respective clearing members without seriously disrupting the functions of its marketplace, the contract market may petition the Commission for exemption from this requirement. Such petition shall include:</P>
          <P>(1) An explanation of why the contract market cannot require the prompt identification of respective clearing members without seriously disrupting the functions of its marketplace, and</P>
          <P>(2) A proposed contract market rule which will insure that the opposite sides of every trade executed on the contract market can be effectively matched and will be accepted by a clearing member for clearance or will be otherwise sufficiently guaranteed.</P>

          <FP>The Commission may, in its discretion and upon such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, grant such petition for exemption upon finding that the functions of the contract market may be seriously disrupted by requiring the prompt identification of respective clearing members and that the contract market appears to have adequately insured that every trade executed thereon can be effectively matched and will be accepted by a <PRTPAGE P="359"/>clearing member for clearance or will be otherwise sufficiently guaranteed.</FP>

          <P>(b) <E T="03">Contract market rules required.</E> Each contract market must adopt and maintain in effect rules, which have been submitted to the Commission pursuant to section 5a(a)(12)(A) of the Act and Commission Regulation 1.41, that, at a minimum, (1) define the term “broker association” to include the relationships set forth in § 156.1 of this part, (2) prohibit conduct described in paragraph (a) of this section, and (3) require registration of each relationship defined by its rules as a broker association no later than 10 days after establishment of such relationship. Contract market records of registration shall include the following information with respect to each broker association, if applicable:</P>
          <P>(i) Name;</P>

            <P>(iii) <E T="03">No substantial delay of customer's transaction.</E> Providing notice not later than when you establish a customer relationship would not substantially delay the customer's transaction when the relationship is initiated in person at your office or through other means by which the customer may view the notice, such as on a web site.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Delivery of notice.</E> When you are required by this section to deliver an initial privacy notice, you must deliver it according to the provisions of § 160.9.

            <P>(a)(1) <E T="03">Form of opt out notice.</E> If you are required to provide an opt out notice under § 160.10(a), you must provide a clear and conspicuous notice to each of your consumers that accurately explains the right to opt out under that section. The notice must state:</P>
            <P>(i) That you disclose or reserve the right to disclose nonpublic personal information about your consumer to a nonaffiliated third party;</P>
            <P>(ii) That the consumer has the right to opt out of that disclosure; and</P>
            <P>(iii) A reasonable means by which the consumer may exercise the opt out right.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Examples</E>—(i) <E T="03">Adequate opt out notice.</E> You provide adequate notice that the consumer can opt out of the disclosure of nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party if you:</P>

            <P>(A) Identify all of the categories of nonpublic personal information that you disclose or reserve the right to disclose, and all of the categories of nonaffiliated third parties to which you disclose the information, as described <PRTPAGE P="372"/>in § 160.6(a)(2) and (3), and state that the consumer can opt out of the disclosure of that information; and</P>
            <P>(B) Identify the financial products or services that the consumer obtains from you, either singly or jointly, to which the opt out direction would apply.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Reasonable means to opt out.</E> You provide a reasonable means to exercise an opt out right if you:</P>
            <P>(A) Designate check-off boxes in a prominent position on the relevant forms with the opt out notice;</P>
            <P>(B) Include a reply form together with the opt out notice;</P>
            <P>(C) Provide an electronic means to opt out, such as a form that can be sent via electronic mail or a process at your web site, if the consumer agrees to the electronic delivery of information; or</P>
            <P>(D) Provide a toll-free telephone number that consumers may call to opt out.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Unreasonable opt out means.</E> You do not provide a reasonable means of opting out if:</P>
            <P>(A) The only means of opting out is for the consumer to write his or her own letter to exercise that opt out right; or</P>
            <P>(B) The only means of opting out as described in any notice subsequent to the initial notice is to use a check-off box that you provided with the initial notice but did not include with the subsequent notice.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Specific opt out means.</E> You may require each consumer to opt out through a specific means, as long as that means is reasonable for the consumer.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Same form as initial notice permitted.</E> You may provide the opt out notice together with or on the same written or electronic form, as the initial notice you provide in accordance with § 160.4.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Initial notice required when opt out notice delivered subsequent to initial notice.</E> If you provide the opt out notice after the initial notice in accordance with § 160.4, you must also include a copy of the initial notice with the opt out notice in writing, or, if the consumer agrees, electronically.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Joint relationships.</E> (1) If two or more consumers jointly obtain a financial product or service from you, you may provide a single opt out notice; however, you must honor a request from one or more joint account holders for a separate opt out notice. Your opt out notice must explain how you will treat an opt out direction by a joint consumer.</P>
            <P>(2) Any of the joint consumers may exercise the right to opt out. You may either:</P>
            <P>(i) Treat an opt out direction by a joint consumer as applying to all of the associated joint consumers; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Permit each joint consumer to opt out separately.</P>
            <P>(3) If you permit each joint consumer to opt out separately, you must permit one of the joint consumers to opt out on behalf of all of the joint consumers.</P>
            <P>(4) You may not require all joint consumers to opt out before you implement any opt out direction.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Example.</E> If John and Mary have a joint trading account with you and arrange for you to send statements to John's address, you may do any of the following, but you must explain in your opt out notice which opt out policy you will follow:</P>
            <P>(i) Send a single opt out notice to John's address, but you must accept an opt out direction from either John or Mary;</P>
            <P>(ii) Treat an opt out direction by either John or Mary as applying to the entire account. If you do so, and John opts out, you may not require Mary to opt out as well before implementing John's opt out direction; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Permit John and Mary to make different opt out directions. If you do so:</P>

            <P>(b) The model form is a standardized form, including page layout, content, format, style, pagination, and shading. Institutions seeking to obtain the safe harbor through use of the model form may modify it only as described in these Instructions.</P>
            <P>(c) Note that disclosure of certain information, such as assets, income, and information from a consumer reporting agency, may give rise to obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act [15 U.S.C. 1681-1681x] (FCRA), such as a requirement to permit a consumer to opt out of disclosures to affiliates or designation as a consumer reporting agency if disclosures are made to nonaffiliated third parties.</P>
            <P>(d) The word “customer” may be replaced by the word “member” whenever it appears in the model form, as appropriate.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. The Contents of the Model Privacy Form</HD>
            <P>The model form consists of two pages, which may be printed on both sides of a single sheet of paper, or may appear on two separate pages. Where an institution provides a long list of institutions at the end of the model form in accordance with Instruction C.3(a)(1), or provides additional information in accordance with Instruction C.3(c), and such list or additional information exceeds the space available on page two of the model form, such list or additional information may extend to a third page.</P>

            <P>(1) Date last revised (upper right-hand corner).</P>
            <P>(2) Title.</P>
            <P>(3) Key frame (Why?, What?, How?).</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Easily readable type font.</E> Financial institutions that use the model form must use an easily readable type font. While a number of factors together produce easily readable type font, institutions are required to use a minimum of 10-point font (unless otherwise expressly permitted in these Instructions) and sufficient spacing between the lines of type.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Logo.</E> A financial institution may include a corporate logo on any page of the notice, so long as it does not interfere with the <PRTPAGE P="387"/>readability of the model form or the space constraints of each page.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Page size and orientation.</E> Each page of the model form must be printed on paper in portrait orientation, the size of which must be sufficient to meet the layout and minimum font size requirements, with sufficient white space on the top, bottom, and sides of the content.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Color.</E> The model form must be printed on white or light color paper (such as cream) with black or other contrasting ink color. Spot color may be used to achieve visual interest, so long as the color contrast is distinctive and the color does not detract from the readability of the model form. Logos may also be printed in color.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Languages.</E> The model form may be translated into languages other than English.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Information Required in the Model Privacy Form</HD>
            <P>The information in the model form may be modified only as described below:</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">General instructions for the “What?” box.</E> (1) The bulleted list identifies the types of personal information that the institution collects and shares. All institutions must use the term “Social Security number” in the first bullet.</P>
            <P>(2) Institutions must use five (5) of the following terms to complete the bulleted list: Income; account balances; payment history; transaction history; transaction or loss history; credit history; credit scores; assets; investment experience; credit-based insurance scores; insurance claim history; medical information; overdraft history; purchase history; account transactions; risk tolerance; medical-related debts; credit card or other debt; mortgage rates and payments; retirement assets; checking account information; employment information; wire transfer instructions.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">General instructions for the disclosure table.</E> The left column lists reasons for sharing or using personal information. Each reason correlates to a specific legal provision described in paragraph C.2(d) of this Instruction. In the middle column, each institution must provide a “Yes” or “No” response that accurately reflects its information sharing policies and practices with respect to the reason listed on the left. In the right column, each institution must provide in each box one of the following three (3) responses, as applicable, that reflects whether a consumer can limit such sharing: “Yes” if it is required to or voluntarily provides an opt-out; “No” if it does not provide an opt-out; or “We don't share” if it answers “No” in the middle column. Only the sixth row (“For our affiliates to market to you”) may be omitted at the option of the institution. <E T="03">See</E> paragraph C.2(d)(6) of this Instruction.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Specific disclosures and corresponding legal provisions.</E> (1) <E T="03">For our everyday business purposes.</E> This reason incorporates sharing information under §§ 160.14 and 160.15 and with service providers pursuant to § 160.13 of this part other than the purposes specified in paragraphs C.2(d)(2) or C.2(d)(3) of these Instructions.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">For our marketing purposes.</E> This reason incorporates sharing information with service providers by an institution for its own marketing pursuant to § 160.13 of this part. An institution that shares for this reason may choose to provide an opt-out.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">For joint marketing with other financial companies.</E> This reason incorporates sharing information under joint marketing agreements between two or more financial institutions and with any service provider used in connection with such agreements pursuant to § 160.13 of this part. An institution that shares for this reason may choose to provide an opt-out.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">For our affiliates' everyday business purposes—information about transactions and experiences.</E> This reason incorporates sharing information specified in sections 603(d)(2)(A)(i) and (ii) of the FCRA. An institution that shares for this reason may choose to provide an opt-out.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">For our affiliates' everyday business purposes—information about creditworthiness.</E> This reason incorporates sharing information pursuant to section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) of the FCRA. An institution that shares for this reason must provide an opt-out.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">For our affiliates to market to you.</E> This reason incorporates sharing information specified in section 624 of the FCRA. This reason may be omitted from the disclosure table when: the institution does not have affiliates (or does not disclose personal information to its affiliates); the institution's affiliates do not use personal information in a manner that requires an opt-out; or the institution provides the affiliate marketing notice separately. Institutions that include <PRTPAGE P="388"/>this reason must provide an opt-out of indefinite duration. An institution not required to provide an opt-out under this subparagraph may elect to include this reason in the model form. Note: The CFTC's Regulations do not address the affiliate marketing rule.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">For nonaffiliates to market to you.</E> This reason incorporates sharing described in §§ 160.7 and 160.10(a) of this part. An institution that shares personal information for this reason must provide an opt-out.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">To limit our sharing:</E> A financial institution must include this section of the model form <E T="03">only</E> if it provides an opt-out. The word “choice” may be written in either the singular or plural, as appropriate. Institutions must select one or more of the applicable opt-out methods described: telephone, such as by a toll-free number; a Web site; or use of a mail-in opt-out form. Institutions may include the words “toll-free” before telephone, as appropriate. An institution that allows consumers to opt out online must provide either a specific Web address that takes consumers directly to the opt-out page or a general Web address that provides a clear and conspicuous direct link to the opt-out page. The opt-out choices made available to the consumer who contacts the institution through these methods must correspond accurately to the “Yes” responses in the third column of the disclosure table. In the part titled “Please note” institutions may insert a number that is 30 or greater in the space marked “[30].” Instructions on voluntary or state privacy law opt-out information are in paragraph C.2(g)(5) of these Instructions.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Questions box.</E> Customer service contact information must be inserted as appropriate, where [phone number] or [Web site] appear.

            <P>(g) <E T="03">Mail-in opt-out form.</E> Financial institutions must include this mail-in form <E T="03">only</E> if they state in the “To limit our sharing” box that consumers can opt out by mail. The mail-in form must provide opt-out options that correspond accurately to the “Yes” responses in the third column in the disclosure table. Institutions that require customers to provide only name and address may omit the section identified as “[account #].” Institutions that require additional or different information, such as a random opt-out number or a truncated account number, to implement an opt-out election should modify the “[account #]” reference accordingly. This includes institutions that require customers with multiple accounts to identify each account to which the opt-out should apply. An institution must enter its opt-out mailing address: in the far right of this form (<E T="03">see</E> version 3); or below the form (<E T="03">see</E> version 4). The reverse side of the mail-in opt-out form must not include any content of the model form.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Joint accountholder.</E> Only institutions that provide their joint accountholders the choice to opt out for only one accountholder, in accordance with paragraph C.3(a)(5) of these Instructions, must include in the far left column of the mail-in form the following statement: “If you have a joint account, your choice(s) will apply to everyone on your account unless you mark below. Apply my choice(s) only to me.” The word “choice” may be written in either the singular or plural, as appropriate. Financial institutions that provide insurance products or services, provide this option, and elect to use the model form may substitute the word “policy” for “account” in this statement. Institutions that do not provide this option may eliminate this left column from the mail-in form.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">FCRA Section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) opt-out.</E> If the institution shares personal information pursuant to section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) of the FCRA, it must include in the mail-in opt-out form the following statement: “Do not share information about my creditworthiness with your affiliates for their everyday business purposes.”</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">FCRA Section 624 opt-out.</E> If the institution incorporates section 624 of the FCRA in accord with paragraph C.2(d)(6) of these Instructions, it must include in the mail-in opt-out form the following statement: “Do not allow your affiliates to use my personal information to market to me.”</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Nonaffiliate opt-out.</E> If the financial institution shares personal information pursuant to § 160.10(a) of this part, it must include in the mail-in opt-out form the following statement: “Do not share my personal information with nonaffiliates to market their products and services to me.”</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Additional opt-outs.</E> Financial institutions that use the disclosure table to provide opt-out options beyond those required by Federal law must provide those opt-outs in this section of the model form. A financial institution that chooses to offer an opt-out for its own marketing in the mail-in opt-out form must include one of the two following statements: “Do not share my personal information to market to me.” <E T="03">or</E> “Do not use my personal information to market to me.” A financial institution that chooses to offer an opt-out for joint marketing must include the following statement: “Do not share my personal information with other financial institutions to jointly market to me.”</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Barcodes.</E> A financial institution may elect to include a barcode and/or “tagline” (an internal identifier) in 6-point font at the bottom of page one, as needed for information internal to the institution, so long as these do not interfere with the clarity or text of the form.<PRTPAGE P="389"/>

            <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Page Two</HD>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General Instructions for the Questions.</E> Certain of the Questions may be customized as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">“Who is providing this notice?”</E> This question may be omitted where only one financial institution provides the model form and that institution is clearly identified in the title on page one. Two or more financial institutions that jointly provide the model form must use this question to identify themselves as required by § 160.9(f) of this part. Where the list of institutions exceeds four (4) lines, the institution must describe in the response to this question the general types of institutions jointly providing the notice and must separately identify those institutions, in minimum 8-point font, directly following the “Other important information” box, or, if that box is not included in the institution's form, directly following the “Definitions.” The list may appear in a multi-column format.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">“How does [name of financial institution] protect my personal information?”</E> The financial institution may only provide additional information pertaining to its safeguards practices following the designated response to this question. Such information may include information about the institution's use of cookies or other measures it uses to safeguard personal information. Institutions are limited to a maximum of 30 additional words.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">“How does [name of financial institution] collect my personal information?”</E> Institutions must use five (5) of the following terms to complete the bulleted list for this question: Open an account; deposit money; pay your bills; apply for a loan; use your credit or debit card; seek financial or tax advice; apply for insurance; pay insurance premiums; file an insurance claim; seek advice about your investments; buy securities from us; sell securities to us; direct us to buy securities; direct us to sell your securities; make deposits or withdrawals from your account; enter into an investment advisory contract; give us your income information; provide employment information; give us your employment history; tell us about your investment or retirement portfolio; tell us about your investment or retirement earnings; apply for financing; apply for a lease; provide account information; give us your contact information; pay us by check; give us your wage statements; provide your mortgage information; make a wire transfer; tell us who receives the money; tell us where to send the money; show your government-issued ID; show your driver's license; order a commodity futures or option trade.

            <P>(4) <E T="03">“Why can't I limit all sharing?”</E> Institutions that describe state privacy law provisions in the <E T="03">“Other important information”</E> box must use the bracketed sentence: “See below for more on your rights under state law.” Other institutions must omit this sentence.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">“What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with someone else?”</E> Only financial institutions that provide opt-out options must use this question. Other institutions must omit this question. Institutions must choose one of the following two statements to respond to this question: “Your choices will apply to everyone on your account.” or “Your choices will apply to everyone on your account—unless you tell us otherwise.” Financial institutions that provide insurance products or services and elect to use the model form may substitute the word “policy” for “account” in these statements.</P>

This specific information must be in italicized lettering to set off the information from the standardized definitions.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Affiliates.</E> As required by § 160.6(a)(3) of this part, where [<E T="03">affiliate information</E>] appears, the financial institution must:</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Receipt of eligibility information.</E> A covered affiliate may receive eligibility information from an affiliate in various ways, including when the affiliate places that information into a common database that the covered affiliate may access.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Service providers.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (d)(5) of this section, a covered affiliate receives or uses an affiliate's eligibility information if a service provider acting on the covered affiliate's behalf (regardless of whether such service provider is a third party or an affiliate of the covered affiliate) receives or uses that information in the manner described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (d)(1)(ii) of this section. All relevant facts and circumstances will determine whether a service provider is acting on behalf of a covered affiliate when it receives or uses an affiliate's eligibility information in connection with marketing the covered affiliate's financial products or services.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Use by an affiliate of its own eligibility information.</E> Unless a covered affiliate uses eligibility information that the covered affiliate receives from an affiliate in the manner described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the covered affiliate does not make a solicitation subject to this subpart:</P>
            <P>(i) Uses its own eligibility information that it obtained in connection with a pre-existing business relationship it has or previously had with the consumer to market the covered affiliate's financial products or services to the consumer; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Directs its service provider to use the affiliate's own eligibility information that it obtained in connection with a pre-existing business relationship it has or previously had with the consumer to market the covered affiliate's financial products or services to the consumer, and the covered affiliate does not communicate directly with the service provider regarding that use.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Use of eligibility information by a service provider</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> A covered affiliate does not make a solicitation subject to this subpart if a service provider (including an affiliated or third-party service provider that maintains or accesses a common database that the covered affiliate may access) receives eligibility information from an affiliate that has or previously had a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and uses that eligibility information to market the covered affiliate's financial products or services to the consumer, so long as—</P>
            <P>(A) The affiliate controls access to and use of its eligibility information by the service provider (including the right to establish the specific terms and conditions under which the service provider may use such information to market the covered affiliate's financial products or services);</P>
            <P>(B) The affiliate establishes specific terms and conditions under which the service provider may access and use such affiliate's eligibility information to market the covered affiliate's financial products and services (or those of affiliates generally) to the consumer, such as the identity of the affiliated companies whose financial products or services may be marketed to the consumer by the service provider, the types of financial products or services of affiliated companies that may be marketed, and the number of times the consumer may receive marketing materials, and periodically evaluates the service provider's compliance with those terms and conditions;</P>
            <P>(C) The affiliate requires the service provider to implement reasonable policies and procedures designed to ensure that the service provider uses such affiliate's eligibility information in accordance with the terms and conditions established by such affiliate relating to the marketing of the covered affiliate's financial products or services;</P>
            <P>(D) The affiliate is identified on or with the marketing materials provided to the consumer; and</P>
            <P>(E) The covered affiliate does not directly use its affiliate's eligibility information in the manner described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Writing requirements.</E> (A) The requirements of paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) and (C) of this section must be set forth in a written agreement between the affiliate that has or previously had a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and the service provider; and</P>

            <P>(B) The specific terms and conditions established by the affiliate as provided <PRTPAGE P="396"/>in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section must be set forth in writing.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Relation to affiliate-sharing notice and opt out.</E> Nothing in this rulemaking will limit the responsibility of a covered affiliate to comply with the notice and opt-out provisions under other privacy rules under the FCRA, the GLB Act or the CEA.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Scope and duration of opt out.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope of opt-out election</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The consumer's election to opt out prohibits any covered affiliate subject to the scope of the opt-out notice from using eligibility information received from another affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Continuing relationship</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> If the consumer establishes a continuing relationship with a covered affiliate or its affiliate, an opt-out notice may apply to eligibility information obtained in connection with—</P>
            <P>(A) A single continuing relationship or multiple continuing relationships that the consumer establishes with a covered affiliate or its affiliates, including continuing relationships established subsequent to delivery of the opt-out notice, so long as the notice adequately describes the continuing relationships covered by the opt out; or</P>
            <P>(B) Any other transaction between the consumer and the covered affiliate or its affiliates as described in the notice.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Examples of a continuing relationship.</E> A consumer has a continuing relationship with a covered affiliate or its affiliate if:</P>
            <P>(A) The covered affiliate is a futures commission merchant through whom a consumer has opened an account, or that carries the consumer's account on a fully-disclosed basis, or that effects or engages in commodity interest transactions with or for a consumer, even if the covered affiliate does not hold any assets of the consumer;</P>
            <P>(B) The covered affiliate is an introducing broker that solicits or accepts specific orders for trades;</P>
            <P>(C) The covered affiliate is a commodity trading advisor with whom a consumer has a contract or subscription, either written or oral, regardless of whether the advice is standardized, or is based on, or tailored to, the commodity interest or cash market positions or other circumstances or characteristics of the particular consumer;</P>
            <P>(D) The covered affiliate is a commodity pool operator, and accepts or receives from the consumer, funds, securities, or property for the purpose of purchasing an interest in a commodity pool;</P>
            <P>(E) The covered affiliate is a major swap participant that holds securities or other assets as collateral for a loan made to the consumer, even if the covered affiliate did not make the loan or do not affect any transactions on behalf of the consumer; or</P>
            <P>(F) The covered affiliate is a swap dealer that regularly effects or engages in swap transactions with or for a consumer even if the covered affiliate does not hold any assets of the consumer.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">No continuing relationship</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> If there is no continuing relationship between a consumer and the covered affiliate or its affiliate, and the covered affiliate or its affiliate obtain eligibility information about a consumer in connection with a transaction with the consumer, such as an isolated transaction or a credit application that is denied, an opt-out notice provided to the consumer only applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with that transaction.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Examples of no continuing relationship.</E> A consumer does not have a continuing relationship with a covered affiliate or its affiliate if:</P>
            <P>(A) The covered affiliate has acted solely as a “finder” for a futures commission merchant, and the covered affiliate does not solicit or accept specific orders for trades; or</P>
            <P>(B) The covered affiliate has solicited the consumer to participate in a pool or to direct his or her account and he or she has not provided the covered affiliate with funds to participate in a pool or entered into any agreement with the covered affiliate to direct his or her account.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Menu of alternatives.</E> A consumer may be given the opportunity to choose from a menu of alternatives when electing to prohibit solicitations, such as by electing to prohibit solicitations from certain types of affiliates covered by the opt-out notice but not other types of affiliates covered by the <PRTPAGE P="397"/>notice, electing to prohibit solicitations based on certain types of eligibility information but not other types of eligibility information, or electing to prohibit solicitations by certain methods of delivery but not other methods of delivery. However, one of the alternatives must allow the consumer to prohibit all solicitations from all of the affiliates that are covered by the notice.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Special rule for a notice following termination of all continuing relationships.</E> A consumer must be given a new opt-out notice if, after all continuing relationships with the covered affiliate or its affiliate(s) are terminated, the consumer subsequently establishes another continuing relationship with the covered affiliate or its affiliate(s) and the consumer's eligibility information is to be used to make a solicitation. The new opt-out notice must apply, at a minimum, to eligibility information obtained in connection with the new continuing relationship. Consistent with paragraph b of this section, the consumer's decision not to opt out after receiving the new opt-out notice would not override a prior opt-out election by the consumer that applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with a terminated relationship, regardless of whether the new opt-out notice applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with the terminated relationship.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Duration of opt-out election.</E> An opt-out election must be effective for a period of at least five years beginning when the consumer's opt-out election is received and implemented, unless the consumer subsequently revokes the opt-out election in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically. An opt-out election may be established for a period of more than five years or for an indefinite period unless revoked.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period in which a consumer can opt out.</E> A consumer may opt out at any time.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">No effect on opt-out period.</E> An opt-out period may not be shortened by sending a renewal notice to the consumer before expiration of the opt-out period, even if the consumer does not renew the opt out.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Contents of the opt-out notice</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> An opt-out notice must be in writing, be clear and conspicuous, as well as concise, and must accurately disclose the following:</P>
            <P>(i) (A) The name of the affiliate that has or previously had a pre-existing business relationship with a consumer, which is providing the notice; or</P>
            <P>(B) If jointly provided jointly by multiple affiliates and each affiliate shares a common name, then the notice may indicate that it is being provided by multiple companies with the same name or multiple companies in the same group or family of companies. If the affiliates providing the notice do not share a common name, then the notice must either separately identify each affiliate by name or identify each of the common names used by those affiliates;</P>
            <P>(ii) The list of affiliates or types of affiliates whose use of eligibility information is covered by the notice, which may include companies that become affiliates after the notice is provided to the consumer;</P>
            <P>(iii) A general description of the types of eligibility information that may be used to make solicitations to the consumer;</P>
            <P>(iv) A statement that the consumer may elect to limit the use of eligibility information to make solicitations to the consumer;</P>
            <P>(v) A statement that the consumer's election will apply for the specified period of time and, if applicable, that the consumer will be allowed to renew the election once that period expires;</P>
            <P>(vi) If the notice is provided to consumers who have previously elected to opt out, that such consumer does not need to act again until the consumer receives a renewal notice; and</P>
            <P>(vii) A reasonable and simple method for the consumer to opt out.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Specifying length of time period.</E> If consumer is granted an opt-out period longer than a five-year duration, the opt-out notice must specify the length of the opt-out period.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">No revised notice for extension of opt-out period.</E> The duration of an opt-out period may be increased for a period longer than the period specified in <PRTPAGE P="398"/>the opt-out notice without having to provide a revised notice of the increase to the consumer.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Joint relationships.</E> (1) If two or more consumers jointly obtain a financial product or service, a single opt-out notice may be provided to joint consumers.</P>
            <P>(2) Any of the joint consumers may exercise the right to opt out on behalf of each joint consumer.</P>
            <P>(3) The opt-out election notice must explain how an opt-out election by a joint consumer will be treated. That is, the notice should specify whether an opt-out election by a joint consumer will be treated as applying to all of the associated joint consumers, or as applying to each joint consumer separately.</P>
            <P>(4) If the opt-out election notice provides that each joint consumer is permitted to opt out separately, one of the joint consumers must be permitted to opt out on behalf of all of the joint consumers and the joint consumer must be permitted to exercise his or her separate rights to opt out in a single response.</P>
            <P>(5) A covered affiliate cannot require all joint consumers to opt out before implementing any opt-out election.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Alternative contents.</E> If the consumer is afforded a broader right to opt out of receiving marketing than is required by this subpart, the requirements of this section may be satisfied by providing the consumer with a clear, conspicuous, and concise notice that accurately discloses the consumer's opt-out rights.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Coordinated and consolidated consumer notices.</E> A notice required by this subpart may be coordinated and consolidated with any other notice or disclosure required to be issued under any other provision of law by the covered affiliate providing the notice, including but not limited to notices in the FCRA or the GLB Act privacy notices.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Equivalent notices.</E> A notice or disclosure that is equivalent to the notice required by this part in terms of content, and that is provided to a consumer together with a notice required by any other provision of law, satisfies the requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Model notices.</E> Model notices are provided in appendix A of this part. These notices were meant to facilitate compliance with this subpart; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be interpreted to require persons subject to this part to use the model notices.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> A covered affiliate must not use eligibility information about a consumer that the covered affiliate receives from an affiliate to make a solicitation to such consumer about the covered affiliate's financial products or services, unless the consumer is provided a reasonable opportunity to opt out, as required by this subpart.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Examples.</E> A reasonable opportunity to opt out under this subpart is:</P>
            <P>(1) If the opt-out notice is mailed to the consumer, the consumer has 30 days from the date the notice is mailed to opt out.</P>
            <P>(2) If the opt-out notice is sent <E T="03">via</E> electronic means to the consumer, the consumer has 30 days from the date the consumer acknowledges receipt to elect to opt out by any reasonable method.</P>
            <P>(3) If the opt-out notice is sent <E T="03">via</E> e-mail (where the consumer has agreed to receive disclosures by e-mail), the consumer is given 30 days after the e-mail is sent to elect to opt out by any reasonable method.</P>
            <P>(4) If the opt-out notice provided to the consumer at the time of an electronic transaction, the consumer is required to decide, as a necessary part of proceeding with the transaction, whether to opt out before completing the transaction.</P>
            <P>(5) If the opt-out notice is provided during an in-person transaction, the consumer is required to decide, as a necessary part of completing the transaction, whether to opt out through a simple process.</P>
            <P>(6) If the opt-out notice is provided in conjunction with other privacy notices required by law, the consumer is allowed to exercise the opt-out election within a reasonable period of time and in the same manner as the opt out under that privacy notice.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Definition of cardholder.</E> For purposes of this section, a cardholder means a consumer who has been issued a credit or debit card.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Address validation requirements.</E> A card issuer must establish and implement reasonable policies and procedures to assess the validity of a change of address if it receives notification of a change of address for a consumer's debit or credit card account and, within a short period of time afterwards (during at least the first 30 days after it receives such notification), the card issuer receives a request for an additional or replacement card for the same account. Under these circumstances, the card issuer may not issue an additional or replacement card, until, in accordance with its reasonable policies and procedures and for the purpose of assessing the validity of the change of address, the card issuer:</P>
            <P>(1)(i) Notifies the cardholder of the request:</P>

            <P>A. Although use of the model forms is not required, use of the model forms in this appendix (as applicable) complies with the requirement in section 624 of the FCRA for clear, conspicuous, and concise notices.</P>
            <P>B. Certain changes may be made to the language or format of the model forms without losing the protection from liability afforded by use of the model forms. These changes may not be so extensive as to affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the language in the model forms. Persons making such extensive revisions will lose the safe harbor that this appendix provides. Acceptable changes include, for example:</P>
            <P>1. Rearranging the order of the references to “your income”, “your account history”, and “your credit score”.</P>
            <P>2. Substituting other types of information for “income”, “account history”, or “credit score” for accuracy, such as “payment history”, “credit history”, or “claims history”.</P>
            <P>3.

            <P>7. Adding a statement that the consumer may exercise the right to opt out at any time.</P>
            <P>8. Adding the following statement, if accurate: “If you previously opted out, you do not need to do so again.”</P>

            <P>Section 162.30 requires each financial institution or creditor that offers or maintains one or more covered accounts, as defined in § 162.30(b)(3), to develop and provide for the continued administration of a written Identity Theft Prevention Program to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of a covered account or any existing covered account. These guidelines are intended to assist financial institutions and creditors in the formulation and maintenance of an Identity Theft Prevention Program that satisfies the requirements of § 162.30.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. The Identity Theft Prevention Program</HD>
            <P>In designing its Identity Theft Prevention Program, a financial institution or creditor may incorporate, as appropriate, its existing policies, procedures, and other arrangements that control reasonably foreseeable risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Identifying Relevant Red Flags</HD>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Risk factors.</E> A financial institution or creditor should consider the following factors in identifying relevant Red Flags for covered accounts, as appropriate:</P>
            <P>(1) The types of covered accounts it offers or maintains;</P>
            <P>(2) The methods it provides to open its covered accounts;</P>
            <P>(3) The methods it provides to access its covered accounts; and</P>
            <P>(4) Its previous experiences with identity theft.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Sources of Red Flags.</E> Financial institutions and creditors should incorporate relevant Red Flags from sources such as:</P>
            <P>(1) Incidents of identity theft that the financial institution or creditor has experienced;</P>
            <P>(2) Methods of identity theft that the financial institution or creditor has identified that reflect changes in identity theft risks; and</P>
            <P>(3) Applicable supervisory guidance.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Categories of Red Flags.</E> The Identity Theft Prevention Program should include relevant Red Flags from the following categories, as appropriate. Examples of Red Flags from each of these categories are appended as Supplement A to this Appendix B.</P>
            <P>(1) Alerts, notifications, or other warnings received from consumer reporting agencies or service providers, such as fraud detection services;</P>
            <P>(2) The presentation of suspicious documents;</P>
            <P>(3) The presentation of suspicious personal identifying information, such as a suspicious address change;</P>
            <P>(4) The unusual use of, or other suspicious activity related to, a covered account; and</P>
            <P>(5) Notice from customers, victims of identity theft, law enforcement authorities, or other persons regarding possible identity theft in connection with covered accounts held by the financial institution or creditor.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Detecting Red Flags</HD>
            <P>The Identity Theft Prevention Program's policies and procedures should address the detection of Red Flags in connection with the opening of covered accounts and existing covered accounts, such as by:</P>
            <P>(a) Obtaining identifying information about, and verifying the identity of, a person opening a covered account; and</P>
            <P>(b) Authenticating customers, monitoring transactions, and verifying the validity of change of address requests, in the case of existing covered accounts.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Preventing and Mitigating Identity Theft</HD>
            <P>The Identity Theft Prevention Program's policies and procedures should provide for appropriate responses to the Red Flags the financial institution or creditor has detected that are commensurate with the degree of risk posed. In determining an appropriate response, a financial institution or creditor should consider aggravating factors that may heighten the risk of identity theft, such as a data security incident that results in unauthorized access to a customer's account records held by the financial institution or creditor, or third party, or notice that a customer has provided information related to a covered account held by the financial institution or creditor to someone fraudulently claiming to represent the financial institution or creditor or to a fraudulent Internet Web site. Appropriate responses may include the following:</P>
            <P>(a) Monitoring a covered account for evidence of identity theft;</P>
            <P>(b) Contacting the customer;</P>
            <P>(c) Changing any passwords, security codes, or other security devices that permit access to a covered account;</P>
            <P>(d) Reopening a covered account with a new account number;</P>
            <P>(e) Not opening a new covered account;</P>
            <P>(f) Closing an existing covered account;</P>
            <P>(g) Not attempting to collect on a covered account or not selling a covered account to a debt collector;</P>
            <P>(h) Notifying law enforcement; or</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Updating the Identity Theft Prevention Program</HD>
            <P>Financial institutions and creditors should update the Identity Theft Prevention Program (including the Red Flags determined to be relevant) periodically, to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft, based on factors such as:</P>
            <P>(a) The experiences of the financial institution or creditor with identity theft;</P>
            <P>(b) Changes in methods of identity theft;</P>
            <P>(c) Changes in methods to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft;</P>
            <P>(d) Changes in the types of accounts that the financial institution or creditor offers or maintains; and</P>
            <P>(e) Changes in the business arrangements of the financial institution or creditor, including mergers, acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, and service provider arrangements.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Methods for Administering the Identity Theft Prevention Program</HD>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Oversight of Identity Theft Prevention Program.</E> Oversight by the board of directors, an appropriate committee of the board, or a designated senior management employee should include:</P>
            <P>(1) Assigning specific responsibility for the Identity Theft Prevention Program's implementation;</P>
            <P>(2) Reviewing reports prepared by staff regarding compliance by the financial institution or creditor with § 162.30; and</P>
            <P>(3) Approving material changes to the Identity Theft Prevention Program as necessary to address changing identity theft risks.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Reports.</E> (1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Staff of the financial institution or creditor responsible for development, implementation, and administration of its Identity Theft Prevention Program should report to the board of directors, an appropriate committee of the board, or a designated senior management employee, at least annually, on compliance by the financial institution or creditor with § 162.30.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Contents of report.</E> The report should address material matters related to the Identity Theft Prevention Program and evaluate issues such as: The effectiveness of the policies and procedures of the financial institution or creditor in addressing the risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of covered accounts and with respect to existing covered accounts; service provider arrangements; significant incidents involving identity theft and management's response; and recommendations for material changes to the Identity Theft Prevention Program.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Oversight of service provider arrangements.</E> Whenever a financial institution or creditor engages a service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more covered accounts the financial institution or creditor should take steps to ensure that the activity of the service provider is conducted in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft. For example, a financial institution or creditor could require the service provider by contract to have policies and procedures to detect relevant Red Flags that may arise in the performance of the service provider's activities, and either report the Red Flags to the financial institution or creditor, or to take appropriate steps to prevent or mitigate identity theft.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">VII. Other Applicable Legal Requirements</HD>
            <P>Financial institutions and creditors should be mindful of other related legal requirements that may be applicable, such as:</P>
            <P>(a) For financial institutions and creditors that are subject to 31 U.S.C. 5318(g), filing a Suspicious Activity Report in accordance with applicable law and regulation;</P>
            <P>(b) Implementing any requirements under 15 U.S.C. 1681c-1(h) regarding the circumstances under which credit may be extended when the financial institution or creditor detects a fraud or active duty alert;</P>
            <P>(c) Implementing any requirements for furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2, for example, to correct or update inaccurate or incomplete information, and to not report information that the furnisher has reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate; and</P>
            <P>(d) Complying with the prohibitions in 15 U.S.C. 1681m on the sale, transfer, and placement for collection of certain debts resulting from identity theft.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Supplement A to Appendix B</HD>
            <P>In addition to incorporating Red Flags from the sources recommended in section II(b) of the Guidelines in Appendix B of this part, each financial institution or creditor may consider incorporating into its Identity Theft Prevention Program, whether singly or in combination, Red Flags from the following illustrative examples in connection with covered accounts:</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Alerts, Notifications or Warnings From a Consumer Reporting Agency</HD>
            <P>1. A fraud or active duty alert is included with a consumer report.</P>
            <P>2. A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of credit freeze in response to a request for a consumer report.</P>

            <P>3. A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of address discrepancy, as defined in Sec. 603(f) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a(f)).<PRTPAGE P="407"/>
            </P>
            <P>4. A consumer report indicates a pattern of activity that is inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an applicant or customer, such as:</P>
            <P>a. A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;</P>
            <P>b. An unusual number of recently established credit relationships;</P>
            <P>c. A material change in the use of credit, especially with respect to recently established credit relationships; or</P>
            <P>d. An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Suspicious Documents</HD>
            <P>5. Documents provided for identification appear to have been altered or forged.</P>
            <P>6. The photograph or physical description on the identification is not consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the identification.</P>
            <P>7. Other information on the identification is not consistent with information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer presenting the identification.</P>
            <P>8. Other information on the identification is not consistent with readily accessible information that is on file with the financial institution or creditor, such as a signature card or a recent check.</P>
            <P>9. An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives the appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Suspicious Personal Identifying Information</HD>
            <P>10. Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when compared against external information sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For example:</P>
            <P>a. The address does not match any address in the consumer report; or</P>
            <P>b. The Social Security Number (SSN) has not been issued, or is listed on the Social Security Administration's Death Master File.</P>
            <P>11. Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and date of birth.</P>
            <P>12. Personal identifying information provided is associated with known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For example:</P>
            <P>a. The address on an application is the same as the address provided on a fraudulent application; or</P>
            <P>b. The phone number on an application is the same as the number provided on a fraudulent application.</P>
            <P>13. Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For example:</P>
            <P>a. The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or a prison; or</P>
            <P>b. The phone number is invalid, or is associated with a pager or answering service.</P>
            <P>14. The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons opening an account or other customers.</P>
            <P>15. The address or telephone number provided is the same as or similar to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large number of other persons opening accounts or by other customers.</P>
            <P>16. The person opening the covered account or the customer fails to provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in response to notification that the application is incomplete.</P>
            <P>17. Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with personal identifying information that is on file with the financial institution or creditor.</P>
            <P>18. For financial institutions or creditors that use challenge questions, the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot provide authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet or consumer report.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Unusual Use of, or Suspicious Activity Related to, the Covered Account</HD>
            <P>19. Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered account, the institution or creditor receives a request for a new, additional, or replacement means of accessing the account or for the addition of an authorized user on the account.</P>
            <P>20. A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly associated with known patterns of fraud. For example:</P>

            <P>a. The majority of available credit is used for cash advances or merchandise that is easily convertible to cash (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> electronics equipment or jewelry); or</P>
            <P>b. The customer fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments.</P>
            <P>21. A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:</P>
            <P>a. Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments;</P>
            <P>b. A material increase in the use of available credit;</P>
            <P>c. A material change in purchasing or spending patterns;</P>
            <P>d. A material change in electronic fund transfer patterns in connection with a deposit account; or</P>
            <P>e. A material change in telephone call patterns in connection with a cellular phone account.</P>

            <P>22. A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of <PRTPAGE P="408"/>account, the expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).</P>
            <P>23. Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the customer's covered account.</P>
            <P>24. The financial institution or creditor is notified that the customer is not receiving paper account statements.</P>
            <P>25. The financial institution or creditor is notified of unauthorized charges or transactions in connection with a customer's covered account.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Notice From Customers, Victims of Identity Theft, Law Enforcement Authorities, or Other Persons Regarding Possible Identity Theft in Connection With Covered Accounts Held by the Financial Institution or Creditor</HD>
            <P>26. The financial institution or creditor is notified by a customer, a victim of identity theft, a law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 165.1</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Section 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act, entitled “Commodity Whistleblower Incentives and Protection,” requires the Commission to pay awards, subject to certain limitations and conditions, to whistleblowers who voluntarily provide the Commission with original information about violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. This part 165 describes the whistleblower program that the Commission intends to establish to implement the provisions of Section 23, and explains the procedures the whistleblower will need to follow in order to be eligible for an award. Whistleblowers should read these procedures carefully, because the failure to take certain required steps within the time frames described in this part may result in disqualification from receiving an award. Unless expressly provided for in this part, no person is authorized to make any offer or promise, or otherwise to bind the Commission with respect to the payment of any award or the amount thereof.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 165.2</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>As used in this part:</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Action.</E> The term “action” generally means a single captioned judicial or administrative proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing:</P>
          <P>(1) For purposes of making an award under § 165.7, the Commission will treat as a Commission action two or more administrative or judicial proceedings brought by the Commission if these proceedings arise out of the same nucleus of operative facts; or</P>

          <P>(2) For purposes of determining the payment on an award under § 165.14, the Commission will deem as part of the Commission action upon which the <PRTPAGE P="409"/>award was based any subsequent Commission proceeding that, individually, results in a monetary sanction of $1,000,000 or less, and that arises out of the same nucleus of operative facts.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Aggregate amount.</E> The phrase “aggregate amount” means the total amount of an award granted to one or more whistleblowers pursuant to § 165.8.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Analysis.</E> The term “analysis” means the whistleblower's examination and evaluation of information that may be generally available, but which reveals information that is not generally known or available to the public.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Collected by the Commission.</E> The phrase “collected by the Commission” refers to any funds received, and confirmed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, in satisfaction of part or all of a civil monetary penalty, disgorgement obligation, or fine owed to the Commission.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Covered judicial or administrative action.</E> The phrase “covered judicial or administrative action” means any judicial or administrative action brought by the Commission under the Commodity Exchange Act whose successful resolution results in monetary sanctions exceeding $1,000,000.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Fund.</E> The term “Fund” means the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Customer Protection Fund.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Independent knowledge.</E> The phrase “independent knowledge” means factual information in the whistleblower's possession that is not generally known or available to the public. The whistleblower may gain independent knowledge from the whistleblower's experiences, communications and observations in the whistleblower's personal business or social interactions. The Commission will not consider the whistleblower's information to be derived from the whistleblower's independent knowledge if the whistleblower obtained the information:</P>
          <P>(1) From sources generally available to the public such as corporate filings and the media, including the Internet;</P>
          <P>(2) Through a communication that was subject to the attorney-client privilege, unless the disclosure is otherwise permitted by the applicable federal or state attorney conduct rules;</P>
          <P>(3) In connection with the legal representation of a client on whose behalf the whistleblower, or the whistleblower's employer or firm, have been providing services, and the whistleblower seek to use the information to make a whistleblower submission for the whistleblower's own benefit, unless disclosure is authorized by the applicable federal or state attorney conduct rules;</P>
          <P>(4) Because the whistleblower was an officer, director, trustee, or partner of an entity and another person informed the whistleblower of allegations of misconduct, or the whistleblower learned the information in connection with the entity's processes for identifying, reporting, and addressing possible violations of law;</P>
          <P>(5) Because the whistleblower was an employee whose principal duties involved compliance or internal audit responsibilities; or</P>
          <P>(6) By a means or in a manner that is determined by a United States court to violate applicable Federal or state criminal law.</P>
          <P>(7) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> Paragraphs (g)(4) and (5) of this section shall not apply if:</P>
          <P>(i) The whistleblower has a reasonable basis to believe that disclosure of the information to the Commission is necessary to prevent the relevant entity from engaging in conduct that is likely to cause substantial injury to the financial interest or property of the entity or investors;</P>
          <P>(ii) The whistleblower has a reasonable basis to believe that the relevant entity is engaging in conduct that will impede an investigation of the misconduct; or</P>
          <P>(iii) At least 120 days have elapsed since the whistleblower provided the information to the relevant entity's audit committee, chief legal officer, chief compliance officer (or their equivalents), or the whistleblower's supervisor, or since the whistleblower received the information, if the whistleblower received it under circumstances indicating that the entity's audit committee, chief legal officer, chief compliance officer (or their equivalents), or the whistleblower's supervisor was already aware of the information.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Independent analysis.</E> The phrase “independent analysis” means the <PRTPAGE P="410"/>whistleblower's own analysis, whether done alone or in combination with others.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Information that led to successful enforcement.</E> The Commission will consider that the whistleblower provided original information that led to the successful enforcement of a judicial or administrative action, or related action, in the following circumstances:</P>
          <P>(1) The whistleblower gave the Commission original information that was sufficiently specific, credible, and timely to cause the Commission staff to commence an examination, open an investigation, reopen an investigation that the Commission had closed, or to inquire concerning different conduct as part of a current examination or investigation, and the Commission brought a successful judicial or administrative action based in whole or in part on conduct that was the subject of the whistleblower's original information; or</P>
          <P>(2) The whistleblower gave the Commission original information about conduct that was already under examination or investigation by the Commission, the Congress, any other authority of the federal government, a state Attorney General or securities regulatory authority, any registered entity, registered futures association, or self-regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)), foreign futures authority, or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (except in cases where the whistleblower was an original source of this information as defined in paragraph (l) of this section), and the whistleblower's submission significantly contributed to the success of the action.</P>
          <P>(3) The whistleblower reported original information through an entity's internal whistleblower, legal, or compliance procedures for reporting allegations of possible violations of law before or at the same time the whistleblower reported them to the Commission; the entity later provided the whistleblower's information to the Commission, or provided results of an audit or investigation initiated in whole or in part in response to information the whistleblower reported to the entity; and the information the entity provided to the Commission satisfies either paragraph (i)(1) or (2) of this section. Under this paragraph (i)(3), the whistleblower must also submit the same information to the Commission in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 165.3 within 180 days of providing it to the entity.</P>
          <P>(j) <E T="03">Monetary sanctions.</E> The phrase “monetary sanctions,” when used with respect to any judicial or administrative action, or related action, means—</P>
          <P>(1) Any monies, including penalties, disgorgement, restitution, and interest ordered to be paid; and</P>
          <P>(2) Any monies deposited into a disgorgement fund or other fund pursuant to section 308(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7246(b)) as a result of such action or any settlement of such action.</P>
          <P>(k) <E T="03">Original information.</E> The phrase “original information” means information that—</P>
          <P>(1) Is derived from the independent knowledge or independent analysis of a whistleblower;</P>
          <P>(2) Is not already known to the Commission from any other source, unless the whistleblower is the original source of the information;</P>
          <P>(3) Is not exclusively derived from an allegation made in a judicial or administrative hearing, in a governmental report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, unless the whistleblower is a source of the information; and</P>
          <P>(4) Is submitted to the Commission for the first time after July 21, 2010 (the date of enactment of the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010).</P>
          <P>(5) Original information shall not lose its status as original information solely because the whistleblower submitted such information prior to October 24, 2011, provided such information was submitted after July 21, 2010, the date of enactment of the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010. In order to be eligible for an award, a whistleblower who submits original information to the Commission after July 21, 2010, but prior to October 24, 2011, must comply with the procedure set forth in § 165.3(d).</P>
          <P>(l) <E T="03">Original source.</E> The whistleblower must satisfy the whistleblower's status <PRTPAGE P="411"/>as the original source of information to the Commission's satisfaction.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Information obtained from another source.</E> The Commission will consider the whistleblower to be an “original source” of the same information that the Commission obtains from another source if the information the whistleblower provide satisfies the definition of original information and the other source obtained the information from the whistleblower or the whistleblower's representative.</P>
          <P>(i) In order to be considered an original source of information that the Commission receives from Congress, any other federal, state or local authority, a foreign futures authority, any registered entity, registered futures association, or any self-regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)), the whistleblower must have voluntarily given such authorities the information within the meaning of this part. In determining whether the whistleblower is the original source of information, the Commission may seek assistance and confirmation from one of the other entities or authorities described in this paragraph (l)(1)(i).</P>
          <P>(ii) In the event that the whistleblower claims to be the original source of information that an authority or another entity, other than as set forth in paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section, provided to the Commission, the Commission may seek assistance and confirmation from such authority or other entity.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Information first provided to another authority or person.</E> If the whistleblower provides information to Congress, any other federal, state, or local authority, a foreign futures authority, a registered entity, a registered futures association, a self-regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)), or to any of the persons described in paragraphs (g)(4) and (5) of this section, and the whistleblower, within 180 days, makes a submission to the Commission pursuant to § 165.3, as the whistleblower must do in order for the whistleblower to be eligible to be considered for an award, then, for purposes of evaluating the whistleblower's claim to an award under § 165.7, the Commission will consider that the whistleblower provided original information as of the date of the whistleblower's original disclosure, report, or submission to one of these other authorities or persons. The whistleblower must establish the whistleblower's status as the original source of such information, as well as the effective date of any prior disclosure, report, or submission, to the Commission's satisfaction. The Commission may seek assistance and confirmation from the other authority or person in making this determination.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Information already known by the Commission.</E> If the Commission already knows some information about a matter from other sources at the time the whistleblower makes the whistleblower's submission, and the whistleblower is not an original source of that information, as described above, the Commission will consider the whistleblower an “original source” of any information the whistleblower separately provides that is original information that materially adds to the information that the Commission already possesses.</P>
          <P>(m) <E T="03">Related action.</E> The phrase “related action,” when used with respect to any judicial or administrative action brought by the Commission under the Commodity Exchange Act, means any judicial or administrative action brought by an entity listed in § 165.11(a) that is based upon the original information voluntarily submitted by a whistleblower to the Commission pursuant to § 165.3 that led to the successful resolution of the Commission action.</P>
          <P>(n) <E T="03">Successful resolution.</E> The phrase “successful resolution,” when used with respect to any judicial or administrative action brought by the Commission under the Commodity Exchange Act, includes any settlement of such action or final judgment in favor of the Commission. It shall also have the same meaning as “successful enforcement.”</P>
          <P>(o) <E T="03">Voluntary submission or voluntarily submitted.</E> (1) The phrase “voluntary submission” or “voluntarily submitted” within the context of submission of original information to the <PRTPAGE P="412"/>Commission under this part, shall mean the provision of information made prior to any request from the Commission, Congress, any other federal or state authority, the Department of Justice, a registered entity, a registered futures association, or a self-regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)) to the whistleblower or anyone representing the whistleblower (such as an attorney) about a matter to which the information in the whistleblower's submission is relevant. If the Commission or any of these other authorities makes a request, inquiry, or demand to the whistleblower or the whistleblower's representative first, the whistleblower's submission will not be considered voluntary, and the whistleblower will not be eligible for an award, even if the whistleblower's response is not compelled by subpoena or other applicable law. For purposes of this paragraph (o), the whistleblower will be considered to have received a request, inquiry or demand if documents or information from the whistleblower is within the scope of a request, inquiry, or demand that the whistleblower's employer receives, unless, after receiving the documents or information from the whistleblower, the whistleblower's employer fails to provide the whistleblower's documents or information to the requesting authority in a timely manner.</P>
          <P>(2) In addition, the whistleblower's submission will not be considered voluntary if the whistleblower is under a pre-existing legal or contractual duty to report the violations that are the subject of the whistleblower's original information to the Commission, Congress, any other federal or state authority, the Department of Justice, a registered entity, a registered futures association, or a self-regulatory organization (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)), or a duty that arises out of a judicial or administrative order.</P>
          <P>(p) <E T="03">Whistleblower(s).</E> (1) The term “whistleblower” or “whistleblowers” means any individual, or two (2) or more individuals acting jointly, who provides information relating to a potential violation of the Commodity Exchange Act to the Commission, in the manner established by § 165.3. A company or another entity is not eligible to be a whistleblower.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Prohibition against retaliation.</E> The anti-retaliation protections under Section 23(h) of the Commodity Exchange Act apply whether or not the whistleblower satisfies the requirements, procedures and conditions to qualify for an award. For purposes of the anti-retaliation protections afforded by Section 23(h)(1)(A)(i) of the Commodity Exchange Act, the whistleblower is a whistleblower if:</P>
          <P>(i) The whistleblower possess a reasonable belief that the information the whistleblower is providing relates to a possible violation of the CEA, or the rules or regulations thereunder, that has occurred, is ongoing, or is about to occur; and</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 165.7</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Procedures for award applications in Commission actions and related actions, and Commission award determinations.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) Whenever a Commission judicial or administrative action results in monetary sanctions totaling more than $1,000,000 (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a covered judicial or administrative action) the Commission will publish on the Commission's Web site a “Notice of Covered Action.” Such Notice of Covered Action will be published subsequent to the entry of a final judgment or order that alone, or collectively with other judgments or orders previously entered in the Commission covered administrative or judicial action, exceeds $1,000,000 in monetary sanctions. The Commission will not contact whistleblower claimants directly as to Notices of Covered Actions; prospective claimants should monitor the Commission Web site for such Notices. A whistleblower claimant will have 90 days from the date of the Notice of Covered Action to file a claim for an award based on that action, or the claim will be barred.</P>

          <P>(b)(1) To file a claim for a whistleblower award, the whistleblower must file Form WB-APP, Application for Award for Original Information Provided Pursuant to Section 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act. The whistleblower must sign this form as the claimant and submit it to the Commission by mail or fax to Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street NW., Washington, DC 20581, Fax (202) 418-5975, or by completing and submitting the Form WB-APP online and submitting it electronically through the Commission's Web site at <E T="03">https://www.cftc.gov</E> or the Commission's Whistleblower Program Web site at <E T="03">https://www.whistleblower.gov.</E>
          </P>
          <P>(2) The Form WB-APP, including any attachments, must be received by the Commission within 90 calendar days of the date of the Notice of Covered Action or 90 calendar days following the date of a final judgment in a Related Action (or if the final judgment in a Related Action was issued prior to the action meeting the definition of Related Action, within 90 calendar days following the date the action satisfied the definition of Related Action, except in the circumstances described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section). One Form WB-APP may be filed in response to both a Notice of Covered Action and final judgment in a Related Action if the relevant time periods are applicable.</P>
          <P>(3) If a covered judicial or administrative action and Related Action have different final judgment dates or if there is no covered judicial or administrative action connected to a Related Action, a claimant, who wishes to file a claim for an award in both a covered judicial or administrative action and a Related Action, or in a Related Action that does not have a connected covered judicial or administrative action, must follow one of the following procedures depending on that claimant's particular situation.</P>
          <P>(i) If a final judgment imposing monetary sanctions in a Related Action has not been entered at the time the claimant submits a claim for an award in connection with a covered judicial or administrative action, the claimant must submit the claim for the Related Action on Form WB-APP within ninety (90) calendar days following the date of issuance of a final judgment in the Related Action.</P>
          <P>(ii) If a final judgment in a Related Action has been entered and a Notice of Covered Action for a related covered judicial or administrative action has not been published, a claimant for an award in both the covered judicial or administrative action and Related Action may submit the claims for both the Related Action and the covered judicial or administrative action within ninety (90) days of the date of the Notice of Covered Action. The claims may be submitted on the same Form WB-APP.</P>

          <P>(iii) If there is a final judgment in a Related Action that relates to a judicial or administrative action brought by the Commission under the Commodity Exchange Act that is not a covered judicial or administrative action, and therefore there is no Notice of Covered Action, a claimant for an award in <PRTPAGE P="416"/>connection with the Related Action must submit the claim in connection with the Related Action on Form WB-APP within ninety (90) calendar days following either:</P>
          <P>(A) The date of issuance of a final judgment in the Related Action, if that date is after the date of issuance of the final judgment in the related Commission judicial or administrative action; or</P>

          <P>(B) The date of issuance of the final judgment in the related Commission judicial or administrative action, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> the date the Related Action becomes a Related Action, if the date of issuance of the final judgment in the Related Action precedes the final judgment in the related Commission judicial or administrative action.</P>
          <P>(c) If the whistleblower provided the whistleblower's original information to the Commission anonymously pursuant to §§ 165.3 and 165.4 and:</P>
          <P>(1) The whistleblower is making the whistleblower's claim for a whistleblower award on a disclosed basis, the whistleblower must disclose the whistleblower's identity on the Form WB-APP. The whistleblower's identity must be verified in a form and manner that is acceptable to the Commission prior to the payment of any award; or</P>
          <P>(2) The whistleblower is making the whistleblower's claim for a whistleblower award on an anonymous basis, the whistleblower must be represented by counsel. The whistleblower must provide the whistleblower's counsel with a completed Form WB-APP that is signed by the whistleblower by no later than the date upon which the whistleblower's counsel submits to the Commission a copy of the Form WB-APP that does not disclose the whistleblower's identity and is signed solely by the whistleblower's counsel. In addition, the whistleblower's counsel must retain the signed original of the whistleblower's Form WB-APP in counsel's records. Upon request of the Commission staff, whistleblower's counsel must produce to the Commission the whistleblower's signed original WB-APP and the whistleblower's identity must be verified in a form and manner that is acceptable to the Commission prior to the payment of any award.</P>
          <P>(d) A claimant may withdraw a Form WB-APP by submitting a written request to the Whistleblower Office at any time during the review process.</P>
          <P>(e)(1) The Whistleblower Office may issue a Proposed Final Disposition for award applications that do not relate to a Notice of Covered Action, a final judgment in a Related Action, or a previously filed Form TCR without presentation of the award claim to the staff designated by the Director of the Division of Enforcement under § 165.15(a)(2) (“Claims Review Staff”). In such instances, the Whistleblower Office will inform the award claimant in writing that the claim does not relate to a Notice of Covered Action, a final judgment in a Related Action, or a previously filed Form TCR and will be rejected unless the claimant provides additional information. The claimant will have 30 days from the date of the written notice to respond and to correct the identified deficiencies. If the claimant does not respond in 30 days or if the response does not include information showing that the WB-APP relates to a Notice of Covered Action, a final judgment in a Related Action, or a previously filed Form TCR the Whistleblower Office will issue a Proposed Final Disposition. The claimant's failure to submit a timely response to the written notice from the Whistleblower Office will constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and the claimant will be prohibited from pursuing an appeal under § 165.13.</P>

          <P>(2) The Whistleblower Office will notify the Claims Review Staff of any Proposed Final Disposition under this paragraph (e). Within thirty (30) calendar days thereafter, any member of the Claims Review Staff may request that the Proposed Final Disposition be reviewed by the Claims Review Staff. If no member of the Claims Review Staff requests such a review within the 30-day period, then the Proposed Final Disposition will become the Final Order of the Commission. In the event that a member of the Claims Review Staff requests a review, the Claims Review Staff will review the record that the Whistleblower Office relied upon in making its determination and either remand to the Whistleblower Office for further action or issue a Final Order of <PRTPAGE P="417"/>the Commission, which could consist of the Proposed Final Disposition.</P>
          <P>(f)(1) In connection with each individual covered judicial or administrative action or final judgment in a Related Action, for which an award application is submitted, once the time for filing any appeals of the covered judicial or administrative action or the final judgment in the Related Action has expired (or, where an appeal is filed of the covered judicial or administrative action, or the final judgment in a Related Action, as applicable, and concluded), the Claims Review Staff designated under § 165.15(a)(2) will evaluate all timely whistleblower award claims submitted on Form WB-APP in response to a Notice of Covered Action, referenced in paragraph (a) of this section, or final judgment in a Related Action in accordance with the criteria set forth in this part.</P>
          <P>(2) The Whistleblower Office may require that the claimant provide additional information relating to the claimant's eligibility for an award or satisfaction of any of the conditions for an award, as set forth in § 165.5(b)(2). The Whistleblower Office may also request additional information from the claimant in connection with the claim for an award in a Related Action to demonstrate that the claimant directly (or through the Commission) voluntarily provided the governmental agency, regulatory authority or self-regulatory organization the original information that led to the Commission's successful covered action, and that the information provided by the claimant led to the successful enforcement of the Related Action. The Whistleblower Office may also, in its discretion, seek assistance and confirmation from the other agency in making this determination.</P>
          <P>(g)(1) Following Claims Review Staff evaluation, the Claims Review Staff will issue a Preliminary Determination setting forth a preliminary assessment as to whether the claim should be granted or denied and, if granted, setting forth the proposed award percentage amount. The Whistleblower Office will send a copy of the Preliminary Determination to the claimant.</P>
          <P>(2) The claimant may contest the Preliminary Determination made by the Claims Review Staff by submitting a written response to the Whistleblower Office setting forth the grounds for the claimant's objection to either the denial of an award or the proposed amount of an award. The response must be in the form and manner that the Whistleblower Office shall require. The claimant may also include documentation or other evidentiary support for the grounds advanced in the claimant's response. The claimant may also request a meeting with the Whistleblower Office within the timeframes provided in this paragraph (g), however such meetings are not required, and the Whistleblower Office may in its sole discretion deny the request.</P>
          <P>(i) Before determining whether to contest a Preliminary Determination, the claimant may, within thirty (30) days of the date of the Preliminary Determination, request that the Whistleblower Office make available for the claimant's review the materials from among those set forth in § 165.10 that formed the basis of the Claims Review Staff's Preliminary Determination.</P>
          <P>(ii) If the claimant decides to contest the Preliminary Determination, the claimant must submit the claimant's written response and supporting materials setting forth the grounds for the claimant's objection to either the denial of an award or the proposed amount of an award within sixty (60) calendar days of the date of the Preliminary Determination, or if a request to review materials used to make a Preliminary Determination is made pursuant to paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, then within sixty (60) calendar days of the Whistleblower Office making those materials available for the claimant's review. The claimant also may request a meeting with the Whistleblower Office within those same sixty (60) calendar days. However, such meetings are not required and the Whistleblower Office may in its sole discretion decline the request.</P>

          <P>(h) If the claimant fails to submit a timely response pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, then the Preliminary Determination will become the Final Order of the Commission (except where the Preliminary Determination recommended an award, in which case the Preliminary Determination will be <PRTPAGE P="418"/>deemed a Proposed Final Determination for purposes of paragraph (j) of this section). The claimant's failure to submit a timely response contesting a Preliminary Determination will constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and the claimant will be prohibited from pursuing an appeal under § 165.13.</P>
          <P>(i) If the claimant submits a timely response under paragraph (g) of this section, then the Claims Review Staff will consider the issues and grounds advanced in the claimant's response, along with any supporting documentation the claimant provided, and will make its Proposed Final Determination.</P>
          <P>(j) The Whistleblower Office will notify the Commission of each Proposed Final Determination. Within thirty (30) calendar days thereafter, any Commissioner may request that the Proposed Final Determination be reviewed by the Commission. If no Commissioner requests such a review within the 30-day period, then the Proposed Final Determination will become the Final Order of the Commission. In the event a Commissioner requests a review, the Commission will review the record that the staff relied upon in making its determinations, including the claimant's submissions to the Whistleblower Office, and issue its Final Order.</P>
          <P>(k) A Preliminary Determination, Proposed Final Disposition, or a Proposed Final Determination may be issued only after a review for legal sufficiency by the Office of the General Counsel.</P>
          <P>(l) The Office of the Secretariat will serve the claimant with the Final Order of the Commission.</P>

          <P>The determination of the amount of an award shall be in the discretion of the Commission. This discretion shall be exercised as prescribed by § 165.7.</P>
          <P>(a) In determining the amount of an award, the Commission shall take into consideration—</P>
          <P>(1) The significance of the information provided by the whistleblower to the success of the covered judicial or administrative action or related action;</P>
          <P>(2) The degree of assistance provided by the whistleblower and any legal representative of the whistleblower in a covered judicial or administrative action or related action;</P>
          <P>(3) The programmatic interest of the Commission in deterring violations of the Commodity Exchange Act by making awards to whistleblowers who provide information that leads to the successful enforcement of such laws;</P>
          <P>(4) Whether the award otherwise enhances the Commission's ability to enforce the Commodity Exchange Act, protect customers, and encourage the submission of high quality information from whistleblowers; and</P>
          <P>(5) Potential adverse incentives from oversize awards.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Factors that may increase the amount of a whistleblower's award.</E> In determining whether to increase the amount of an award, the Commission will consider the following factors, <PRTPAGE P="419"/>which are not listed in order of importance.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Significance of the information provided by the whistleblower.</E> The Commission will assess the significance of the information provided by a whistleblower to the success of the Commission action or related action. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:</P>
          <P>(i) The nature of the information provided by the whistleblower and how it related to the successful enforcement action, including whether the reliability and completeness of the information provided to the Commission by the whistleblower resulted in the conservation of Commission resources; and</P>
          <P>(ii) The degree to which the information provided by the whistleblower supported one or more successful claims brought in the Commission action or related action.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Assistance provided by the whistleblower.</E> The Commission will assess the degree of assistance provided by the whistleblower and any legal representative of the whistleblower in the Commission action or related action. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:</P>
          <P>(i) Whether the whistleblower provided ongoing, extensive, and timely cooperation and assistance by, for example, helping to explain complex transactions, interpreting key evidence, or identifying new and productive lines of inquiry;</P>
          <P>(ii) The timeliness of the whistleblower's initial report to the Commission or to an internal compliance or reporting system of business organizations committing, or impacted by, the violations of the Commodity Exchange Act, where appropriate;</P>
          <P>(iii) The resources conserved as a result of the whistleblower's assistance;</P>
          <P>(iv) Whether the whistleblower appropriately encouraged or authorized others to assist the staff of the Commission who might otherwise not have participated in the investigation or related action;</P>
          <P>(v) The efforts undertaken by the whistleblower to remediate the harm caused by the violations of the Commodity Exchange Act, including assisting the authorities in the recovery of the fruits and instrumentalities of the violations; and</P>
          <P>(vi) Any unique hardships experienced by the whistleblower as a result of his or her reporting and assisting in the enforcement action.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Law enforcement interest.</E> The Commission will assess its programmatic interest in deterring violations of the Commodity Exchange Act by making awards to whistleblowers who provide information that leads to the successful enforcement of such laws. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:</P>
          <P>(i) The degree to which an award enhances the Commission's ability to enforce the commodity laws;</P>
          <P>(ii) The degree to which an award encourages the submission of high quality information from whistleblowers by appropriately rewarding whistleblower submissions of significant information and assistance, even in cases where the monetary sanctions available for collection are limited or potential monetary sanctions were reduced or eliminated by the Commission because an entity self-reported a commodities violation following the whistleblower's related internal disclosure, report, or submission;</P>
          <P>(iii) Whether the subject matter of the action is a Commission priority, whether the reported misconduct involves regulated entities or fiduciaries, whether the whistleblower exposed an industry-wide practice, the type and severity of the commodity violations, the age and duration of misconduct, the number of violations, and the isolated, repetitive, or ongoing nature of the violations;</P>
          <P>(iv) The dangers to market participants or others presented by the underlying violations involved in the enforcement action, including the amount of harm or potential harm caused by the underlying violations, the type of harm resulting from or threatened by the underlying violations, and the number of individuals or entities harmed; and</P>

          <P>(v) The degree, reliability and effectiveness of the whistleblower's assistance, including the consideration of the whistleblower's complete, timely truthful assistance to the Commission and criminal authorities.<PRTPAGE P="420"/>
          </P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Participation in internal compliance systems.</E> The Commission will assess whether, and the extent to which, the whistleblower and any legal representative of the whistleblower participated in internal compliance systems. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:</P>
          <P>(i) Whether, and the extent to which, a whistleblower reported the possible Commodity Exchange Act violations through internal whistleblower, legal or compliance procedures before, or at the same time as, reporting them to the Commission; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Whether, and the extent to which, a whistleblower assisted any internal investigation or inquiry concerning the reported Commodity Exchange Act violations.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Factors that may decrease the amount of a whistleblower's award.</E> In determining whether to decrease the amount of an award, the Commission will consider the following factors, which are not listed in order of importance.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Culpability.</E> The Commission will assess the culpability or involvement of the whistleblower in matters associated with the Commission's action or related actions. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:</P>
          <P>(i) The whistleblower's role in the Commodity Exchange Act violations;</P>
          <P>(ii) The whistleblower's education, training, experience, and position of responsibility at the time the violations occurred;</P>
          <P>(iii) Whether the whistleblower acted with scienter, both generally and in relation to others who participated in the violations;</P>
          <P>(iv) Whether the whistleblower financially benefitted from the violations;</P>
          <P>(v) Whether the whistleblower is a recidivist;</P>
          <P>(vi) The egregiousness of any wrongdoing committed by the whistleblower; and</P>
          <P>(vii) Whether the whistleblower knowingly interfered with the Commission's investigation of the violations or related enforcement actions.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Unreasonable reporting delay.</E> The Commission will assess whether the whistleblower unreasonably delayed reporting the Commodity Exchange Act violations. In considering this factor, the Commission may take into account, among other things:</P>
          <P>(i) Whether the whistleblower was aware of the relevant facts but failed to take reasonable steps to report or prevent the violations from occurring or continuing;</P>
          <P>(ii) Whether the whistleblower was aware of the relevant facts but only reported them after learning about a related inquiry, investigation, or enforcement action; and</P>
          <P>(iii) Whether there was a legitimate reason for the whistleblower to delay reporting the violations.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Interference with internal compliance and reporting systems.</E> The Commission will assess, in cases where the whistleblower interacted with his or her entity's internal compliance or reporting system, whether the whistleblower undermined the integrity of such system. In considering this factor, the Commission will take into account whether there is evidence provided to the Commission that the whistleblower knowingly:</P>
          <P>(i) Interfered with an entity's established legal, compliance, or audit procedures to prevent or delay detection of the reported Commodity Exchange Act violation;</P>
          <P>(ii) Made any material false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations that hindered an entity's efforts to detect, investigate, or remediate the reported Commodity Exchange Act violations; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Provided any false writing or document knowing the writing or document contained any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or entries that hindered an entity's efforts to detect, investigate, or remediate the reported Commodity Exchange Act violations.</P>
          <P>(d) The Commission shall not take into consideration the balance of the Fund in determining the amount of an award.</P>

          <P>(1) Where multiple whistleblowers are owed payments from the Fund based on awards that do not arise from the same Notice of Covered Action (or related action), priority in making these payments will be determined based upon the date that the Final Order of the Commission is made. If two or more of these Final Orders of the Commission are entered on the same date, then those whistleblowers owed payments will be paid on a pro rata basis until sufficient amounts become available in the Fund to pay their entire payments.</P>
          <P>(2) Where multiple whistleblowers are owed payments from the Fund based on awards that arise from the same Notice of Covered Action (or related action), they will share the same payment priority and will be paid on a pro rata basis until sufficient amounts become available in the Fund to pay their entire payments.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Privacy Act Statement</HD>

          <P>This notice is given under the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act requires that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) inform individuals of the following when asking for information. The solicitation of this information is authorized under the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 1 <E T="03">et seq.</E> The information provided will enable the CFTC to determine the whistleblower award claimant's eligibility for payment of an award pursuant to Section 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act and Part 165 of the CFTC's regulations. This information will be used to investigate and prosecute violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and the CFTC's regulations. This information may be disclosed to federal, state, local or foreign agencies or other authorities responsible for investigating, prosecuting, enforcing or implementing laws, rules or regulations implicated by the information consistent with the confidentiality requirements set forth in Section 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act and Part 165 of the CFTC's regulations. The information will be maintained and additional disclosures may be made in accordance with System of Records Notices CFTC-49, “Whistleblower Records” (exempted), CFTC-10, “Investigatory Records” (exempted), and CFTC-16, “Enforcement Case Files.” The CFTC requests the last four digits of the claimant's Social Security Number for use as an individual identifier to administer and manage the whistleblower award program. Executive Order 9397 (November 22, 1943) allows federal agencies to use the Social Security Number as an individual identifier. Furnishing the information is voluntary. However, if an individual is providing information for the whistleblower award program, not providing required information may result in the individual not being eligible for award consideration.</P>
          <P>Questions concerning this form may be directed to Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Whistleblower Office, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street NW., Washington, DC 20581.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Submission Procedures</HD>
          <P>• This form <E T="03">must</E> be used by persons making a claim for a whistleblower <PRTPAGE P="446"/>award in connection with information provided to the CFTC, or to another agency or organization in a related action. In order to be deemed eligible for an award, you must meet all the requirements set forth in Section 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act and Part 165 of the CFTC's regulations.</P>
          <P>• You must sign the Form WB-APP as the claimant. If you wish to submit the Form WB-APP anonymously, you must do so through an attorney, your attorney must sign the Counsel Certification Section of the Form WB-APP that is submitted to the CFTC, and you must give your attorney your original signed Form WB-APP so that it can be produced to the CFTC upon request.</P>
          <P>• During the whistleblower award claim process, your identity must be verified in a form and manner that is acceptable to the CFTC prior to the payment of any award.</P>
          <P>○ If you are filing your claim in connection with information that you provided to the CFTC, then your Form WB-APP, and any attachments thereto, must be received by the CFTC within ninety (90) days of the date of the Notice of Covered Action, or the date of a final judgment in a related action to which the claim relates.</P>
          <P>○ If you are filing your claim in connection with information that you provided to another agency or organization in a related action, then your Form WB-APP, and any attachments thereto, must be received by the CFTC as follows:</P>
          <P>• If a final order imposing monetary sanctions has been entered in a related action at the time that you submit your claim for an award in connection with a CFTC action, you may submit your claim for an award in that related action on the same Form WB-APP that you use for the CFTC action.</P>
          <P>• If a final order imposing monetary sanctions in a related action has not been entered at the time that you submit your claim for an award in connection with a CFTC action, you must submit your claim on Form WB-APP within ninety (90) days of the issuance of a final order imposing sanctions in the related action.</P>

          <P>• If a final order imposing monetary sanctions in a related action relates to a judicial or administrative action brought by the Commission under the Commodity Exchange Act that is not a covered judicial or administrative action, and therefore there would not be a Notice of Covered Action, you must submit your claim on Form WB-APP for an award in connection with the related action within ninety (90) calendar days following either (1) the date of issuance of a final order in the related action, if that date is after the date of issuance of the final judgment in the related Commission judicial or administrative action; or (2) the date of issuance of the final judgment in the related Commission judicial or administrative action, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> the date the related action becomes a related action, if the date of issuance of the final order in the related action precedes the final judgment in the related Commission judicial or administrative action.</P>

          <P>• To submit your Form WB-APP, you may print it and either submit it by mail to Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Whistleblower Office, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street NW., Washington, DC 20581, or by facsimile to (202) 418-5975.

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section D: Notice of Covered Action</HD>
          <P>The process for making a claim for a whistleblower award for a CFTC action begins with the publication of a “Notice of Covered Action” on the CFTC's Web site. This Notice is published whenever a judicial or administrative action brought by the CFTC results in the imposition of monetary sanctions exceeding $1,000,000. The Notice is published on the CFTC's Web site subsequent to the entry of a final judgment or order in the action that by itself, or collectively with other judgments or orders previously entered in the action, exceeds the $1,000,000 threshold required for a whistleblower to be potentially eligible for an award. The CFTC will not contact whistleblower claimants directly as to Notices of Covered Actions; prospective claimants should monitor the CFTC Web site for such Notices.</P>
          <P>Question 1: Provide the date of the Notice of Covered Action to which this claim relates.</P>
          <P>Question 2: Provide the notice number of the Notice of Covered Action.</P>

          <P>Question 1: State whether you are currently, or were at the time that you acquired the original information that you submitted to the CFTC, a member, officer or employee of: The CFTC; the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision; the National Credit Union Administration Board; the Securities and Exchange Commission; the Department of Justice; a registered entity; a registered futures association; a self-regulatory <PRTPAGE P="448"/>organization; a law enforcement organization; or a foreign regulatory authority or law enforcement organization.</P>
          <P>Question 2: State whether you provided the information that you submitted to the CFTC pursuant to a cooperation agreement with the CFTC, or with any other agency or organization.</P>
          <P>Question 3: State whether you provided this information before you (or anyone representing you) received any request, inquiry or demand that relates to the subject matter of your submission (i) from the CFTC, (ii) in connection with an investigation, inspection or examination by any registered entity, registered futures association or self-regulatory organization, or (iii) in connection with an investigation by the Congress, or any other federal or state authority.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section G: Entitlement to Award</HD>
          <P>This section is optional. Use this section to explain the basis for your belief that you are entitled to an award in connection with your submission of information to the CFTC, or to another agency in connection with a related action. Specifically, address why you believe that you voluntarily provided the CFTC with original information that led to the successful enforcement of a judicial or administrative action filed by the CFTC, or a related action. Refer to § 165.9 of the CFTC's regulations for further information concerning the relevant award criteria.</P>
          <P>Section 23(c)(1)(B) of the Commodity Exchange Act and § 165.9(a) of the CFTC's regulations require the CFTC to consider the following factors in determining the amount of an award: (1) The significance of the information provided by a whistleblower to the success of the CFTC action or related action; (2) the degree of assistance provided by the whistleblower and any legal representative of the whistleblower in the CFTC action or related action; (3) the programmatic interest of the CFTC in deterring violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (including regulations under the Act) by making awards to whistleblowers who provide information that leads to the successful enforcement of such laws; (4) whether the award otherwise enhances the CFTC's ability to enforce the Commodity Exchange Act, protect customers, and encourage the submission of high quality information from whistleblowers; and (5) potential adverse incentives from oversize awards. Address these factors in your response as well.</P>

          <P>(A) Arises out of any transaction executed on or subject to the rules of a designated contract market,<PRTPAGE P="450"/>
          </P>
          <P>(B) Is executed or effected through a member of such facility, a participant transacting on or through such facility or an employee of such facility, and</P>

          <P>(ii) Arises out of any retail forex transaction (as defined in § 5.1(m) of this chapter).</P>
          <P>(2) The term <E T="03">customer</E> as used in this section includes any person for or on behalf of whom a member of a designated contract market, or a participant transacting on or through such designated contract market, effects a transaction on such contract market, except another member of or participant in such designated contract market. <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> a person who is an “eligible contract participant” as defined in section 1a(18) of the Act shall not be deemed to be a customer within the meaning of this section.</P>
          <P>(3) The term <E T="03">Commission registrant</E> as used in this section means a person registered under the Act as a futures commission merchant, retail foreign exchange dealer, introducing broker, floor broker, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, or associated person.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Voluntariness.</E> The use by customers of dispute settlement procedures shall be voluntary as provided in paragraphs (c) and (g) of this section.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Customers.</E> No Commission registrant shall enter into any agreement or understanding with a customer in which the customer agrees, prior to the time a claim or grievance arises, to submit such claim or grievance to any settlement procedure except as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) Signing the agreement must not be made a condition for the customer to utilize the services offered by the Commission registrant.</P>
          <P>(2) If the agreement is contained as a clause or clauses of a broader agreement, the customer must separately endorse the clause or clauses containing the cautionary language and provisions specified in this section. A futures commission merchant or introducing broker may obtain such endorsement as provided in § 1.55(d) of this chapter for the following classes of customers only:</P>
          <P>(i) A plan defined as a government plan or church plan in section 3(32) or section 3(33) of title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or a foreign person performing a similar role or function subject as such to comparable foreign regulation; and</P>
          <P>(ii) A person who is a “qualified eligible participant” or a “qualified eligible client” as defined in § 4.7 of this chapter.</P>

          <P>(3) The agreement may not require any customer to waive the right to seek reparations under section 14 of the Act and part 12 of this chapter. Accordingly, such customer must be advised in writing that he or she may seek reparations under section 14 of the Act by an election made within 45 days after the Commission registrant notifies the customer that arbitration will be demanded under the agreement. This notice must be given at the time when the Commission registrant notifies the customer of an intention to arbitrate. The customer must also be advised that if he or she seeks reparations under section 14 of the Act and the Commission declines to institute reparations proceedings, the claim or grievance will be subject to the pre-existing arbitration agreement and must also be advised that aspects of the claim or grievance that are not subject to the reparations procedure (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> do not constitute a violation of the Act or rules thereunder) may be required to be submitted to the arbitration or other dispute settlement procedure set forth in the pre-existing arbitration agreement.</P>
          <P>(4) The agreement must advise the customer that, at such time as he or she may notify the Commission registrant that he or she intends to submit a claim to arbitration, or at such time as such person notifies the customer of its intent to submit a claim to arbitration, the customer will have the opportunity to elect a qualified forum for conducting the proceeding.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Election of forum.</E> (i) Within ten business days after receipt of notice from the customer that he or she intends to submit a claim to arbitration, or at the time a Commission registrant notifies the customer of its intent to <PRTPAGE P="451"/>submit a claim to arbitration, the Commission registrant must provide the customer with a list of organizations whose procedures meet Acceptable Practices established by the Commission for dispute resolution, together with a copy of the rules of each forum listed. The list must include:</P>
          <P>(A) The designated contract market, if applicable and if available, upon which the transaction giving rise to the dispute was executed or could have been executed;</P>
          <P>(B) A registered futures association; and</P>
          <P>(C) At least one other organization that will provide the customer with the opportunity to select the location of the arbitration proceeding from among several major cities in diverse geographic regions and that will provide the customer with the choice of a panel or other decision-maker composed of at least one or more persons, of which at least a majority are not members or associated with a member of the designated contract market, if applicable, or employee thereof, and that are not otherwise associated with the designated contract market (mixed panel), if applicable: Provided, however, that the list of qualified organizations provided by a Commission registrant that is a floor broker need not include a registered futures association unless a registered futures association has been authorized to act as a decision-maker in such matters.</P>
          <P>(ii) The customer shall, within forty-five days after receipt of such list, notify the opposing party of the organization selected. A customer's failure to provide such notice shall give the opposing party the right to select an organization from the list.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Fees.</E> The agreement must acknowledge that the Commission registrant will pay any incremental fees that may be assessed by a qualified forum for provision of a mixed panel, unless the arbitrators in a particular proceeding determine that the customer has acted in bad faith in initiating or conducting that proceeding.</P>
          <P>(7) <E T="03">Cautionary Language.</E> The agreement must include the following language printed in large boldface type:

              <E T="04">Three Forums Exist for the Resolution of Commodity Disputes: Civil Court litigation, reparations at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and arbitration conducted by a self-regulatory or other private organization.</E>
            </P>
            <P>The CFTC recognizes that the opportunity to settle disputes by arbitration may in some cases provide many benefits to customers, including the ability to obtain an expeditious and final resolution of disputes without incurring substantial costs. The CFTC requires, however, that each customer individually examine the relative merits of arbitration and that your consent to this arbitration agreement be voluntary.</P>
            <P>By signing this agreement, you: (1) May be waiving your right to sue in a court of law; and (2) are agreeing to be bound by arbitration of any claims or counterclaims which you or [name] may submit to arbitration under this agreement. You are not, however, waiving your right to elect instead to petition the CFTC to institute reparations proceedings under Section 14 of the Commodity Exchange Act with respect to any dispute that may be arbitrated pursuant to this agreement. In the event a dispute arises, you will be notified if [name] intends to submit the dispute to arbitration. If you believe a violation of the Commodity Exchange Act is involved and if you prefer to request a section 14 “Reparations” proceeding before the CFTC, you will have 45 days from the date of such notice in which to make that election.</P>
            <P>You need not sign this agreement to open or maintain an account with [name]. See 17 CFR 166.5.</P>
          </EXTRACT>
          
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Enforceability.</E> A dispute settlement procedure may require parties utilizing such procedure to agree, under applicable state law, submission agreement or otherwise, to be bound by an award rendered in the procedure, provided that the agreement to submit the claim or grievance to the procedure was made in accordance with paragraph (c) or (g) of this section or that the agreement to submit the claim or grievance was made after the claim or grievance arose. Any award so rendered shall be enforceable in accordance with applicable law.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Time limits for submission of claims.</E> The dispute settlement procedure established by a designated contract market shall not include any unreasonably short limitation period foreclosing submission of customers' claims or grievances or counterclaims.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Counterclaims.</E> A procedure established by a designated contract market under the Act for the settlement of customers' claims or grievances against a member or employee thereof <PRTPAGE P="452"/>may permit the submission of a counterclaim in the procedure by a person against whom a claim or grievance is brought. The designated contract market may permit such a counterclaim where the counterclaim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject of the customer's claim or grievance and does not require for adjudication the presence of essential witnesses, parties, or third persons over whom the designated contract market does not have jurisdiction. Other counterclaims arising out of a transaction subject to the Act and rules promulgated thereunder for which the customer utilizes the services of the registrant may be permissible where the customer and the registrant have agreed in advance to require that all such submissions be included in the proceeding, and if the aggregate monetary value of the counterclaims is capable of calculation.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Eligible contract participants.</E> A person who is an “eligible contract participant” as defined in section 1a(12) of the Act may negotiate any term of an agreement or understanding with a Commission registrant in which the eligible contract participant agrees, prior to the time a claim or grievance arises, to submit such claim or grievance to any settlement procedure provided for in the agreement.</P>

            <P>A futures association must demonstrate that it will be able to carry out the purposes of section 17 of the Act. Since a basic purpose of a futures association is to regulate the practices of its members, an association should demonstrate that it will require its members to adhere to regulatory requirements governing their business practices at least as stringent as those imposed by the Commission. For example, the association should be prepared to establish and maintain in accordance with § 1.52 of this chapter, a financial compliance program for those members of the association who are futures commission merchants.</P>

Unless specifically indicated, references in this part to the National Futures Association shall also include any other registered futures association.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Matters excluded.</E> The Commission will not review under these rules the following decisions by the National Futures Association:</P>
            <P>(1) A decision in a disciplinary action if the party aggrieved by the decision knowingly failed to pursue the right to appeal an adverse decision to the Appeals Committee of the National Futures Association and there are no extraordinary circumstances that otherwise warrant Commission consideration of the aggrieved party's appeal;</P>
            <P>(2) A decision in an arbitration action brought pursuant to section 17(b)(10) of the Act or any rule of the National Futures Association;</P>
            <P>(3) Suspension of a member based solely on that member's failure to pay National Futures Association dues;</P>
            <P>(4) A decision to disqualify any member for service on the National Futures Association Board of Directors, Business Conduct Committees, Hearing Committee or arbitration panels pursuant to the standards for service adopted by the National Futures Association to implement Commission rule 1.63;</P>

            <P>(5) Suspension of a member or a person associated with a member based solely on that person's failure to pay an arbitration award or a settlement agreement resulting from an arbitration action brought pursuant to section 17(b)(10) of the Act or rules and regulations of the National Futures Association, or a settlement agreement resulting from a mediation proceeding sponsored by the National Futures Association, unless there are extraordinary circumstances that involve <PRTPAGE P="457"/>something more than the ministerial application of a predetermined sanction, or raise a colorable claim that the National Futures Assocaition has acted arbitrarily.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Appeals from excluded decisions.</E> If the General Counsel, or any employee under the General Counsel's supervision as the General Counsel may designate, determines that a notice of appeal submitted to the Commission is from a decision that is excluded from review under this part, the notice of appeal may be stricken and ordered to be returned to the aggrieved party who submitted it.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Applicability of these part 171 rules.</E> Unless otherwise ordered, these rules will apply in their entirety to all appeals and matters relating thereto filed on or after October 31, 1990.

          <P>(2) <E T="03">Involuntary cases.</E> A commodity broker against which an involuntary petition in bankruptcy is filed, or the trustee if a trustee has been appointed in such case, must use its best efforts to effect a transfer in accordance with § 190.06 (e) and (f) of all open commodity contracts and equity held by the commodity broker for or on behalf of its customers and such other property as the Commission in its discretion may authorize, on or before the seventh calendar day after the filing date, and immediately cease doing business: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That the <PRTPAGE P="477"/>commodity broker may trade for liquidation only, unless otherwise directed by the Commission, by any applicable self-regulatory organization or by the court: And, <E T="03">Provided further,</E> That if the commodity broker demonstrates to the Commission within such period that it was in compliance with the segregation and financial requirements of this chapter on the filing date, and the Commission determines, in its sole discretion, that such transfer or liquidation is neither appropriate nor in the public interest, the commodity broker may continue in business subject to applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and of this chapter.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Liquidation or offset.</E> After entry of the order for relief and subject to paragraph (e) of this section, which requires the trustee to attempt to make certain transfers permitted by § 190.06 and section 764(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, the following commodity contracts and other property held by or for the account of a debtor must be liquidated or offset by the trustee promptly and in an orderly manner, subject to limit moves and to applicable procedures under the Bankruptcy Code:</P>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, an open commodity contract must be offset if: such contract is a futures contract or a Cleared Swaps contract which cannot be settled in cash and which would otherwise remain open either beyond the last day of trading (if applicable), or the first day on which notice of intent to deliver may be tendered with respect thereto, whichever occurs first; such contract is a long option on a physical commodity which cannot be settled in cash and would be automatically exercised, has value and would remain open beyond the last day for exercise; such contract is a short option on a physical commodity which cannot be settled in cash; or, as otherwise specified in these rules.</P>

          <P>(g) <E T="03">Treatment of open commodity contracts</E>—(1) <E T="03">Margin payments by the trustee.</E> Prior to the primary liquidation date, the trustee may make variation and maintenance margin payments to a commodity broker carrying the account of the debtor, as appropriate, pending liquidation of any open commodity contracts required to be liquidated under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, whether or not such contracts are specifically identifiable to a particular customer: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That:</P>
          <P>(i) No payments may be made on behalf of accounts which are in deficit,</P>
          <P>(ii) No payments may be made on behalf of non-public customers or the debtor from funds which are segregated for the benefit of public customers,</P>
          <P>(iii) The trustee must make margin payments if payments of margin are received from customers after bankruptcy in response to margin calls, and</P>
          <P>(iv) No payments need be made to restore initial margin.</P>

          <P>Subsequent to the primary liquidation date, accounts which contain open commodity contracts not required to be liquidated under § 190.02 (f)(1) shall be operated by the trustee as follows:</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Operation of accounts held open for transfer</E>—(1) <E T="03">Establishment of transfer accounts.</E> On the primary liquidation date, the trustee must generate a new statement of account for each class of account of a customer which contains a commodity contract not required to be liquidated under § 190.02(f)(1). The opening balance of such statement must be equal to its funded balance, less the value on the date of its transfer or return of any property transferred or returned with respect to the net equity claim for such account prior to the primary liquidation date.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Accounting for transfer accounts.</E> The opening balance of any statement generated on the primary liquidation date in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be adjusted for operations on or subsequent to the primary liquidation date in the same manner as the equity in a commodity contract account maintained for or on behalf of a customer would adjusted in the ordinary course of business prior to the filing date: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That such statement of account must also be adjusted to reflect certain adjustments to the funded balance in accordance with § 190.07(c)(2), such that the balance in that account will always be equal to the funded balance of the claimant's net equity claim adjusted for corrections and subsequent operations less the value on the date of transfer or return of any property transferred or returned with respect to that claim prior to the primary liquidation date.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Margin calls.</E> The trustee must promptly issue margin calls with respect to any account referred to under paragraph (a)(1) of this section in which the balance does not equal or exceed 100% of the maintenance margin requirements of the applicable designated contact market or swap execution facility, if any, with respect to the open commodity contracts in such account, or if there are no such maintenance margin requirements, 100% of the clearing organization's initial margin requirements applicable to the open commodity contracts in such account, or if there are no such maintenance margin requirements or clearing organization initial margin requirements, then 50% of the customer initial margin applicable to the commodity contracts in such account: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That no margin calls need be made to restore customer initial margin.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Margin payments.</E> The trustee may make variation or maintenance margin payments to the broker carrying any account referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section as appropriate if such <PRTPAGE P="479"/>payments do not exceed the balance of the statement of account generated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to which such contracts are credited. Any customer for which commodity contracts remain open subsequent to the primary liquidation date will not be relieved of the obligation to make margin payments by reason of the bankruptcy of the commodity broker: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the full amount of any margin payment made by a customer subsequent to the primary liquidation date must be credited to the account referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for which it was made.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Distribution.</E> No distribution of equity may be made to or on behalf of customers by the trustee with respect to an account established in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section and to § 190.08(d).</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Liquidation of open commodity contracts.</E> Commodity contracts held open by the trustee in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be liquidated promptly and in an orderly manner, if:</P>
          <P>(1) Any payment of margin would result in a deficit in the account in which they are held;</P>
          <P>(2) The customer for, or on whose behalf, the account is held fails to meet a margin call within a reasonable time;</P>
          <P>(3) The trustee has received no customer instructions with respect to such contract by the sixth calendar day after entry of the order for relief;</P>
          <P>(4) The commodity contract has not been transferred in accordance with § 190.08(d)(2) on or before the seventh calendar day after entry of the order for relief; or</P>
          <P>(5) The commodity contract would otherwise remain open (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> because it cannot be settled in cash) beyond the last day of trading in such contract (if applicable) or the first day on which notice of delivery may be tendered with respect to such contract, whichever occurs first.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Liquidation of specifically identifiable property other than open commodity contracts.</E> All specifically identifiable property other than open commodity contracts which have not been liquidated prior to the primary liquidation date, and for which no customer instructions have been timely received must be liquidated, to the extent reasonably possible, no later than the sixth calendar day after final publication of the notice referred to in § 190.02(b)(1).

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Compliance with the Act and regulations.</E> Except as specifically provided otherwise in this part, the trustee shall comply with all of the provisions of the Act and of the regulations thereunder as if it were the debtor.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Computation of funded balance.</E> Using the information available, the trustee must compute a funded balance for each customer account which contains open commodity contracts as of the close of business each day subsequent to the order for relief until the final liquidation date. Such computation must be completed prior to noon on the next business day.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Records</E>—(1) <E T="03">Maintenance.</E> Subject to the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code, records of the computations required by this part shall be maintained in accordance with § 1.31 of this chapter by the trustee for the greater of the period required by § 1.31 of this chapter or for a period of one year after the close of the bankruptcy proceeding for which they were compiled.</P>

At any time on or after the filing date, the commodity broker, or the trustee if a trustee has been appointed, shall be required to give the Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice immediate access to all records of the debtor, including records required to be retained in accordance with § 1.31 of this chapter and all other records of the commodity broker, whether or not the Act or this <PRTPAGE P="480"/>chapter would require such records to be maintained by the commodity broker.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Liquidation</E>—(1) <E T="03">Order of Liquidation</E>—(i) <E T="03">In the Market.</E> Liquidation of open commodity contracts held for a house account or customer account by or on behalf of a commodity broker which is a debtor shall be accomplished pursuant to the rules of a clearing organization, a designated contract market, or a swap execution facility, as applicable. Such rules shall ensure that the process for liquidating open commodity contracts, whether for the house account or the customer account, results in competitive pricing, to the extent feasible under market conditions at the time of liquidation. Such rules must be submitted to the Commission for approval, pursuant to section 5c(c) of the Act, and be approved by the Commission. Alternatively, such rules must otherwise be submitted to and approved by the Commission (or its delegate pursuant to § 190.10(d) of this part) prior to their application.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Book entry.</E> Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, in appropriate cases, upon application by the trustee or the affected clearing organization, the Commission may permit open commodity contracts to be liquidated, or settlement on such contracts to be made, by book entry. Such book entry shall offset open commodity contracts, whether matched or not matched on the books of the commodity broker, using the settlement price for such commodity contracts as determined by the clearing organization. Such settlement price shall be determined by the rules of the clearing organization, which shall ensure that such settlement price is established in a competitive manner, to the extent feasible under market conditions at the time of liquidation. Such rules must be submitted to the Commission for approval pursuant to section 5c(c) of the Act, and be approved by the Commission. Alternatively, such rules must otherwise be approved by the Commission (or its delegate pursuant to § 190.10(d) of this part) prior to their application.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Liquidation only.</E> Nothing in this part shall be interpreted to permit the trustee to purchase or sell new commodity contracts for customers of the debtor except to offset open commodity contracts or to transfer any transferable notice received by the debtor or the trustee under any commodity contract: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That the trustee may, in its discretion and with approval of the Commission, cover uncovered inventory or commodity contracts of the debtor which cannot be liquidated immediately because of price limits or other market conditions, or may take an offsetting position in a new month or at a strike price for which limits have not been reached.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Exception to Liquidation Only.</E> Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the trustee may, with the written permission of the Commission, operate the business of the debtor in the ordinary course, including the purchase or sale of new commodity contracts on behalf of the customers of the debtor under appropriate circumstances, as determined by the Commission.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Other matters</E>—(1) <E T="03">Determination as to bona fide hedges.</E> In determining which commodity contracts are eligible to be held open for transfer pursuant to customer instruction, the trustee may rely on the designation in the accounting records of the commodity broker that the account for or on behalf of which the contract is held is a hedging account. Commodity contracts maintained in a hedging account may be treated by the trustee as specifically identifiable.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Disbursements.</E> The trustee shall make no disbursements to customers prior to final distribution except with approval of the court or in accordance with § 190.08(d).</P>

          <SUBJECT>Making and taking delivery on commodity contracts.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) In the event that the trustee is unable to liquidate an open commodity contract subject to physical delivery or an option on a physical commodity, which cannot be settled in cash, prior to the last day of trading in that contract as required by §§ 190.02(f)(1) and 190.03(b)(5), the trustee must use its best efforts to prevent property which is to be delivered for or on behalf of a customer to fulfill that contract, or property for which delivery is being taken with respect to a customer pursuant to that contract, from becoming part of the debtor's estate.</P>
          <P>(2) Delivery account shall mean any account prominently designated as such in the records of the debtor which contains only the specifically identifiable property associated with delivery set forth in § 190.01(kk) (3), (4), and (5), except that with respect to § 190.01(kk) (4) and (5), delivery need not be made or taken and exercise need not be effected for such property to be included in a delivery account.</P>
          <P>(3) The portion of the price or the proceeds of a commodity contract upon delivery which is not specifically identifiable property under § 190.01(kk) (4) and (5) must be distributed pro rata under section 766(h) of the Code.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Rules for deliveries on behalf of a customer of a debtor.</E> Except in the case of a commodity contract which is settled in cash, each designated contract market, swap execution facility, or clearing organization shall adopt, maintain in effect and enforce rules which have been submitted in accordance with section 5c(c) of the Act for approval by the Commission, which:</P>
          <P>(1) Permit the making and taking of delivery to fulfill a commodity contract for a physical commodity or an option on a physical commodity, which has not become part of the debtor's estate on the date of the entry of the order for relief but with respect to which commodity contract:</P>
          <P>(i) Trading has ceased on the date of the entry of the order for relief;</P>
          <P>(ii) Notice of delivery has been tendered on or before the date of the entry of the order for relief; or,</P>

          <P>(iii) Trading ceases before it can be liquidated by the trustee, to be effected directly between the customer of the debtor and the person identified by the clearing organization as the party to whom delivery should be made or from whom delivery should be taken by such customer of the debtor without intervention of the trustee and without including such physical commodity or the payment for such physical commodity in any bankruptcy distribution: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That a customer shall not be relieved of his obligation to make or take delivery for the sole reason that delivery must be made or taken from a commodity broker which is a debtor; and</P>
          <P>(2) Recognize that the equity of a customer of the debtor in a commodity contract upon which delivery is made or taken must be included in the net equity claim of that customer and, as such, can only be distributed pro rata at the time of, and as part of, any distributions to customers made by the trustee.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Delivery made or taken within the debtor's estate.</E> (1) Any property in a delivery account which is part of the <PRTPAGE P="482"/>debtor's estate on the date of the order for relief may be returned under the terms set forth in § 190.08(d)(1)(ii).</P>
          <P>(2) If the property to be delivered is part of the debtor's estate on the date of the order for relief and a customer of the debtor is required to make delivery, the trustee must make delivery in the same manner as if no bankruptcy had occurred and the party by whom delivery is taken must pay the full notice price or strike price for delivery.</P>

          <P>(3) If delivery is to be made or taken on behalf of a house account the trustee must either make or take delivery, as the case may be, on behalf of the debtor's estate: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That if the trustee, at any time, takes delivery of a physical commodity, the trustee must convert that physical commodity to cash as promptly as possible.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Transfers.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Transfer rules.</E> No clearing organization or other self-regulatory organization may adopt, maintain in effect or enforce rules which:</P>
          <P>(1) Are inconsistent with the provisions of this part;</P>
          <P>(2) Interfere with the acceptance by its members of open commodity contracts and the equity margining or securing such contracts from futures commission merchants, or persons which are required to be registered as futures com-mission merchants, which are required to transfer accounts pursuant to § 1.17(a)(4) of this chapter; or</P>

          <P>(3) Prevent the acceptance by its members of transfers of open commodity contracts and the equity margining or securing such contracts from futures commission merchants with respect to which a petition in bankruptcy has been filed, if such transfers have been approved by the Commission. <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> that this paragraph shall not limit the exercise of any contractual right of a clearing organization or other registered entity to liquidate open commodity contracts.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice.</E> Unless notice has been filed pursuant to § 1.65(b) of this chapter, if a futures commission merchant, or a person required to be registered as a futures commission merchant, intends to transfer commodity contracts held by or for a commodity broker from or for the account of a customer to another person registered as a futures commission merchant after a petition in bankruptcy has been filed by or against such commodity broker, the transferor must notify the Commission no later than is required under § 190.02(a)(2).</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Financial requirements for transferees.</E> (1) No transfer may be made which would cause the transferee to be in violation of the minimum financial requirements set forth in this chapter.</P>
          <P>(2) A transferee may accept a transfer of open commodity contracts even though the money, securities and other property eligible for transfer under the regulations contained in this part is insufficient to fully margin such positions, if the transferee agrees to accept the transfer subject to any loss due to the failure to recover such deficiency from the customers whose contracts it has accepted or from the estate of the debtor.</P>
          <P>(3) The transferee of a commodity contract for which notice is given under § 190.06(b)(2) must keep that contract open one business day after its receipt, unless the customer for whom the transfer is made fails to respond within a reasonable time to a margin call for the difference between the margin transferred with such contract and the margin which such transferee would require with respect to a similar commodity contract held for the account of a customer in the ordinary course of business.</P>
          <P>(4) No commission may be collected by the transferor with respect to the transfer of an open commodity contract for which notice is given under § 190.06(b)(2).</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Customer instructions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Customer instructions.</E> A commodity broker must provide an opportunity for each customer to specify when undertaking its <PRTPAGE P="483"/>first hedging contract whether, in the event of bankruptcy, such customer prefers that open commodity contracts held in a hedging account be liquidated by the trustee without seeking customer instructions. Such commodity broker may obtain evidence of the customer instructions as provided in § 1.55(d) of this chapter.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Record of customer instructions.</E> Each futures commission merchant must indicate prominently in the accounting records in which it maintains open trade balances any customer accounts which are hedging accounts for which the customer has not specified that it prefers open contracts to be liquidated in bankruptcy by the trustee without instruction.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Eligibility for transfer under section 764(b) of the Bankruptcy Code</E>—(1) <E T="03">Accounts eligible for transfer.</E> Subject to the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section, all accounts are eligible for transfer after the filing date pursuant to section 764(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, except:</P>
          <P>(i) House accounts or the accounts of general partners of the debtor if the debtor is a partnership;</P>
          <P>(ii) Leverage accounts, if the debtor is the leverage transaction merchant with respect to such accounts;</P>
          <P>(iii) Dealer option accounts, if the debtor is the dealer option grantor with respect to such accounts; or</P>
          <P>(iv) Accounts which are in deficit.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Amount of equity which may be transferred.</E> In no case may money, securities or property be transferred in respect of any eligible account if the value of such money, securities or property would exceed the funded balance of such account based on available information as of the calendar day immediately preceding transfer less the value on the date of return or transfer of any property previously returned or transferred with respect thereto.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Special rules for transfers under section 764(b) of the Bankruptcy Code</E>—(1) <E T="03">Dealer options</E>—(i) <E T="03">Eligibility for transfer.</E> Prior to exercise, any dealer option contract held by or for the account of a debtor which is a futures commission merchant from or for the account of a customer may be transferred even if the funded balance available for transfer which is attributable to such contract does not equal 100% of the portion of the purchase price required to be segregated with respect to such contract: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That a dealer option contract will be eligible for transfer only if any deficiency in the funded balance of the customer account in which it is held is not due to amounts owed by such customer to the debtor; and, <E T="03">Provided further,</E> That the transferee of any dealer option contract need not segregate more than an amount equal to that portion of the purchase price due the grantor which is transferred with the contract which should be equal to the grantor's funded balance in the portion of the purchase price segregated less any reasonable reserve established by the trustee for the nonrecovery of overpayments.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Obligation of the dealer option grantor.</E> In the event of the transfer of a dealer option contract pursuant to this section, the failure of the debtor futures commission merchant to segregate 100% of the purchase price due the grantor for such contract, or the failure of the dealer option grantor to collect 100% of such purchase price due the grantor, shall not excuse the dealer option grantor from its obligation to perform such contract in full upon its exercise, without any setoff or set aside for the premium deficiency.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Clearing organizations.</E> Commodity contracts held by a clearing organization which is a debtor may not be transferred.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Partial transfers</E>—(i) <E T="03">Of the customer estate.</E> If all eligible customer accounts held by a debtor cannot be transferred under this section, a partial transfer may nonetheless be made. The Commission will not disapprove such a transfer for the sole reason that it was a partial transfer if it would prefer the transfer of accounts, the liquidation of which could adversely affect the market or the bankrupt estate. Any dealer option contract held by or for the account of a debtor which is a futures commission merchant from or for the account of a customer which has not previously been transferred, and is eligible for transfer, must be transferred on or before the seventh calendar day after entry of the order for relief.<PRTPAGE P="484"/>
          </P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Of a customer account.</E> If all of a customer's open commodity contracts cannot be transferred under this section, a partial transfer of contracts may be made. A partial transfer may be effected by liquidating that portion of the open commodity contracts held by a customer which represents sufficient equity to permit the transfer of the remainder. If any commodity contracts to be transferred in a partial transfer are part of a spread or straddle, both sides of such spread or straddle must be transferred or neither side may be transferred.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Prohibition on avoidance of transfers under section 764(b) of the Bankruptcy Code</E>—(1) <E T="03">Pre-relief transfers.</E> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section, the following transfers may not be avoided by a trustee:</P>
          <P>(i) The transfer of commodity contract accounts prior to the entry of the order for relief in compliance with § 1.17(a)(4) of this chapter unless such transfer is disapproved by the Commission; or</P>
          <P>(ii) The transfer prior to the order for relief by a public customer, including a transfer by a public customer which is a commodity broker, of commodity contract accounts held from or for the account of such customer by or on behalf of the debtor unless:</P>
          <P>(A) The customer acted in collusion with the debtor or its principals to obtain a greater share of the bankrupt estate than that to which it would be entitled in a bankruptcy distribution; or</P>
          <P>(B) The transfer is disapproved by the Commission.</P>
          <P>(iii) The transfer prior to the order for relief by a clearing organization of one or more accounts held for or on behalf of customers of the debtor, provided that (I) the money, securities, or other property accompanying such transfer did not exceed the funded balance of each account based on available information as of the close of business on the business day immediately preceding such transfer less the value on the date of return or transfer of any property previously returned or transferred thereto, and (II) the transfer is not disapproved by the Commission.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Post-relief transfers.</E> On or after the entry of the order for relief, the following transfers to one or more transferees may not be avoided by the trustee:</P>
          <P>(i) The transfer of a customer account eligible to be transferred under paragraph (e) or (f) of this section made by the trustee of the commodity broker or by any self-regulatory organization of the commodity broker:</P>
          <P>(A) On or before the seventh calendar day after the entry of the order for relief; and</P>
          <P>(B) The Commission is notified in accordance with § 190.02(a)(2) prior to the transfer and does not disapprove the transfer; or</P>
          <P>(ii) The transfer of a customer account at the direction of the Commission on or before the seventh calendar day after the order for relief upon such terms and conditions as the Commission may deem appropriate and in the public interest.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Withdrawals prior to bankruptcy.</E> The withdrawal or settlement of a commodity contract account by a public customer including a public customer which is a commodity broker, prior to the filing date may not be avoided by a trustee unless:</P>
          <P>(i) The customer making the withdrawal or settlement acted in collusion with the debtor or its principals to obtain a greater share of the bankruptcy estate than that to which such customer would be entitled in a bankruptcy distribution; or</P>
          <P>(ii) The withdrawal or settlement is disapproved by the Commission.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Commission action.</E> Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in appropriate cases and to protect the public interest, the Commission may:</P>

          <P>Allowed net equity shall be computed as follows:</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Allowed claim.</E> The allowed net equity claim of a customer shall be equal <PRTPAGE P="485"/>to the aggregate of the funded balances of such customer's net equity claim for each account class plus or minus the adjustments specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Net equity.</E> Net equity means the total claim of a customer against the estate of the debtor based on the commodity contracts held by the debtor for or on behalf of such customer less any indebtedness of the customer to the debtor. Net equity shall be calculated as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Step 1—Equity determination.</E> Determine the equity balance of each customer account by computing, with respect to such account, the sum of:</P>
          <P>(i) The ledger balance;</P>
          <P>(ii) The open trade balance; and</P>
          <P>(iii) The current realizable market value, determined as of the close of the market on the last preceding market day, of any securities or other property held by or for the debtor from or for such account, plus accrued interest, if any.</P>
          <P>(A) For the purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), the ledger balance of a customer account shall be calculated by adding:</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Cash deposited to purchase, margin, guarantee, secure, or settle a commodity contract;</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Except as is otherwise provided in this chapter, the cash proceeds of such cash, or of securities or other property referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section held from or for the customer by or for the account of the commodity broker; and</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Gains realized on trades, and</P>

          <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Disbursements to or on behalf of the customer; and</P>

For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), the open trade balance of a customer's account shall be computed by subtracting the unrealized loss in value of the open commodity contracts held by or for such account from the unrealized gain in value of the open commodity contracts held by or for such account. In calculating the ledger balance or open trade balance of any customer, exclude any security futures products, any gains or losses realized on trades in such products, any property received to margin, guarantee or secure such products (including interest thereon or the proceeds thereof), to the extent any of the foregoing are held in a securities account, and any disbursements to or on behalf of such customer in connection with such products or such property held in a securities account.</P>

Paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(xiii) of this section prescribe which accounts must be treated as being held in the same capacity and which accounts must be treated as being held in a separate capacity.</P>
          <P>(i) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(2), all accounts which are maintained with a debtor in a person's name and which, under this paragraph (b)(2), are deemed to be held by that person in its individual capacity shall be deemed to be held in the same capacity.</P>
          <P>(ii) An account maintained with a debtor by a guardian, custodian, or conservator for the benefit of a ward, or for the benefit of a minor under the Uniform Gift to Minors Act, shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from accounts held by such guardian, custodian or conservator in its individual capacity.</P>
          <P>(iii) An account maintained with a debtor in the name of an executor or administrator of an estate shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from accounts held by such executor or administrator in its individual capacity.</P>

          <P>(v) An account maintained with a debtor by a trustee shall be deemed to <PRTPAGE P="486"/>be held in the individual capacity of the grantor of the trust unless the trust is created by a valid written instrument for a purpose other than avoidance of an offset under the regulations contained in this part. A trust account which is not deemed to be held in the individual capacity of its grantor under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from accounts held in an individual capacity by the trustee, by the grantor or any successor in interest of the grantor, or by any trust beneficiary, and from accounts held by any other trust.</P>
          <P>(vi) An account maintained with a debtor by a corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from accounts held by the shareholders, partners or members of such corporation, partnership or unincorporated association, if such entity was created for purposes other than avoidance of an offset under the regulations contained in this part.</P>
          <P>(vii) A hedging account of a person shall be deemed to be held in the same capacity as a speculative account of such person.</P>

          <P>(viii) Subject to paragraph (b)(2)(ix) of this section, the futures accounts, leverage accounts, options accounts, foreign futures accounts, delivery accounts (as defined in § 190.05(a)(2)), and cleared swaps accounts of the same person shall not be deemed to be held in separate capacities: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> that such accounts may be aggregated only in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
          <P>(ix) An omnibus customer account of a futures commission merchant maintained with a debtor shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from the house account and any other omnibus customer account of such futures commission merchant.</P>

          <P>(x) A joint account maintained with the debtor shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from any account held in an individual capacity by the participants in such account, from any account held in an individual capacity by a commodity pool operator or commodity trading advisor for such account, and from any other joint account: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That if such account is not transferred in accordance with § 190.06, it shall be deemed to be held in the same capacity as any other joint account held by identical participants and a participant's percentage interest therein shall be deemed to be held in the same capacity as any account held in an individual capacity by such participant.</P>
          <P>(xi) An account maintained with a debtor in the name of a plan which, on the filing date, has in effect a registration statement in accordance with the requirements of section 1031 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the regulations thereunder shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from an account held in an individual capacity by the plan administrator, any employer, employee, participant, or beneficiary with respect to such plan.</P>
          <P>(xii) Except as otherwise provided in this section, an account maintained with a debtor by an agent or nominee for a principal or a beneficial owner shall be deemed to be an account held in the individual capacity of such principal or beneficial owner.</P>
          <P>(xiii) With respect to the cleared swaps account class, each individual customer account within each omnibus customer account referred to in paragraph (ix) of this section shall be deemed to be held in a separate capacity from each other such individual customer account; subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (xii) of this paragraph (b)(2).</P>
          <P>(xiv) Accounts held by a customer in separate capacities shall be deemed to be accounts of different customers. The burden of proving that an account is held in a separate capacity shall be upon the customer.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Step 3</E>—<E T="03">Setoffs.</E> (i) The net equity of one customer account may not be offset against the net equity of any other customer.</P>

          <P>(ii) Any obligation which is not required to be included in computing the equity of a customer under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but which is owed by such customer to the debtor must be deducted from any obligation not required to be included in computing the equity of a customer which is owed by such debtor to the customer. If the former amount exceeds the latter, the <PRTPAGE P="487"/>excess must be deducted from the equity balance of the customer obtained after performing the preceding calculations required by paragraph (b) of this section: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That if the customer owns more than two classes of accounts the excess must be offset against each positive equity balance in the same proportion as that positive equity balance bears to the total of all positive equity balances of accounts of different classes held by such customer.</P>

          <P>(iii) A negative equity balance obtained with respect to one customer account class must be set off against a positive equity balance in any other account class of such customer held in the same capacity: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That if a customer owns more than two classes of accounts such balance must be offset against each positive equity balance in the same proportion as that positive equity balance bears to the total of all positive equity balances in accounts of different classes held by such customer.</P>
          <P>(iv) To the extent any indebtedness of the debtor to the customer which is not required to be included in computing the equity of such customer under paragraph (b)(1) of this section exceeds such indebtedness of the customer to the debtor, the customer claim therefor will constitute a general creditor's claim rather than a customer property claim, and the net equity therefor shall be separately calculated.</P>
          <P>(v) The rules pertaining to separate capacities and permitted setoffs contained in this section must be applied subsequent to the entry of an order for relief; prior to the filing date, the provisions of § 1.22 of this chapter and of sections 4d(a)(2) and 4d(f) of the Act (and, in each case, the regulations promulgated thereunder) shall govern what setoffs are permitted.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Step 4</E>—<E T="03">Correction for distributions.</E> The value on the date of transfer or distribution of any property transferred or distributed subsequent to the filing date and prior to the primary liquidation data with respect to each class of account held by a customer must be added to the equity obtained for that customer for accounts of that class after performing the steps contained in paragraphs (b)(1)-(3) of this section: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That if all accounts for which there are customer claims of record and 100% of the equity pertaining thereto are transferred in accordance with § 190.06 and section 764(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, net equity shall be computed based solely upon those customer claims, if any, filed subsequent to bankruptcy which are not claims of record on the filing date.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Step 5</E>—<E T="03">Correction for subsequent events.</E> Compute any adjustments to Steps 1 through 4 of this paragraph (b) required to correct misestimates or errors including, without limitation, corrections for subsequent events such as the liquidation of unliquidated claims at a value different from the estimated value previously used in computing net equity.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Step 6</E>—<E T="03">Net equity of accounts which remain open subsequent to the primary liquidation date.</E> If the accounts of a customer contain commodity contracts which remain open subsequent to the primary liquidation date, the trustee must adjust the net equity obtained for that customer pursuant to the steps contained in paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) of this section as provided in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Calculation of funded balance.</E> “Funded balance” means a customer's pro rata share of the customer estate with respect to each account class available as of the primary liquidation date for distribution to customers of the same class.</P>
          <P>(1) The funded balance of any customer claim shall be computed by:</P>
          <P>(i) Multiplying the ratio of the amount of the net equity claim less the amounts referred to in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section of such customer for any account class bears to the sum of the net equity claims less the amounts referred to in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section of all customers for accounts of that class by the sum of:</P>

          <P>(A) The value of the money, securities or property segregated on behalf of all accounts of the same class less the amounts referred to in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section;<PRTPAGE P="488"/>
          </P>
          <P>(B) The value of any money, securities or property which must be allocated under § 190.08 to customer accounts of the same class; and</P>
          <P>(C) The amount of any add-back required under paragraph (b)(4) of this section; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Then adding 100% of any margin payment made between the entry of the order for relief and the primary liquidation date.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Corrections to funded balance.</E> The funded balance must be adjusted, as of the primary liquidation date, to correct for subsequent events including, without limitation:</P>
          <P>(i) Added claimants;</P>
          <P>(ii) Disallowed claims;</P>
          <P>(iii) Liquidation of unliquidated claims at a value other than their estimated value;</P>
          <P>(iv) Recovery of property; and</P>
          <P>(v) Deficits generated by the continued operation of accounts after the primary liquidation date which cannot be fully adjusted under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Adjustments to funded balance for operations subsequent to the primary liquidation date.</E> If accounts of a customer contain commodity contracts which remain open subsequent to the primary liquidation date, the funded balance for each class must be adjusted until liquidation or transfer of all such open commodity contracts of that customer of the same class, as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) Unrealized and realized gains and any receipts of margin with respect thereto must be added to the funded balance;</P>
          <P>(2) Unrealized and realized losses, and the normal costs attributable to the payment of commissions, brokerage, interest, taxes, storage, transaction fees and other costs and charges lawfully incurred with respect to the maintenance or liquidation of such open commodity contracts, and any distributions must be subtracted from the funded balance; and</P>
          <P>(3) Subject to claims against the trustee for failure to liquidate, any deficit which is not recovered from the customer on whose behalf it is incurred must be charged against the funded balance of each account which remained open on the date the deficit occurred in the same proportion as the funded balance of each account bears to all the funded balances of all accounts which remained open on that date.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Valuation.</E> In computing net equity, commodity contracts and other property held by or for a commodity broker must be valued as provided in this paragraph (e): <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> that for all commodity contracts other than those listed in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if identical commodity contracts, securities, or other property are liquidated on the same date, but cannot be liquidated at the same price, the trustee may use the weighted average of the liquidation prices in computing the net equity of each customer holding such contracts, securities, or property.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Commodity Contracts.</E> Unless otherwise specified in this paragraph (e), the value of an open commodity contract shall be equal to the settlement price as calculated by the clearing organization pursuant to its rules: <E T="03">Provided,</E> that such rules must either be submitted to the Commission, pursuant to section 5c(c)(4) of the Act and be approved by the Commission, or such rules must be otherwise approved by the Commission (or its delegate pursuant to § 190.10(d) of this part) prior to their application; <E T="03">Provided, further,</E> that if such contract is transferred its value shall be determined as of the end of the settlement cycle in which it is transferred; and <E T="03">Provided, finally,</E> that if such contract is liquidated, its value shall be equal to the net proceeds of liquidation.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Principal contracts.</E> The valuation date of principal contracts which are not transferred shall be the date of the order for relief unless there is specific property which constitutes cover by the principal for the principal contract in which case it shall be the date of liquidation of the cover. For purposes of valuing contracts for which there is no established secondary market:</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Cash price series approved by Commission.</E> The market value of the physical commodity which is the subject of a principal contract shall be computed using a cash price series approved by the Commission for use by the dealer option grantor, in the case of dealer options, and by the leverage transaction <PRTPAGE P="489"/>merchant, in the case of leverage contracts.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">No cash price series approved by Commission.</E> If no applicable cash price series has been submitted to the Commission, or if such a cash price series has been submitted, but has not been approved by the Commission, the market value of the physical commodity which is the subject of a principal contract shall be equal to the lesser of:</P>
          <P>(A) The market value of the physical commodity as of the close of business on the local cash market most proximate to the debtor's principal place of business; or</P>

          <P>(B) The spot month settlement price on a designated contract market which trades contracts in that physical commodity most proximate to the debtor's principal place of business: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That where there is more than one local market as described in paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) (A) or (B) of this section, the trustee should use the most active market.</P>
          <P>(iii) <E T="03">Special rule for valuing dealer options.</E> A dealer option which is in-the-money will be deemed to have been exercised for purposes of determining its value which shall be equal to the greater of:</P>
          <P>(A) The in-the-money amount; or</P>

          <P>(B) The premium paid for such option divided by the number of days contained in the option period and multiplied by the number of days remaining in such period on the liquidation date: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That in the trustee's sole discretion, the trustee may reduce such value to an amount which does not exceed the average of the premiums recently paid for similar options granted by the same grantor.</P>
          <FP>Any time value not reflected in this computation claimed by a customer must be treated as a general creditor's claim.</FP>
          <P>(iv) <E T="03">Special rule for valuing leverage contracts.</E> Notwithstanding paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section, if the records of the debtor are not sufficient to substantiate customer claims for profits and to identify the owners of contracts with losses, the liquidation value of a leverage contract shall be deemed to be an amount equal to the total deposit made by a customer in respect to such contract.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Bucketed contracts.</E> The value of a commodity contract which has not been established in fact shall be deemed to be equal to the value of the total deposit made by a customer in respect to such contract.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Securities.</E> The value of a listed security shall be equal to the closing price for such security on the exchange upon which it is traded. The value of all securities not traded on an exchange shall be equal in the case of a long position, to the average of the bid prices for long positions, and in the case of a short position, to the average of the asking prices for the short positions. If liquidated prior to the primary liquidation date, the value of such security shall be equal to the net proceeds of its liquidation. Securities which are not publicly traded shall be valued by the trustee, subject to approval of the court, using such professional assistance as the trustee deems necessary in its sole discretion under the circumstances.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Property.</E> Cash commodities held in inventory, as collateral or otherwise, shall be valued at their fair market value. Subject to the other provisions of this paragraph (e), all other property shall be valued by the trustee subject to approval by the court, using such professional assistance as the trustee deems necessary in its sole discretion under the circumstances: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That if such property is sold, its value for purposes of the calculations required by this part shall be the net proceeds of such sale: <E T="03">Provided further,</E> That the sale is made in compliance with all applicable statutes, rules and orders of any court or governmental entity with jurisdiction thereover.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Allocation of property and allowance of claims.</SUBJECT>

          <P>The property of the debtor's estate must be allocated among account classes and between customer classes as provided in this section, except for special distributions required under appendix B to this part.

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope of customer property.</E> (1) Customer property includes the following:</P>
          <P>(i) All cash, securities, or other property or the proceeds of such cash, securities or other property received, acquired, or held by or for the account of the debtor, from or for the account of a customer, including a non-public customer, which is:</P>

          <P>(G) Property hypothecated under § 1.30 of this chapter to the extent that the value of such property exceeds the proceeds of any loan of margin made with respect thereto, and</P>
          <P>(ii) All cash, securities, or other property which:</P>
          <P>(A) Is segregated on the filing date;</P>
          <P>(B) Is a security owned by the debtor to the extent there are customer claims for securities of the same class and series of an issuer;</P>
          <P>(C) Is specifically identifiable to a customer;</P>
          <P>(D) Is property of a type described in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section which has been withdrawn and subsequently is recovered by the avoidance powers of the trustee;</P>
          <P>(E) Represents recovery of any debit balance, margin deficit, or other claim of the debtor against a customer account;</P>
          <P>(F) Was unlawfully converted but is part of the debtor's estate;</P>
          <P>(G) Is property of the debtor that any applicable law, rule, regulation, or order requires to be set aside for the benefit of customers, unless including such property in the customer estate would not significantly increase the customer estate;</P>
          <P>(H) Is property of the debtor's estate recovered by the Commission in any proceeding brought against the principals, agents, or employees of the debtor;</P>
          <P>(I) Is proceeds from the investment of customer property by the trustee pending final distribution; or</P>
          <P>(J) Is cash, securities or other property of the debtor's estate, including the debtor's trading or operating accounts and commodities of the debtor held in inventory, but only to the extent that the property enumerated in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(E) and (a)(1)(ii)(A) through (a)(1)(ii)(H) of this section is insufficient to satisfy in full all claims of public customers.</P>
          <P>(2) Customer property will not include:</P>
          <P>(i) Claims against the debtor for damages for any wrongdoing of the debtor, including claims for misrepresentation or fraud, or for any violation of the Act or of the regulations thereunder;</P>
          <P>(ii) Other claims for property which are not based upon property received, acquired or held by or for the account of the debtor, from or for the account of the customer;</P>

          <P>(b) <E T="03">Allocation of property between customer classes.</E> No portion of the customer estate may be allocated to pay non-public customer claims until all public customer claims have been satisfied in full. Any property segregated on behalf of non-public customers must be treated initially as part of the public customer estate and allocated under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Allocation of property among account classes</E>—(1) <E T="03">Segregated property.</E> Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, property held by or for the account of a customer, which is segregated on behalf of a specific account class, or readily traceable on the filing date to customers of such account class, must be allocated to the customer estate of the account class for which it is segregated or to which it is readily traceable.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">All other property.</E> Money, securities and property received from or for the account of customers on behalf of any account class which is recovered on behalf of the customer estate and which cannot be allocated in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, must be allocated as of the primary liquidation date in the following order:</P>
          <P>(i) To the estate of the account class for which, after the allocation required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the percentage of each public customer net equity claim which is funded is the lowest, until the funded percentage of net equity claims of such class equals the percentage of each public customer's net equity claim which is funded for the account class with the next lowest percentage of the funded claims; and then</P>
          <P>(ii) To the estate of the two account classes referred to in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section so that the percentage of the net equity claims which are funded for each class remains equal until the percentage of each public customer net equity claim which is funded equals the percentage of each public customer net equity claim which is funded for the account class with the next lowest percentage of funded claims, and so forth, until the percentage of each public customer net equity claim which is funded is equal for all classes of accounts; and then,</P>
          <P>(iii) Among account classes in the same proportion as the public customer net equity claims for each such account class bears to the total of public customer net equity claims of all account classes until the public customer claims of each account class are paid in full; and, thereafter,</P>
          <P>(iv) To the non-public customer estate for each account class in the same order as is prescribed in paragraphs (c)(2) (i) to (iii) of this section for the allocation of the customer estate among account classes.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Distribution of customer property</E>—(1) <E T="03">Return or transfer of specifically identifiable property other than a commodity contract.</E> Specifically identifiable property other than an open commodity contract not required to be liquidated under § 190.02(f)(2) may be returned or transferred on behalf of the customer to which it is identified:</P>
          <P>(i) If it is margining an open commodity contract, only if cash is first deposited with the trustee in an amount equal to the greater of the full fair market value of such property on the return date or the balance due on the return date on any loan by the debtor to the customer for which such property constitutes security; or</P>

          <P>(ii) If it is not so margining an open contract, at the option of the customer, either pursuant to the terms of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, or pursuant to the following terms: such customer first deposits cash with the trustee in an amount equal to the amount by which the greater of the value of the specifically identifiable property to be transferred or returned on the date of such transfer or return or the balance due on the return date on any loan by the debtor to the customer for which such property constitutes security, together with any other disbursements made, or to be made, to such customer, plus a reasonable reserve in the trustee's sole discretion, exceeds the estimated aggregate of the funded balances for each class of account of such customer less the <PRTPAGE P="492"/>value on the date of its transfer or return of any property transferred or returned prior to the primary liquidation date with respect to the customer's net equity claim for such account; <E T="03">Provided,</E> That adequate security for the nonrecovery of any overpayments by the trustee is provided to the debtor's estate by the customer.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Transfers of specifically identifiable commodity contracts under section 766 of the Bankruptcy Code.</E> Any specifically identifiable commodity contract which is not required to be liquidated under § 190.02(f)(1) or § 190.03(b), and which is not otherwise liquidated, may be transferred on behalf of a customer: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That such customer must first deposit cash with the trustee in an amount equal to the amount by which the equity to be transferred to margin such contract together with any other transfers or returns of specifically identifiable property or disbursements made, or to be made, to such customer, plus a reasonable reserve in the trustee's sole discretion, exceeds the estimated aggregate of the funded balances for each class of account of such customer less the value on the date of its transfer or return of any property transferred or returned prior to the primary liquidation date with the respect to the customer's net equity claim for such account: and, <E T="03">Provided further,</E> That adequate security for the nonrecovery of any overpayments by the trustee is provided to the debtor's estate by the customer.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Distribution in kind of specifically identifiable securities.</E> If any securities of a customer would have been specifically identifiable under § 190.01(kk)(6) if that customer had had no open commodity contracts, the customer may request that the trustee purchase or otherwise obtain the largest whole number of like-kind securities, with a fair market value (inclusive of transaction costs) which does not exceed that portion of such customer's allowed net equity claim that constitutes a claim for securities, if like-kind securities can be purchased in a fair and orderly manner.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Proof of customer claim.</E> No distribution shall be made pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(3) of this section prior to receipt of a completed proof of customer claim as described in § 190.02(d).</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">No differential distributions.</E> No further disbursements may be made to customers for whom transfers have been made pursuant to § 190.06 and paragraph (d)(2) of this section, until a percentage of each net equity claim equivalent to the percentage distributed to such customers is distributed to all public customers. Partial distributions, other than the transfers referred to in § 190.06 and paragraph (d)(2) of this section, made prior to the final net equity determination date must be made pursuant to a preliminary plan of distribution approved by the court, upon notice to the parties and to all customers, which plan requires adequate security to the debtor's estate for the nonrecovery of any overpayments by the trustee and distributes an equal percentage of net equity to all public customers.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Margin payments.</E> The trustee may make margin payments on behalf of any account which do not exceed the funded balance of that account.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Bankruptcy Appendix Form 1—Operation of the Debtor's Estate—Schedule of Trustee's Duties</HD>
          <P>For the convenience of a prospective trustee, the Commission has constructed an approximate schedule of important duties which the trustee should perform during the early stages of a commodity broker bankruptcy proceeding. The schedule includes duties required by this part, subchapter IV of chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code as well as certain practical suggestions, but it is only intended to highlight the more significant duties and is not an exhaustive description of all the trustee's responsibilities. It also assumes that the commodity broker being liquidated is an FCM. Moreover, it is important to note that the operating facts in a particular bankruptcy proceeding may vary the schedule or obviate the need for any of the particular activities.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">All Cases</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Date of Order for Relief</HD>
          <P>1. Assure that the commodity broker has notified the Commission, its designated self-regulatory organization (“DSRO”) (if any), and all applicable clearing organizations of which it is a member that a petition or order for relief has been filed (§ 190.02(a)(1)).</P>
          <P>2. Attempt to effectuate the transfer of entire customer accounts wherein the commodity contracts are transferred together with the money, securities, or other property margining, guaranteeing, or securing the commodity contracts (hereinafter the “transfer”).</P>
          <P>3. Attempt to estimate shortfall of customer funds segregated pursuant to sections 4d(a) and (b) of the Act; customer funds segregated pursuant to section 4f of the Act; and the foreign futures or foreign options secured amount, as defined in § 1.3 of this chapter.</P>
          <P>a. The trustee should:</P>
          <P>i. Contact the DSRO (if any) and the clearing organizations and attempt to effectuate a transfer with such shortfall under section 764(b) of the Code; notify the Commission for assistance (§ 190.02(a)(2) and (e)(1), § 190.06(b)(2), (e), (f)(3), (g)(2), and (h)) but recognize that if there is a substantial shortfall, a transfer of such funds or amounts is highly unlikely.</P>
          <P>ii. If a transfer cannot be effectuated, liquidate all customer commodity contracts that are margined, guaranteed, or secured by funds or amounts with such shortfall, except dealer options and specifically identifiable commodity contracts which are bona fide hedging positions (as defined in § 190.01(kk)(2)) with instructions not to be liquidated. (See §§ 190.02(f) and 190.06(d)(1)). (In this connection, depending upon the size of the debtor and other complications of liquidation, the trustee should be aware of special liquidation rules, and in particular the availability under certain circumstances of book-entry liquidation (§ 190.04(d)(1)(ii)).</P>
          <P>b. If there is a small shortfall in any of the funds or amounts listed in paragraph 2, negotiate with the clearing organization to effect a transfer; notify the Commission (§§ 190.02(a)(2) and (e)(1), 190.06(b)(2), (e), (f)(3), (g)(2), and (h)).</P>

          <P>4. Whether or not a transfer has occurred, liquidate or offset open commodity contracts not eligible for transfer (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> deficit accounts) (§ 190.06(e)(1)).</P>
          <P>5. Offset all futures contracts and Cleared Swaps contracts which cannot be settled in cash and which would otherwise remain open either beyond the last day of trading (if applicable) or the first day on which notice of intent to deliver may be tendered with respect thereto, whichever occurs first; offset all long options on a physical commodity which cannot be settled in cash, have value and would be automatically exercised or would remain open beyond the last day of exercise; and offset all short options on a physical commodity which cannot be settled in cash (§ 190.02(f)(1)).</P>
          <P>6. Compute estimated funded balance for each customer commodity contract account containing open commodity contracts (§ 190.04(b)) (daily thereafter).</P>
          <P>7. Make margin calls if necessary (§ 190.02(g)(1)) (daily thereafter).</P>
          <P>8. Liquidate or offset any open commodity contact account for which a customer has failed to meet a margin call (§ 190.02(f)(1)) (daily thereafter).</P>
          <P>9. Commence liquidation or offset of specifically identifiable property described in § 190.02(f)(2)(i) (property which has lost 10% or more of value) (and as appropriate thereafter).</P>
          <P>10. Commence liquidation or offset of property described in § 190.02(f)(3) (“all other property”).</P>
          <P>11. Be aware of any contracts in delivery position and rules pertaining to such contracts (§ 190.05).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">First Calendar Day After the Entry of an Order for Relief</HD>
          <P>1. If a transfer occurred on the date of entry of the order for relief:</P>
          <P>a. Liquidate any remaining open commodity contracts, except any dealer option or specifically identifiable commodity contract [hedge] (See § 190.01(kk)(2) and § 190.02(f)(1)), and not otherwise transferred in the transfer.</P>
          <P>b. Primary liquidation date for transferred or liquidated commodity contracts (§ 190.01(ff)).</P>

          <P>2. If no transfer has yet been effected, continue attempt to negotiate transfer of open <PRTPAGE P="496"/>commodity contracts and dealer options (§ 190.02(c)(1)).</P>
          <P>3. Provide the clearing organization or Collecting Futures Commission Merchant (as such term is defined in § 22.1) with assurances to prevent liquidation of open commodity contract accounts available for transfer at the customer's instruction or liquidate all open commodity contracts except those available for transfer at a customer's instruction and dealer options.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Second Calendar Day After the Entry of an Order for Relief</HD>
          <P>If no transfer has yet been effected, request directly customer instructions regarding transfer of open commodity contracts and publish notice for customer instructions regarding the return of specifically identifiable property other than commodity contracts (§§ 190.02(b) (1) and (2)).</P>

          <P>As no customer may obtain more than his or her proportionate share of the property available to satisfy customer claims, if you instruct the trustee to return your property to you, you will be required to pay the estate, as a condition to the return of your property, an amount determined by the trustee.

          <P>3. Any warehouse receipt, bill of lading or other document of title deposited as margin which, as of (date petition was filed), was securing an open commodity contract and—can be identified in (commodity broker)'s records as being held for your account, and—is neither in bearer form nor otherwise transferable by delivery.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix B to Part 190—Special Bankruptcy Distributions</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Framework 1—Special Distribution of Customer Funds for Futures Contracts When FCM Participated in Cross-Margining</HD>
          <P>The Commission has established the following distributional convention with respect to “customer funds” (as § 1.3 of this chapter defines such term) for futures contracts held by a futures commission merchant (FCM) that participated in a cross-margining (XM) program which shall apply if participating market professionals sign an agreement that makes reference to this distributional rule and the form of such agreement has been approved by the Commission by rule, regulation or order:</P>

          <P>All customer funds for futures contracts held in respect of XM accounts, regardless of the product that customers holding such accounts are trading, are required by Commission order to be segregated separately from all other customer segregated funds. For purposes of this distributional rule, XM accounts will be deemed to be commodity interest accounts and securities held in XM accounts will be deemed to be received by the FCM to margin, guarantee or secure commodity interest contracts. The maintenance of property in an XM account will result in subordination of the claim for such property to certain non-XM customer claims and thereby will operate to cause such XM claim not to be treated as a customer claim for purposes of the Securities Investors Protection Act and the XM securities to be excluded from the securities estate. This creates subclasses of futures customer accounts, an XM account and a non-XM account (a person could hold each type of account), and results in two pools of segregated funds belonging to futures customers: An XM pool and a non-XM pool. In the event that there is a shortfall in the non-XM pool of customer class segregated funds and there is no shortfall in the XM pool of customer segregated funds, all futures customer net equity claims, whether or not they arise out of the XM subclass of accounts, will be combined and will be paid <E T="03">pro rata</E> out of the total pool of available XM and non-XM customer funds for futures contracts. In the event that there is a shortfall in the XM pool of customer segregated funds and there is no shortfall in the non-XM pool of customer segregated funds, then futures customer net equity claims arising from the XM subclass of accounts shall be satisfied first from the XM pool of customer segregated funds, and futures customer net equity claims arising from the non-XM subclass of accounts shall be satisfied first from the non-XM customer segregated funds. Furthermore, in the event that there is a shortfall in both the non-XM and XM pools of customer segregated funds: (1) If the non-XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation requirement in the non-XM pool is greater than or equal to the XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation requirement in the XM pool, all futures customer net equity claims will be paid <E T="03">pro rata;</E> and (2) if the XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation requirement in the XM pool is greater than the non-XM shortfall as a percentage of the segregation requirement of the non-XM pool, non-XM futures customer net equity claims will be paid <E T="03">pro rata</E> out of the available non-XM segregated funds, and XM futures customer net equity claims will be paid <E T="03">pro rata</E> out of the available XM segregated funds. In this way, non-XM customers will never be adversely affected by an XM shortfall.</P>
          <P>The following examples illustrate the operation of this convention. The examples assume that the FCM has two customers, one with exclusively XM accounts and one with exclusively non-XM accounts. However, the examples would apply equally if there were only one customer, with both an XM account and a non-XM account.</P>
