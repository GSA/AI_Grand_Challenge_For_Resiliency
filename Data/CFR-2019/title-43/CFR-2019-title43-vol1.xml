      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

Individuals practicing before the Department should observe the Canons of Professional Ethics of the American Bar Association and those of the Federal Bar Association, by which the Department will be guided in disciplinary matters.</P>

            <P>(a) Subparts A through I of this part contain the rules that the Department follows in processing records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552.</P>
            <P>(b) Definitions of terms used in Subparts A through I of this part are found at § 2.70.</P>
            <P>(c) Subparts A through I of this part should be read in conjunction with the text of the FOIA and the OMB Fee Guidelines.</P>

            <P>(d) The Department's FOIA Handbook and its attachments contain detailed information about Department procedures for making FOIA requests and descriptions of the types of records maintained by different Department <PRTPAGE P="11"/>bureaus or offices. This resource is available at <E T="03">https://www.doi.gov/foia/news/guidance.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(e) The Department's regulations for requests made under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, are located at subpart K of this part.</P>
            <P>(f) Part 2 does not entitle any person to any service or to the disclosure of any record that is not required under the FOIA.</P>

            <P>(g) Before you file a FOIA request, you are encouraged to review the Department's electronic FOIA libraries at <E T="03">http://www.doi.gov/foia/libraries.</E> The material you seek may be immediately available electronically at no cost.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Where should you send a FOIA request?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Department does not have a central location for submitting FOIA requests and it does not maintain a central index or database of records in its possession. Instead, the Department's records are decentralized and maintained by various bureaus and offices throughout the country.</P>
            <P>(b) To make a request for Department records, you must write directly to the bureau that you believe maintains those records.</P>

            <P>(c) Address requests to the appropriate FOIA contact in the bureau that maintains the requested records. The Department's FOIA Web site, <E T="03">https://www.doi.gov/foia</E>, lists the physical and email addresses of each bureau's FOIA Officer, along with other appropriate FOIA contacts at <E T="03">http://www.doi.gov/foia/contacts.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(d) Questions about where to send a FOIA request should be directed to the bureau that manages the underlying program or to the appropriate FOIA Public Liaison, as discussed in § 2.66 of this part.</P>
            <CITA>[77 FR 76902, Dec. 31, 2012, as amended at 81 FR 11127, Mar. 3, 2016]</CITA>

            <SECTNO>§ 2.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Does where you send your request affect its processing?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A request to a particular bureau component (for example, a request addressed to a regional or field office) will be presumed to seek only records from that particular component.</P>
            <P>(b) If you seek records from an entire bureau, submit your request to the bureau FOIA Officer. The bureau FOIA Officer will forward it to the bureau component(s) that he or she believes has or are likely to have responsive records.</P>
            <P>(c) If a request to a bureau states that it seeks records located at another specific component of the same bureau, the appropriate FOIA contact will forward the request to the other component.</P>
            <P>(d) If a request to a bureau states that it seeks records from other unspecified components within the same bureau, the appropriate FOIA contact will send the request to the Bureau FOIA Officer. He or she will forward it to the components that the bureau FOIA Officer believes have or are likely to have responsive records.</P>
            <P>(e) If your request is received by a bureau that believes it is not the appropriate bureau to process your request, the bureau that received your request will attempt to contact you (if possible, via telephone or email) to confirm that you deliberately sent your request to that bureau for processing. If you do not confirm this, the bureau will deem your request misdirected and route the misdirected request to the appropriate bureau to respond under the basic time limit outlined in § 2.17.</P>

            <P>(f) If a request to a bureau states that it seeks records from other unspecified bureaus, the bureau's FOIA Officer may forward the request to <PRTPAGE P="12"/>those bureaus which he or she believes have or are likely to have responsive records. If the bureau FOIA Officer forwards the request, they will notify you in writing and provide the name of a contact in the other bureau(s). If it does not forward the request, the bureau will return it to you, advise you to submit the request directly to the other bureaus, notify you that it cannot comply with the request, and close the request.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 2.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How should you describe the records you seek?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) You must reasonably describe the records sought. A reasonable description contains sufficient detail to enable bureau personnel familiar with the subject matter of the request to locate the records with a reasonable amount of effort.</P>
            <P>(b) You should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or types of records that you are seeking. This will assist the bureau in identifying the requested records (for example, time frames involved or specific personnel who may have the requested records). For example, whenever possible, identify:</P>
            <P>(1) The date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject of any particular records you seek;</P>
            <P>(2) The office that created the records you seek;</P>
            <P>(3) The timeframe for which you are seeking records; and</P>
            <P>(4) Any other information that will assist the bureau in locating the records.</P>
            <P>(c) The bureau's FOIA Public Liaison can assist you in formulating or reformulating a request in an effort to better identify the records you seek.</P>
            <P>(d) If the bureau determines that your request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the bureau will inform you what additional information you need to provide in order to reasonably describe the records that you seek so the requested records can be located with a reasonable amount of effort. The bureau will also notify you that it will not be able to comply with your request unless the additional information it has requested is received from you in writing within 20 workdays after the bureau has requested it and that you may appeal its determination. If you receive this type of notification, you may wish to discuss it with the bureau's designated FOIA contact or its FOIA Public Liaison (see § 2.66 of this part). If the bureau does not receive your written response containing the additional information within 20 workdays after the bureau has requested it, the bureau will presume that you are no longer interested in the records and will close the file on the request.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 2.6</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How will fee information affect the processing of your request?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Your request must explicitly state that you will pay all fees associated with processing the request, that you will pay fees up to a specified amount, and/or that you are seeking a fee waiver.</P>
            <P>(b) If the bureau anticipates that the fees for processing the request will exceed the amount you have agreed to pay, or if you did not agree in writing to pay processing fees or request a fee waiver and the bureau anticipates the processing costs will exceed $50 (see § 2.37(g) of this part) or will exceed your entitlements (see § 2.39 of this part), the bureau will notify you:</P>
            <P>(1) Of the estimated processing fees;</P>
            <P>(2) Of its need for either an advance payment (see § 2.50 of this part) or your written assurance that you will pay the anticipated fees (or fees up to a specified amount); and</P>
            <P>(3) That it will not be able to fully comply with your request unless you provide a fee waiver request and/or the requested written assurance or advance payment.</P>
            <P>(c) If the bureau does not receive a written response from you within 20 workdays after requesting the information in paragraph (b) of this section, it will presume that you are no longer interested in the records and will close the file on the request.</P>

            <P>(d) If you are seeking a fee waiver, your request must include a justification that addresses and meets the criteria in §§ 2.45 and 2.48 of this part. Failure to provide sufficient justification will result in a denial of the fee <PRTPAGE P="13"/>waiver request. If you are seeking a fee waiver, you may also indicate the amount you are willing to pay if the fee waiver is denied. This allows the bureau to process the request for records while it considers your fee waiver request. You may also inform us of why you believe your request meets one or more of the criteria for a discretionary fee waiver under § 2.56 of this part.</P>
            <P>(e) The bureau will begin processing your request only after all issues regarding fees are resolved.</P>
            <P>(f) If you are required to pay a fee and it is later determined on appeal that you were entitled to a full or partial fee waiver, you will receive an appropriate refund.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What information should you include about your fee category?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A request should indicate your fee category (that is, whether you are a commercial-use requester, news media, educational or noncommercial scientific institution, or other requester as described in §§ 2.38 and 2.39 of this part).</P>
            <P>(b) If you submit a FOIA request on behalf of another person or organization (for example, if you are an attorney submitting a request on behalf of a client), the bureau will determine the fee category by considering the underlying requester's identity and intended use of the information.</P>
            <P>(c) If your fee category is unclear, the bureau may ask you for additional information (see § 2.51 of this part).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Can you ask for records to be disclosed in a particular form or format?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Generally, you may choose the form or format of disclosure for records requested. The bureau must provide the records in the requested form or format if the bureau can readily reproduce the record in that form or format. If the bureau cannot readily reproduce the record in that form or format, it must explain why it cannot.</P>
            <P>(b) The bureau may charge you the direct costs involved in converting records to the requested format if the bureau does not normally maintain the records in that format (see § 2.44 of this part).</P>

            <SUBJECT>What if your request seeks records about another person?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) When a request seeks records about another person, you may receive greater access by submitting proof that the person either:</P>
            <P>(1) Consents to the release of the records to you (for example, a notarized authorization signed by that person); or</P>
            <P>(2) Is deceased (for example, a copy of a death certificate or an obituary).</P>
            <P>(b) The bureau can require you to supply additional information if necessary to verify that a particular person has consented to disclosure or is deceased.</P>

If you are seeking expedited processing, your request must include a justification that addresses and meets the criteria in § 2.20 of this part and includes the certification required at § 2.20(b)(2) of this part.

            <SUBJECT>What should you know about how bureaus process requests?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Except as described in §§ 2.4 and 2.13 of this part, the bureau to which the request is addressed is responsible for responding to the request and for making a reasonable effort to search for responsive records.</P>
            <P>(b) In determining which records are responsive to a request, the bureau will include only records in its possession and control on the date that it begins its search.</P>
            <P>(c) The bureau will make reasonable efforts to search for the requested records. As part of its reasonable efforts, the bureau will search paper and/or electronic records (for example, emails), as appropriate. The bureau will not search for records in an electronic form or format if these efforts would significantly interfere with the operation of the bureau's automated information system.</P>
            <P>(d) If a bureau receives a request for records in its possession that it did not create or that another bureau or a Federal agency is substantially concerned with, it may undertake consultations and/or referrals as described in § 2.13.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 2.13</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How do consultations and referrals work?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Consultations and referrals can occur within the Department or outside the Department.</P>
            <P>(1) Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section addresses consultations and referrals that occur within the Department when the bureau has responsive records.</P>
            <P>(2) Paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section address consultations and referrals that occur outside the Department when the bureau has responsive records.</P>
            <P>(3) Paragraph (h) of this section addresses what happens when the bureau has no responsive records but believes responsive records may be in the possession of a Federal agency outside the Department.</P>
            <P>(b) If a bureau (other than the Office of Inspector General) receives a request for records in its possession that another bureau created or is substantially concerned with, it will either:</P>
            <P>(1) Consult with the other bureau before deciding whether to release or withhold the records; or</P>
            <P>(2) Refer the request, along with the records, to that other bureau for direct response.</P>
            <P>(c) The bureau that originally received the request will notify you of the referral in writing. When the bureau notifies you of the referral, it will tell you whether the referral was for part or all of your request and provide the name and contact information for the other bureau.</P>
            <P>(d) If, while responding to a request, the bureau locates records that originated with another Federal agency, it usually will refer the request and any responsive records to that other agency for a release determination and direct response.</P>
            <P>(e) If the bureau refers records to another agency, it will document the referral and maintain a copy of the records that it refers and notify you of the referral in writing, unless the notification will itself disclose a sensitive, exempt fact. When the bureau notifies you of the referral, it will tell you whether the referral was for part or all of your request and provide the name and contact information for the other agency. You may treat such a response as a denial of records and file an appeal, in accordance with the procedures in § 2.59 of this part.</P>
            <P>(f) If the bureau locates records that originated with another Federal agency while responding to a request, the bureau will make the release determination itself (after consulting with the originating agency) when:</P>
            <P>(1) The record is of primary interest to the Department (for example, a record may be of primary interest to the Department if it was developed or prepared according to the Department's regulations or directives, or in response to a Departmental request);</P>
            <P>(2) The Department is in a better position than the originating agency to assess whether the record is exempt from disclosure;</P>
            <P>(3) The originating agency is not subject to the FOIA; or</P>

            <P>(4) It is more efficient or practical depending on the circumstances.<PRTPAGE P="15"/>
            </P>
            <P>(g) If the bureau receives a request for records that another Federal agency has classified under any applicable executive order concerning record classification, it must refer the request to that agency for response.</P>
            <P>(h) If the bureau receives a request for records not in its possession, but that the bureau believes may be in the possession of a Federal agency outside the Department, the bureau will return the request to you, may advise you to submit it directly to the agency, will notify you that the bureau cannot comply with the request, and will close the request. If you believe this response was in error, you may file an appeal in accordance with the procedures in § 2.59.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What is multitrack processing and how does it affect your request?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Bureaus use processing tracks to distinguish simple requests from more complex ones on the basis of the estimated number of workdays needed to process the request.</P>
            <P>(b) In determining the number of workdays needed to process the request, the bureau considers factors such as the number of pages involved in processing the request or the need for consultations.</P>
            <P>(c) The basic processing tracks are designated as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) Simple: requests in this track will take between one to five workdays to process;</P>
            <P>(2) Normal: requests in this track will take between six to twenty workdays to process;</P>
            <P>(3) Complex: requests in this track will take between twenty-one workdays and sixty workdays to process; or</P>
            <P>(4) Exceptional/Voluminous: requests in this track involve very complex processing challenges, which may include a large number of potentially responsive records, and will take over sixty workdays to process.</P>
            <P>(d) Bureaus also have a specific processing track for requests that are granted expedited processing under the standards in § 2.20 of this part. These requests will be processed as soon as practicable.</P>
            <P>(e) Bureaus must advise you of the track into which your request falls and, when appropriate, will offer you an opportunity to narrow your request so that it can be placed in a different processing track. If you request placement in a particular processing track but the bureau places you in a different processing track, the bureau will provide you with an explanation of why you were not placed in the processing track you requested.</P>
            <P>(f) The use of multitrack processing does not alter the statutory deadline for a bureau to determine whether to comply with your FOIA request (see § 2.16 of this part).</P>

            <P>(b) The basic time limit in § 2.16 may also repeatedly be temporarily suspended for the time it takes you to respond to written communications from the bureau that are necessary to clarify issues regarding fee assessment (see § 2.51 of this part).</P>

            <P>(1) The unusual circumstances involved; and</P>
            <P>(2) The date by which it expects to complete processing the request.</P>
            <P>(b) If the processing time will extend beyond a total of 30 workdays, the bureau will:</P>

            <P>(2) Make available its FOIA Public Liaison (see § 2.66 of this part) to assist in resolving any disputes between you and the bureau, and notify you of your right to seek dispute resolution from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS).</P>
            <P>(c) If the bureau extends the time limit under this section and you do not receive a response in accordance with § 2.16(a) in that time period, you may consider the request denied and file an appeal in accordance with the procedures in § 2.59.</P>
            <P>(d) Your refusal to reasonably modify the scope of a request or arrange an alternative time frame for processing a request after being given the opportunity to do so may be considered for litigation purposes as a factor when determining whether exceptional circumstances exist.</P>

            <SUBJECT>When will expedited processing be provided and how will it affect your request?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The bureau will provide expedited processing upon request if you demonstrate to the satisfaction of the bureau that there is a compelling need for the records. The following circumstances demonstrate a compelling need:</P>
            <P>(1) Where failure to expedite the request could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</P>
            <P>(2) Where there is an urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity and the request is made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information.</P>
            <P>(i) In most situations, a person primarily engaged in disseminating information will be a representative of the news media.</P>
            <P>(ii) If you are not a full time member of the news media, to qualify for expedited processing here, you must establish that your main professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, although it need not be your sole occupation.</P>
            <P>(iii) The requested information must be the type of information which has particular value that will be lost if not disseminated quickly; this ordinarily refers to a breaking news story of general public interest.</P>
            <P>(iv) Information of historical interest only or information sought for litigation or commercial activities would not qualify, nor would a news media deadline unrelated to breaking news.</P>
            <P>(b) If you seek expedited processing, you must submit a statement that:</P>
            <P>(1) Explains in detail how your request meets one or both of the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(2) Certifies that your explanation is true and correct to the best of your knowledge and belief.</P>

            <P>(c) You may ask for expedited processing of your request by writing to the <PRTPAGE P="17"/>appropriate FOIA contact in the bureau that maintains the records requested any time before the bureau issues its final response to your request. When making a request for expedited processing of an administrative appeal, submit the request to the appropriate deciding official for FOIA appeals.</P>
            <P>(d) The bureau must notify you of its decision to grant or deny expedited processing within 10 calendar days of receiving an expedited processing request.</P>
            <P>(e) If expedited processing is granted, the request will be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and be processed as soon as practicable.</P>
            <P>(f) If expedited processing is denied, the bureau will:</P>
            <P>(1) Inform you of the basis for the denial, including an explanation of why the expedited processing request does not meet the Department's expedited processing criteria under this section; and</P>
            <P>(2) Notify you of the right to appeal the decision on expedited processing in accordance with the procedures in subpart H of this part.</P>
            <P>(g) If you appeal the bureau's expedited processing decision, that portion of your appeal (if it is properly formatted under § 2.59 of this part) will be processed before appeals that do not challenge expedited processing decisions.</P>
            <P>(h) If the bureau has not responded to the request for expedited processing within 10 calendar days, you may file an appeal (for nonresponse in accordance with § 2.57(a)(8) of this part).</P>

            <P>(1) The requested information has been designated by the submitter as confidential information under § 2.26(a) of this subpart; or</P>
            <P>(2) The requested information has not been designated as confidential information by the submitter under § 2.26(a) of this subpart, but the bureau identifies it as possibly confidential information.</P>

            <P>(b) If a voluminous number of submitters are involved, the bureau may publish a notice in a manner reasonably calculated to reach the attention of the submitters (for example, in newspapers or newsletters, the bureau's Web site, or the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>) instead of providing a written notice to each submitter.</P>

            <P>A notice to a submitter must include:</P>
            <P>(a) Either a copy of the request, the exact language of the request, or (for notices published under § 2.27(b) of this subpart) a general description of the request;</P>

            <P>(e) Notice that information contained in the submitter's objections may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA;</P>

            <P>(1) Whether the submitter provided the information voluntarily and, if so, how disclosure will impair the Government's ability to obtain similar information in the future and/or how the information fits into a category of information that the submitter does not customarily release to the public;</P>
            <P>(2) Whether the Government required the information to be submitted, and if so, how disclosure will impair the Government's ability to obtain similar information in the future and/or how substantial competitive or other business harm would likely result from disclosure; and</P>
            <P>(3) A certification that the information is confidential, has not been disclosed to the public by the submitter, and is not routinely available to the public from other sources.</P>
            <P>(b) If not already provided, the submitter must include a daytime telephone number, an email and mailing address, and a fax number (if available).</P>

            <SUBJECT>What general principles govern fees?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The bureau will charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with this subpart and with the OMB Fee Guidelines.</P>
            <P>(b) The bureau may contact you for additional information to resolve fee issues.</P>
            <P>(c) The bureau ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to you.</P>
            <P>(d) You may usually pay fees by check, certified check, or money order made payable to the “Department of the Interior” or the bureau.</P>
            <P>(1) Where appropriate, the bureau may require that your payment be made in the form of a certified check.</P>
            <P>(2) You may also be able to pay your fees by credit card. You may contact the bureau to determine what forms of payment it accepts.</P>
            <P>(e) The bureau should ensure that it conducts searches, review, and duplication in the most efficient and the least expensive manner so as to minimize costs for both you and the bureau.</P>
            <P>(f) If the bureau does not comply with any time limit in the FOIA:</P>
            <P>(1) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the bureau cannot assess any search fees (or, if you are in the fee category of a representative of the news media or an educational and noncommercial scientific institution, duplication fees).</P>
            <P>(2)(i) If the bureau has determined that unusual circumstances apply (as the term is defined in § 2.70) and the bureau provided you a timely written notice to extend the basic time limit in accordance with § 2.19, the noncompliance is excused for an additional 10 workdays.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the bureau has determined that unusual circumstances apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the noncompliance is excused if the bureau has provided you a timely written notice in accordance with § 2.19 and has discussed with you via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than 3 good-faith attempts to do so) how you could effectively limit the scope of the request.</P>
            <P>(iii) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist (as that term is defined in § 2.70), the noncompliance is excused for the length of time provided by the court order.</P>
            <P>(g) If the fee for processing your request is less than $50, you will not be charged unless multiple requests are aggregated under § 2.54 of this subpart to an amount that is $50 or more.</P>
            <P>(h) If you fail to pay any FOIA-related fee within 30 calendar days of the date of billing, the processing of any new or ongoing requests and/or appeals from you shall ordinarily be suspended.</P>
            <P>(i) If you would like to reformulate your request so it will meet your needs at a lower cost, you may wish to seek assistance from the bureau's designated FOIA contact or its FOIA Public Liaison (see § 2.66 of this part).</P>

            <SUBJECT>What are the requester fee categories?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) There are four categories of requesters for the purposes of determining fees—commercial-use, educational and noncommercial scientific institutions, representatives of news media, and all others.</P>
            <P>(b) The bureau's decision to place you in a particular fee category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on your intended use of the information and, in most cases, your identity. If you do not submit sufficient information in your FOIA request for the bureau to determine your proper fee category, the bureau may ask you to provide additional information (see § 2.51 of this subpart). If you request placement in a particular fee category but the bureau places you in a different fee category, the bureau will provide you with an explanation of why you were not placed in the fee category you requested (for example, if you were placed in the commercial use requester category rather than the category you requested, the bureau will describe how the records would further your commercial, trade, or profit interests).</P>
            <P>(c) See § 2.70 of this part for the definitions of each of these fee categories.</P>

            <P>(b) Examples of these services include providing multiple copies of the same record, converting records that are not already maintained in a requested format to the requested format, obtaining research data under § 2.69 of this part, sending records by means other than first class mail, and conducting a search that requires the creation of a new computer search program to locate the requested records.</P>

            <P>(1) In the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or activities, and</P>
            <P>(2) Not primarily in your commercial interest.</P>
            <P>(b) A partial fee waiver may be appropriate if some but not all of the requested records are likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government.</P>
            <P>(c) When deciding whether to waive or reduce fees, the bureau will rely on the fee waiver justification submitted in your request letter.

            <P>(d) The burden is on you to justify entitlement to a fee waiver. Requests for fee waivers are decided on a case-by-case basis under the criteria discussed above in paragraph (a) of this section and § 2.48 of this subpart.

            <P>(f) The bureau must not make value judgments about whether the information at issue is “important” enough to be made public; it is not the bureau's role to attempt to determine the level of public interest in requested information.</P>

            <P>(a) In deciding whether your fee waiver request meets the requirements of § 2.45(a)(1) of this subpart, the bureau will consider the criteria listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section. You must address and meet each of these criteria in order to demonstrate that you are entitled to a fee waiver.</P>
            <P>(1) How the records concern the operations or activities of the Federal government.</P>
            <P>(2) How disclosure is likely to contribute to public understanding of those operations or activities, including:</P>
            <P>(i) How the contents of the records are meaningfully informative;</P>
            <P>(ii) The logical connection between the content of the records and the operations or activities;</P>

            <P>(iv) Your identity, vocation, qualifications, and expertise regarding the requested information and information that explains how you plan to disclose the information in a manner that will be informative to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to your individual understanding</P>
            <P>(v) Your ability and intent to disseminate the information to a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject (for example, how and to whom do you intend to disseminate the information). If we have categorized you as a representative of the news media under § 2.38, we will presume you have this ability and intent.</P>
            <P>(3) How disclosure is likely to significantly contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to your individual understanding, including:</P>
            <P>(i) Whether the information being requested is new;</P>
            <P>(ii) Whether the information would confirm or clarify data that has been released previously;</P>

            <P>(iii) How disclosure will increase the level of public understanding of the operations or activities of the Department or a bureau that existed prior to disclosure; and<PRTPAGE P="25"/>
            </P>
            <P>(iv) Whether the information is already publicly available. If the Government previously has published the information you are seeking or it is routinely available to the public in a library, reading room, through the Internet, or as part of the administrative record for a particular issue, it is less likely that there will be a significant contribution from release.</P>
            <P>(4) How the public's understanding of the subject in question will be enhanced to a significant extent by the disclosure.</P>
            <P>(b) In deciding whether the fee waiver meets the requirements in § 2.45(a)(2) of this subpart, the bureau will consider any commercial interest of yours that would be furthered by the requested disclosure.</P>
            <P>(1) You are encouraged to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.</P>
            <P>(2) The bureau will not find that disclosing the requested information will be primarily in your commercial interest where the public interest is greater than any identified commercial interest in disclosure.</P>
            <P>(3) If you do have a commercial interest that would be furthered by disclosure, explain how the public interest in disclosure would be greater than any commercial interest you or your organization may have in the documents.</P>
            <P>(i) Your identity, vocation, and intended use of the requested records are all factors to be considered in determining whether disclosure would be primarily in your commercial interest.</P>
            <P>(ii) If you are a representative of a news media organization seeking information as part of the news gathering process, we will presume that the public interest outweighs your commercial interest.</P>
            <P>(iii) If you represent a business/corporation/association or you are an attorney representing such an organization, we will presume that your commercial interest outweighs the public interest unless you demonstrate otherwise.</P>

            <P>(1) You have never made a FOIA request to the Department requiring the payment of fees; or</P>
            <P>(2) You did not pay a previous FOIA fee within 30 calendar days of the date of billing.</P>
            <P>(b) If the bureau believes that you did not pay a previous FOIA fee within 30 calendar days of the date of billing, the bureau will require you to either:</P>
            <P>(1) Demonstrate you paid prior fee within 30 calendar days of the date of billing; or</P>
            <P>(2) Pay any unpaid amount of the previous fee, plus any applicable interest penalties (see § 2.53 of this subpart), and pay in advance the estimated fee for the new request.</P>
            <P>(c) When the bureau notifies you that an advance payment is due under paragraph (a) of this section, it will give you an opportunity to reduce the fee by modifying the request.</P>
            <P>(d) Your payment of the funds you owe the bureau for work it has already completed before records are sent to you is not an advance payment under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) If the bureau requires advance payment, it will start further work only after receiving the advance payment. It will also notify you that it will not be able to comply with your FOIA request unless you provide the advance payment. Unless you pay the advance payment within 20 workdays after the date of the bureau's fee letter, the bureau will presume that you are no longer interested and will close the file on the request.</P>

            <P>(a) If your FOIA request does not contain sufficient information for the bureau to determine your proper fee category or leaves another fee issue unclear, the bureau may ask you to provide additional clarification. If it does so, the bureau will notify you that it will not be able to comply with your FOIA request unless you provide the clarification requested.</P>

            <P>(a) If you request research data that were used by the Federal Government in developing certain kinds of agency actions, and the research data relate to published research findings produced under an award, in accordance with OMB Circular A-110:</P>
            <P>(1) If the bureau was the awarding agency, it will request the research data from the recipient;</P>

            <P>(2) This fee is in addition to any fees the agency may assess under the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(c) The bureau will forward a copy of the request to the recipient, who is responsible for searching for and reviewing the requested information in accordance with these FOIA regulations.

These examples are not all inclusive. As methods of news delivery evolve, alternative representatives of news media may come into being. A freelance journalist will qualify as a news-media entity if he or she can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that entity, whether or not the journalist is actually employed by that entity (for example, a publication contract would present a solid basis for such an expectation).</P>

Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential information submitter under subpart G of this part, but it excludes time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of FOIA exemptions.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Search</E> means the process of looking for and retrieving records responsive to a request. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records; and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve electronic records.</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">Workday</E> means a regular Federal workday. It excludes Saturdays, Sundays, or Federal legal public holidays. Items arriving or delivered after 5 p.m. Eastern Time will be deemed received on the next workday.</P>

He shall also be advised that if he desires he may appeal the determination to the Chairman, Department of the Interior Oversight Committee for Security, U.S. Department of the Interior, Washington, DC 20240.

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Standards of accuracy.</E> Records subject to the Act which are used in making any determination about any individual shall be maintained with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in making the determination.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Collection of information.</E> (1) Information which may be used in making determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs shall, to the greatest extent practicable, be collected directly from that individual.<PRTPAGE P="36"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) In deciding whether collection of information from an individual, as opposed to a third party source, is practicable, the following factors, among others, may be considered:</P>
            <P>(i) Whether the nature of the information sought is such that it can only be obtained from a third party;</P>
            <P>(ii) Whether the cost of collecting the information from the individual is unreasonable when compared with the cost of collecting it from a third party;</P>
            <P>(iii) Whether there is a risk that information collected from third parties, if inaccurate, could result in an adverse determination to the individual concerned;</P>
            <P>(iv) Whether the information, if supplied by the individual, would have to be verified by a third party; or</P>

            <P>(i) The authority (whether granted by statute or Executive Order of the President) which authorizes the solicitation of the information and whether disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary;</P>
            <P>(ii) The principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used;</P>
            <P>(iii) The routine uses which may be made of the information; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The effects on the individual, if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information.</P>
            <P>(3)(i) When information is collected on a standard form, the notice to the individual shall be provided on the form, on a tear-off sheet attached to the form, or on a separate sheet, whichever is most practical.</P>
            <P>(ii) When information is collected by an interviewer, the interviewer shall provide the individual with a written notice which the individual may retain. If the interview is conducted by telephone, however, the interviewer may summarize the notice for the individual and need not provide a copy to the individual unless the individual requests a copy.</P>
            <P>(iii) An individual may be asked to acknowledge, in writing, that the notice required by this section has been provided.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Records concerning activity protected by the First Amendment.</E> No record may be maintained describing how any individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution unless the maintenance of the record is (1) expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained or (2) pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Records maintained in manual form.</E> When maintained in manual form, records subject to the Privacy Act shall be maintained in a manner commensurate with the sensitivity of the information contained in the system of records.

For the purposes of this paragraph, a master key is a key which may be used to open rooms other than the room containing records subject to the Privacy Act, unless those rooms are utilized by officials or employees authorized to have access to the records subject to the Privacy Act.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Records maintained in computerized form.</E> When maintained in computerized form, records subject to the Privacy Act shall be maintained, at a minimum, subject to safeguards based on those recommended in the National Bureau of Standard's booklet “Computer Security Guidelines for Implementing the Privacy Act of 1974” (May 30, 1975), and any supplements thereto, which are adequate and appropriate to assuring the integrity of records in the system.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Office of Personnel Management personnel records.</E> A system of records made up of Office of Personnel Management personnel records shall be maintained under the security requirements set out in 5 CFR 293.106 and 293.107.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Bureau responsibility.</E> (1) The bureau responsible for a system of records shall be responsible for assuring that specific procedures are developed to assure that the records in the system are maintained with security meeting the requirements of the Act and this section.</P>

              <P>(5) Employees who voluntarily testify, while on their own time or in approved leave status, as private citizens as to facts or events that are not related to the official business of the Department. The employee must state for the record that the testimony represents the employee's own views and is not necessarily the official position of the Department. <E T="03">See</E> 5 CFR §§ 2635.702(b), 2635.807 (b).</P>
              <P>(6) Testimony by employees as expert witnesses on subjects outside their official duties, except that they must obtain prior approval if required by § 2.90.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Scope of authority; applicable regulations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The Office of Hearings and Appeals, headed by a Director, is an authorized representative of the Secretary for the purpose of hearing, considering, and deciding matters within the jurisdiction of the Department involving hearings, appeals, and other review functions of the Secretary. The Office may hear, consider, and decide those matters as fully and finally as might the Secretary, subject to any limitations on its authority imposed by the Secretary. Principal components of the Office include:</P>
            <P>(a) One or more Hearings Divisions consisting of administrative law judges who are authorized to conduct hearings in cases required by law to be conducted under 5 U.S.C. 554, and other deciding officials who are authorized to conduct hearings in cases arising under statutes and regulations of the Department; and</P>
            <P>(b) Appeals Boards, shown below, with administrative jurisdiction and special procedural rules as indicated. General rules applicable to all types of proceedings are set forth in subpart B of this part. Therefore, for information as to applicable rules, reference should be made to the special rules in the subpart relating to the particular type of proceeding, as indicated, and to the general rules in subpart B of this part. Wherever there is any conflict between one of the general rules in subpart B of this part and a special rule in another subpart applicable to a particular type of proceeding, the special rule will govern. Reference should be made also to the governing laws, substantive regulations and policies of the Department relating to the proceeding. In addition, reference should be made to part 1 of this subtitle which regulates practice before the Department of the Interior.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Board of Indian Appeals.</E> The Board decides finally for the Department appeals to the head of the Department pertaining to:</P>
            <P>(i) Administrative actions of officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, issued under 25 CFR chapter I, except as limited in 25 CFR chapter I or § 4.330 of this part, and</P>

            <P>(ii) Decisions and orders of administrative law judges and Indian probate judges in Indian probate matters, other than those involving estates of the Five Civilized Tribes of Indians. The Board also decides such other matters pertaining to Indians as are referred to it by the Secretary, the Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, or the Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs for exercise of review authority of the Secretary. Special regulations applicable <PRTPAGE P="60"/>to proceedings before the Board are contained in subpart D of this part.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Board of Land Appeals.</E> The Board decides finally for the Department appeals to the head of the Department from decisions rendered by Departmental officials relating to: (i) The use and disposition of public lands and their resources, including land selections arising under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, as amended; (ii) the use and disposition of mineral resources in certain acquired lands of the United States and in the submerged lands of the Outer Continental Shelf; and (iii) the conduct of surface coal mining under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. Special procedures for hearings, appeals and contests in public land cases are contained in subpart E of this part; special procedures for hearings and appeals under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 are contained in subpart L of this part.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Ad Hoc Board of Appeals.</E> Appeals to the head of the Department which do not lie within the appellate review jurisdiction of an established Appeals Board and which are not specifically excepted in the general delegation of authority to the Director may be considered and ruled upon by the Director or by Ad Hoc Boards of Appeals appointed by the Director to consider the particular appeals and to issue decisions thereon, deciding finally for the Department all questions of fact and law necessary for the complete adjudication of the issues. Jurisdiction of the Boards would include, but not be limited to, the appellate and review authority of the Secretary referred to in parts 13, 21, and 230 of this title, and in 36 CFR parts 8 and 20. Special regulations applicable to proceedings in such cases are contained in subpart G of this part.</P>

The concurrence of a majority of the Board Administrative Judges who consider an appeal shall be sufficient for a decision.</P>
            <P>(b) Decisions of the Board must be in writing and signed by not less than a majority of the Administrative Judges who considered the appeal. The Director, being an ex officio member, may participate in the consideration of any appeal and sign the resulting decision.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Effect of decision pending appeal.</E> Except as otherwise provided by law or other pertinent regulation:</P>
            <P>(1) A decision will not be effective during the time in which a person adversely affected may file a notice of appeal; when the public interest requires, however, the Director or an Appeals Board may provide that a decision, or any part of a decision, shall be in full force and effective immediately;</P>
            <P>(2) A decision will become effective on the day after the expiration of the time during which a person adversely affected may file a notice of appeal unless a petition for a stay pending appeal is filed together with a timely notice of appeal; a petition for a stay may be filed only by a party who may properly maintain an appeal;</P>

            <P>(3) A decision, or that portion of a decision, for which a stay is not granted will become effective immediately after the Director or an Appeals Board denies or partially denies the petition for a stay, or fails to act on the petition within the time specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="62"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Standards and procedures for obtaining a stay.</E> Except as otherwise provided by law or other pertinent regulation:</P>
            <P>(1) A petition for a stay of a decision pending appeal shall show sufficient justification based on the following standards:</P>
            <P>(i) The relative harm to the parties if the stay is granted or denied,</P>
            <P>(ii) The likelihood of the appellant's success on the merits,</P>
            <P>(iii) The likelihood of immediate and irreparable harm if the stay is not granted, and</P>
            <P>(iv) Whether the public interest favors granting the stay;</P>
            <P>(2) The appellant requesting the stay bears the burden of proof to demonstrate that a stay should be granted;</P>
            <P>(3) The appellant shall serve a copy of its notice of appeal and petition for a stay on each party named in the decision from which the appeal is taken, and on the Director or the Appeals Board to which the appeal is taken, at the same time such documents are served on the appropriate officer of the Department; any party, including the officer who made the decision being appealed, may file a response to the stay petition within 10 days after service; failure to file a response shall not result in a default on the question of whether a stay should be granted; service shall be made by delivering copies personally or by sending them by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested; and</P>
            <P>(4) The Director or an Appeals Board shall grant or deny a petition for a stay pending appeal, either in whole or in part, on the basis of the factors listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, within 45 calendar days of the expiration of the time for filing a notice of appeal.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Exhaustion of administrative remedies.</E> No decision which at the time of its rendition is subject to appeal to the Director or an Appeals Board shall be considered final so as to be agency action subject to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 704, unless a petition for a stay of decision has been timely filed and the decision being appealed has been made effective in the manner provided in paragraphs (a)(3) or (b)(4) of this section or a decision has been made effective pending appeal pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section or pursuant to other pertinent regulation.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Finality of decision.</E> No further appeal will lie in the Department from a decision of the Director or an Appeals Board of the Office of Hearings and Appeals. Unless otherwise provided by regulation, reconsideration of a decision may be granted only in extraordinary circumstances where, in the judgment of the Director or an Appeals Board, sufficient reason appears therefor. Requests for reconsideration must be filed promptly, or within the time required by the regulations relating to the particular type of proceeding concerned, and must state with particularity the error claimed. The filing and pendency of a request for reconsideration shall not operate to stay the effectiveness of the decision involved unless so ordered by the Director or an Appeals Board. A request for reconsideration need not be filed to exhaust administrative remedies.</P>

In all cases where a party is represented by an attorney, such attorney will be recognized as fully controlling the case on behalf of his/her client, and service of any document relating to the proceeding shall be made upon such attorney in addition to any other service specifically required by law or by order of a presiding official or an appeals board. Where a party is represented by more than one attorney, service upon one of the attorneys shall be sufficient.<PRTPAGE P="63"/>

When a decision has become final, an appeals board in its discretion may, upon request and after notice to the other party or parties, permit the withdrawal of original exhibits or any part thereof by the party entitled thereto. The substitution of true copies of exhibits or any part thereof may be required by the Board in its discretion as a condition of granting permission for such withdrawal. Transcripts of testimony and/or documents received or reviewed pursuant to § 4.31 of these rules shall be sealed against disclosure to unauthorized persons and retained with the official record, subject to the withdrawal and substitution provisions hereof.</P>

The successors of such person shall likewise promptly inform such office of their interest in the matters and state their addresses. If a person fails to furnish a record address as required herein, he will not be entitled to notice in connection with the proceedings.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Computation of time for filing and service.</E> Except as otherwise provided by law, in computing any period of time prescribed for filing and serving a document, the day upon which the decision or document to be appealed from or answered was served or the day of any other event after which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included. The last day of the period so computed is to be included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, Federal legal holiday, or other nonbusiness day, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, Federal legal holiday, or other nonbusiness day. When the time prescribed or allowed is 7 days or less, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, Federal legal holidays and other nonbusiness days shall be excluded in the computation.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Extensions of time.</E> (1) The time for filing or serving any document may be extended by the Appeals Board or other officer before whom the proceeding is pending, except for the time for filing a notice of appeal and except where such extension is contrary to law or regulation.</P>
            <P>(2) A request for an extension of time must be filed within the time allowed for the filing or serving of the document and must be filed in the same office in which the document in connection with which the extension is requested must be filed.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Application for subpoena.</E> Where the file has not yet been transmitted to the administrative law judge, the application for a subpoena may be filed in the office of the officer who made the decision appealed from, or in the office of the Bureau of Land Management in which the complaint was filed, in which cases such offices will forward the application to the examiner.</P>

This paragraph does not apply to Government employees who are called as witnesses by the Government.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Inquiries.</E> All inquiries with respect to any matter pending before the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall be directed to the Director, the Chief Administrative Law Judge, or the Chairman of the appropriate Board.</P>

Proceedings include cases pending before the Office, rulemakings amending this Part 4 that might affect a pending case, requests for reconsideration or review by the Director, and any other related action pending before the Office. The terms “interested person” and “person interested in the proceeding” include any individual or other person with an interest in the agency proceeding that is <PRTPAGE P="65"/>greater than the interest that the public as a whole may have. This regulation does not prohibit communications concerning case status or advice concerning compliance with procedural requirements unless the area of inquiry is in fact an area of controversy in the proceeding. Any oral communication made in violation of this regulation shall be reduced to writing in a memorandum to the file by the person receiving the communication and shall be included in the record. Any written communication made in violation of this regulation shall be included in the record. In proceedings other than informal rulemakings copies of the memorandum or communication shall be provided to all parties, who shall be given an opportunity to respond in writing.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Sanctions.</E> The administrative law judge, board, or Director who has responsibility for the matter with respect to which a prohibited communication has been knowingly made may impose appropriate sanctions on the offending person or persons, which may include requiring an offending party to show cause why its claim, motion, or interest should not be dismissed, denied, or otherwise adversely affected; disciplining offending Office personnel pursuant to the Department's standards of conduct (43 CFR part 20); and invoking such sanctions against other offending persons as may be appropriate under the circumstances.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Disqualification.</E> (1) An Office of Hearings and Appeals deciding official must withdraw from a case if circumstances exist that would disqualify a judge in such circumstances under the recognized canons of judicial ethics.</P>
            <P>(2) A party may file a motion seeking the disqualification of a deciding official, setting forth in detail the circumstances that the party believes require disqualification. Any supporting facts must be established by affidavit or other sufficient evidence. A copy of the motion should be sent to the Director.</P>
            <P>(3) The head of the appropriate unit within the Office or the Director may decide whether disqualification is required if the deciding official does not withdraw under paragraph (c)(1) of this section or in response to a motion under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(4) For purposes of this section, “deciding official” includes an attorney decision maker or Indian probate judge as defined in § 4.201, an administrative law judge, an administrative judge, or a member of any Board.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Request for limiting disclosure of confidential information.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) If any person submitting a document in a proceeding under this part <PRTPAGE P="66"/>claims that some or all of the information contained in that document is exempt from the mandatory public disclosure requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), is information referred to in section 1905 of title 18 of the United States Code (disclosure of confidential information), or is otherwise exempt by law from public disclosure, the person:</P>
            <P>(1) Must indicate in the document that it is exempt, or contains information which is exempt, from disclosure;</P>
            <P>(2) Must request the presiding officer or appeals board not to disclose such information except to the parties to the proceeding under the conditions provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and must serve the request upon the parties to the proceeding. The request shall include the following items:</P>
            <P>(i) A copy of the document from which has been deleted the information for which the person requests nondisclosure; if it is not practicable to submit such copy of the document because deletion of the information would render the document unintelligible, a description of the document may be substituted;</P>
            <P>(ii) A statement specifying why the information is confidential, if the information for which nondisclosure is requested is claimed to come within the exception in 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) for trade secrets and commercial or financial information:</P>
            <P>(iii) A statement specifying the justification for nondisclosure, if the information for which nondisclosure is requested is not within the exception in 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).</P>
            <P>(b) If information is submitted in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the information will not be disclosed except as provided in the Freedom of Information Act, in accordance with part 2 of this title, or upon request from a party to the proceeding under the restrictions stated in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) At any time, a party may request the presiding officer or appeals board to direct a person submitting information under paragraph (a) of this section to provide that information to the party. The presiding officer or board will so direct, unless paragraph (d) of this section is applicable, if the party requesting the information agrees under oath in writing:</P>
            <P>(1) Not to use or disclose the information except in the context of the proceeding conducted pursuant to this part; and</P>
            <P>(2) To return all copies of the information at the conclusion of the proceeding to the person submitting the information under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) If any person submitting a document in a proceeding under this Part other than a hearing conducted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 554 claims that a disclosure of information in that document to another party to the proceeding is prohibited by law, notwithstanding the protection provided under paragraph (c) of this section, such person:</P>
            <P>(1) Must indicate in the original document that it contains information of which disclosure is prohibited;</P>
            <P>(2) Must request that the presiding officer or appeals board review such evidence as a basis for its decision without disclosing it to the other party or parties, and serve the request upon the parties to the proceeding. The request shall include a copy of the document or description as required by paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section and state why disclosure is prohibited, citing pertinent statutory or regulatory authority. If the prohibition on disclosure is intended to protect the interest of a person who is not a party to the proceeding, the party making the request must demonstrate that such person refused to consent to the disclosure of the evidence to other parties to the proceeding.</P>
            <P>(3) If the presiding officer or an appeals board denies the request, the person who made the request shall be given an opportunity to withdraw the evidence before it is considered by the presiding official or board unless a Freedom of Information Act request, administrative appeal from the denial of a request, or lawsuit seeking release of the information is pending.</P>

            <P>(e) If the person submitting a document does not submit the copy of the document or description required by paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (d)(2) of this section, the presiding officer or appeals <PRTPAGE P="67"/>board may assume that there is no objection to public disclosure of the document in its entirety.</P>
            <P>(f) Where a decision by a presiding officer or appeals board is based in whole or in part on evidence not included in the public record or disclosed to all parties, the decision shall so state, specifying the nature of the evidence and the provision of law under which disclosure was denied, and the evidence so considered shall be retained under seal as part of the official record.</P>

              <P>(c) Where the Bureau or Office provided an opportunity for participation in its decisionmaking process, a party to the case, as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, may raise on appeal only those issues:</P>

A request for a postponement must be served upon all parties to the proceeding and filed in the office of the administrative law judge at least 10 days prior to the date of the hearing. In no case will a request for postponement served or filed less than 10 days in advance of the hearing or made at the hearing be granted unless the party requesting it demonstrates that an extreme emergency occurred which could not have been anticipated and which justifies beyond question the granting of a postponement. In any such emergency, if time does not permit the filing of such request prior to the hearing, it may be made orally at the hearing.</P>

If a request is based upon the absence of witnesses, it must state what the substance of the testimony of the absent witnesses would be. No postponement will be granted if the adverse party or parties file with the examiner within 5 days after the service of the request a statement admitting that the witnesses on account of whose absence the postponement is desired would, if present, testify as stated in the request. If time does not permit the filing of such statement prior to the hearing, it may be made orally at the hearing.</P>
              <P>(c) Only one postponement will be allowed to a party on account of the absence of witnesses unless the party requesting a further postponement shall at the time apply for an order to take the testimony of the alleged absent witness by deposition.</P>

              <P>(a) Postponements of hearings will not be allowed upon the request of any party or the Bureau except upon a showing of good cause and proper diligence. A request for a postponement must be served upon all parties to the proceeding and filed in the office of the administrative law judge at least 10 days prior to the date of the hearing. In no case will a request for postponement served or filed less than 10 days in advance of the hearing or made at the hearing be granted unless the party requesting it demonstrates that an extreme emergency occurred which could not have been anticipated and which justifies beyond question the granting of a postponement. In any such emergency, if time does not permit the filing of such request prior to the hearing, it may be made orally at the hearing.</P>
              <P>(b) The request for a postponement must state in detail the reasons why a postponement is necessary. If a request is based upon the absence of witnesses, it must state what the substance of the testimony of the absent witnesses would be. No postponement will be granted if the adverse party or parties file with the administrative law judge within 5 days after the service of the request a statement admitting that the witnesses on account of whose absence the postponement is desired would, if present, testify as stated in the request. If time does not permit the filing of such statement prior to the hearing, it may be made orally at the hearing.</P>
              <P>(c) Only one postponement will be allowed to a party on account of the absence of witnesses unless the party requesting a further postponement shall at the time apply for an order to take the testimony of the alleged absent witness by deposition.</P>

Documentary evidence may be received <PRTPAGE P="94"/>if pertinent to any issue. The administrative law judge will summarily stop examination and exclude testimony which is obviously irrelevant and immaterial.</P>
              <P>(b) Objections to evidence will be ruled upon by the administrative law judge. Such rulings will be considered, but need not be separately ruled upon, by the Board in connection with its decision. Where a ruling of an administrative law judge sustains an objection to the admission of evidence, the party affected may insert in the record, as a tender of proof, a summary written statement of the substance of the excluded evidence, and the objecting party may then make an offer of proof in rebuttal.</P>

              <P>(b) In the case of a private contest, each party will be required to pay the reporter's fees covering the party's direct evidence and cross-examination of witnesses, except that if the ultimate decision is adverse to the contestant, he must in addition pay all the reporter's fees otherwise payable by the contestee.</P>
              <P>(c) Each party to a private contest shall be required by the administrative law judge to make reasonable deposits for reporter's fees from time to time in advance of taking testimony. Such deposits shall be sufficient to cover all reporter's fees for which the party may ultimately be liable under paragraph (b) of this section. Any part of a deposit not used will be returned to the depositor upon the final determination of the case except that deposits which are required to be made when a complaint is filed will not be returned if the party making the deposit does not appear at the hearing, but will be used to pay the reporter's fee. Reporter's fees will be at the rates established for the local courts, or, if the reporting is done pursuant to a contract, at rates established by the contract.</P>

The administrative law judge may adopt the findings of fact and conclusions of law proposed by one or more of the parties if they are correct. He must rule upon each proposed finding and conclusion submitted by the parties and such ruling shall be shown in the record. The administrative law judge will render a written decision in the case which shall become a part of the record and shall include a statement of his findings and conclusions, as well as the reasons or basis therefor, and his rulings upon the findings and conclusions proposed by the parties if such rulings do not appear elsewhere in the record.

              <P>(a) The appellant, the State Director or his representative, and recognized intervenors will stipulate so far as possible all material facts and the issue or issues involved. The administrative law judge will state any other issues on which he may wish to have evidence presented. Issues which appear to the administrative law judge to be unnecessary to a proper disposition of the case will be excluded; but the party asserting such issue may state briefly for the record the substance of the proof which otherwise would have been offered in support of the issue. Issues not covered by the appellant's specifications of error may not be admitted except with the consent of the State Director or his representative, unless the administrative law judge rules that such issue is essential to the controversy and should be admitted. The parties will then be given an opportunity to submit offers of settlement and proposals of adjustment for the consideration of the administrative law judge and of the other parties.</P>
              <P>(b) Unless the administrative law judge orders otherwise, the State Director or his representative will then make the opening statement, setting forth the facts leading to the appeal. Upon the conclusion of the opening statement, the appellant shall present his case, consistent with his specifications of error. (In the case of a show cause, the State Director shall set forth the facts leading to the issuance of the show cause notice and shall present his case following the opening statement.) Following the appellant's presentation, or upon his failure to make such presentation, the administrative law judge, upon his own motion or upon motion of any of the parties, may order summary dismissal of the appeal with prejudice because of the inadequacy or insufficiency of the appellant's case, to be followed by a written order setting forth the reasons for the dismissal and taking such other action under this subpart as may be proper and warranted. An appeal may be had from such order as well as from any other final determination made by the administrative law judge.</P>

              <P>(c) In the absence or upon denial of such motion the State Director or his representative and recognized intervenors may present evidence if such a presentation appears to the administrative law judge to be necessary for a proper disposition of the matters in controversy, adhering as closely as possible to the issues raised by the appellant. All oral testimony shall be under oath or affirmation, and witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by any party to the proceeding. The administrative law judge may question any witness whenever it appears necessary. Documentary evidence will be received by the administrative law judge and made a part of the record, if pertinent to any issue, or may be entered by stipulation. No exception need be stated or noted and every ruling of the administrative law judge will be subject to review on appeal. The party affected by an adverse ruling sustaining an objection to the admission of evidence, may insert in the record, as a tender of proof, a brief written statement of the substance of the excluded evidence; and the opposing party may then make an offer of proof in rebuttal. The administrative law judge shall summarily stop examination and exclude testimony on any issue which he determines has been adjudicated previously in an appeal involving the same preference and the same parties or their predecessors in interest, or which is obviously irrelevant and immaterial to the issues in the case. At the conclusion of the testimony the parties at the hearing shall be given a reasonable opportunity, considering the number and complexity of the issues and the amount of testimony, to submit to the administrative law judge proposed findings of fact and <PRTPAGE P="98"/>conclusions of law, and reasons in support thereof, or to stipulate to a waiver of such findings and conclusions.</P>
              <P>(d) The reporter's fees will be borne by the Government. Each party must pay for any copies of the transcript that the party requests. The Government will file the original transcript with the case record.</P>

Under the Act, an eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over the Department or other agency, unless the position of the Department or other agency was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The regulations in this subpart describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the Office of Hearings and Appeals will use in ruling on those applications.</P>

              <P>(a) The affected applicant or recipient to whom a notice of hearing or a notice of an opportunity for hearing has been mailed in accordance with part 17 of this title and § 4.815, and the Director, are the initial parties to the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(b) Other persons or organizations shall have the right to participate as parties if the final decision could directly and adversely affect them or the class they represent, and if they may contribute materially to the disposition of the proceedings.</P>
              <P>(c) A person or organization wishing to participate as a party under this section shall submit a petition to the administrative law judge within 15 days after the notice has been served. The petition should be filed with the administrative law judge and served on the affected applicant or recipient, on the Director, and on any other person or organization who has been made a party at the time of filing. Such petition shall concisely state: (1) Petitioner's interest in the proceeding, (2) how his participation as a party will contribute materially to the disposition of the proceeding, (3) who will appear for petitioner, (4) the issues on which petitioner wishes to participate, and (5) whether petitioner intends to present witnesses.</P>
              <P>(d) The administrative law judge shall promptly ascertain whether there are objections to the petition. He shall then determine whether petitioners have the requisite interest to be a party in the proceedings, as defined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and shall permit or deny participation accordingly. Where petitions to participate as parties are made by individuals or groups with common interests, the administrative law judge may request all such petitioners to designate a single representative, or he may recognize one or more of such petitioners to represent all such petitioners. The administrative law judge shall give each such petitioner written notice of the decision on his petition. If the petition is denied, he shall briefly state the grounds for denial and shall then treat the petition as a request for participation as amicus curiae. The administrative law judge shall give written notice to each party of each petition granted.</P>
              <P>(e) Persons or organizations whose petition for party participation is denied may appeal the decision to the Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals, within 7 days of receipt of denial.

              <P>A person submitting a complaint pursuant to § 17.6 of this title is not a party to the proceedings governed by part 17 of this title and these regulations, but may petition, after proceedings are initiated, to become an amicus curiae.

              <P>(b) The administrative law judge will grant the petition if he finds that the petitioner has an interest in the proceedings and may contribute materially to the disposition of the proceedings. The administrative law judge shall give the petitioner written notice of the decision on his petition.</P>
              <P>(c) An amicus curiae is not a party and may not introduce evidence at a hearing but may only participate as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) An amicus curiae may submit a written statement of position to the administrative law judge at any time prior to the beginning of a hearing, and shall serve a copy on each party. He may also file a brief or written statement on each occasion a decision is to be made or a prior decision is subject to review. His brief or written statement shall be filed and served on each party within the time limits applicable to the party whose position he deems himself to support; or if he does not deem himself to support the position of any party, within the longest time limit applicable to any party at that particular stage of the proceedings.</P>
              <P>(e) When all parties have completed their initial examination of a witness, any amicus curiae may request the administrative law judge to propound specific questions to the witness. The administrative law judge, in his discretion, may grant any such request if he believes the proposed additional testimony may assist materially in elucidating factual matters at issue between the parties and will not expand the issues.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Depositions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A party may take the testimony of any person, including a party, by deposition upon oral examination. This may be done by stipulation or by notice, as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. On motion of any party or other person upon whom the notice is served, the administrative law judge may for cause shown enlarge or shorten the time for the deposition, change the place of the deposition, limit the scope of the deposition or quash the notice. Depositions of persons other than parties or their representatives shall be upon consent of the deponent.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The party will give reasonable notice in writing to every other party of the time and place for taking depositions, the name and address of each person to be examined, if known, or a general description sufficient to identify him or the particular class or group to which he belongs.</P>
              <P>(2) The notice to a deponent may be accompanied by a request for the production of documents and tangible things at the taking of the deposition.</P>
              <P>(3) A party may name as the deponent a corporation, partnership, association, or governmental agency and may designate a particular person within the organization whose testimony is desired and the matters on which examination is requested. If no particular person is named, the organization shall designate one or more agents to testify on its behalf, and may set forth the matters on which each will testify. The persons so designated shall testify as to matters known or reasonably available to the organization.</P>
              <P>(c) Examination and cross-examination of witnesses may proceed as permitted at the hearing. The witness shall be placed under oath by a disinterested person qualified to administer oaths by the laws of the United States or of the place where the examination is held, and the testimony taken by such person shall be recorded verbatim.</P>
              <P>(d) During the taking of a deposition a party or deponent may request suspension of the deposition on grounds of bad faith in the conduct of the examination, annoyance, embarrassment, oppression of a deponent or party or improper questions propounded. The deposition will then be adjourned. However, the objecting party or deponent must immediately move the administrative law judge for a ruling on his objections to the deposition conduct or proceedings. The administrative law judge may then limit the scope or manner of the taking of the deposition.</P>
              <P>(e) The officer shall certify the deposition and promptly file it with the administrative law judge. Documents or true copies of documents and other items produced for inspection during the examination of the witness shall, upon the request of a party, be marked for identification and annexed to the deposition.</P>
              <P>(f) The party taking the deposition shall give prompt notice of its filing to all other parties.</P>

              <P>(1) Any deposition may be used for contradiction or impeachment of the deponent as a witness.</P>
              <P>(2) The deposition of a party, or of an agent designated to testify on behalf of a party, may be used by an adverse party for any purpose.</P>

              <P>(3) The deposition of any witness may be used for any purpose if the party offering the deposition has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness because he is dead; or if the witness is at a greater distance than 100 miles from the place of hearing, or is out of the United States, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition; or if the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or, upon application and notice, that such exceptional circumstances exist as to <PRTPAGE P="113"/>make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally in open hearing, to allow the deposition to be used.</P>
              <P>(b) If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence, the remainder becomes subject to introduction by any party.</P>
              <P>(c) Objection may be made at the hearing to receiving in evidence any deposition or part thereof for any reason which would require the exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then present and testifying.</P>

              <P>(2) An evasive or incomplete answer is to be treated as a failure to answer.</P>
              <P>(b) If a party or an agent designated to testify fails to obey an order to permit discovery, the administrative law judge may make such orders as are just, including:</P>

              <P>(a) The hearing is directed primarily to receiving factual evidence and expert opinion testimony related to the issues in the proceeding. A hearing will be held only in cases where issues of fact must be resolved in order to determine whether the applicant or recipient has failed to comply with one or more applicable requirements of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (sec. 602, 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1) and part 17 of this title.

              <P>(c) In any case where it appears from the answer of the applicant or recipient to the notice of hearing or notice of opportunity to request a hearing, from his failure timely to answer, or from his admissions or stipulations in the record that there are no matters of material fact in dispute, the administrative law judge may enter an order so finding, vacating the hearing date if one has been set, and fixing the time for the submission of evidence by the Government for the record. Thereafter, the proceedings shall go to conclusion in accordance with part 17 of this title and the rules in this subpart. An appeal from such order may be allowed in accordance with the rules for interlocutory appeal in § 4.823.</P>

Authorization of depositions for discovery purposes is governed by § 4.1031.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Criteria.</E> (1) The ALJ may authorize a deposition to preserve testimony <PRTPAGE P="128"/>only if the party shows that the witness:</P>

              <P>(a) A party or a prospective witness or deponent may file a motion requesting a protective order to limit from disclosure to other parties or to the public a document or testimony containing information which is confidential or exempt by law from public disclosure.</P>
              <P>(b) In the motion the person must describe the information sought to be protected from disclosure and explain in detail:</P>

              <P>(2) Why disclosure of the information would adversely affect the person; and</P>
              <P>(3) Why disclosure is not required in the public interest.</P>
              <P>(c) If the person seeks non-disclosure of information in a document:</P>
              <P>(1) The motion must include a copy of the document with the confidential information deleted. If it is not practicable to submit such a copy of the document because deletion of the information would render the document unintelligible, a description of the document may be substituted.</P>
              <P>(2) The ALJ may require the person to file a sealed copy of the document for in camera inspection.</P>
              <P>(d) Ordinarily, documents and testimony introduced into the public hearing process are presumed to be public. In issuing a protective order, the ALJ may make any order which justice requires to protect the person, consistent with the mandatory public disclosure requirements of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b), and other applicable law.</P>

However, this paragraph does not apply to federal employees who are called as witnesses by OFA.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Motion to quash.</E> (1) A person to whom a subpoena is directed may request by motion that the ALJ quash or modify the subpoena.</P>
              <P>(2) The motion must be filed:</P>
              <P>(i) Within 5 days after service of the subpoena; or</P>

              <P>(3) The ALJ may quash or modify the subpoena if it:</P>
              <P>(i) Is unreasonable;</P>
              <P>(ii) Requires evidence beyond the limits on witnesses and evidence found in §§ 4.1042 and 4.1046;</P>
              <P>(iii) Requires evidence during discovery that is not discoverable; or</P>

              <P>(b) Each matter of which an admission is requested is admitted unless, within 30 days after service of the request or such shorter or longer time as the administrative law judge may allow, the party to whom the request is directed serves on the requesting party—</P>

However, no ex parte communication as to the merits of the proceeding may be conducted with the administrative law judge.</P>
              <P>(b) Any party desiring to file a response to the application for review shall file a written response within 5 working days of service of the application.</P>
              <P>(c) If the applicant has requested a hearing, the administrative law judge shall act immediately upon receipt of the application to notify the parties of the time and place of the hearing at least 5 working days prior to the hearing date.</P>
              <P>(d) The administrative law judge may require the parties to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law at the hearing which may be orally supplemented on the record at the hearing or, where proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law have not been submitted at the hearing, they may be orally presented for the record at the hearing.</P>

              <P>(e) The administrative law judge shall make an initial decision. He shall either rule from the bench on the application, orally stating the reasons for his decision or he shall issue a written <PRTPAGE P="149"/>decision. If the administrative law judge makes an oral ruling, his approval of the record of the hearing shall constitute his written decision. The decision of the administrative law judge must be issued within 15 days of the filing of the perfected application under § 4.1184.</P>
              <P>(f) If any party desires to appeal to the Board, such party shall—</P>

              <P>(2) If the administrative law judge issues a written decision after the close of the hearing, file a notice of appeal with the administrative law judge and with the Board within 2 working days of receipt of the administrative law judge's decision.</P>
              <P>(g) If the decision of the administrative law judge is appealed, the Board shall act immediately to issue an expedited briefing schedule, and the Board shall act expeditiously to review the record and issue its decision. The decision of the Board must be issued within 30 days of the date the perfected application is filed with OHA pursuant to § 4.1184.</P>
              <P>(h) If all parties waive the opportunity for a hearing and the administrative law judge determines that a hearing is not necessary, but the applicant does not waive the 30-day decision requirement, the administrative law judge shall issue an initial decision on the application within 15 days of receipt of the application. The decision shall contain findings of fact and an order disposing of the application. The decision shall be served upon all the parties and the parties shall have 2 working days from receipt of such decision within which to appeal to the Board. The Board shall issue its decision within 30 days of the date the perfected application is filed with OHA pursuant to § 4.1184.</P>
              <P>(i) If at any time after the initiation of this expedited procedure, the applicant requests a delay or acts in a manner so as to frustrate the expeditious nature of this proceeding or fails to comply with any requirement of § 4.1187(a), such action shall constitute a waiver of the 30-day requirement of section 525(b) of the act.</P>
              <P>(j) If the applicant seeks to offer witnesses, exhibits, or testimony at the hearing in addition to those identified, submitted, described, or summarized in the application for expedited review perfected in accordance with the requirements of § 4.1184, upon objection by an opposing party to such offer, the administrative law judge may allow such objecting party additional time in order to prepare for cross-examination of unidentified witnesses or to identify and prepare rebuttal evidence or otherwise uncover any additional prejudice which may result to such party. The administrative law judge may rule that the running of the 30-day time for decision is stayed for the period of any additional time allowed pursuant to this subsection or may determine that the applicant has waived his right to the 30-day decision.</P>

            <P>(a) This appeals procedure embodies an informal administrative review of agency decisions made under OMB Circular A-76, and is intended to assure that such decisions are fair, equitable, and in compliance with the provisions of the Circular. This procedure provides affected parties an opportunity to request that such decisions be objectively reviewed by a party independent of the A-76 decision process.</P>
            <P>(b) This appeals procedure is administrative rather than judicial in nature, and does not provide for a judicial review or for further levels of appeal. The decisions of the appeals official are final.</P>
            <P>(c) This procedure is intended to protect the rights of all affected parties and, therefore, neither the procedure nor agency determinations may be subject to negotiation, arbitration, or agreements with any one of the parties.</P>

            <P>(b) This appeals procedure shall be used only to resolve questions of the determination between contract and in-house performance of a commercial or industrial type requirement, and shall not apply to questions concerning award to one contractor in preference to another.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How are terms defined in this subpart?</SUBJECT>
            <P>The following definitions apply to this subpart:</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Agency, we, our, or us</E> means the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, as appropriate.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Commercial filming</E> means the film, electronic, magnetic, digital, or other recording of a moving image by a person, business, or other entity for a market audience with the intent of generating income. Examples include, but are not limited to, feature film, videography, television broadcast, or documentary, or other similar projects. Commercial filming activities may include the advertisement of a product or service, or the use of actors, models, sets, or props.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Cost recovery</E> means the money that an agency collects as reimbursement for actual costs it incurred to permit a particular activity, including but not limited to, accepting and processing a permit application and monitoring the permitted commercial filming or still photography activity.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Location fee</E> means a land or facility use fee similar to rent that provides a fair return to the United States for the use of Federal lands or facilities when used for:</P>
            <P>(1) Commercial filming activities or similar projects; and</P>
            <P>(2) Still photography activities where a permit is required.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Model</E> means a person or object that serves as the subject for commercial <PRTPAGE P="175"/>filming or still photography for the purpose of promoting the sale or use of a product or service. Models include, but are not limited to, individuals, animals, or inanimate objects, such as vehicles, boats, articles of clothing, and food and beverage products, placed on agency lands so that they may be filmed or photographed to promote the sale or use of a product or service. For the purposes of this part, portrait subjects such as wedding parties and high school graduates are not considered models, if the image will not be used to promote or sell a product or service.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">News</E> means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public, gathered by news-media entities for dissemination to the public. Examples of news-media entities include, but are not limited to, television or radio stations broadcasting to the general public and publishers of periodicals (but only if such entities qualify as disseminators of “news”) who make their products available for purchase by or subscription by or free distribution to the general public.</P>

            <P>(2) A freelance journalist is regarded as working for a news-media entity if the journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that entity, even if the journalist is not actually employed by the entity. A contract would present a solid basis for such an expectation; we may also consider the past publication record of the requester in making such a determination.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">News-gathering activities</E> means filming, videography, and still photography activities carried out by a representative of the news media.</P>

Sets and props also include trained animals and inanimate objects, such as camping equipment, campfires, wagons, and so forth, when used to stage a specific scene. The use of a camera on a tripod, without the use of any other equipment, is not considered a prop.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Still photography</E> means the capturing of a still image on film or in a digital format.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Videography</E> means the process of capturing moving images on electronic media, e.g., video tape, hard disk or solid state storage.</P>

            <P>(ii) Requests, pursuant to § 6.2(e), a determination of the respective rights of the Government and of the inventor.</P>
            <P>(e) If the inventor believes that he is not required by the regulations in this subpart to assign to the Government the entire domestic right, title, and interest in and to the invention, and if he is unwilling to make such an assignment to the Government, he shall, in his invention report, request that the Solicitor determine the respective rights of the Government and of the inventor in the invention, and he shall include in his invention report information on the following points, in addition to the data called for in paragraph (d) of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) The circumstances under which the invention was made (conceived, actually reduced to practice or constructed and tested);</P>
            <P>(2) The employee's official duties, as given on his job sheet or otherwise assigned, at the time of the making of the invention;</P>
            <P>(3) The extent to which the invention was made during the inventor's official working hours, the extent use was made of government facilities, equipment, funds, material or information, and the time or services of other government employees on official duty;</P>

            </P>
            <P>(5) Whether the employee would be willing, upon request, to voluntarily assign foreign rights in the invention to the Government if it should be determined that an assignment of the domestic rights to the Government is not required.</P>

            <P>(a) If an employee inventor requests pursuant to § 6.2(e), that such determination be made, the Solicitor shall determine the respective rights of the employee and of the Government in and to the invention. His determination shall be subject to review by the Commissioner in proper cases under Executive Orders 10096 and 10930 and the rules and regulations issued by the Commissioner with the approval of the President.</P>
            <P>(b) If the Government is entitled to obtain the entire domestic right, title and interest in and to an invention made by an employee of the Department, the Solicitor, subject to review by the Commissioner in proper cases, may take such action respecting the invention as he deems necessary or advisable to protect the interests of the United States.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Rights in inventions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The rules prescribed in this section shall be applied in determining the respective rights of the Government and of an employee of the Department in and to any invention made by the employee.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) Except as indicated in the succeeding paragraphs, (b) (1) through (4), of this section, the Government shall obtain the entire domestic right, title, and interest in and to any invention made by an employee of the Department</P>
            <P>(i) During working hours, or</P>
            <P>(ii) With a contribution by the Government of facilities, equipment, materials, funds, or information, or of time or services of other government employees on official duty, or</P>
            <P>(iii) Which bears a direct relation to or is made in consequence of the official duties of the inventor.</P>

            <P>(2) In any case where the contribution of the Government, as measured by any one or more of the criteria set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, to the invention is insufficient equitably to justify a requirement of assignment to the Government of the entire domestic right, title, and interest in and to such invention, or in any case where the Government has insufficient interest in an invention to obtain the <PRTPAGE P="179"/>entire domestic right, title, and interest therein (although the Government could obtain same under paragraph (b)(1) of this section), the Solicitor, subject to the approval of the Commissioner, shall leave title to such invention in the employee, subject, however, to the reservation to the Government of a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license in the invention with power to grant sublicenses for all governmental purposes, such reservation, in the terms thereof, to appear, where practicable, in any patent, domestic or foreign, which may issue on such invention.</P>
            <P>(3) In applying the provisions of paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section to the facts and circumstances relating to the making of any particular invention, it shall be presumed that any invention made by an employee who is employed or assigned (i) to invent or improve or perfect any art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or (ii) to conduct or perform research, development work, or both, or (iii) to supervise, direct, coordinate, or review Government financed or conducted research, development work, or both, or (iv) to act in a liaison capacity among governmental or nongovernmental agencies or individuals engaged in such work, falls within the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and it shall be presumed that any invention made by any other employee falls within the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Either presumption may be rebutted by a showing of the facts and circumstances in the case and shall not preclude a determination that these facts and circumstances justify leaving the entire right, title and interest in and to the invention in the government employee, subject to law.</P>
            <P>(4) In any case wherein the Government neither (i) obtains the entire domestic right, title, and interest in and to an invention pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, nor (ii) reserves a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license in the invention, with power to grant sublicenses for all governmental purposes, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Solicitor, subject to the approval of the Commissioner, shall leave the entire right, title, and interest in and to the invention in the employee, subject to law.</P>
            <P>(c) In the event that the Solicitor determines, pursuant to paragraph (b) (2) or (4) of this section, that title to an invention will be left with an employee, the Solicitor shall notify the employee of this determination and promptly prepare, and preserve in appropriate files, accessible to the Commissioner, a written signed, and dated statement concerning the invention including the following:</P>
            <P>(1) A description of the invention in sufficient detail to identify the invention and show the relationship to the employee's duties and work assignment;</P>
            <P>(2) The name of the employee and his employment status, including a detailed statement of his official duties and responsibilities at the time the invention was made; and</P>
            <P>(3) A statement of the Solicitor's determination and reasons therefor. The Solicitor shall, subject to considerations of national security, or public health, safety, or welfare, submit to the Commissioner a copy of this written statement. This submittal in a case falling within the provisions of paragraph (b) (2) of this section shall be made after the expiration of the period prescribed in § 6.6 for the taking of an appeal, or it may be made prior to the expiration of such period if the employees acquiesces in the Solicitor's determination. The Commissioner thereupon shall review the determination of the Solicitor and the Commissioner's decision respecting the matter shall be final, subject to the right of the employee or the Solicitor to submit to the Commissioner within 30 days (or such longer period as the Commissioner may, for good cause, shown in writing, fix in any case) after receiving notice of such decision, a petition for the reconsideration of the decision. A copy of such petition must also be filed by the inventor with the Solicitor within the prescribed period.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Appeals by employees.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Any employee who is aggrieved by a determination of the Solicitor pursuant to § 6.5(b) (1) or (2) may obtain a review of the determination by filing, <PRTPAGE P="180"/>within 30 days (or such longer period as the Commissioner may for good cause shown in writing, fix in any case) after receiving notice of such determination, two copies of an appeal with the Commissioner. The Commissioner then shall forward one copy of the appeal to the Solicitor.</P>
            <P>(b) On receipt of a copy of an appeal filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the Solicitor shall, subject to considerations of national security, or public health, safety, or welfare, promptly furnish both the Commissioner and the inventor with a copy of a report containing the following information about the invention involved in the appeal:</P>
            <P>(1) A copy of a statement containing the information specified in § 6.5(c), and</P>
            <P>(2) A detailed statement of the points of dispute or controversy, together with copies of any statements or written arguments that may have been filed, and of any other relevant evidence that the Solicitor considered in making his determination of Government interest. Within 25 days (or such longer period as the Commissioner may, for good cause shown, fix in any case) after the transmission of a copy of the Solicitor's report to the employee, the employee may file a reply thereto with the Commissioner and file one copy thereof with the Solicitor.</P>
            <P>(c) After the time for the employee's reply to the Solicitor's report has expired and if the employee has so requested in his appeal, a date will be set for the hearing of oral arguments by the employee (or by an attorney whom he designates by written power of attorney filed before, or at the hearing) and the Solicitor. Unless it shall be otherwise ordered before the hearing begins, oral arguments will be limited to thirty minutes for each side. The employee need not retain an attorney or request an oral hearing to secure full consideration of the facts and his arguments. He may expedite such consideration by notifying the Commissioner when he does not intend to file a reply to the Solicitor's report.</P>
            <P>(d) After a hearing on the appeal, if a hearing was requested, or after expiration of the period for the inventor's reply to the Solicitor's report, if no hearing is set, the Commissioner shall issue a decision on the matter, which decision shall be final after the period for asking reconsideration expires or on the date that a decision on a petition for reconsideration is finally disposed of. Any request for reconsideration or modification of the decision must be filed within 30 days from the date of the original decision (or within such an extension thereof as may be set by the Commissioner before the original period expires). The Com- missioner's decision shall be made after consideration of the statements of fact in the employee's appeal, the Solicitor's report, and the employee's reply, but the Commissioner, at his discretion and with due respect to the rights and convenience of the inventor and the Solicitor, may call for further statements on specific questions of fact or may request additional evidence in the form of affidavits or depositions on specific facts in dispute.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Domestic patent protection.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Solicitor, upon determining that an invention coming within the scope of § 6.5(b) (1) or (2) has been made, shall thereupon determine whether patent protection will be sought in the United States by the Department for such invention. A controversy over the respective rights of the Government and of the inventor in any case shall not delay the taking of the actions provided for in this section. In cases coming within the scope of § 6.5(b)(2), action by the Department looking toward such patent protection shall be contingent upon the consent of the inventor.</P>
            <P>(b) Where there is a dispute as to whether paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of § 6.5 applies in determining the respective rights of the Government and of an employee in and to any invention, the Solicitor will determine whether patent protection will be sought in the United States pending the Commissioner's decision on the dispute, and, if he determines that an application for patent should be filed, he will take such rights as are specified in § 6.5(b)(2), but this shall be without prejudice to acquiring the rights specified in § 6.5(b)(1) should the Commissioner so decide.</P>

            <P>(c) Where the Solicitor has determined to leave title to an invention with an employee under § 6.5(b)(2), the <PRTPAGE P="181"/>Solicitor will, upon the filing of an application for patent and pending review of the determination by the Commissioner, take the rights specified in that paragraph, without prejudice to the subsequent acquisition by the Government of the rights specified in § 6.5(b)(1) should the Commissioner so decide.</P>
            <P>(d) In the event that the Solicitor determines that an application for patent will not be filed on an invention made under the circumstances specified in § 6.5(b)(1) giving the United States the right to title thereto, the Solicitor shall subject to considerations of national security, or public health, safety, or welfare, report to the Commissioner promptly upon making such determination, the following information concerning the invention:</P>
            <P>(1) Description of the invention in sufficient detail to permit a satisfactory review;</P>

            <P>(1) The acceptance of a license or sublicense shall not be construed as a waiver of the right to contest the validity of the patent. A license or sublicense shall be revocable only upon a finding by the Solicitor of the Department that the terms of the license or sublicense have been violated and that the revocation of the license or sublicense is in the public interest. Such finding shall be made only after reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard.</P>
            <P>(2) Licenses and sublicenses shall be nontransferable. Upon a satisfactory showing that the Government or public will be benefited thereby, they may be granted to properly qualified applicants royalty-free.

A cross-licensing agreement may be considered adequate consideration.</P>

            <P>(3) Licensees and sublicensees may be required to submit annual or more frequent technical or statistical reports concerning practical experience acquired through the exercise of the license or sublicense, the extent of the <PRTPAGE P="184"/>production under the license or sublicense, and other related subjects.</P>
            <P>(4) A licensee or sublicensee manufacturing a patented article pursuant to a license or sublicense shall give notice to the public that the article is patented by affixing thereon the word “patent”, together with the number of the patent, or when, from the character of the article, this cannot be done, by fixing to it, or to the package in which it is enclosed, a label containing such notice.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The regulations in this part implement provisions of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470aa-mm) by establishing the uniform definitions, standards, and procedures to be followed by all Federal land managers in providing protection for archaeological resources, located on public lands and Indian lands of the United States. These regulations enable Federal land managers to protect archaeological resources, taking into consideration provisions of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (92 Stat. 469; 42 U.S.C. 1996), through permits authorizing excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources, through civil penalties for unauthorized excavation and/or removal, through provisions for the preservation of archaeological resource collections and data, and through provisions for ensuring confidentiality of information about archaeological resources when disclosure would threaten the archaeological resources.</P>
            <P>(b) The regulations in this part do not impose any new restrictions on activities permitted under other laws, authorities, and regulations relating to mining, mineral leasing, reclamation, and other multiple uses of the public lands.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Permit requirements and exceptions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Any person proposing to excavate and/or remove archaeological resources from public lands or Indian lands, and to carry out activities associated with such excavation and/or removal, shall apply to the Federal land manager for a permit for the proposed work, and shall not begin the proposed work until a permit has been issued. The Federal land manager may issue a permit to any qualified person, subject to appropriate terms and conditions, provided that the person applying for a permit meets conditions in § 7.8(a) of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) Exceptions:</P>

            <P>(1) No permit shall be required under this part for any person conducting activities on the public lands under other permits, leases, licenses, or entitlements for use, when those activities are exclusively for purposes other than the excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources, even though those activities might incidentally result in the disturbance of archaeological resources. General earth-moving excavation conducted under a permit or other authorization shall not be construed to mean excavation and/or removal as used in this part. This exception does not, however, affect the Federal land manager's responsibility to comply with other authorities which protect archaeological resources prior to approving permits, leases, licenses, or entitlements for use; any excavation <PRTPAGE P="188"/>and/or removal of archaeological resources required for compliance with those authorities shall be conducted in accordance with the permit requirements of this part.</P>
            <P>(2) No permit shall be required under this part for any person collecting for private purposes any rock, coin, bullet, or mineral which is not an archaeological resource as defined in this part, provided that such collecting does not result in disturbance of any archaelogical resource.</P>
            <P>(3) No permit shall be required under this part or under section 3 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432), for the excavation or removal by any Indian tribe or member thereof of any archaeological resource located on Indian lands of such Indian tribe, except that in the absence of tribal law regulating the excavation or removal or archaeological resources on Indian lands, an individual tribal member shall be required to obtain a permit under this part;</P>
            <P>(4) No permit shall be required under this part for any person to carry out any archaeological activity authorized by a permit issued under section 3 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432), before the enactment of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979. Such permit shall remain in effect according to its terms and conditions until expiration.</P>
            <P>(5) No permit shall be required under section 3 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432) for any archaeological work for which a permit is issued under this part.</P>
            <P>(c) Persons carrying out official agency duties under the Federal land manager's direction, associated with the management of archaeological resources, need not follow the permit application procedures of § 7.6. However, the Federal land manager shall insure that provisions of §§ 7.8 and 7.9 have been met by other documented means, and that any official duties which might result in harm to or destruction of any Indian tribal religious or cultural site, as determined by the Federal land manager, have been the subject of consideration under § 7.7.</P>
            <P>(d) Upon the written request of the Governor of any State, on behalf of the State or its educational institutions, the Federal land manager shall issue a permit, subject to the provisions of §§ 7.5(b)(5), 7.7, 7.8(a) (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7), 7.9, 7.10, 7.12, and 7.13(a) to such Governor or to such designee as the Governor deems qualified to carry out the intent of the Act, for purposes of conducting archaeological research, excavating and/or removing archaeological resources, and safeguarding and preserving any materials and data collected in a university, museum, or other scientific or educational institution approved by the Federal land manager.</P>
            <P>(e) Under other statutory, regulatory, or administrative authorities governing the use of public lands and Indian lands, authorizations may be required for activities which do not require a permit under this part. Any person wishing to conduct on public lands or Indian lands any activities related to but believed to fall outside the scope of this part should consult with the Federal land manager, for the purpose of determining whether any authorization is required, prior to beginning such activities.</P>

            <P>(b) Each application for a permit shall include:</P>
            <P>(1) The nature and extent of the work proposed, including how and why it is proposed to be conducted, proposed time of performance, locational maps, and proposed outlet for public written dissemination of the results.</P>
            <P>(2) The name and address of the individual(s) proposed to be responsible for conducting the work, institutional affiliation, if any, and evidence of education, training, and experience in accord with the minimal qualifications listed in § 7.8(a).</P>

            <P>(3) The name and address of the individual(s), if different from the individual(s) named in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, proposed to be responsible <PRTPAGE P="189"/>for carrying out the terms and conditions of the permit.</P>
            <P>(4) Evidence of the applicant's ability to initiate, conduct, and complete the proposed work, including evidence of logistical support and laboratory facilities.</P>
            <P>(5) Where the application is for the excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources on public lands, the names of the university, museum, or other scientific or educational institution in which the applicant proposes to store all collections, and copies of records, data, photographs, and other documents derived from the proposed work. Applicants shall submit written certification, signed by an authorized official of the institution, of willingness to assume curatorial responsibility for the collections, records, data, photographs and other documents and to safeguard and preserve these materials as property of the United States.</P>
            <P>(6) Where the application is for the excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources on Indian lands, the name of the university, museum, or other scientific or educational institution in which the applicant proposes to store copies of records, data, photographs, and other documents derived from the proposed work, and all collections in the event the Indian owners do not wish to take custody or otherwise dispose of the archaeological resources. Applicants shall submit written certification, signed by an authorized official of the institution, or willingness to assume curatorial responsibility for the collections, if applicable, and/or the records, data, photographs, and other documents derived from the proposed work.</P>
            <P>(c) The Federal land manager may require additional information, pertinent to land management responsibilities, to be included in the application for permit and shall so inform the applicant.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Paperwork Reduction Act.</E> The information collection requirement contained in § 7.6 of these regulations has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 <E T="03">et seq.</E> and assigned clearance number 1024-0037. The purpose of the information collection is to meet statutory and administrative requirements in the public interest. The information will be used to assist Federal land managers in determining that applicants for permits are qualified, that the work proposed would further archaeological knowledge, that archaeological resources and associated records and data will be properly preserved, and that the permitted activity would not conflict with the management of the public lands involved. Response to the information requirement is necessary in order for an applicant to obtain a benefit.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Notification to Indian tribes of possible harm to, or destruction of, sites on public lands having religious or cultural importance.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If the issuance of a permit under this part may result in harm to, or destruction of, any Indian tribal religious or cultural site on public lands, as determined by the Federal land manager, at least 30 days before issuing such a permit the Federal land manager shall notify any Indian tribe which may consider the site as having religious or cultural importance. Such notice shall not be deemed a disclosure to the public for purposes of section 9 of the Act.</P>
            <P>(1) Notice by the Federal land manager to any Indian tribe shall be sent to the chief executive officer or other designated official of the tribe. Indian tribes are encouraged to designate a tribal official to be the focal point for any notification and discussion between the tribe and the Federal land manager.</P>
            <P>(2) The Federal land manager may provide notice to any other Native American group that is known by the Federal land manager to consider sites potentially affected as being of religious or cultural importance.</P>
            <P>(3) Upon request during the 30-day period, the Federal land manager may meet with official representatives of any Indian tribe or group to discuss their interests, including ways to avoid or mitigate potential harm or destruction such as excluding sites from the permit area.

            <P>(4) When the Federal land manager determines that a permit applied for <PRTPAGE P="190"/>under this part must be issued immediately because of an imminent threat of loss or destruction of an archaeological resource, the Federal land manager shall so notify the appropriate tribe.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) In order to identify sites of religious or cultural importance, the Federal land manager shall seek to identify all Indian tribes having aboriginal or historic ties to the lands under the Federal land manager's jurisdiction and seek to determine, from the chief executive officer or other designated official of any such tribe, the location and nature of specific sites of religious or cultural importance so that such information may be on file for land management purposes. Information on sites eligible for or included in the National Register of Historic Places may be withheld from public disclosure pursuant to section 304 of the Act of October 15, 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470w-3).</P>
            <P>(2) If the Federal land manager becomes aware of a Native American group that is not an Indian tribe as defined in this part but has aboriginal or historic ties to public lands under the Federal land manager's jurisdiction, the Federal land manager may seek to communicate with official representatives of that group to obtain information on sites they may consider to be of religious or cultural importance.</P>
            <P>(3) The Federal land manager may enter into agreement with any Indian tribe or other Native American group for determining locations for which such tribe or group wishes to receive notice under this section.</P>
            <P>(4) The Federal land manager should also seek to determine, in consultation with official representatives of Indian tribes or other Native American groups, what circumstances should be the subject of special notification to the tribe or group after a permit has been issued. Circumstances calling for notification might include the discovery of human remains. When circumstances for special notification have been determined by the Federal land manager, the Federal land manager will include a requirement in the terms and conditions of permits, under § 7.9(c), for permittees to notify the Federal land manger immediately upon the occurrence of such circumstances. Following the permittee's notification, the Federal land manager will notify and consult with the tribe or group as appropriate. In cases involving Native American human remains and other “cultural items”, as defined by NAGPRA, the Federal land manager is referred to NAGPRA and its implementing regulations.</P>

In any such hearing, the amount of civil penalty assessed shall be determined in accordance with this part, and shall not be limited by the amount assessed by the Federal land manager under paragraph <PRTPAGE P="195"/>(f) of this section or any offer of mitigation or remission made by the Federal land manager.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Determination of loss or absence of archaeological interest.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Under certain circumstances, a Federal land manager may determine, pursuant to § 7.3(a)(5) of this part, that certain material remains are not or are no longer of archaeological interest, and therefore are not to be considered archaeological resources under this part.</P>
            <P>(b) The Federal land manager may make such a determination if he/she finds that the material remains are not capable of providing scientific or humanistic understandings of past human behavior, cultural adaptation, and related topics.</P>
            <P>(c) Prior to making a determination that material remains are not or are no longer archaeological resources, the Federal land manager shall ensure that the following procedures are completed:</P>
            <P>(1) A professional archaeological evaluation of material remains and similar materials within the area under consideration shall be completed, consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation (48 FR 44716, Sept. 29, 1983) and with 36 CFR parts 60, 63, and 65.</P>
            <P>(2) The principal bureau archaeologist or, in the absence of a principal bureau archaeologist, the Department Consulting Archeologist, shall establish whether the material remains under consideration contribute to scientific or humanistic understandings of past human behavior, cultural adaptation and related topics. The principal bureau archaeologist or the Department Consulting Archeologist, as appropriate, shall make a recommendation to the Federal land manager concerning these material remains.</P>
            <P>(d) The Federal land manager shall make the determination based upon the facts established by and the recommendation of the principal bureau archaeologist or the Departmental Consulting Archeologist, as appropriate, and shall fully document the basis therefor, including consultation with Indian tribes for determinations regarding sites of religious or cultural importance.</P>
            <P>(e) The Federal land manager shall make public notice of the determination and its limitations, including any permitting requirements for activities associated with the materials determined not to be archaeological resources for purposes of this part.</P>

            <P>(f) Any interested individual may request in writing that the Departmental Consulting Archeologist review any final determination by the Federal land manager that certain remains, are not, or are no longer, archaeological resources. Two (2) copies of the request should be sent to the Departmental Consulting Archeologist, National Park Service, P.O. Box 37127, Washington, DC 20013-7127, and should document why the requestor disagrees with the determination of the Federal land manager.

            <P>(a) If the lands involved in a permit application are Indian lands, the consent of the appropriate Indian tribal authority or individual Indian landowner is required by the Act and these regulations.</P>
            <P>(b) When Indian tribal lands are involved in an application for a permit or a request for extension or modification of a permit, the consent of the Indian tribal government must be obtained. For Indian allotted lands outside reservation boundaries, consent from only the individual landowner is needed. When multiple-owner allotted lands are involved, consent by more than 50 percent of the ownership interest is sufficient. For Indian allotted lands within reservation boundaries, consent must be obtained from the Indian tribal government and the individual landowner(s).</P>
            <P>(c) The applicant should consult with the Bureau of Indian Affairs concerning procedures for obtaining consent from the appropriate Indian tribal authorities and submit the permit application to the area office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs that is responsible for the administration of the lands in question. The Bureau of Indian Affairs shall insure that consultation with the appropriate Indian tribal authority or individual Indian landowner regarding terms and conditions of the permit occurs prior to detailed evaluation of the application.

            <P>(b) The disputant, if unsatisfied with the outcome of the review or conference, may request that the decision be reviewed by the head of the bureau involved.</P>
            <P>(c) Any disputant unsatisfied with the higher level review, and desiring to appeal the decision, pursuant to § 7.11 of this part, should consult with the appropriate Federal land manager regarding the existence of published bureau appeal procedures. In the absence of published bureau appeal procedures, the review by the head of the bureau involved will constitute the final decision.</P>

            <P>(d) Any affected person may request a review by the Departmental Consulting Archeologist of any professional issues involved in a bureau permitting decision, such as professional qualifications, research design, or other professional archaeological matters. The Departmental Consulting Archeologist shall make a final professional recommendation to the head of the bureau involved. The head of the bureau involved will consider the recommendation, but may reject it, in whole or in part, for good cause. This request should be in writing, and <PRTPAGE P="200"/>should state the reasons for the request. See § 7.33(f) for the address of the Departmental Consulting Archeologist.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose, applicability, and information collection.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> These regulations carry out provisions of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 (Pub.L. 101-601; 25 U.S.C. 3001-3013;104 Stat. 3048-3058). These regulations develop a systematic process for determining the rights of lineal descendants and Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations to certain Native American human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony with which they are affiliated.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (1) These regulations pertain to the identification and appropriate disposition of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony that are:</P>
            <P>(i) In Federal possession or control; or</P>
            <P>(ii) In the possession or control of any institution or State or local government receiving Federal funds; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Excavated intentionally or discovered inadvertently on Federal or tribal lands.</P>

            <P>(2) These regulations apply to human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony <PRTPAGE P="206"/>which are indigenous to Alaska, Hawaii, and the continental United States, but not to territories of the United States.</P>
            <P>(3) Throughout this part are decision points which determine how this part applies in particular circumstances, e.g., a decision as to whether a museum “controls” human remains and cultural objects within the meaning of the regulations, or a decision as to whether an object is a “human remain,” “funerary object,” “sacred object,” or “object of cultural patrimony” within the meaning of the regulations. Any final determination making the Act or this part inapplicable is subject to review under section 15 of the Act. With respect to Federal agencies, the final denial of a request of a lineal descendant, Indian tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization for the repatriation or disposition of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony brought under, and in compliance with, the Act and this part constitutes a final agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 704).</P>

            <P>(c) The information collection requirements contained in this part have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 <E T="03">et seq.</E> and assigned control number 1024-0144. A Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>In addition to the term <E T="03">Act,</E> which means the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act as described above, definitions used in these regulations are grouped in seven classes: Parties required to comply with these regulations; Parties with standing to make claims under these regulations; Parties responsible for implementing these regulations; Objects covered by these regulations; Cultural affiliation; Types of land covered by these regulations; and Procedures required by these regulations.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Who must comply with these regulations?</E> (1) <E T="03">Federal agency</E> means any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States. Such term does not include the Smithsonian Institution as specified in section 2 (4) of the Act.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Federal agency official</E> means any individual authorized by delegation of authority within a Federal agency to perform the duties relating to these regulations.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Museum</E> means any institution or State or local government agency (including any institution of higher learning) that has possession of, or control over, human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony and receives Federal funds.</P>
            <P>(i) The term “<E T="03">possession</E>” means having physical custody of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony with a sufficient legal interest to lawfully treat the objects as part of its collection for purposes of these regulations. Generally, a museum or Federal agency would not be considered to have possession of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony on loan from another individual, museum, or Federal agency.</P>
            <P>(ii) The term “<E T="03">control</E>” means having a legal interest in human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony sufficient to lawfully permit the museum or Federal agency to treat the objects as part of its collection for purposes of these regulations whether or not the human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects or objects of cultural patrimony are in the physical custody of the museum or Federal agency. Generally, a museum or Federal agency that has loaned human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony to another individual, museum, or Federal agency is considered to retain control of those human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony for purposes of these regulations.</P>
            <P>(iii) The phrase “<E T="03">receives Federal funds</E>” means the receipt of funds by a museum after November 16, 1990, from a Federal agency through any grant, loan, contract (other than a procurement contract), or other arrangement <PRTPAGE P="207"/>by which a Federal agency makes or made available to a museum aid in the form of funds. Federal funds provided for any purpose that are received by a larger entity of which the museum is a part are considered Federal funds for the purposes of these regulations. For example, if a museum is a part of a State or local government or a private university and the State or local government or private university receives Federal funds for any purpose, the museum is considered to receive Federal funds for the purpose of these regulations.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Museum official</E> means the individual within a museum designated as being responsible for matters relating to these regulations.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Person</E> means an individual, partnership, corporation, trust, institution, association, or any other private entity, or, any official, employee, agent, department, or instrumentality of the United States, or of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization, or of any State or political subdivision thereof that discovers or discovered human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects or objects of cultural patrimony on Federal or tribal lands after November 16, 1990.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Who has standing to make a claim under these regulations?</E> (1) <E T="03">Lineal descendant</E> means an individual tracing his or her ancestry directly and without interruption by means of the traditional kinship system of the appropriate Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization or by the common law system of descendance to a known Native American individual whose remains, funerary objects, or sacred objects are being claimed under these regulations.</P>
            <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(3)(i) <E T="03">Native Hawaiian organization</E> means any organization that:</P>
            <P>(A) Serves and represents the interests of Native Hawaiians;</P>
            <P>(B) Has as a primary and stated purpose the provision of services to Native Hawaiians; and</P>
            <P>(C) Has expertise in Native Hawaiian affairs.</P>
            <P>(ii) The term <E T="03">Native Hawaiian</E> means any individual who is a descendant of the aboriginal people who, prior to 1778, occupied and exercised sovereignty in the area that now constitutes the State of Hawaii. Such organizations must include the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and <E T="03">Hui Ma<AC T="8"/>lama I Na<AC T="8"/>Ku<AC T="8"/>puna 'O Hawai'i Nei.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Indian tribe official</E> means the principal leader of an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization or the individual officially designated by the governing body of an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization or as otherwise provided by tribal code, policy, or established procedure as responsible for matters relating to these regulations.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Who is responsible for carrying out these regulations?</E> (1) <E T="03">Secretary</E> means the Secretary of the Interior or a designee.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Review Committee</E> means the advisory committee established pursuant to section 8 of the Act.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Manager, National NAGPRA Program</E> means the official of the Department of the Interior designated by the Secretary as responsible for administration of matters relating to this part. Communications to the Manager, National NAGPRA Program should be sent to the mailing address listed on the National NAGPRA Contact Information Web site, <E T="03">http://www.nps.gov/nagpra/CONTACTS/INDEX.HTM.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">What objects are covered by these regulations?</E> The Act covers four types of Native American objects. The term <E T="03">Native American</E> means of, or relating to, a tribe, people, or culture indigenous to the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Human remains</E> means the physical remains of the body of a person of Native American ancestry. The term does not include remains or portions of remains that may reasonably be determined to have been freely given or naturally shed by the individual from whose body they were obtained, such as hair made into ropes or nets. For the purposes of determining cultural affiliation, human remains incorporated into a funerary object, sacred object, or object of cultural patrimony, as defined below, must be considered as part of that item.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Funerary objects</E> means items that, as part of the death rite or ceremony of a culture, are reasonably believed to have been placed intentionally at the <PRTPAGE P="208"/>time of death or later with or near individual human remains. Funerary objects must be identified by a preponderance of the evidence as having been removed from a specific burial site of an individual affiliated with a particular Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization or as being related to specific individuals or families or to known human remains. The term <E T="03">burial site</E> means any natural or prepared physical location, whether originally below, on, or above the surface of the earth, into which, as part of the death rite or ceremony of a culture, individual human remains were deposited, and includes rock cairns or pyres which do not fall within the ordinary definition of gravesite. For purposes of completing the summary requirements in § 10.8 and the inventory requirements of § 10.9:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Associated funerary objects</E> means those funerary objects for which the human remains with which they were placed intentionally are also in the possession or control of a museum or Federal agency. Associated funerary objects also means those funerary objects that were made exclusively for burial purposes or to contain human remains.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Unassociated funerary objects</E> means those funerary objects for which the human remains with which they were placed intentionally are not in the possession or control of a museum or Federal agency. Objects that were displayed with individual human remains as part of a death rite or ceremony of a culture and subsequently returned or distributed according to traditional custom to living descendants or other individuals are not considered unassociated funerary objects.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Sacred objects</E> means items that are specific ceremonial objects needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the practice of traditional Native American religions by their present-day adherents. While many items, from ancient pottery sherds to arrowheads, might be imbued with sacredness in the eyes of an individual, these regulations are specifically limited to objects that were devoted to a traditional Native American religious ceremony or ritual and which have religious significance or function in the continued observance or renewal of such ceremony. The term <E T="03">traditional</E> religious leader means a person who is recognized by members of an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization as:</P>
            <P>(i) Being responsible for performing cultural duties relating to the ceremonial or religious traditions of that Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization, or</P>
            <P>(ii) Exercising a leadership role in an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization based on the tribe or organization's cultural, ceremonial, or religious practices.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Objects of cultural patrimony</E> means items having ongoing historical, traditional, or cultural importance central to the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization itself, rather than property owned by an individual tribal or organization member. These objects are of such central importance that they may not be alienated, appropriated, or conveyed by any individual tribal or organization member. Such objects must have been considered inalienable by the culturally affiliated Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization at the time the object was separated from the group. Objects of cultural patrimony include items such as Zuni War Gods, the Confederacy Wampum Belts of the Iroquois, and other objects of similar character and significance to the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization as a whole.</P>
            <P>(e)(1) What is <E T="03">cultural affiliation</E>? Cultural affiliation means that there is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced historically or prehistorically between members of a present-day Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization and an identifiable earlier group. Cultural affiliation is established when the preponderance of the evidence—based on geographical, kinship, biological, archeological, anthropological, linguistic, folklore, oral tradition, historical evidence, or other information or expert opinion—reasonably leads to such a conclusion.</P>
            <P>(2) What does <E T="03">culturally unidentifiable</E> mean? Culturally unidentifiable refers to human remains and associated funerary objects in museum or Federal agency collections for which no lineal <PRTPAGE P="209"/>descendant or culturally affiliated Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization has been identified through the inventory process.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">What types of lands do the excavation and discovery provisions of these regulations apply to?</E> (1) <E T="03">Federal lands</E> means any land other than tribal lands that are controlled or owned by the United States Government, including lands selected by but not yet conveyed to Alaska Native Corporations and groups organized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). United States “control,” as used in this definition, refers to those lands not owned by the United States but in which the United States has a legal interest sufficient to permit it to apply these regulations without abrogating the otherwise existing legal rights of a person.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Tribal lands</E> means all lands which:</P>
            <P>(i) Are within the exterior boundaries of any Indian reservation including, but not limited to, allotments held in trust or subject to a restriction on alienation by the United States; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Comprise dependent Indian communities as recognized pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1151; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Are administered for the benefit of Native Hawaiians pursuant to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920 and section 4 of the Hawaiian Statehood Admission Act (Pub.L. 86-3; 73 Stat. 6).</P>
            <P>(iv) Actions authorized or required under these regulations will not apply to tribal lands to the extent that any action would result in a taking of property without compensation within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">What procedures are required by these regulations?</E> (1) <E T="03">Summary</E> means the written description of collections that may contain unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony required by § 10.8 of these regulations.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Inventory</E> means the item-by-item description of human remains and associated funerary objects.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Intentional excavation</E> means the planned archeological removal of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony found under or on the surface of Federal or tribal lands pursuant to section 3 (c) of the Act.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Inadvertent discovery</E> means the unanticipated encounter or detection of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony found under or on the surface of Federal or tribal lands pursuant to section 3 (d) of the Act.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Disposition</E> means the transfer of control over Native American human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony by a museum or Federal agency under this part. This part establishes disposition procedures for several different situations:</P>
            <P>(i) Custody of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony excavated intentionally from, or discovered inadvertently on, Federal or tribal lands after November 16, 1990, is established under § 10.6.</P>
            <P>(ii) Repatriation of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony in museum and Federal agency collections to a lineal descendant or culturally affiliated Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization is established under § 10.10.</P>
            <P>(iii) Disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains, with or without associated funerary objects, in museum or Federal agency collections is established under § 10.11.</P>
            <P>(iv) Disposition of unclaimed human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony is governed by § 10.7.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Unclaimed cultural items</E> means Native American human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony:</P>
            <P>(1) That have been excavated or discovered on, and removed from, Federal lands after November 16, 1990, and</P>
            <P>(2) Whose disposition under 25 U.S.C. 3002(a) and § 10.6 of this part has not occurred because either:</P>

            <P>(i) Within one year after publication of a notice under § 10.6(c) of this part, no Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization has sent a written claim for the cultural items to the appropriate Federal agency, or no lineal descendant <PRTPAGE P="210"/>has responded to a notice for human remains and associated funerary objects; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Within two years after knowing or having reason to know that cultural items were excavated or discovered, and removed, the appropriate Federal agency could not reasonably identify any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization or lineal descendant as a potential claimant.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Intentional archaeological excavations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This section carries out section 3 (c) of the Act regarding the custody of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony that are excavated intentionally from Federal or tribal lands after November 16, 1990.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Specific Requirements.</E> These regulations permit the intentional excavation of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony from Federal or tribal lands only if:</P>

            <P>(1) The objects are excavated or removed following the requirements of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) (16 U.S.C. 470aa <E T="03">et seq.</E>) and its implementing regulations. Regarding private lands within the exterior boundaries of any Indian reservation, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) will serve as the issuing agency for any permits required under the Act. For BIA procedures for obtaining such permits, see 25 CFR part 262 or contact the Deputy Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior, Washington, DC 20240. Regarding lands administered for the benefit of Native Hawaiians pursuant to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, and section 4 of Pub. L. 86-3, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands will serve as the issuing agency for any permits required under the Act, with the Hawaii State Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Land and Natural Resources acting in an advisory capacity for such issuance. Procedures and requirements for issuing permits will be consistent with those required by the ARPA and its implementing regulations;</P>
            <P>(2) The objects are excavated after consultation with or, in the case of tribal lands, consent of, the appropriate Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization pursuant to § 10.5;</P>
            <P>(3) The disposition of the objects is consistent with their custody as described in § 10.6; and</P>
            <P>(4) Proof of the consultation or consent is shown to the Federal agency official or other agency official responsible for the issuance of the required permit.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> (1) The Federal agency official must take reasonable steps to determine whether a planned activity may result in the excavation of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony from Federal lands. Prior to issuing any approvals or permits for activities, the Federal agency official must notify in writing the Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations that are likely to be culturally affiliated with any human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony that may be excavated. The Federal agency official must also notify any present-day Indian tribe which aboriginally occupied the area of the planned activity and any other Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations that the Federal agency official reasonably believes are likely to have a cultural relationship to the human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony that are expected to be found. The notice must be in writing and describe the planned activity, its general location, the basis upon which it was determined that human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony may be excavated, and, the basis for determining likely custody pursuant to § 10.6. The notice must also propose a time and place for meetings or consultations to further consider <PRTPAGE P="211"/>the activity, the Federal agency's proposed treatment of any human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony that may be excavated, and the proposed disposition of any excavated human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony. Written notification should be followed up by telephone contact if there is no response in 15 days. Consultation must be conducted pursuant to § 10.5.</P>
            <P>(2) Following consultation, the Federal agency official must complete a written plan of action (described in § 10.5(e)) and execute the actions called for in it.</P>

            <P>(3) If the planned activity is also subject to review under section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), the Federal agency official should coordinate consultation and any subsequent agreement for compliance conducted under that Act with the requirements of § 10.3 (c)(2) and § 10.5. Compliance with these regulations does not relieve Federal agency officials of requirements to comply with section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
            <P>(4) If an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization receives notice of a planned activity or otherwise becomes aware of a planned activity that may result in the excavation of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony on tribal lands, the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization may take appropriate steps to:</P>
            <P>(i) Ensure that the human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony are excavated or removed following § 10.3 (b), and</P>
            <P>(ii) Make certain that the disposition of any human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony excavated intentionally or discovered inadvertently as a result of the planned activity are carried out following § 10.6.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Inadvertent discoveries.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This section carries out section 3 (d) of the Act regarding the custody of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony that are discovered inadvertently on Federal or tribal lands after November 16, 1990.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Discovery.</E> Any person who knows or has reason to know that he or she has discovered inadvertently human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony on Federal or tribal lands after November 16, 1990, must provide immediate telephone notification of the inadvertent discovery, with written confirmation, to the responsible Federal agency official with respect to Federal lands, and, with respect to tribal lands, to the responsible Indian tribe official. The requirements of these regulations regarding inadvertent discoveries apply whether or not an inadvertent discovery is duly reported. If written confirmation is provided by certified mail, the return receipt constitutes evidence of the receipt of the written notification by the Federal agency official or Indian tribe official.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Ceasing activity.</E> If the inadvertent discovery occurred in connection with an on-going activity on Federal or tribal lands, the person, in addition to providing the notice described above, must stop the activity in the area of the inadvertent discovery and make a reasonable effort to protect the human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony discovered inadvertently.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Federal lands.</E> (1) As soon as possible, but no later than three (3) working days after receipt of the written confirmation of notification with respect to Federal lands described in § 10.4 (b), the responsible Federal agency official must:</P>
            <P>(i) Certify receipt of the notification;</P>
            <P>(ii) Take immediate steps, if necessary, to further secure and protect inadvertently discovered human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony, including, as appropriate, stabilization or covering;</P>

            <P>(iii) Notify any known lineal descendants of a deceased Native American individual whose human remains and associated funerary objects were discovered of such discovery, and, with respect to a discovery of human remains, associated funerary objects, unassociated funerary objects, sacred <PRTPAGE P="212"/>objects, or objects of cultural patrimony, notify the Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations likely to be culturally affiliated with the cultural items, the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that aboriginally occupied the area, and any other Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization known to have a cultural relationship to the cultural items. This notification must be by telephone with written confirmation and must include information about the kinds of human remains, associated funerary objects, unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony, their condition, and the circumstances of their discovery;</P>
            <P>(iv) Initiate consultation on the inadvertent discovery pursuant to § 10.5;</P>
            <P>(v) If the human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony must be excavated or removed, follow the requirements and procedures in § 10.3 (b) of these regulations; and</P>
            <P>(vi) Ensure that disposition of all inadvertently discovered human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony is carried out following § 10.6.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Resumption of activity.</E> The activity that resulted in the inadvertent discovery may resume thirty (30) days after certification by the notified Federal agency of receipt of the written confirmation of notification of inadvertent discovery if the resumption of the activity is otherwise lawful. The activity may also resume, if otherwise lawful, at any time that a written, binding agreement is executed between the Federal agency and the affiliated Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations that adopt a recovery plan for the excavation or removal of the human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony following § 10.3 (b)(1) of these regulations. The disposition of all human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony must be carried out following § 10.6.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Tribal lands.</E> (1) As soon as possible, but no later than three (3) working days after receipt of the written confirmation of notification with respect to Tribal lands described in § 10.4 (b), the responsible Indian tribe official may:</P>
            <P>(i) Certify receipt of the notification;</P>
            <P>(ii) Take immediate steps, if necessary, to further secure and protect inadvertently discovered human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony, including, as appropriate, stabilization or covering;</P>
            <P>(iii) If the human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony must be excavated or removed, follow the requirements and procedures in § 10.3 (b) of these regulations; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Ensure that disposition of all inadvertently discovered human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony is carried out following § 10.6.</P>
            <P>(2) Resumption of Activity. The activity that resulted in the inadvertent discovery may resume if otherwise lawful after thirty (30) days of the certification of the receipt of notification by the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Federal agency officials.</E> Federal agency officials should coordinate their responsibilities under this section with their emergency discovery responsibilities under section 106 of the National Historical Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 (f) <E T="03">et seq.</E>), 36 CFR 800.11 or section 3 (a) of the Archeological and Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 469 (a-c)). Compliance with these regulations does not relieve Federal agency officials of the requirement to comply with section 106 of the National Historical Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 (f) <E T="03">et seq.</E>), 36 CFR 800.11 or section 3 (a) of the Archeological and Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 469 (a-c)).</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Notification requirement in authorizations.</E> All Federal authorizations to carry out land use activities on Federal lands or tribal lands, including all leases and permits, must include a requirement for the holder of the authorization to notify the appropriate Federal or tribal official immediately upon the discovery of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects <PRTPAGE P="213"/>of cultural patrimony pursuant to § 10.4 (b) of these regulations.</P>

            <P>Consultation as part of the intentional excavation or inadvertent discovery of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony on Federal lands must be conducted in accordance with the following requirements.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Consulting parties.</E> Federal agency officials must consult with known lineal descendants and Indian tribe officials:</P>
            <P>(1) From Indian tribes on whose aboriginal lands the planned activity will occur or where the inadvertent discovery has been made; and</P>
            <P>(2) From Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations that are, or are likely to be, culturally affiliated with the human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony; and</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Initiation of consultation.</E> (1) Upon receiving notice of, or otherwise becoming aware of, an inadvertent discovery or planned activity that has resulted or may result in the intentional excavation or inadvertent discovery of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony on Federal lands, the responsible Federal agency official must, as part of the procedures described in §§ 10.3 and 10.4, take appropriate steps to identify the lineal descendant, Indian tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization entitled to custody of the human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony pursuant to § 10.6 and § 10.14. The Federal agency official shall notify in writing:</P>
            <P>(i) Any known lineal descendants of the deceased Native American individual whose human remains and associated funerary objects have been or are likely to be excavated intentionally or discovered inadvertently; and</P>

            <P>(2) The notice must propose a time and place for meetings or consultation to further consider the intentional excavation or inadvertent discovery, the Federal agency's proposed treatment of the human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony that may be excavated, and the proposed disposition of any intentionally excavated or inadvertently discovered human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony.</P>
            <P>(3) The consultation must seek to identify traditional religious leaders who should also be consulted and seek to identify, where applicable, lineal descendants and Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations affiliated with the human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Provision of information.</E> During the consultation process, as appropriate, the Federal agency official must provide the following information in writing to the lineal descendants and the officials of Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations that are or are likely to be affiliated with the <PRTPAGE P="214"/>human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony excavated intentionally or discovered inadvertently on Federal lands:</P>

For the purposes of this section, custody means ownership or control of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony excavated intentionally or discovered inadvertently in Federal or tribal lands after November 16, 1990. Custody of these human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony is, with priority given in the order listed:</P>
            <P>(1) In the case of human remains and associated funerary objects, in the lineal descendant of the deceased individual as determined pursuant to § 10.14 (b);</P>
            <P>(2) When a lineal descendant of a deceased Native American individual cannot be ascertained with respect to the human remains and associated funerary objects, and with respect to unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony:</P>
            <P>(i) In the Indian tribe on whose tribal land the human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony were excavated intentionally or discovered inadvertently;</P>
            <P>(ii) In the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that has the closest cultural affiliation with the human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony as determined pursuant to § 10.14 (c); or</P>
            <P>(iii) In circumstances in which the cultural affiliation of the human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony cannot be ascertained and the objects were excavated intentionally or discovered inadvertently on Federal land that is recognized by a final judgment of the Indian Claims Commission or the United States Court of Claims as the aboriginal land of an Indian tribe:</P>
            <P>(A) In the Indian tribe aboriginally occupying the Federal land on which the human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony were excavated intentionally or discovered inadvertently, or</P>
            <P>(B) If a preponderance of the evidence shows that a different Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization has a stronger cultural relationship with the human remains, associated funerary objects, unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony, in the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that has the strongest demonstrated relationship with the cultural items.</P>
            <P>(b) Custody of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony and other provisions of the Act apply to all intentional excavations and inadvertent discoveries made after November 16, 1990, including those made before the effective date of these regulations.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Final notice, claims and disposition with respect to Federal lands.</E> Upon determination of the lineal descendant, Indian tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization that under these regulations appears to be entitled to custody of particular human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony excavated intentionally or discovered inadvertently on Federal lands, the responsible Federal agency official must, subject to the notice required herein and the limitations of § 10.15, transfer custody of the objects to the lineal descendant, Indian tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization following appropriate procedures, <PRTPAGE P="216"/>which must respect traditional customs and practices of the affiliated Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations in each instance. Prior to any such disposition by a Federal agency official, the Federal agency official must publish general notices of the proposed disposition in a newspaper of general circulation in the area in which the human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony were excavated intentionally or discovered inadvertently and, if applicable, in a newspaper of general circulation in the area(s) in which affiliated Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations members now reside. The notice must provide information as to the nature and affiliation of the human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony and solicit further claims to custody. The notice must be published at least two (2) times at least a week apart, and the transfer must not take place until at least thirty (30) days after the publication of the second notice to allow time for any additional claimants to come forward. If additional claimants do come forward and the Federal agency official cannot clearly determine which claimant is entitled to custody, the Federal agency must not transfer custody of the objects until such time as the proper recipient is determined pursuant to these regulations. The Federal agency official must send a copy of the notice and information on when and in what newspaper(s) the notice was published to the Manager, National NAGPRA Program.</P>

The purpose of the inventory is to facilitate repatriation by providing clear descriptions of human remains and associated funerary objects and establishing the cultural affiliation between these objects and present-day Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations. Museums and Federal agencies are encouraged to produce inventories first on those portions of their collections for which information is readily available or about which Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations have expressed special interest. Early focus on these parts of collections will result in determinations that may serve as models for other inventories. Federal agencies must ensure that these requirements are met for all collections from their lands or generated by their actions whether the collections are held by the Federal agency or by a non-Federal institution.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony</E>—(1) <E T="03">Criteria.</E> Upon the request of a lineal descendant, Indian tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization, a museum or Federal agency must expeditiously repatriate unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony if all the following criteria are met:</P>
            <P>(i) The object meets the definitions established in § 10.2 (d)(2)(ii), (d)(3), or (d)(4); and</P>
            <P>(ii) The cultural affiliation of the object is established:</P>
            <P>(A) Through the summary, consultation, and notification procedures in § 10.14 of these regulations; or</P>
            <P>(B) By presentation of a preponderance of the evidence by a requesting Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization under section 7(a)(4) of the Act; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The known lineal descendant or culturally affiliated Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization presents evidence which, if standing alone before the introduction of evidence to the contrary, would support a finding that the museum or Federal agency does not have a right of possession to the objects as defined in § 10.10 (a)(2); and</P>
            <P>(iv) The agency or museum is unable to present evidence to the contrary proving that it does have a right of possession as defined below; and</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Right of possession.</E> For purposes of this section, “right of possession” means possession obtained with the voluntary consent of an individual or group that had authority of alienation. The original acquisition of a Native American unassociated funerary object, sacred object, or object of cultural patrimony from an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization with the voluntary consent of an individual or group with authority to alienate such object is deemed to give right of possession to that object.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Notification.</E> Repatriation must take place within ninety (90) days of receipt of a written request for repatriation that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section from a lineal descendent or culturally affiliated Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization, provided that the repatriation may not occur until at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice of intent to repatriate in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as described in § 10.8.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Human remains and associated funerary objects</E>—(1) <E T="03">Criteria.</E> Upon the request of a lineal descendant, Indian tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization, a museum and Federal agency must expeditiously repatriate human remains and associated funerary objects if all of the following criteria are met:</P>
            <P>(i) The human remains or associated funerary object meets the definitions established in § 10.2 (d)(1) or (d)(2)(i); and</P>
            <P>(ii) The affiliation of the deceased individual to known lineal descendant, present day Indian tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization:</P>
            <P>(A) Has been reasonably traced through the procedures outlined in § 10.9 and § 10.14 of these regulations; or</P>
            <P>(B) Has been shown by a preponderance of the evidence presented by a requesting Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization under section 7(a)(4) of the Act; and</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> These requirements for repatriation do not apply to:</P>

            <P>(1) Circumstances where human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony are indispensable to the completion of a specific scientific study, the outcome of which is of major benefit to the United States. Human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony in such circumstances must be returned no later than ninety (90) days after completion of the study; or<PRTPAGE P="223"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) Circumstances where there are multiple requests for repatriation of human remains, associated funerary objects, unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony and the museum or Federal agency, after complying with this part, cannot determine by a preponderance of the evidence which competing requesting party is the most appropriate claimant. In these circumstances, the museum or Federal agency may retain the cultural items in question until the competing requesting parties agree upon the appropriate recipient or the dispute is otherwise resolved pursuant to these regulations or by a court of competent jurisdiction; or</P>
            <P>(3) Circumstances where a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that the repatriation of the human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony in the possession or control of a museum would result in a taking of property without just compensation within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, in which event the custody of the objects must be as provided under otherwise applicable law. Nothing in these regulations must prevent a museum or Federal agency, where otherwise so authorized, or a lineal descendant, Indian tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization, from expressly relinquishing title to, right of possession of, or control over any human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony.</P>
            <P>(4) Circumstances where the repatriation is not consistent with other repatriation limitations identified in § 10.15 of these regulations.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Place and manner of repatriation.</E> The repatriation of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony must be accomplished by the museum or Federal agency in consultation with the requesting lineal descendants, or culturally affiliated Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization, as appropriate, to determine the place and manner of the repatriation.</P>

            <P>(f) <E T="03">Record of repatriation.</E> (1) Museums and Federal agencies must adopt internal procedures adequate to permanently document the content and recipients of all repatriations.</P>
            <P>(2) The museum official or Federal agency official, at the request of the Indian tribe official, may take such steps as are considered necessary pursuant to otherwise applicable law, to ensure that information of a particularly sensitive nature is not made available to the general public.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Culturally unidentifiable human remains.</E> If the cultural affiliation of human remains cannot be established under this part, the human remains must be considered culturally unidentifiable.</P>
            <P>(1) Museum and Federal agency officials must report the inventory information regarding these human remains in their holdings to the Manager, National NAGPRA Program, who will send this information to the Review Committee.</P>
            <P>(2) The Review Committee will:</P>
            <P>(i) Compile an inventory of culturally unidentifiable human remains in the possession or control of each museum and Federal agency; and</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains and associated funerary objects.</E> (1) A museum or Federal agency that is unable to prove that it has right of possession, as defined at § 10.10(a)(2), to culturally unidentifiable human remains must offer to transfer control of the human remains to Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations in the following priority order:</P>
            <P>(i) The Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization from whose tribal land, at the time of the excavation or removal, the human remains were removed; or</P>

            <P>(ii) The Indian tribe or tribes that are recognized as aboriginal to the area from which the human remains were <PRTPAGE P="225"/>removed.

            <P>(g) <E T="03">How the Secretary determines the penalty amount.</E> (1) The penalty amount must be determined on the record;</P>

            <P>(2) The penalty amount must be .25 percent of your museum's annual budget, or $6,834, whichever is less, and such additional sum as the Secretary may <PRTPAGE P="229"/>determine is appropriate after taking into account:</P>
            <P>(i) The archeological, historical, or commercial value of the human remains, funerary object, sacred object, or object of cultural patrimony involved; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The damages suffered, both economic and non-economic, by the aggrieved party or parties including, but not limited to, expenditures by the aggrieved party to compel the museum to comply with the Act; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The number of violations that have occurred at your museum.</P>
            <P>(3) An additional penalty of up to $1,368 per day after the date that the final administrative decision takes effect may be assessed if your museum continues to violate the Act.</P>
            <P>(4) The Secretary may reduce the penalty amount if there is:</P>
            <P>(i) A determination that you did not willfully fail to comply; or</P>
            <P>(ii) An agreement by you to mitigate the violation, including, but not limited to, payment of restitution to the aggrieved party or parties; or</P>
            <P>(iii) A determination that you are unable to pay, provided that this factor may not apply if you have been previously found to have failed to comply with these regulations; or,</P>
            <P>(iv) A determination that the penalty constitutes excessive punishment under the circumstances.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">How the Secretary assesses the penalty.</E> (1) The Secretary considers all available information, including information provided during the process of assessing civil penalties or furnished upon further request by the Secretary.</P>
            <P>(2) The Secretary may assess the civil penalty upon completing informal discussions or when the period for requesting a hearing expires, whichever is later.</P>
            <P>(3) The Secretary notifies you in writing of the penalty amount assessed by serving a written notice of assessment, either in person or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested). The notice of assessment includes:</P>
            <P>(i) The basis for determining the penalty amount assessed and/or any offer to mitigate or remit the penalty; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Notification of the right to request a hearing, including the procedures to follow, and to seek judicial review of any final administrative decision that assesses a civil penalty.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Actions that you may take upon receipt of a notice of assessment.</E> If you are served with a notice of assessment, you may do one of the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Accept in writing or by payment of the proposed penalty, or any mitigation or remission offered in the notice of assessment. If you accept the proposed penalty, mitigation, or remission, you waive the right to request a hearing.</P>
            <P>(2) Seek informal discussions with the Secretary.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">File a petition for relief.</E> You may file a petition for relief within 45 calendar days of receiving the notice of assessment. A petition for relief is to be sent to the NAGPRA Civil Penalties Coordinator, National NAGPRA Program, at the mailing address listed on the National NAGRPA Contact Information Web site, <E T="03">http://www.nps.gov/nagpra/CONTACTS/INDEX.HTM.</E> Your petition may ask the Secretary not to assess a penalty or to reduce the penalty amount.

            <P>(ii) Fully explain the legal or factual basis for the requested relief.</P>
            <P>(4) Request a hearing. Figure 1 outlines the civil penalty hearing and appeal process.</P>
            <P>(i) In addition to the documentation required in paragraph (g) of this section, your request must include a copy of the notice of assessment and must identify the basis for challenging the assessment.</P>
            <P>(ii) In this hearing, the amount of the civil penalty assessed must be determined in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section, and will not be limited to the amount assessed by the Secretary or any offer of mitigation or remission made by the Secretary.</P>

            <P>(iv) State your preferred place and date for a hearing.</P>
            <P>(2) Your failure to file a written request for a hearing within 45 days of the date of service of a notice of failure to comply or notice of assessment waives your right to a hearing.</P>
            <P>(3) Upon receiving a request for a hearing, the Hearings Division assigns an administrative law judge to the case, gives notice of assignment promptly to the parties, and files all pleadings, papers, and other documents in the proceeding directly with the administrative law judge, with copies served on the opposing party.</P>
            <P>(4) Subject to the provisions of 43 CFR 1.3, you may appear by representative or by counsel, and may participate fully in the proceedings. If you fail to appear and the administrative law judge determines that this failure is without good cause, the administrative law judge may, in his/her discretion, determine that this failure waives your right to a hearing and consent to the making of a decision on the record.</P>
            <P>(5) Departmental counsel, designated by the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior, represents the Secretary in the proceedings. Upon notice to the Secretary of the assignment of an administrative law judge to the case, this counsel must enter his/her appearance on behalf of the Secretary and must file all petitions and correspondence exchanges by the Secretary and the respondent that become part of the hearing record. Thereafter, you must serve all documents for the Secretary on his/her counsel.</P>

            <P>(i) The administrative law judge has all powers accorded by law and necessary to preside over the parties and the proceedings and to make decisions under 5 U.S.C. 554-557.</P>
            <P>(ii) The transcript of testimony; the exhibits; and all papers, documents, and requests filed in the proceedings constitute the record for decision. The administrative law judge renders a written decision upon the record, which sets forth his/her findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the reasons and basis for them.</P>
            <P>(iii) Unless you file a notice of appeal described in these regulations, the administrative law judge's decision constitutes the final administrative determination of the Secretary in the matter and takes effect 30 calendar days from this decision.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">How you appeal a decision.</E> (1) Either you or the Secretary may appeal the decision of an administrative law judge by filing a Notice of Appeal. Send your Notice of Appeal to the Interior Board of Indian Appeals, Office of Hearings and Appeals, U.S. Department of the Interior, 800 North Quincy Street, Suite 300, Arlington, VA 22203, within 30 calendar days of the date of the administrative law judge's decision. The notice must be accompanied by proof of service on the administrative law judge and the opposing party.</P>
            <P>(2) To the extent they are not inconsistent with these regulations, the provisions of the Department of the Interior Hearings and Appeals Procedures in 43 CFR part 4, subpart D, apply to such appeal proceedings. The appeal board's decision on the appeal must be in writing and takes effect as the final administrative determination of the Secretary on the date that the decision is rendered, unless otherwise specified in the decision.</P>

            <P>(3) You may obtain copies of decisions in civil penalty proceedings instituted under the Act by sending a request to the Interior Board of Indian Appeals, Office of Hearings and Appeals, U.S. Department of the Interior, 800 North Quincy Street, Suite 300, Arlington, VA 22203. Fees for this service are established by the director of that office.<PRTPAGE P="231"/>
            </P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">The final administrative decision.</E> (1) When you have been served with a notice of assessment and have accepted the penalty as provided in these regulations, the notice constitutes the final administrative decision.</P>
            <P>(2) When you have been served with a notice of assessment and have not filed a timely request for a hearing as provided in these regulations, the notice of assessment constitutes the final administrative decision.</P>
            <P>(3) When you have been served with a notice of assessment and have filed a timely request for a hearing as provided in these regulations, the decision resulting from the hearing or any applicable administrative appeal from it constitutes the final administrative decision.</P>
            <P>(m) <E T="03">How you pay the penalty.</E> (1) If you are assessed a civil penalty, you have 45 calendar days from the date of issuance of the final administrative decision to make full payment of the penalty assessed to the Secretary, unless you have filed a timely request for appeal with a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
            <P>(2) If you fail to pay the penalty, the Secretary may request the Attorney General of the United States to collect the penalty by instituting a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the district in which your museum is located. In these actions, the validity and amount of the penalty is not subject to review by the court.</P>
            <P>(3) Assessing a penalty under this section is not a waiver by the Secretary of the right to pursue other available legal or administrative remedies.</P>

            <P>(b) New holdings or collections.</P>
            <P>(1) Any museum or Federal agency that, after completion of the summaries and inventories as required by §§ 10.8 and 10.9, receives a new holding or collection or locates a previously unreported current holding or collection that may include human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects or objects of cultural patrimony, must:</P>
            <P>(i) Within 6 months of receiving a new holding or collection or locating a previously unreported current holding or collection, or within 6 months of the effective date of this rule, whichever is later, provide a summary of the holding or collection as required by § 10.8 to any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that is, or is likely to be, affiliated with the collection; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Within 2 years of receiving a new holding or collection or locating a previously unreported current holding or collection, or within 2 years of the effective date of this rule, whichever is later, prepare, in consultation with any affiliated Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization, an inventory as required by § 10.9 of these regulations. Any museum that has made a good faith effort to complete its inventory, but which will be unable to complete the process by this deadline, may request an extension of the time requirements under § 10.9(f).</P>

            <P>(2) Additional pieces or fragments of previously repatriated human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony may be returned to the appropriate Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization without publication of a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> as otherwise required under §§ 10.8(f) and 10.9(e), if they do not change the number or cultural affiliation of the cultural items listed in the previous notice.</P>

            <P>(3) A museum or Federal agency that receives a new holding or collection for which a summary or inventory was previously prepared, as required by §§ 10.8 or 10.9, may rely upon the previously prepared documents. The receiving museum or Federal agency must provide a copy of the previously prepared summary or inventory to all affiliated Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations, along with notification that the receiving museum or Federal agency has assumed possession <PRTPAGE P="232"/>and control of the holding or collection.</P>
            <P>(c) New Indian tribes.</P>
            <P>(1) Any museum or Federal agency that has possession or control of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony that are, or are likely to be, culturally affiliated with a newly Federally recognized Native American tribe, must:</P>
            <P>(i) Within 6 months of the publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of the Native American group's placement on the list of Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible to Receive Services from the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs, or within 6 months of the effective date of this rule, whichever is later, provide a summary of the collection as required by § 10.8 to that Indian tribe; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Within 2 years of the publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of the Native American group's placement on the list of Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible to Receive Services from the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs, or within 2 years of the effective date of this rule, whichever is later, prepare, in consultation with the newly recognized culturally affiliated Indian tribe an inventory as required by § 10.9. Any museum that has made a good faith effort to complete its inventory, but which will be unable to complete the process by this deadline, may request an extension of the time requirements under § 10.9(f).</P>

            <P>(2) The list of Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible to Receive Services from the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as required by section 104 of the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994 (25 U.S.C. 479a-1 (2006)).</P>
            <P>(d) New Federal funds.

            <P>(1) Within 3 years of the date of receipt of Federal funds, or within 3 years of the effective date of this rule, whichever is later, provide a summary of the collection as required by § 10.8 to any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that is, or is likely to be, culturally affiliated with the collections; and</P>
            <P>(2) Within 5 years of the date of receipt of Federal funds, or within 5 years of the effective date of this rule, whichever is later, prepare, in consultation with any affiliated Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization, an inventory as required by § 10.9.</P>
            <P>(e) Amendment of previous decision.</P>

            <P>(1) Any museum or Federal agency that has previously published a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> regarding the intent to repatriate unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony under § 10.8(f), or the completion of an inventory of Native American human remains and associated funerary objects as required by § 10.9(e), must publish an amendment to that notice if, based on subsequent information, the museum or Federal agency revises its decision in a way that changes the number or cultural affiliation of the cultural items listed.</P>

            <P>(2) Repatriation may not occur until at least 30 days after publication of the amended notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

            <SUBJECT>Lineal descent and cultural affiliation.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This section identifies procedures for determining lineal descent and cultural affiliation between present-day individuals and Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations and human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony in museum or Federal agency collections or excavated intentionally or discovered inadvertently from Federal lands. They may also be used by Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations with respect to tribal lands.<PRTPAGE P="233"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Criteria for determining lineal descent.</E> A lineal descendant is an individual tracing his or her ancestry directly and without interruption by means of the traditional kinship system of the appropriate Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization or by the common law system of descendence to a known Native American individual whose remains, funerary objects, or sacred objects are being requested under these regulations. This standard requires that the earlier person be identified as an individual whose descendants can be traced.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Criteria for determining cultural affiliation.</E> Cultural affiliation means a relationship of shared group identity that may be reasonably traced historically or prehistorically between a present-day Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization and an identifiable earlier group. All of the following requirements must be met to determine cultural affiliation between a present-day Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization and the human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony of an earlier group:</P>
            <P>(1) Existence of an identifiable present-day Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization with standing under these regulations and the Act; and</P>
            <P>(2) Evidence of the existence of an identifiable earlier group. Support for this requirement may include, but is not necessarily limited to evidence sufficient to:</P>
            <P>(i) Establish the identity and cultural characteristics of the earlier group,</P>
            <P>(ii) Document distinct patterns of material culture manufacture and distribution methods for the earlier group, or</P>
            <P>(iii) Establish the existence of the earlier group as a biologically distinct population; and</P>
            <P>(3) Evidence of the existence of a shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the present-day Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization and the earlier group. Evidence to support this requirement must establish that a present-day Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization has been identified from prehistoric or historic times to the present as descending from the earlier group.</P>
            <P>(d) A finding of cultural affiliation should be based upon an overall evaluation of the totality of the circumstances and evidence pertaining to the connection between the claimant and the material being claimed and should not be precluded solely because of some gaps in the record.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Evidence.</E> Evidence of a kin or cultural affiliation between a present-day individual, Indian tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization and human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony must be established by using the following types of evidence: Geographical, kinship, biological, archeological, anthropological, linguistic, folklore, oral tradition, historical, or other relevant information or expert opinion.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Standard of proof.</E> Lineal descent of a present-day individual from an earlier individual and cultural affiliation of a present-day Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization to human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. Claimants do not have to establish cultural affiliation with scientific certainty.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 10.15</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Limitations and remedies.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Failure to claim prior to repatriation.</E> (1) Any person who fails to make a timely claim prior to the repatriation or disposition of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony is deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to claim such items pursuant to these regulations or the Act. For these purposes, a “timely claim” means the filing of a written claim with a responsible museum or Federal agency official prior to the time the particular human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony at issue are duly repatriated or disposed of to a claimant by a museum or Federal agency pursuant to these regulations.</P>

            <P>(2) If there is more than one (1) claimant, the human remains, funerary <PRTPAGE P="234"/>object, sacred object, or objects of cultural patrimony may be held by the responsible museum or Federal agency or person in possession thereof pending resolution of the claim. Any person who is in custody of such human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony and does not claim entitlement to them must place the objects in the possession of the responsible museum or Federal agency for retention until the question of custody is resolved.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Failure to claim where no repatriation or disposition has occurred.</E> [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Exhaustion of remedies.</E> (1) A person's administrative remedies are exhausted only when the person has filed a written claim with the responsible Federal agency and the claim has been duly denied under this part. This paragraph applies to both:</P>
            <P>(i) Human remains, associated funerary objects, unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony subject to Subpart B of this part; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Federal collections subject to Subpart C of this part.</P>
            <P>(2) A Federal agency's final denial of a repatriation request constitutes a final agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 704). As used in this paragraph, “repatriation request” means the request of a lineal descendant, Indian tribe, or Native Hawaiian organization for repatriation or disposition of human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony brought under the Act and this part.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Savings provisions.</E> Nothing in these regulations can be construed to:</P>
            <P>(1) Limit the authority of any museum or Federal agency to:</P>
            <P>(i) Return or repatriate human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony to Indian tribes, Native Hawaiian organizations, or individuals; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Enter into any other agreement with the consent of the culturally affiliated Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization as to the disposition of, or control over, human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony.</P>
            <P>(2) Delay actions on repatriation requests that were pending on November 16, 1990;</P>
            <P>(3) Deny or otherwise affect access to court;</P>
            <P>(4) Limit any procedural or substantive right which may otherwise be secured to individuals or Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations; or</P>
            <P>(5) Limit the application of any State or Federal law pertaining to theft of stolen property.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Scope and applicability.</SUBJECT>

            <P>The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 9601 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> and the Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. 1251-1376, provide that natural resource trustees may assess damages to natural resources resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance covered under CERCLA or the CWA and may seek to recover those damages. This part supplements the procedures established under the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), 40 CFR part 300, for the identification, investigation, study, and response to a discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance, and it provides a procedure by which a natural resource trustee can determine compensation for injuries to natural resources that have not been nor are expected to be addressed by response actions conducted pursuant to the NCP. The assessment procedures set forth in this part are not mandatory. However, they must be used by Federal or State natural resource trustees in order to obtain the rebuttable presumption contained in section 107(f)(2)(C) of CERCLA. This part applies to assessments initiated after the effective date of this final rule.</P>

            <P>The purpose of this part is to provide standardized and cost-effective procedures for assessing natural resource damages. The results of an assessment performed by a Federal or State natural resource trustee according to these procedures shall be accorded the evidentiary status of a rebuttable presumption as provided in section 107(f)(2)(C) of CERCLA.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 11.13</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Overview.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The process established by this part uses a planned and phased approach to the assessment of natural resource damages. This approach is designed to ensure that all procedures used in an assessment, performed pursuant to this part, are appropriate, necessary, and sufficient to assess damages for injuries to natural resources.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Preassessment phase.</E> Subpart B of this part, the preassessment phase, provides for notification, coordination, and emergency activities, if necessary, and includes the preassessment screen. The preassessment screen is meant to be a rapid review of readily available information that allows the authorized official to make an early decision on whether a natural resource damage assessment can and should be performed.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Assessment Plan phase.</E> If the authorized official decides to perform an assessment, an Assessment Plan, as described in subpart C of this part, is prepared. The Assessment Plan ensures that the assessment is performed in a planned and systematic manner and that the methodologies chosen demonstrate reasonable cost.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Type A assessments.</E> The simplified assessments provided for in section 301(c)(2)(A) of CERCLA are performed using the standard procedures specified in subpart D of this part.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Type B assessments.</E> Subpart E of this part covers the assessments provided for in section 301(c)(2)(B) of CERCLA. The process for implementing type B assessments has been divided into the following three phases.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Injury Determination phase.</E> The purpose of this phase is to establish that one or more natural resources have been injured as a result of the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance. The sections of subpart E comprising the Injury Determination phase include definitions of injury, guidance on determining pathways, and testing and sampling methods. <PRTPAGE P="237"/>These methods are to be used to determine both the pathways through which resources have been exposed to oil or a hazardous substance and the nature of the injury.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Quantification phase.</E> The purpose of this phase is to establish the extent of the injury to the resource in terms of the loss of services that the injured resource would have provided had the discharge or release not occurred. The sections of subpart E comprising the Quantification phase include methods for establishing baseline conditions, estimating recovery periods, and measuring the degree of service reduction stemming from an injury to a natural resource.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Damage Determination phase.</E> The purpose of this phase is to establish the appropriate compensation expressed as a dollar amount for the injuries established in the Injury Determination phase and measured in the Quantification phase. The sections of subpart E of this part comprising the Damage Determination phase include guidance on acceptable cost estimating and valuation methodologies for determining compensation based on the costs of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources, plus, at the discretion of the authorized official, compensable value, as defined in § 11.83(c) of this part.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Post-assessment phase.</E> Subpart F of this part includes requirements to be met after the assessment is complete. The Report of Assessment contains the results of the assessment, and documents that the assessment has been carried out according to this rule. Other post-assessment requirements delineate the manner in which the demand for a sum certain shall be presented to a responsible party and the steps to be taken when sums are awarded as damages.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Reporting requirements and definition.</E> (1) In the event of a natural resource emergency, the natural resource trustee shall contact the National Response Center (800/424-8802) to report the actual or threatened discharge or release and to request that an immediate response action be taken.</P>
            <P>(2) An emergency is any situation related to a discharge or release requiring immediate action to avoid an irreversible loss of natural resources or to prevent or reduce any continuing danger to natural resources, or a situation in which there is a similar need for emergency action.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Emergency actions.</E> If no immediate response actions are taken at the site of the discharge or release by the EPA or the U.S. Coast Guard within the time that the natural resource trustee determines is reasonably necessary, or if such actions are insufficient, the natural resource trustee should exercise any existing authority <PRTPAGE P="243"/>he may have to take on-site response actions. The natural resource trustee shall determine whether the potentially responsible party, if his identity is known, is taking or will take any response action. If no on-site response actions are taken, the natural resource trustee may undertake limited off-site restoration action consistent with its existing authority to the extent necessary to prevent or reduce the immediate migration of the oil or hazardous substance onto or into the resource for which the Federal or State agency or Indian tribe may assert trusteeship.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Limitations on emergency actions.</E> The natural resource trustee may undertake only those actions necessary to abate the emergency situation, consistent with its existing authority. The normal procedures provided in this part must be followed before any additional restoration actions other than those necessary to abate the emergency situation are undertaken. The burden of proving that emergency restoration was required and that restoration costs were reasonable and necessary based on information available at the time rests with the natural resource trustee.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General limitations.</E> Until the authorized official has made the determination required in § 11.23 of this part to proceed with an assessment, field sampling of natural resources should be limited to the conditions identified in this section. All sampling and field work shall be subject to the provisions of § 11.17 of this part concerning safety and applicability of resource protection statutes.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Early sampling and data collection.</E> Field samples may be collected or site visits may be made before completing the preassessment screen to preserve data and materials that are likely to be lost if not collected at that time and that will be necessary to the natural resource damage assessment. Field sampling and data collection at this stage should be coordinated with the lead agency under the NCP to minimize duplication of sampling and data collection efforts. Such field sampling and data collection should be limited to:</P>
            <P>(1) Samples necessary to preserve perishable materials considered likely to have been affected by, and contain evidence of, the oil or hazardous substance. These samples generally will be biological materials that are either dead or visibly injured and that evidence suggests have been injured by oil or a hazardous substance;</P>
            <P>(2) Samples of other ephemeral conditions or material, such as surface water or soil containing or likely to contain oil or a hazardous substance, where those samples may be necessary for identification and for measurement of concentrations, and where necessary samples may be lost because of factors such as dilution, movement, decomposition, or leaching if not taken immediately; and</P>
            <P>(3) Counts of dead or visibly injured organisms, which may not be possible to take if delayed because of factors such as decomposition, scavengers, or water movement. Such counts shall be subject to the provisions of § 11.71(l)(5)(iii) of this part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Preassessment screen—general.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirement.</E> Before beginning any assessment efforts under this part, except as provided for under the emergency restoration provisions of § 11.21 of this part, the authorized official shall complete a preassessment screen and make a determination as to whether an assessment under this part shall be carried out.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of the preassessment screen is to provide a rapid review of readily available information that focuses on resources for which the Federal or State agency or Indian tribe may assert trusteeship under section 107(f) or section 126(d) of CERCLA. This review should ensure that there is a reasonable probability of making a successful claim before monies and efforts are expended in carrying out an assessment.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination.</E> When the authorized official has decided to proceed with an assessment under this part, the authorized official shall document the decision in terms of the criteria provided in paragraph (e) of this section in <PRTPAGE P="244"/>a Preassessment Screen Determination. This Preassessment Screen Determination shall be included in the Report of Assessment described in § 11.90 of this part.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Content.</E> The preassessment screen shall be conducted in accordance with the guidance provided in this section and in § 11.24—Preassessment screen—information on the site and § 11.25—Preassessment screen—preliminary identification of resources potentially at risk, of this part.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Criteria.</E> Based on information gathered pursuant to the preassessment screen and on information gathered pursuant to the NCP, the authorized official shall make a preliminary determination that all of the following criteria are met before proceeding with an assessment:</P>
            <P>(1) A discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance has occurred;</P>
            <P>(2) Natural resources for which the Federal or State agency or Indian tribe may assert trusteeship under CERCLA have been or are likely to have been adversely affected by the discharge or release;</P>
            <P>(3) The quantity and concentration of the discharged oil or released hazardous substance is sufficient to potentially cause injury, as that term is used in this part, to those natural resources;</P>
            <P>(4) Data sufficient to pursue an assessment are readily available or likely to be obtained at reasonable cost; and</P>
            <P>(5) Response actions, if any, carried out or planned do not or will not sufficiently remedy the injury to natural resources without further action.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Coordination.</E> (1) In a situation where response activity is planned or underway at a particular site, assessment activity shall be coordinated with the lead agency consistent with the NCP.</P>
            <P>(2) Whenever, as part of a response action under the NCP, a preliminary assessment or an OSC Report is to be, or has been, prepared for the site, the authorized official should consult with the lead agency under the NCP, as necessary, and to the extent possible use information or materials gathered for the preliminary assessment or OSC Report, unless doing so would unnecessarily delay the preassessment screen.</P>
            <P>(3) Where a preliminary assessment or an OSC Report does not exist or does not contain the information described in this section, that additional information may be gathered.</P>
            <P>(4) If the natural resource trustee already has a process similar to the preassessment screen, and the requirements of the preassessment screen can be satisfied by that process, the processes may be combined to avoid duplication.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Preassessment phase costs.</E> (1) The following categories of reasonable and necessary costs may be incurred in the preassessment phase of the damage assessment:</P>
            <P>(i) Release detection and identification costs;</P>
            <P>(ii) Trustee identification and notification costs;</P>
            <P>(iii) Potentially injured resource identification costs;</P>
            <P>(iv) Initial sampling, data collection, and evaluation costs;</P>
            <P>(v) Site characterization and preassessment screen costs; and</P>
            <P>(vi) Any other preassessment costs for activities authorized by §§ 11.20 through 11.25 of this part.</P>
            <P>(2) The reasonable and necessary costs for these categories shall be limited to those costs incurred by the authorized official for, and specifically allocable to, site-specific efforts taken during the preassessment phase for assessment of damages to natural resources for which the agency or Indian tribe is acting as trustee. Such costs shall be supported by appropriate records and documentation and shall not reflect regular activities performed by the agency or Indian tribe in management of the natural resource. Activities undertaken as part of the preassessment phase shall be taken in a manner that is cost-effective, as that phrase is used in this part.</P>

            <P>(ii) And the release of a hazardous substance from which such damages resulted have occurred wholly before enactment of CERCLA; or</P>

            <P>(a) If the authorized official determines during the Preassessment Phase that an assessment is warranted, the authorized official must develop a plan for the assessment of natural resource damages.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of the Assessment Plan is to ensure that the assessment is performed in a planned and systematic manner and that methodologies selected from subpart D for a type A assessment or from subpart E for a type B assessment, including the Injury Determination, Quantification, and Damage Determination phases, can be conducted at a reasonable cost, as that phrase is used in this part.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Assessment Plan phase costs.</E> (1) The following categories of reasonable and necessary costs may be incurred in the Assessment Plan phase of the damage assessment:</P>

            <SUBJECT>What does the Assessment Plan include?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General content and level of detail.</E> (1) The Assessment Plan must identify and document the use of all of the type A and/or type B procedures that will be performed.</P>

            <P>(2) The Assessment Plan shall be of sufficient detail to serve as a means of evaluating whether the approach used for assessing the damage is likely to be cost-effective and meets the definition of reasonable cost, as those terms are used in this part. The Assessment Plan shall include descriptions of the natural resources and the geographical areas involved. The Assessment Plan shall also include a statement of the authority for asserting trusteeship, or co-trusteeship, for those natural resources considered within the Assessment Plan. The authorized official's statement of the authority for asserting trusteeship shall not have the force and effect of a rebuttable presumption <PRTPAGE P="247"/>under § 11.91(c) of this part. In addition, for type B assessments, the Assessment Plan shall include the sampling locations within those geographical areas, sample and survey design, numbers and types of samples to be collected, analyses to be performed, preliminary determination of the recovery period, and other such information required to perform the selected methodologies.</P>
            <P>(3) The Assessment Plan shall contain information sufficient to demonstrate that the damage assessment has been coordinated to the extent possible with any remedial investigation feasibility study or other investigation performed pursuant to the NCP.</P>
            <P>(4) The Assessment Plan shall contain procedures and schedules for sharing data, split samples, and results of analyses, when requested, with any identified potentially responsible parties and other natural resource trustees.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Identification of types of assessment procedures.</E> The Assessment Plan must identify whether the authorized official plans to use a type A procedure, type B procedures, or a combination. Sections 11.34 through 11.36 contain standards for deciding which types of procedures to use. The Assessment Plan must include a detailed discussion of how these standards are met.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Specific requirements for type B procedures.</E> If the authorized official plans to use type B procedures, the Assessment Plan must also include the following:</P>
            <P>(1) The results of the confirmation of exposure performed under § 11.37;</P>
            <P>(2) A Quality Assurance Plan that satisfies the requirements listed in the NCP and applicable EPA guidance for quality control and quality assurance plans;</P>

            <P>(4) The Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan developed in accordance with the guidance in § 11.81 of this part. If existing data are not sufficient to develop the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan as part of the Assessment Plan, the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan may be developed later, after the completion of the Injury Determination or Quantification phases. If the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan is published separately, the public review and comment will be conducted pursuant to § 11.81(d) of this part.</P>

            <P>(1) <E T="03">Coordination.</E> (i) If the authorized official's responsibility is shared with other natural resource trustees as a result of coexisting or contiguous natural resources or concurrent jurisdiction, the authorized official shall ensure that all other known affected natural resource trustees are notified that an Assessment Plan is being developed. This notification shall include the results of the Preassessment Screen Determination.</P>
            <P>(ii) Authorized officials from different agencies or Indian tribes are encouraged to cooperate and coordinate any assessments that involve coexisting or contiguous natural resources or concurrent jurisdiction. They may arrange to divide responsibility for implementing the assessment in any manner that is agreed to by all of the affected natural resource trustees with the following conditions:</P>

            <P>(A) A lead authorized official shall be designated to administer the assessment. The lead authorized official shall act as coordinator and contact regarding all aspects of the assessment and shall act as final arbitrator of disputes if consensus among the authorized officials cannot be reached regarding the development, implementation, or any other aspect of the Assessment Plan. The lead authorized official shall be designated by mutual agreement of all <PRTPAGE P="248"/>the natural resource trustees. If consensus cannot be reached as to the designation of the lead authorized official, the lead authorized official shall be designated in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) (B), (C), or (D) of this section:</P>
            <P>(B) When the natural resources being assessed are located on lands or waters subject to the administrative jurisdiction of a Federal agency, a designated official of the Federal agency shall act as the lead authorized official.</P>
            <P>(C) When the natural resources being assessed, pursuant to section 126(d) of CERCLA, are located on lands or waters of an Indian tribe, an official designated by the Indian tribe shall act as the lead authorized official.</P>
            <P>(D) For all other natural resources for which the State may assert trusteeship, a designated official of the State agency shall act as the lead authorized official.</P>
            <P>(iii) If there is a reasonable basis for dividing the assessment, the natural resource trustee may act independently and pursue separate assessments, actions, or claims so long as the claims do not overlap. In these instances, the natural resource trustees shall coordinate their efforts, particularly those concerning the sharing of data and the development of the Assessment Plans.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Identification and involvement of the potentially responsible party.</E> (i) If the lead agency under the NCP for response actions at the site has not identified potentially responsible parties, the authorized official shall make reasonable efforts to identify any potentially responsible parties.</P>
            <P>(ii) In the event the number of potentially responsible parties is large or if some of the potentially responsible parties cannot be located, the authorized official may proceed against any one or more of the parties identified. The authorized official should use reasonable efforts to proceed against most known potentially responsible parties or at least against all those potentially responsible parties responsible for significant portions of the potential injury.</P>
            <P>(iii)(A) The authorized official shall send a Notice of Intent to Perform an Assessment to all identified potentially responsible parties. The Notice shall invite the participation of the potentially responsible party, or, if several parties are involved and if agreed to by the lead authorized official, a representative or representatives designated by the parties, in the development of the type and scope of the assessment and in the performance of the assessment. The Notice shall briefly describe, to the extent known, the site, vessel, or facility involved, the discharge of oil or release of hazardous substance of concern to the authorized official, and the resources potentially at risk. The Notice shall also contain a statement of authority for asserting trusteeship, or co-trusteeship, over those natural resources identified as potentially at risk.</P>
            <P>(B) The authorized official shall allow at least 30 calendar days, with reasonable extensions granted as appropriate, for the potentially responsible party or parties notified to respond to the Notice before proceeding with the development of the Assessment Plan or any other assessment actions.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Plan approval.</E> The authorized official shall have final approval as to the appropriate methodologies to include in the Assessment Plan and any modifications to the Assessment Plan.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Public involvement in the Assessment Plan.</E> (1) The authorized official must make the Assessment Plan available for review by any identified potentially responsible parties, other natural resource trustees, other affected Federal or State agencies or Indian tribes, and any other interested member of the public for a period of at least 30 calendar days, with reasonable extensions granted as appropriate. The authorized official may not perform any type B procedures described in the Assessment Plan until after this review period.</P>

            <P>(2) Any comments concerning the Assessment Plan received from identified potentially responsible parties, other natural resource trustees, other affected Federal or State agencies or Indian tribes, and any other interested members of the public, together with responses to those comments, shall be included as part of the Report of Assessment, described in § 11.90 of this part.<PRTPAGE P="249"/>
            </P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Plan implementation.</E> At the option of the authorized official and if agreed to by any potentially responsible party, or parties acting jointly, the potentially responsible party or any other party under the direction, guidance, and monitoring of the authorized official may implement all or any part of the Assessment Plan finally approved by the authorized official. Any decision by the authorized official to allow or not allow implementation by the potentially responsible party shall be documented in the Assessment Plan.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Plan modification.</E> (1) The Assessment Plan may be modified at any stage of the assessment as new information becomes available.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) Any modification to the Assessment Plan that in the judgment of the authorized official is significant shall be made available for review by any identified potentially responsible party, any other affected natural resource trustees, other affected Federal or State agencies or Indian tribes, and any other interested members of the public for a period of at least 30 calendar days, with reasonable extensions granted as appropriate, before tasks called for in the modified plan are begun.</P>
            <P>(ii) Any modification to the Assessment Plan that in the judgment of the authorized official is not significant shall be made available for review by any identified potentially responsible party, any other affected natural resource trustees, other affected Federal or State agencies or Indian tribes, and any other interested members of the public, but the implementation of such modification need not be delayed as a result of such review.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Plan review.</E> (1) After the Injury Determination phase is completed and before the Quantification phase is begun, the authorized official shall review the decisions incorporated in the Assessment Plan.</P>
            <P>(2) The purpose of this review is to ensure that the selection of methodologies for the Quantification and Damage Determination phases is consistent with the results of the Injury Determination phase, and that the use of such methodologies remains consistent with the requirements of reasonable cost, as that term is used in this part.</P>

            <P>(a) If the authorized official determines under § 11.34 that a type A procedure is available, the authorized official must then decide whether to use that procedure or use type B procedures. The authorized official must make this decision by weighing the difficulty of collecting site-specific data against the suitability of the averaged data and simplifying assumptions in the type A procedure for the release being assessed. The authorized official may use type B procedures if they can be performed at a reasonable cost and if the increase in accuracy provided by those procedures outweighs the increase in assessment costs. Section 1, Volume I of the NRDAM/CME technical document (incorporated by reference, see § 11.18) lists the simplifying assumptions made in the NRDAM/CME. Volumes III through IV of the NRDAM/CME technical document list the data in the NRDAM/CME. Section 1, Volume I of the NRDAM/GLE technical document (incorporated by reference, see § 11.18) lists the simplifying assumptions made in the NRDAM/GLE. Volume III of the NRDAM/GLE technical document lists the data in the NRDAM/GLE.</P>
            <P>(b) The authorized official must use type B procedures rather than a type A procedure whenever a potentially responsible party:</P>
            <P>(1) Submits a written request for use of type B procedures along with documentation of the reasons supporting the request; and</P>
            <P>(2) Advances all reasonable costs of using type B procedures within a time frame acceptable to the authorized official.</P>
            <P>(c) If there is no available type A procedure, the authorized official must use type B procedures to calculate all damages.</P>
            <P>(d) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the authorized official may change the type of procedure used in light of comments received on the Assessment Plan. [See § 11.32(e)(2) to determine if the authorized official must provide for additional public review.] However, if the authorized official decides to use type B procedures in lieu of a type A procedure, and cannot confirm exposure under § 11.37, the authorized official may not then use a type A procedure.</P>

            <P>(b) The type A procedures address the following categories of injury and compensable value:</P>

            <P>(1) Direct mortality of species covered by the NRDAM/CME or NRDAM/GLE resulting from short-term exposure to the released substance. Volume <PRTPAGE P="251"/>IV of the NRDAM/CME technical document (incorporated by reference, see § 11.18) lists the species that the NRDAM/CME covers. Section 3, Volume III of the NRDAM/GLE technical document (incorporated by reference, see § 11.18) lists the species that the NRDAM/GLE covers;</P>

            <P>(7) Lost recreational harvests resulting from any closures specified by the authorized official and/or from population losses;</P>
            <P>(8) For the type A procedure for coastal and marine environments, lost wildlife viewing, resulting from population losses, by residents of the States bordering the provinces in which the population losses occurred. [A province is one of the geographic areas delineated in Table 6.1, Volume I of the NRDAM/CME technical document.] For the type A procedure for Great Lakes environments, lost wildlife viewing, resulting from population losses, by residents of local areas bordering the provinces in which the population losses occurred.

            <P>(d) When the authorized official uses type B procedures for injuries not addressed in a type A procedure, he or she must follow all of subpart E (which contains standards for determining and quantifying injury as well as determining damages), § 11.31(c) (which addresses content of the Assessment Plan), and § 11.37 (which addresses confirmation of exposure). When the authorized official uses type B procedures for compensable values that are not included in a type A procedure but that result from injuries that are addressed in the type A procedure, he or she need not follow all of subpart E, § 11.31(c), and § 11.37. Instead, the authorized official may rely on the injury predictions of the type A procedure and simply use the valuation methodologies authorized by § 11.83(c) to calculate compensable value. When using valuation methodologies, the authorized official must comply with § 11.84.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Assessment Plan—preliminary estimate of damages.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirement.</E> When performing a type B assessment pursuant to the requirements of subpart E of this part, the authorized official shall develop a preliminary estimate of: the anticipated costs of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources for the injured natural resources; and the compensable value, as defined in § 11.83(c) of this part, of the injured natural resources, if the authorized official intends to include compensable value in the damage claim. This preliminary estimate is referred to as the preliminary estimate of damages. The authorized official shall use the guidance provided in this section, to the extent possible, to develop the preliminary estimate of damages.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of the preliminary estimate of damages is for reference in the scoping of the Assessment Plan to ensure that the choice of the scientific, cost estimating, and valuation methodologies expected to be used in the damage assessment fulfills the requirements of reasonable cost, as that term is used in this part. The authorized official will also use the preliminary estimate of damages in the review of the Assessment Plan, as required in § 11.32(f) of this part, to ensure the requirements of reasonable cost are still met.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Steps.</E> The preliminary estimate of damages should include consideration of the ability of the resources to recover naturally and, if relevant, the compensable value through the recovery period with and without possible alternative actions. The authorized official shall consider the following factors, to the extent possible, in making the preliminary estimate of damages:</P>
            <P>(1) The preliminary estimate of costs of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources should include consideration of a range of possible alternative actions that would accomplish the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of the equivalent of the injured natural resources.</P>
            <P>(i) The preliminary estimate of costs should take into account the effects, or anticipated effects, of any response actions.</P>
            <P>(ii) The preliminary estimate of costs should represent the expected present value of anticipated costs, expressed in constant dollars, and should include direct and indirect costs, and include the timing of those costs. The provisions detailed in §§ 11.80-11.84 of this part are the basis for the development of the estimate.</P>
            <P>(iii) The discount rate to be used in developing the preliminary estimate of costs shall be that determined in accordance with the guidance in § 11.84(e) of this part.</P>
            <P>(2) The preliminary estimate of compensable value should be consistent with the range of possible alternatives for restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources being considered.</P>

            <P>(i) The preliminary estimate of compensable value should represent the expected present value of the anticipated compensable value, expressed in constant dollars, accrued through the period for the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources to baseline conditions, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, between the occurrence of the discharge or release and the completion of (A) the restoration or rehabilitation of the injured natural resources to a condition where they can provide the level of services available at baseline, or (B) the replacement and/or acquisition of equivalent natural resources capable of providing such services. The estimate should use the same base year as the preliminary estimate of costs of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources. The provisions detailed in §§ 11.80-11.84 of this part are the basis for the development of this estimate.</P>
            <P>(ii) The preliminary estimate of compensable value should take into account the effects, or anticipated effects, of any response actions.</P>

            <P>(iii) The discount rate to be used in developing the preliminary estimate of <PRTPAGE P="253"/>compensable value shall be that determined in accordance with the guidance in § 11.84(e) of this part.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Content and timing.</E> (1) In making the preliminary estimate of damages, the authorized official should rely upon existing data and studies. The authorized official should not undertake significant new data collection or perform significant modeling efforts at this stage of the assessment planning phase.</P>
            <P>(2) Where possible, the authorized official should make the preliminary estimate of damages before the completion of the Assessment Plan as provided for in § 11.31 of this part. If there is not sufficient existing data to make the preliminary estimate of damages at the same time as the assessment planning phase, this analysis may be completed later, at the end of the Injury Determination phase of the assessment, at the time of the Assessment Plan review.</P>
            <P>(3) The authorized official is not required to disclose the preliminary estimate before the conclusion of the assessment. At the conclusion of the assessment, the preliminary estimate of damages, along with its assumptions and methodology, shall be included in the Report of the Assessment as provided for in § 11.91 of this part.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Review.</E> The authorized official shall review, and revise as appropriate, the preliminary estimate of damages at the end of the Injury Determination and Quantification phases. If there is any significant modification of the preliminary estimate of damages, the authorized official shall document it in the Report of the Assessment.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What are type A procedures?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A type A procedure is a standardized methodology for performing Injury Determination, Quantification, and Damage Determination that requires minimal field observation. There are two type A procedures: the type A procedure for coastal and marine environments; and the type A procedure for Great Lakes environments. The type A procedure for coastal and marine environments incorporates a computer model called the Natural Resource Damage Assessment Model for Coastal and Marine Environments Version 2.51 (NRDAM/CME). The NRDAM/CME technical document (incorporated by reference, see § 11.18) includes and explains the NRDAM/CME. The type A procedure for Great Lakes environments incorporates a computer model called the Natural Resource Damage Assessment Model for Great Lakes Environments Version 1.51 (NRDAM/GLE). The NRDAM/GLE technical document (incorporated by reference, see § 11.18) includes and explains the NRDAM/GLE. The authorized official must follow §§ 11.41 through 11.44 when using the type A procedures.</P>
            <P>(b) The reasonable and necessary costs incurred in conducting assessments under this subpart shall be limited to those costs incurred or anticipated by the authorized official for, and specifically allocable to, incident-specific efforts taken in the assessment of damages for natural resources for which the agency or Indian tribe is acting as trustee. Such costs shall be supported by appropriate records and documentation, and shall not reflect regular activities performed by the agency or the Indian tribe in management of the natural resource. Activities undertaken as part of the damage assessment shall be taken in a manner that is cost-effective, as that phrase is used in this part.</P>

            <P>(2) The method for determining injury to a biological resource, as defined in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, shall be chosen based upon the capability of the method to demonstrate a measurable biological response. An injury can be demonstrated if the authorized official determines that the biological response under consideration can satisfy all of the following acceptance criteria:</P>
            <P>(i) The biological response is often the result of exposure to oil or hazardous substances. This criterion excludes biological responses that are caused predominately by other environmental factors such as disturbance, nutrition, trauma, or weather. The biological response must be a commonly documented response resulting from exposure to oil or hazardous substances.</P>
            <P>(ii) Exposure to oil or hazardous substances is known to cause this biological response in free-ranging organisms. This criterion identifies biological responses that have been documented to occur in a natural ecosystem as a result of exposure to oil or hazardous substances. The documentation must include the correlation of the degree of the biological response to the observed exposure concentration of oil or hazardous substances.</P>
            <P>(iii) Exposure to oil or hazardous substances is known to cause this biological response in controlled experiments. This criterion provides a quantitative confirmation of a biological response occurring under environmentally realistic exposure levels that may be linked to oil or hazardous substance exposure that has been observed in a natural ecosystem. Biological responses that have been documented only in controlled experimental conditions are insufficient to establish correlation with exposure occurring in a natural ecosystem.</P>
            <P>(iv) The biological response measurement is practical to perform and produces scientifically valid results. The biological response measurement must be sufficiently routine such that it is practical to perform the biological response measurement and to obtain scientifically valid results. To meet this criterion, the biological response measurement must be adequately documented in scientific literature, must produce reproducible and verifiable results, and must have well defined and accepted statistical criteria for interpreting as well as rejecting results.</P>
            <P>(3) Unless otherwise provided for in this section, the injury determination must be based upon the establishment of a statistically significant difference in the biological response between samples from populations in the assessment area and in the control area. The determination as to what constitutes a statistically significant difference must be consistent with the quality assurance provisions of the Assessment Plan. The selection of the control area shall be consistent with the guidance provided in § 11.72 of this part.</P>
            <P>(4) The biological responses listed in this paragraph have been evaluated and found to satisfy the acceptance criteria provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. The authorized official may, when appropriate, select from this list to determine injury to fish and wildlife resources or may designate another response as the determiner of injury provided that the designated response can satisfy the acceptance criteria provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. The biological responses are listed by the categories of injury for which they may be applied.</P>

Clinical behavioral signs of toxicity are characteristic behavioral symptoms expressed by an organism in response to exposure to an oil or hazardous substance. The clinical behavioral signs of toxicity used shall be those that have been documented in published literature.<PRTPAGE P="261"/>
            </P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Avoidance.</E> Injury has occurred when a statistically significant difference can be measured in the frequency of avoidance behavior in population samples of fish placed in testing chambers with equal access to water containing oil or a hazardous substance and the control water. The oil or hazardous substance used in the test must be the exact substance or a substance that is reasonably comparable to that suspected to have caused avoidance to the natural populations of fish. This biological response may be used to confirm injury when oil or hazardous substances are suspected to have resulted in avoidance behavior in fish species.</P>

            <P>(A) <E T="03">Fish neoplasm.</E> Injury has occurred when a statistically significant difference can be measured in the frequency of occurrence of the fish neoplasia when comparing population samples from the assessment area and a control area. Neoplasms are characterized by relatively autonomous growth of abnormal cells that by proliferation infiltrate, press upon, or invade healthy tissue thereby causing destruction of cells, interference with physiological functions, or death of the organism. The following type of fish neoplasia may be used to determine injury: liver neoplasia and skin neoplasia. The neoplasms shall be confirmed by histological procedures and such confirmation procedures may also include special staining techniques for specific tissue components, ultra-structural examination using electron microscopy to identify cell origin, and to rule out or confirm viral, protozoan, or other causal agents. Fish neoplasm may be used to determine injury when oil or hazardous substances are suspected to have been the causal agent.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Category of injury—physiological malfunctions.</E> Five biological responses for determining when physiological malfunctions are a result of exposure to the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance have met the acceptance criteria.</P>
            <P>(A) <E T="03">Eggshell thinning.</E> Injury has occurred when eggshell thicknesses for samples for a population of a given species at the assessment area are thinner than those for samples from a population at a control area, or are at least 15 percent thinner than eggshells collected before 1946 from the same geographic area and stored in a museum. This biological response is a measure of avian eggshell thickness resulting from the adult bird having assimilated the oil or hazardous substance. This biological response may be used when the organochlorine pesticide DDT or its metabolites are suspected to have caused such physiological malfunction injury.</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Reduced avian reproduction.</E> Injury has occurred when a statistically significant difference can be measured in the mean number of young fledged per active nest when comparing samples from populations in the assessment area and a control area. The fledging success (the number of healthy young leaving the nest) shall be used as the measurement of injury. Factors that may contribute to this measurement include egg fertility, hatching success, and survival of young. This biological response may be used when oil or hazardous substances are suspected to have reduced the nesting success of avian species.</P>
            <P>(C) <E T="03">Cholinesterase (ChE) enzyme inhibition.</E> Injury has occurred when brain ChE activity in a sample from the population at the assessment area shows a statistically significant inhibition when compared to the mean activity level in samples from populations in a control area. These enzymes are in the nervous systems of vertebrate organisms and the rate of ChE activity is associated with the regulation of nerve impulse transmission. This biological response may be used as a demonstration of physiological malfunction injury to birds, mammals, and reptiles when anti-ChE substances, such as organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides, have been discharged or released.</P>
            <P>(D) <E T="03">Delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) inhibition.</E> Injury has occurred when the activity level of whole blood ALAD in a sample from the population of a given species at an <PRTPAGE P="262"/>assessment area is significantly less than mean values for a population at a control area, and ALAD depression of at least 50 percent can be measured. The ALAD enzyme is associated with the formation of hemoglobin in blood and in chemical detoxification processes in the liver. This biological response is a measure of the rate of ALAD activity. This biological response may be used to determine injury to bird and mammal species that have been exposed to lead.</P>
            <P>(E) <E T="03">Reduced fish reproduction.</E> Injury has occurred when a statistically significant difference in reproduction success between the control organisms and the test organisms can be measured based on the use of published standardized laboratory toxicity testing methodologies. This biological response may be used when the oil or hazardous substance is suspected to have caused a reduction in the reproductive success of fish species. Laboratory partial-chronic and laboratory chronic toxicity tests may be used. The oil or hazardous substance used in the test must be the exact substance or a substance that is reasonably comparable to that suspected to have caused reduced reproductive success in the natural population of fish.</P>
            <P>(vi) <E T="03">Category of injury—physical deformation.</E> Four biological responses for determining when physical deformations are a result of exposure to the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance have met the injury acceptance criteria.</P>

            <P>(2) Using available information, air modeling, and additional field sampling and analysis, it should be determined whether air resources have been exposed to the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance.</P>
            <P>(3)(i) If an air resource is or has likely been exposed, available information and such additional tests as necessary should be used to estimate the areal extent of exposure and the duration and frequency of exposure of such areas to emissions from the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance.</P>
            <P>(ii) The areal extent of exposure is defined as the geographical surface area or space where emissions from the source of discharge or release are found or otherwise determined to be present for such duration and frequency as to potentially result in injury to resources present within the area or space.</P>
            <P>(4) Previous studies of the characteristics discussed in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section should be relied upon if the conditions in the exposed air resource are similar to experimental conditions of the previous studies. In the absence of this information, air sampling and analysis methods identified in § 11.64(d) of this part, air modeling methods, or a combination of these methods may be used in identifying the air exposure pathway and in estimating the areal extent of exposure and duration and frequency of exposure.</P>
            <P>(5) For estimating the areal extent, duration, and frequency of exposure from the discharge or release, the following factors shall be considered as may be appropriate for each emissions event:</P>

            <P>(2)(i) Using available information and the methods listed in § 11.64(e) of this part, it should be determined whether any element of the geologic resource has been exposed to the oil or hazardous substance. If a geologic resource is or has likely been exposed, the areal extent of the exposed geologic resource, including the lateral and vertical extent of the dispersion, should be estimated.</P>

            <P>(2) Biological pathways that resulted from either direct or indirect exposure to the oil or hazardous substance, or from exposure to products of chemical or biological reactions initiated by the discharge or release shall be identified. Direct exposure can result from direct <PRTPAGE P="266"/>physical contact with the discharged oil or released hazardous substance. Indirect exposure can result from food chain processes.</P>
            <P>(3) If the oil or hazardous substance adhered to, bound to, or otherwise covered surface tissue, or was ingested, or inhaled but not assimilated, the area of dispersion may be determined based upon chemical analysis of the appropriate tissues or organs (such as leaves, lungs, stomach, intestine, or their contents) that were directly exposed to the oil or hazardous substance.</P>
            <P>(4) If the oil or hazardous substance was assimilated, the areal dispersion may be determined based upon one or more of the following alternative procedures:</P>
            <P>(i) If direct exposure to the biological resource has occurred, chemical analysis of the organisms that have been exposed may be performed.</P>
            <P>(ii) If indirect exposure to the biological resource has occurred, either chemical analysis of free-ranging biological resources using one or more indicator species as appropriate, or laboratory analysis of one or more in situ placed indicator species as appropriate may be performed.</P>
            <P>(A) <E T="03">Indicator species,</E> as used in this section, means a species of organism selected consistent with the following factors to represent a trophic level of a food chain:</P>

            <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) Extent to which the organism is representative of the food chain of concern.</P>
            <P>(B) Collection of the indicator species should be limited to the number necessary to define the areal dispersion and to provide sufficient sample volume for chemical analysis.</P>
            <P>(C) When in situ procedures are used, indicator species that behave comparably to organisms existing under free-ranging conditions shall be collected. The indicator species used in this procedure shall be obtained either from a control area selected consistent with provisions of § 11.72 of this part or obtained from a suitable supply of wild-strain organisms reared in a laboratory setting. Appropriate chemical analysis shall be performed on a representative subsample of the indicator species before in situ placement.</P>

            <P>(g) <E T="03">Statutory exclusions.</E> In quantifying the effects of the injury, the following statutory exclusions shall be considered, as provided in sections 107 (f), (i), and (j) and 114(c) of CERCLA, that exclude compensation for damages to natural resources that were a result of:</P>
            <P>(1) An irreversible and irretrievable commitment of natural resources identified in an environmental impact statement or other comparable environmental analysis, and the decision to grant the permit or license authorizes such a commitment, and the facility was otherwise operating within the terms of its permit or license, so long as, in the case of damages to an Indian tribe occurring pursuant to a Federal permit or license, the issuance of that license or permit was not inconsistent with the fiduciary duty of the United States with respect to such Indian tribe; or</P>
            <P>(2) The damages and the release of a hazardous substance from which such damages resulted have occurred wholly before the enactment of CERCLA; or</P>
            <P>(3) The application of a pesticide product registered under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C. 135-135k; or</P>
            <P>(4) Any other federally permitted release, as defined in section 101(10) of CERCLA; or</P>
            <P>(5) Resulting from the release or threatened release of recycled oil from a service station dealer as described in section 107(a) (3) or (4) of CERCLA if such recycled oil is not mixed with any other hazardous substance and is stored, treated, transported or otherwise managed in compliance with regulations or standards promulgated pursuant to section 3014 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act and other applicable authorities.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Surface water resources.</E> (1) The area where the injured surface water resource differs from baseline shall be determined by determining the areal extent of oil or hazardous substances in the water or on the sediments.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) Areal variation in concentrations of the discharged or released substances dissolved in or floating on water, adhering to suspended sediments, or adhering to bed, bank, or shoreline sediments from exposed areas should be determined in sufficient detail to approximately map the boundary separating areas with concentrations above baseline from areas with concentrations equal to or less than baseline.</P>
            <P>(ii) The size, shape, and location of the plume may be estimated using time of travel and dispersion data obtained under § 11.63 of this part, since plumes of dissolved or floating substances may be rapidly transported and dispersed in surface water.</P>
            <P>(3) Water and sediment samples may be collected and chemically analyzed and stage, water discharge, or tidal flux measurements made, as appropriate, to collect new data required by this section.</P>

            <P>(4)(i) Within the area determined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section to be above baseline, the services provided by the surface water or sediments that are affected should be determined. This <PRTPAGE P="272"/>determination may include computation of volumes of water or sediments affected, total areas of water or sediment affected, volume of water used from the affected surface water resource, or other appropriate measures.</P>
            <P>(ii) The services should be determined with consideration of potential effects on downstream or downcurrent resources during the recovery period, as determined in § 11.73 of this part, resulting from transport of dissolved substances and of substances adhering to sediments.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Ground water resources.</E> (1) The area where the injured ground water resource differs from baseline should be determined by determining the areal extent of oil or hazardous substances in water or geologic materials in the unsaturated zone and identified geohydrological units, which are aquifers or confining layers, within the assessment area.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) The lateral and vertical extent of discharged or released substances in the unsaturated zone, if it is known to be exposed, should be determined.</P>
            <P>(ii) The lateral and vertical extent of plumes within geohydrologic units known to be exposed should be determined. Concentrations of substances within and adjacent to each plume should be determined in sufficient detail to approximately locate the boundary separating areas with concentrations above baseline from areas with concentrations equal to or less than baseline.</P>
            <P>(3) Water or geologic materials may be sampled and chemically analyzed, or surface-geophysical techniques may be used for collecting new data required by this section. General verification of the plume boundaries by chemical analysis of selected water samples should be done if boundary locations are initially determined by surface-geophysical measurements.</P>
            <P>(4)(i) Within the area determined in paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section to be above baseline, the services provided by the ground water that is affected should be determined. This determination may include computation of the volume of water affected, volume of affected ground water pumped from wells, volume of affected ground water discharged to streams or lakes, or other appropriate measures.</P>
            <P>(ii) The services should be determined with consideration of potential enlargement of the plume during the recovery period, as determined in § 11.73 of this part, resulting from ground water transport of the substances.</P>
            <P>(iii) The effects on the ground water resource during the recovery period resulting from potential remobilization of discharged or released substances that may be adhering, coating, or otherwise bonding to geologic materials should be considered.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Air resources.</E> The area where the injured air resource differs from baseline should be determined by determining the geographical area affected, the degree of impairment of services, and the period of time impairment occurred.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Geologic resources.</E> The area where the injured geologic resource differs from baseline should be determined by determining:</P>
            <P>(1) The surface area of soil with reduced ability to sustain the growth of vegetation from the baseline level;</P>
            <P>(2) The surface area or volume of soil with reduced suitability as habitat for biota from the baseline level;</P>
            <P>(3) The volume of geologic resources that may act as a source of toxic leachate;</P>
            <P>(4) The tonnage of mineral resources whose access, development, or use is restricted as a result of the discharge or release.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Biological resources.</E> (1) The extent to which the injured biological resource differs from baseline should be determined by analysis of the population or the habitat or ecosystem levels. Although it may be necessary to measure populations to determine changes in the habitats or ecosystems, and vice versa, the final result should be expressed as either a population change or a habitat or ecosystem change in order to prevent double counting in the economic analysis. This separation may be ignored only for resources that do not interact significantly and where it can be demonstrated that double counting is being avoided.</P>

            <P>(2) Analysis of population changes or habitat or ecosystem changes should be <PRTPAGE P="273"/>based upon species, habitats, or ecosystems that have been selected from one or more of the following categories:</P>
            <P>(i) Species or habitats that can represent broad components of the ecosystem, either as representatives of a particular ecological type, of a particular food chain, or of a particular service;</P>
            <P>(ii) Species, habitats, or ecosystems that are especially sensitive to the oil or hazardous substance and the recovery of which will provide a useful indicator of successful restoration; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Species, habitats, or ecosystems that provide especially significant services.</P>
            <P>(3) Analysis of populations, habitats, or ecosystems shall be limited to those populations, habitats, or ecosystems for which injury has been determined in the Injury Determination phase or those that can be linked directly through services to resources for which injury has been so determined. Documentation of the service link to the injured resource must be provided in the latter case.</P>
            <P>(4) Population, habitat, or ecosystem measurement methods that provide data that can be interpreted in terms of services must be selected. To meet this requirement, a method should:</P>
            <P>(i) Provide numerical data that will allow comparison between the assessment area data and the control area or baseline data;</P>
            <P>(ii) Provide data that will be useful in planning efforts for restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources, and in later measuring the success of those efforts, and, where relevant, will allow calculation of compensable value; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Allow correction, as applicable, for factors such as dispersal of organisms in or out of the assessment area, differential susceptibility of different age classes of organisms to the analysis methods and other potential systematic biases in the data collection.</P>
            <P>(5) When estimating population differences of animals, standard and widely accepted techniques, such as census, mark-recapture, density, and index methods, and other estimation techniques appropriate to the species and habitat shall be used. Frequencies of injury observed in the population shall be measured as applicable.</P>
            <P>(i) In general, methods used for estimates of wildlife populations should follow standard and widely accepted techniques such as those recommendations provided in the “Wildlife Management Techniques Manual” (4th edition, Wildlife Society, 1980, available from the Wildlife Society, 5410 Grosvenor Lane, Bethesda, MD 20814), including references cited and recommended in that manual. The specific technique used need not be cited in that manual, but should meet its recommendations for producing reliable estimates or indices.</P>
            <P>(ii) Measurement of age structures, life table statistics, or age structure models generally will not provide satisfactory measurement of changes due to a discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance unless there is clear evidence that the oil or hazardous substance has differentially affected different age classes and there are reliable baseline age structure data available for the population being assessed.</P>
            <P>(iii) Mortality from single incidents may be used to estimate changes in populations only when there are available baseline population data for the area, so that the proportion lost can be estimated, and when corrections can be made for potential sampling biases, such as natural mortality and factors influencing distribution of carcasses and ability of investigators to find them. Specific techniques for measuring mortality include the following:</P>
            <P>(A) Fish mortality in freshwater areas may be estimated from counts of carcasses, using methods and guidelines for estimating numbers of fish killed contained in Part II (Fish-Kill Counting Guidelines) of the “Monetary Values of Freshwater Fish and Fish-Kill Counting Guidelines,” American Fisheries Society Special Publication Number 13, 1982 (incorporation by reference, see § 11.18), including use of appropriate random sampling methods and tagged carcasses as identified and discussed in Part II of that publication.</P>

            <P>(B) The authorized official may adapt the techniques discussed in paragraph (l) (5) (iii) (A) of this section for counting dead aquatic birds or for counting marine or estuarine fish or birds. Such <PRTPAGE P="274"/>adaptation will require the documentation of the methods used to avoid sampling biases.</P>
            <P>(C) Fish mortality may also be estimated by use of an in situ bioassay technique that is similar to that identified in § 11.62(f)(4)(i)(C) of this part, if the oil or hazardous substance is still present at levels that resulted in injury and if appropriate instream controls can be maintained at control areas.</P>
            <P>(6) Plant populations may be measured using standard techniques, such as population density, species composition, diversity, dispersion, and cover,</P>
            <P>(7) Forest and range resources may be estimated by standard forestry and range management evaluation techniques.</P>
            <P>(8) Habitat quality may be measured using techniques such as the Habitat Evaluation Procedures (HEP) developed and used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Quantification phase—baseline services determination.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> The authorized official shall determine the physical, chemical, and biological baseline conditions and the associated baseline services for injured resources at the assessment area to compare that baseline with conditions found in § 11.71 of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">General guidelines.</E> Baseline data shall be selected according to the following general guidelines:</P>
            <P>(1) Baseline data should reflect conditions that would have been expected at the assessment area had the discharge of oil or release of hazardous substances not occurred, taking into account both natural processes and those that are the result of human activities.</P>
            <P>(2) Baseline data should include the normal range of physical, chemical, or biological conditions for the assessment area or injured resource, as appropriate for use in the analysis in § 11.71 of this part, with statistical descriptions of that variability. Causes of extreme or unusual value in baseline data should be identified and described.</P>
            <P>(3) Baseline data should be as accurate, precise, complete, and representative of the resource as the data used or obtained in § 11.71 of this part. Data used for both the baseline and services reduction determinations must be collected by comparable methods. When the same method is not used, comparability of the data collection methods must be demonstrated.</P>
            <P>(4) Baseline data collection shall be restricted to those data necessary for conducting the assessment at a reasonable cost. In particular, data collected should focus on parameters that are directly related to the injuries quantified in § 11.71 of this part and to data appropriate and necessary for the Damage Determination phase.</P>
            <P>(5) The authorized official may use or authorize for use baseline data that are not expected to represent fully the baseline conditions, subject to the following requirements:</P>
            <P>(i) The authorized official shall document how the requirements of this paragraph are met:</P>
            <P>(ii) These substitute baseline data shall not cause the difference between baseline and the conditions in the assessment area to exceed the difference that would be expected if the baseline were completely measured; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The authorized official has determined that it is either not technically feasible or not cost-effective, as those phrases are used in this part, to measure the baseline conditions fully and that these baseline data are as close to the actual baseline conditions as can be obtained subject to these limitations.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Historical data.</E> If available and applicable, historical data for the assessment area or injured resource should be used to establish the baseline. If a significant length of time has elapsed since the discharge or release first occurred, adjustments should be made to historical data to account for changes that have occurred as a result of causes other than the discharge or release. In addition to specialized sources identified in paragraphs (g) through (k) of this section, one or more of the following general sources of historical baseline data may be used:</P>

            <P>(1) Environmental Impact Statements or Environmental Assessments previously prepared for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act <PRTPAGE P="275"/>(NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321-4361, similar documents prepared under other Federal and State laws, and background studies done for any of these documents;</P>
            <P>(2) Standard scientific and management literature sources appropriate to the resource;</P>
            <P>(3) Computerized data bases for the resource in question;</P>
            <P>(4) Public or private landholders in the assessment area or in neighboring areas;</P>
            <P>(5) Studies conducted or sponsored by natural resource trustees for the resource in question;</P>
            <P>(6) Federally sponsored research identified by the National Technical Information Service;</P>
            <P>(7) Studies carried out by educational institutions; and</P>
            <P>(8) Other similar sources of data.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Control areas.</E> Where historical data are not available for the assessment area or injured resource, or do not meet the requirements of this section, baseline data should be collected from control areas. Historical data for a control area should be used if available and if they meet the guidelines of this section. Otherwise, the baseline shall be defined by field data from the control area. Control areas shall be selected according to the following guidelines, and both field and historical data for those areas should also conform to these guidelines:</P>
            <P>(1) One or more control areas shall be selected based upon their similarity to the assessment area and lack of exposure to the discharge or release;</P>
            <P>(2) Where the discharge or release occurs in a medium flowing in a single direction, such as a river or stream, at least one control area upstream or upcurrent of the assessment area shall be included, unless local conditions indicate such an area is inapplicable as a control area;</P>
            <P>(3) The comparability of each control area to the assessment area shall be demonstrated, to the extent technically feasible, as that phrase is used in this part;</P>
            <P>(4) Data shall be collected from the control area over a period sufficient to estimate normal variability in the characteristics being measured and should represent at least one full cycle normally expected in that resource;</P>
            <P>(5) Methods used to collect data at the control area shall be comparable to those used at the assessment area, and shall be subject to the quality assurance provisions of the Assessment Plan;</P>
            <P>(6) Data collected at the control area should be compared to values reported in the scientific or management literature for similar resources to demonstrate that the data represent a normal range of conditions; and</P>
            <P>(7) A control area may be used for determining the baseline for more than one kind of resource, if sampling and data collection for each resource do not interfere with sampling and data collection for the other resources.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Baseline services.</E> The baseline services associated with the physical, chemical, or biological baseline data shall be determined.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Other requirements.</E> The methodologies in paragraphs (g) through (k) of this section shall be used for determining baseline conditions for specific resources in addition to following the general guidelines identified in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. If a particular resource is not being assessed for the purpose of the Damage Determination phase, and data on that resource are not needed for the assessment of other resources, baseline data for the resource shall not be collected.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Surface water resources.</E> (1) This paragraph provides additional guidance on determining baseline services for surface water resources. The general guidance provided in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section should be followed before beginning any work described in this paragraph.</P>
            <P>(2) Applicable and available historical data shall be gathered to determine baseline conditions for the surface water resource at the assessment area. If deemed inadequate for determining baseline conditions, such data shall be used to the extent technically feasible, as that phrase is used in this part, in designating the control areas described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section for the surface water resource determined to be injured.</P>

            <P>(3) Control areas shall be selected for the surface water resource subject to <PRTPAGE P="276"/>the general criteria in paragraph (d) of this section and additional criteria as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) For each injured stream or river reach, a control area shall be designated consisting of a stream or river reach of similar size, that is as near to the assessment area as practical and, if practical, that is upstream or upcurrent from the injured resource, such that the channel characteristics, sediment characteristics, and streamflow characteristics are similar to the injured resource and the water and sediments of the control area, because of location, have not been exposed to the discharge or release.</P>
            <P>(ii) For each injured standing water body, such as a marsh, pond, lake, bay, or estuary, a control area shall be designated consisting of a standing water body of similar size that is as near to the assessment area as practical, such that the sediment characteristics and inflow-outflow characteristics of the control area are similar to the injured resource and the water and sediments of the control area, because of location, have not been exposed to the discharge or release.</P>
            <P>(4)(i) Within the control area locations shall be designated for obtaining samples of water and sediments.</P>
            <P>(ii) The water discharge, stage, or tidal flux shall be measured and representative water and sediments collected as follows:</P>
            <P>(A) Measure stage, water discharge, and tidal flux as appropriate at the same time that water and sediment samples are collected; and</P>
            <P>(B) Obtain comparable samples and measurements at both the control and assessment areas under similar hydraulic conditions.</P>
            <P>(iii) Measurement and samples shall be obtained as described in this paragraph in numbers sufficient to determine:</P>
            <P>(A) The approximate range of concentration of the substances in water and sediments;</P>
            <P>(B) The variability of concentration of the substances in water and sediments during different conditions of stage, water discharge, or tidal flux; and</P>
            <P>(C) The variability of physical and chemical conditions during different conditions of stage, water discharge, or tidal flux relating to the transport or storage of the substances in water and sediments.</P>
            <P>(5) Samples should be analyzed from the control area to determine the physical properties of the water and sediments, suspended sediment concentrations in the water, and concentrations of oil or hazardous substances in water or in the sediments. Additional chemical, physical, or biological tests may be made, if necessary, to obtain otherwise unavailable data for the characteristics of the resource and comparison with the injured resource at the assessment area.</P>
            <P>(6) In order to establish that differences between surface water conditions of the control and assessment areas are statistically significant, the median and interquartile range of the available data or the test results should be compared using the Mann-Whitney and ranked squares tests, respectively.</P>
            <P>(7) Additional tests may be made of samples from the control area, if necessary, to provide otherwise unavailable information about physical, chemical, or biochemical processes occurring in the water or sediments relating to the ability of the injured surface water resource to recover naturally.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Ground water resources.</E> (1) This paragraph provides additional guidance on determining baseline services for ground water resources. The general guidance provided in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section should be followed before beginning any work described in this paragraph.</P>
            <P>(2) Applicable and available historical data shall be gathered to determine baseline conditions for the ground water resource at the assessment area. If deemed inadequate for determining baseline conditions, such data shall be used to the extent technically feasible, as that phrase is used in this part, in designating the control areas described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section for the ground water resource determined to be injured.</P>

            <P>(3) A control area shall be designated subject to the general criteria in paragraph (d) of this section and as near to the assessment area as practical, such <PRTPAGE P="277"/>that, within the control area, geological materials, geohydrological units, and hydrologic conditions are similar to the assessment area, and ground water resources are not exposed to substances from the discharge or release.</P>
            <P>(4) Within the control area, wells shall be identified or drilled, designated as control wells, to obtain representative ground water samples for analysis. The location, depth, and number of control wells and the number of ground water samples collected should be sufficient to estimate the vertical and lateral variation in concentration of the substances in both the unsaturated zone and in ground water from geohydrologic units similar to units tested in the assessment area.</P>
            <P>(i) Representative water samples from each control well shall be collected and analyzed. The analyses should determine the physical and chemical properties of the ground water relating to the occurrence of oil or hazardous substances.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the oil or hazardous substances are commonly more concentrated on geologic materials than in ground water, representative samples of geologic materials from aquifers and the unsaturated zone as appropriate should be obtained and chemically analyzed. The location, depth, and number of these samples should be sufficient to determine the vertical and lateral variation in concentration of the oil or hazardous substances absorbing or otherwise coating geologic materials in the control area. These samples may also be analyzed to determine porosity, mineralogy, and lithology of geologic materials if these tests will provide otherwise unavailable information on storage or mobility of the oil or hazardous substances in the ground water resource.</P>
            <P>(5) In order to establish that differences between ground water conditions of the control and assessment areas are statistically significant, the median and interquartile range of available data or the test results from similar geohydrologic units should be compared using the Mann-Whitney and ranked squares test, respectively.</P>
            <P>(6) Additional tests may be made of samples from the control area, if necessary, to provide otherwise unavailable information about chemical, geochemical, or biological processes occurring in the ground relating to the ability of the injured ground water resource to recover naturally.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Air resources.</E> (1) This paragraph provides additional guidance on determining baseline services for air resources. The general guidance provided in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section should be followed before beginning any work described in this paragraph.</P>
            <P>(2) Applicable and available historical data shall be gathered on ambient air quality and source emissions to determine baseline conditions for the air resource. These historical data may be used to determine baseline conditions if the data satisfy the general guidelines in paragraph (d) of this section and if all the following criteria are met:</P>
            <P>(i) The methodology used to obtain these historical data would detect the oil or hazardous substance at levels appropriate for comparison to the concentrations measured in § 11.71 of this part;</P>
            <P>(ii) The effect of known or likely emission sources near the assessment area other than the source of the discharge or release can be identified or accounted for in the historical data; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The historical data show that normal concentrations of the oil or hazardous substance are sufficiently predictable that changes as a result of the discharge or release are likely to be detectable.</P>
            <P>(3) If historical data appropriate to determine baseline conditions at the assessment area are lacking, one or more control areas, as needed, shall be designated subject to the general criteria of paragraph (d) of this section and the following additional factors, which shall also be considered in establishing a monitoring schedule;</P>

            <P>(i) Applicable and available historical data shall be used to the extent technically feasible, as that phrase is used in this part, in designating control areas or, lacking historical data, the factors in paragraph (i)(3)(iii) of this section shall be considered;<PRTPAGE P="278"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) Control areas shall be spatially representative of the range of air quality and meteorological conditions likely to have occurred at the assessment area during the discharge or release into the atmosphere; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The following additional factors shall be considered:</P>
            <P>(A) The nature of the discharge or release and of potential alternative sources of the oil or hazardous substance, including such factors as existing sources, new sources, intermittent sources, mobile sources, exceptional events, trends, cycles, and the nature of the material discharged or released;</P>
            <P>(B) Environmental conditions affecting transport, such as wind speed and direction, atmospheric stability, temperature, humidity, solar radiation intensity, and cloud cover; and</P>
            <P>(C) Other factors, such as timing of the discharge or release, use patterns of the affected area, and the nature of the injury resulting from the discharge or release.</P>
            <P>(4)(i) The preferred measurement method is to measure air concentrations of the oil or hazardous substance directly using the same methodology employed in § 11.71 of this part.</P>
            <P>(ii) Nonspecific or chemical compound class methodologies may be used to determine baseline generically only in situations where it can be demonstrated that measuring indicator substances will adequately represent air concentrations of other components in a complex mixture.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Geologic resources.</E> (1) This paragraph provides additional guidance on determining baseline services for geologic resources. The general guidance provided in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section should be followed before beginning any work described in this paragraph.</P>
            <P>(2) Applicable and available historical data shall be gathered to determine baseline conditions for the geologic resource at the assessment area. If deemed inadequate for determining baseline conditions, such data shall be used to the extent technically feasible, as that phrase is used in this part, in designating the control areas described in paragraph (j)(3) of this section for the geologic resource determined to be injured.</P>
            <P>(3) Control areas shall be selected for geologic resources subject to the general criteria in paragraph (d) of this section and additional criteria as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) Similarity of exposed soil or geologic material in the assessment area with the geologic resource in the control area should be the primary factor in selecting the control area. Other factors, including climate, depth of ground water, vegetation type and area covered, land slope and land area, and hydraulic gradients and spatial relation to source should be comparable to the assessment area.</P>
            <P>(ii) The control area shall be selected such that the geologic resource in the control area is not exposed to the discharge or release.</P>
            <P>(4)(i) A sufficient number of samples from unbiased, randomly selected locations in the control area shall be obtained in order to characterize the areal variability of the parameters measured. Each sample should be analyzed to determine the physical and chemical properties of the geologic materials relating to the occurrence of the oil or hazardous substance. Additional chemical, physical, or biological tests may be made, if necessary, to obtain otherwise unavailable data for the characterization and comparison with the injured resource at the assessment area.</P>
            <P>(ii) The mean and standard deviation of each parameter measured shall be used as the basis of comparison between the assessment and control areas.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Biological resources.</E> (1) This paragraph provides additional guidance on determining baseline services for biological resources. The general guidance provided in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section should be followed before beginning any work described in this paragraph.</P>

            <P>(2) Applicable and available historical data shall be gathered to determine baseline conditions for the biological resource at the assessment area and should include both population and habitat data if available. These data may be derived from the data sources identified in paragraph (c) of this section, as well as from the following:<PRTPAGE P="279"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) Aerial photographs or maps showing distribution and extent of habitat types or other biological resources before the discharge or release;</P>
            <P>(ii) Biological specimens in systematic museum or herbarium collections and associated records, including labels and collectors' field notes; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Photographs showing the nature of the habitat before the discharge or release when the location and date are well documented.</P>
            <P>(3)(i) Control areas shall be selected for biological resources subject to the general criteria in paragraph (d) of this section and additional criteria as follows:</P>
            <P>(A) The control area shall be comparable to the habitat or ecosystem at the assessment area in terms of distribution, type, species composition, plant cover, vegetative types, quantity, and relationship to other habitats;</P>
            <P>(B) Physical characteristics of the control and assessment areas shall be similar; and</P>
            <P>(C) If more than one habitat or ecosystem type is to be assessed, comparable control areas should be established for each, or a control area should be selected containing those habitat types in a comparable distribution.</P>
            <P>(ii) To the extent they are available, historical data should be gathered and used for the control area. Lacking adequate historical data for both the control and assessment areas, the control areas shall be used for the following purposes, as appropriate to the quantification:</P>
            <P>(A) To measure baseline biota population levels or habitat or ecosystem quality, as discussed in § 11.71(l) of this part; and</P>
            <P>(B) To measure the natural frequency, if any, of the injury being assessed in unaffected populations or to demonstrate the lack of that injury in unaffected populations if these have not been done for purposes of the Injury Determination, and if needed for purposes of the Quantification.</P>
            <P>(4) In addition, a control area should be used to collect control specimens, as needed, for the Injury Determination procedures.</P>
            <P>(5) The identity of species for which Damage Determinations will be made or that play an important role in the assessment shall be confirmed except in the case where collecting the specimens of a species is likely to compromise the restoration of the species. One or more of the following methods shall be used:</P>
            <P>(i) Specimens of the species shall be provided to an independent taxonomist or systematic biologist, who has access to a major systematic biology collection for that taxon, and who shall provide written confirmation of their identity to the species level;</P>
            <P>(ii) A reference collection of specimens of the species, prepared and preserved in a way standard for systematic collections for that taxon, shall be maintained at least through final resolution of the damage action at which time it should be transferred to a major systematic biology collection; or</P>
            <P>(iii) In the case of a species where collecting specimens is likely to compromise the recovery or restoration of that species population, the authorized official shall determine and use an alternative method for confirming species identity that will be consistent with established management goals for that species.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirement.</E> The authorized official shall develop a reasonable number of possible alternatives for (i) the restoration or rehabilitation of the injured natural resources to a condition where they can provide the level of services available at baseline, or (ii) the replacement and/or acquisition of equivalent natural resources capable of providing such services. For each possible alternative developed, the authorized official will identify an action, or set of actions, to be taken singly or in combination by the trustee agency to achieve the baseline restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent natural resources. The authorized official shall then select from among the possible alternatives the alternative that he determines to be the most appropriate based on the guidance provided in this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Steps.</E> (1) The authorized official shall develop a reasonable number of possible alternatives that would restore, rehabilitate, replace, and/or acquire the equivalent of the injured resources. Each of the possible alternatives may, at the discretion of the authorized official, consist of actions, singly or in combination, that would achieve those purposes.</P>
            <P>(i) Restoration or rehabilitation actions are those actions undertaken to return injured resources to their baseline condition, as measured in terms of the physical, chemical, or biological properties that the injured resources would have exhibited or the services that would have been provided by those resources had the discharge of oil or release of the hazardous substance under investigation not occurred. Such actions would be in addition to response actions completed or anticipated pursuant to the National Contingency Plan (NCP).</P>
            <P>(ii) Replacement or acquisition of the equivalent means the substitution for injured resources with resources that provide the same or substantially similar services, when such substitutions are in addition to any substitutions made or anticipated as part of response actions and when such substitutions exceed the level of response actions determined appropriate to the site pursuant to the NCP.</P>
            <P>(iii) Possible alternatives are limited to those actions that (i) restore or rehabilitate the injured natural resources to a condition where they can provide the level of services available at baseline, or (ii) replace and/or acquire equivalent natural resources capable of providing such services.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Services provided by the resources.</E> (i) In developing each of the possible alternatives, the authorized official shall list the proposed actions that would restore, rehabilitate, replace, and/or acquire the equivalent of the services provided by the injured natural resources that have been lost, and the period of time over which these services would continue to be lost.</P>

            <P>(ii) The authorized official shall identify services previously provided by the resources in their baseline condition in <PRTPAGE P="283"/>accordance with § 11.72 of this part and compare those services with services now provided by the injured resources, that is, the with-a-discharge-or-release condition. All estimates of the with-a-discharge-or-release condition shall incorporate consideration of the ability of the resources to recover as determined in § 11.73 of this part.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Range of possible alternatives.</E> (1) The possible alternatives considered by the authorized official that return the injured resources to their baseline level of services could range from intensive action on the part of the authorized official to return the various resources and services provided by those resources to baseline conditions as quickly as possible, to natural recovery with minimal management actions. Possible alternatives within this range could reflect varying rates of recovery, combinations of management actions, and needs for resource replacements or acquisitions.</P>
            <P>(2) An alternative considering natural recovery with minimal management actions, based upon the “No Action-Natural Recovery” determination made in § 11.73(a)(1) of this part, shall be one of the possible alternatives considered.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Factors to consider when selecting the alternative to pursue.</E> When selecting the alternative to pursue, the authorized official shall evaluate each of the possible alternatives based on all relevant considerations, including the following factors:</P>
            <P>(1) Technical feasibility, as that term is used in this part.</P>
            <P>(2) The relationship of the expected costs of the proposed actions to the expected benefits from the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources.</P>
            <P>(3) Cost-effectiveness, as that term is used in this part.</P>
            <P>(4) The results of any actual or planned response actions.</P>
            <P>(5) Potential for additional injury resulting from the proposed actions, including long-term and indirect impacts, to the injured resources or other resources.</P>
            <P>(6) The natural recovery period determined in § 11.73(a)(1) of this part.</P>
            <P>(7) Ability of the resources to recover with or without alternative actions.</P>
            <P>(8) Potential effects of the action on human health and safety.</P>
            <P>(9) Consistency with relevant Federal, State, and tribal policies.</P>
            <P>(10) Compliance with applicable Federal, State, and tribal laws.</P>
            <P>(e) A Federal authorized official shall not select an alternative that requires acquisition of land for Federal management unless the Federal authorized official determines that restoration, rehabilitation, and/or other replacement of the injured resources is not possible.</P>

            <P>(iv) The authorized official shall describe his selection of methodologies and objectives in the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan.</P>

            <P>(3) The authorized official shall determine that the following criteria have been met when choosing among the cost estimating and valuation methodologies. The authorized official shall document this determination in <PRTPAGE P="284"/>the Report of the Assessment. Only those methodologies shall be chosen:</P>
            <P>(i) That are feasible and reliable for a particular incident and type of damage to be measured.</P>
            <P>(ii) That can be performed at a reasonable cost, as that term is used in this part.</P>
            <P>(iii) That avoid double counting or that allow any double counting to be estimated and eliminated in the final damage calculation.</P>
            <P>(iv) That are cost-effective, as that term is used in this part.</P>
            <P>(4) Factors that may be considered by trustees to evaluate the feasibility and reliability of methodologies can include:</P>
            <P>(i) Is the methodology capable of providing information of use in determining the restoration cost or compensable value appropriate for a particular natural resource injury?</P>
            <P>(ii) Does the methodology address the particular natural resource injury and associated service loss in light of the nature, degree, and spatial and temporal extent of the injury?</P>
            <P>(iii) Has the methodology been subject to peer review, either through publication or otherwise?</P>
            <P>(iv) Does the methodology enjoy general or widespread acceptance by experts in the field?</P>
            <P>(v) Is the methodology subject to standards governing its application?</P>
            <P>(vi) Are methodological inputs and assumptions supported by a clearly articulated rationale?</P>
            <P>(vii) Are cutting edge methodologies tested or analyzed sufficiently so as to be reasonably reliable under the circumstances?</P>
            <P>(5) All of the above factors may not be applicable to every case, and other factors may be considered to evaluate feasibility and reliability. The authorized official shall document any consideration of factors deemed applicable in the Report of Assessment.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Costs of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources.</E> (1) Costs for restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources are the amount of money determined by the authorized official as necessary to complete all actions identified in the selected alternative for restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources, as selected in the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan of § 11.81 of this part. Such costs shall include direct and indirect costs, consistent with the provisions of this section.</P>
            <P>(i) Direct costs are those that are identified by the authorized official as attributed to the selected alternative. Direct costs are those charged directly to the conduct of the selected alternative including, but not limited to, the compensation of employees for the time and effort devoted to the completion of the selected alternative; cost of materials acquired, consumed, or expended specifically for the purpose of the action; equipment and other capital expenditures; and other items of expense identified by the authorized official that are expected to be incurred in the performance of the selected alternative.</P>
            <P>(ii) Indirect costs are costs of activities or items that support the selected alternative, but that cannot practically be directly accounted for as costs of the selected alternative. The simplest example of indirect costs is traditional overhead, e.g., a portion of the lease costs of the buildings that contain the offices of trustee employees involved in work on the selected alternative may, under some circumstances, be considered as an indirect cost. In referring to costs that cannot practically be directly accounted for, this subpart means to include costs that are not readily assignable to the selected alternative without a level of effort disproportionate to the results achieved.</P>
            <P>(iii) An indirect cost rate for overhead costs may, at the discretion of the authorized official, be applied instead of calculating indirect costs where the benefits derived from the estimation of indirect costs do not outweigh the costs of the indirect cost estimation. When an indirect cost rate is used, the authorized official shall document the assumptions from which that rate has been derived.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Cost estimating methodologies.</E> The authorized official may choose among the cost estimating methodologies listed in this section or may choose other <PRTPAGE P="285"/>methodologies that meet the acceptance criterion in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Nothing in this section precludes the use of a combination of cost estimating methodologies so long as the authorized official does not double count or uses techniques that allow any double counting to be estimated and eliminated in the final damage calculation.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Comparison methodology.</E> This methodology may be used for unique or difficult design and estimating conditions. This methodology requires the construction of a simple design for which an estimate can be found and applied to the unique or difficult design.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Unit methodology.</E> This methodology derives an estimate based on the cost per unit of a particular item. Many other names exist for describing the same basic approach, such as order of magnitude, lump sum, module estimating, flat rates, and involve various refinements. Data used by this methodology may be collected from technical literature or previous cost expenditures.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Probability methodologies.</E> Under these methodologies, the cost estimate represents an “average” value. These methodologies require information which is called certain, or deterministic, to derive the expected value of the cost estimate. Expected value estimates and range estimates represent two types of probability methodologies that may be used.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Factor methodology.</E> This methodology derives a cost estimate by summing the product of several items or activities. Other terms such as ratio and percentage methodologies describe the same basic approach.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Standard time data methodology.</E> This methodology provides for a cost estimate for labor. Standard time data are a catalogue of standard tasks typically undertaken in performing a given type of work.</P>
            <P>(vi) <E T="03">Cost- and time-estimating relationships (CERs and TERs).</E> CERs and TERs are statistical regression models that mathematically describe the cost of an item or activity as a function of one or more independent variables. The regression models provide statistical relationships between cost or time and physical or performance characteristics of past designs.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Other cost estimating methodologies.</E> Other cost estimating methodologies that are based upon standard and accepted cost estimating practices and are cost-effective are acceptable methodologies to determine the costs of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources under this part.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Compensable value.</E> (1) Compensable value is the amount of money required to compensate the public for the loss in services provided by the injured resources between the time of the discharge or release and the time the resources are fully returned to their baseline conditions, or until the resources are replaced and/or equivalent natural resources are acquired. The compensable value can include the economic value of lost services provided by the injured resources, including both public use and nonuse values such as existence and bequest values. Economic value can be measured by changes in consumer surplus, economic rent, and any fees or other payments collectible by a Federal or State agency or an Indian tribe for a private party's use of the natural resources; and any economic rent accruing to a private party because the Federal or State agency or Indian tribe does not charge a fee or price for the use of the resources. Alternatively, compensable value can be determined utilizing a restoration cost approach, which measures the cost of implementing a project or projects that restore, replace, or acquire the equivalent of natural resource services lost pending restoration to baseline.</P>
            <P>(i) Use value is the economic value of the resources to the public attributable to the direct use of the services provided by the natural resources.</P>
            <P>(ii) Nonuse value is the economic value the public derives from natural resources that is independent of any direct use of the services provided.</P>
            <P>(iii) Restoration cost is the cost of a project or projects that restore, replace, or acquire the equivalent of natural resource services lost pending restoration to baseline.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Valuation methodologies.</E> The authorized official may choose among the <PRTPAGE P="286"/>valuation methodologies listed in this section to estimate appropriate compensation for lost services or may choose other methodologies provided that the methodology can satisfy the acceptance criterion in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Nothing in this section precludes the use of a combination of valuation methodologies so long as the authorized official does not double count or uses techniques that allow any double counting to be estimated and eliminated in the final damage calculation.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Damage determination phase—implementation guidance.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirement.</E> The authorized official should use the cost estimating and valuation methodologies in § 11.83 of this part following the appropriate guidance in this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Determining uses.</E> (1) Before estimating damages for compensable value under § 11.83 of this part, the authorized official should determine the uses made of the resource services identified in the Quantification phase.<PRTPAGE P="287"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) Only committed uses, as that phrase is used in this part, of the resource or services over the recovery period will be used to measure the change from the baseline resulting from injury to a resource. The baseline uses must be reasonably probable, not just in the realm of possibility. Purely speculative uses of the injured resource are precluded from consideration in the estimation of damages.</P>
            <P>(3)(i) When resources or resource services have mutually exclusive uses, the highest-and-best use of the injured resource or services, as determined by the authorized official, shall be used as the basis of the analyses required in this part. This determination of the highest-and-best use must be consistent with the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the uses of the resource or service are not necessarily mutually exclusive, the sum of damages should be determined from individual services. However, the sum of the projected damages from individual services shall consider congestion or crowding out effects, if any, from the resulting projected total use of those services.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Double counting.</E> (1) Double counting of damages should be avoided. Double counting means that a benefit or cost has been counted more than once in the damage assessment.</P>
            <P>(2) Natural resource damages are the residual to be determined by incorporating the effects, or anticipated effects, of any response actions. To avoid one aspect of double counting, the effects of response actions shall be factored into the analysis of damages. If response actions will not be completed until after the assessment has been initiated, the anticipated effects of such actions should be included in the assessment.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Uncertainty.</E> (1) When there are significant uncertainties concerning the assumptions made in all phases of the assessment process, reasonable alternative assumptions should be examined. In such cases, uncertainty should be handled explicitly in the analysis and documented. The uncertainty should be incorporated in the estimates of benefits and costs.</P>
            <P>(2) To incorporate this uncertainty, the authorized official should derive a range of probability estimates for the important assumptions used to determine damages. In these instances, the damage estimate will be the net expected present value of the costs of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources and, if relevant, compensable value.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Discounting.</E> (1) Where possible, damages should be estimated in the form of an expected present value dollar amount. In order to perform this calculation, a discount rate must be selected.</P>
            <P>(2) The discount rate to be used is that specified in “Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-94 Revised” (dated March 27, 1972, available from the Executive Office of the President, Publications, 726 Jackson Place, NW., Washington, DC 20503; ph: (202) 395-7372).</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Substitutability.</E> In calculating compensable value, the authorized official should incorporate estimates of the ability of the public to substitute resource services or uses for those of the injured resources. This substitutability should be estimated only if the potential benefits from an increase in accuracy are greater than the potential costs.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Compensable value during the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources.</E> (1) In determining the amount of damages, the authorized official has the discretion to compute compensable value for the period of time required to achieve the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources.</P>
            <P>(2) When calculating compensable value during the period of time required to achieve restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources, the authorized official should follow the procedures described below. The procedures need not be followed in sequence.</P>

            <P>(i) The ability of the injured resources to recover over the recovery period should be estimated. This estimate includes estimates of natural recovery rates as well as recovery rates <PRTPAGE P="288"/>that reflect management actions or resource acquisitions to achieve restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources.</P>
            <P>(ii) A recovery rate should be selected for this analysis that is based upon cost-effective management actions or resource acquisitions, including a “No Action-Natural Recovery” alternative. After the recovery rate is estimated, compensable value should be estimated.</P>
            <P>(iii) The rate at which the uses of the injured resources and their services will be restored through the restoration or replacement of the services should be estimated. This rate may be discontinuous, that is, no uses are restored until all, or some threshold level, of the services are restored, or continuous, that is, restoration or replacement of uses will be a function of the level and rate of restoration or replacement of the services. Where practicable, the supply of and demand for the restored services should be analyzed, rather than assuming that the services will be utilized at their full capacity at each period of time in the analysis. Compensable value should be discounted using the rate described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. This estimate is the expected present value of uses obtained through restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources.</P>
            <P>(iv) The uses of the resource that would have occurred in the absence of the discharge or release should be estimated. This estimate should be done in accordance with the procedures in § 11.72 of this part. These uses should be estimated over the same time period using the same discount rate as that specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. This amount is the expected present value of uses forgone.</P>
            <P>(v) Subtraction of the present value of uses obtained through restoration or replacement from the expected present value of uses forgone gives the amount of compensation that may be included, if positive, in a measure of damages.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Scope of the analysis.</E> (1) The authorized official must determine the scope of the analysis in order to estimate compensable value.</P>
            <P>(2) In assessments where the scope of analysis is Federal, only the compensable value to the Nation as a whole should be counted.</P>
            <P>(3) In assessments where the scope of analysis is at the State level, only the compensable value to the State should be counted.</P>
            <P>(4) In assessments where the scope of analysis is at the tribal level, only the compensable value to the tribe should be counted.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Ground Water</HD>

            <P>The longitudinal path length (LPL) factors in table 1 are to be applied in estimating the area potentially exposed downgradient of the known limit of exposure or of the boundary of the site. Estimates of lateral path width (LPW) are to be used when the LPW exceeds the width of the plume as determined from available data, or when the width of the plume at the boundary of the site is estimated as less than the LPW. In the absence of data to the contrary, the largest values of LPL and LPW consistent with the geohydrologic data available shall be used to make the estimates required in the preassessment screen. An example computation using the LPL and LPW factors follows table 1.<PRTPAGE P="291"/>

            <P>A release of hazardous substances occurs from a facility located in a glacial valley. Available data indicate the release may have occurred intermittently over a period of almost 1 year, although only one well about 300 feet downgradient of the facility boundary had detectable quantities of contaminants. The contaminated well is screened in the water table aquifer composed of gravelly sands. The facility boundary nearest the contaminated well is almost 3,000 feet in length, but a review of available data determined the release is probably localized along a 500-foot section of the boundary where a stream leaves the facility. Available water table data indicate hydraulic gradients in the valley range from 0.005 feet/mile up to 0.25 feet/mile near pumping wells. No pumping wells are known to be located near the release, and a mean hydraulic gradient of 0.1 feet/mile is estimated in the vicinity of the release site. Using the gravel factor from table 1, the LPL and LPW are estimated:
            </P>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">6000 × 0.1 × 1 = 600 feet (LPL)</FP>

            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">600 × 0.2 = 120 feet (LPW).</FP>
            
            <FP>Since the estimated LPW (120 feet) is less than the plume width (500 feet) determined from other available data, the greater number is used to compute the area potentially exposed:</FP>
            <P>(1) 600 feet × 500 feet = 300,000 square feet (about 6.9 acres). The available information allows an initial determination of area potentially exposed via the ground water pathway to be estimated:</P>
            <P>(2) 300 feet × 500 feet = 150,000 square feet (about 3.5 acres).</P>

            <P>The total area potentially exposed is the sum of (1) and (2):

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Point of Analysis</HD>
            <P>The NRDAM/GLE begins its calculations at the point that the released substance entered water in an area represented by its geographic database. Any water within the geographic boundaries of the NRDAM/GLE is a “Great Lakes environment.” The authorized official must determine all data inputs and modifications as of the time and location that the released substance entered a Great Lakes environment. In the case of a release that began in water in an area within the boundaries of the NRDAM/GLE, this point will be the same as the point of the release. However, for releases that begin on land or that begin outside the boundaries of the NRDAM/GLE, this point will not be the point of the release but rather the point at which the released substance migrates into a Great Lakes environment.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Authority and purpose.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The Randolph-Sheppard Vending Stand Act of June 20, 1936, as amended by section 4 of the Act of August 3, 1954 (68 Stat. 663; 20 U.S.C. 107), directs that, insofar as practicable, preference shall be given to blind persons in the operation of vending stands and machines on any Federal property. The regulations in this part prescribe the policies and procedures to achieve and protect that preference on property, including land, owned or leased by the United States and controlled by the Department of the Interior.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 13.2</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Application for permit.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) State licensing agencies designated by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare under the Randolph-Sheppard Vending Stand Act may apply for permits to establish and maintain vending facilities, including both vending stands and machines, to be operated by blind persons licensed by the State agencies. Application for a permit shall be made, in writing, by the State licensing agency to the head of the Interior bureau or office having control of the property in question. In the regulations in this part the term “head of the Interior bureau or office” includes the authorized representatives of that bureau or office.</P>
          <P>(b) The head of the Interior bureau or office may deny an application if he determines that the issuance of a permit would unduly inconvenience the bureau or office or adversely affect the interests of the United States. Such determination shall be in writing and shall state the reasons on which it is based. The fact that a permit will be without charge for rent shall not constitute a basis for denying an application.</P>
          <P>(c) In considering applications for permits, due regard shall be given to the terms of any existing contractual arrangements.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 13.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Cooperation in selection of facilities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Upon request from a State licensing agency, the Interior bureau or office shall cooperate in selecting locations and arranging accommodations for vending facilities to be operated by blind persons. In making such selection, due consideration shall be given to the requirements of occupant agencies, availability of suitable space, and requirements for preparation and maintenance of the space.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 13.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Terms of permit.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Every permit shall describe the location of the vending facilities and shall be subject to the following provisions:</P>
          <P>(a) The permit shall be issued in the name of the applicant State licensing agency.</P>
          <P>(b) The permit shall be for a definite term, not to exceed five years, and shall be without charge for rent.</P>

          <P>(c) The permit may be revoked at any time upon not less than 30 days written notice to the permittee from the head of the Interior bureau or office having control of the property where the vending facilities are located. Such notice <PRTPAGE P="297"/>shall state the reasons on which it is based.</P>
          <P>(d) Items sold at the vending facilities shall be limited to newspapers, periodicals, pre-packaged confections, tobacco products, articles dispensed automatically or in containers or wrappings in which they are placed before receipt by the vendor, and such other articles as may be approved by the head of the Interior bureau or office for each location. The head of the Interior bureau or office may require discontinuance of sale of any type of article, upon not less than 15 days' notice in writing.</P>
          <P>(e) Vending facilities shall be operated in compliance with such standards of appearance, safety, health, sanitation, and efficiency as may be prescribed by the head of the Interior bureau or office. Such standards shall conform, so far as practicable with the provisions of State laws and regulations, whether or not the property is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.</P>
          <P>(f) The permittee shall arrange for the modification or relocation of the vending facilities when in the opinion of the head of the Interior bureau or office such action is essential to the satisfactory maintenance, operation, or use of the property concerned and shall not modify or relocate such facilities without such approval. Installation, modification, relocation, or removal of vending facilities shall be made only under the supervision of the head of the Interior bureau or office and without cost to the Department of the Interior. The permittee may be required to remove any vending device deemed undesirable by the head of the Interior bureau or office. Ownership of vending devices installed by the permittee or operator shall remain vested with the installer. All extra identifiable costs incurred by the Department of the Interior in restoring to its original condition any space vacated by removal or relocation of vending facilities shall be reimbursed by the permittee or the operator.</P>
          <P>(g) In the event a vending facility is being operated in a manner unsatisfactory to the Interior bureau or office, the permittee will be notified in writing and required to take appropriate action to rectify the situation.</P>
          <P>(h) The operator of the vending facility shall carry such insurance against losses by fire, public liability, employer's liability, or other hazards as is customary among prudent operators of similar businesses under comparable circumstances.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 13.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Protection from competition.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The head of the Interior bureau or office shall protect the blind operator of the vending facility against direct competition from other vendors or vending machines on property which the head of the Interior bureau or office controls. Other vendors or vending machines shall be considered in direct competition with vending facilities permitted under the regulations in this part if they sell or dispense articles which are similar or identical to those on sale at the vending facilities in such proximity to the vending facility as to attract customers who might otherwise patronize the vending facilities.</P>
          <P>(b) After a permit has been issued under the regulations in this part to a State licensing agency for operation of a vending facility, the head of the Interior bureau or office, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, shall take action to terminate, as soon as possible and with minimum interruption to the service afforded customers, any existing competitive arrangement for the sale of any articles similar to or identical to those sold or to be sold under the permit. Notice of such termination shall be given as required under the terms of the existing arrangement, or if none is provided, a notice of not less than 30 days shall be given in writing.</P>
          <P>(c) Existing arrangements with respect to vending machines need not be terminated if such vending machines are moved at the expense of their operators to locations elsewhere on the property which are noncompetitive with a blind-operated vending facility, or if the income from such machines is assigned to the blind operator.</P>

          <P>(d) This section shall not apply to the sale and service of food and other articles considered as food and usually sold in connection with meals by cafeterias, <PRTPAGE P="298"/>restaurants, or similar food dispensing establishments.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 13.6</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Appeals.</SUBJECT>
          <P>When the head of an Interior bureau or office has designated a representative to act for him under these regulations, he shall provide for the review of any matter in dispute between such representatives and the State licensing agency. In the event that they fail to reach agreement concerning the granting of a permit for the vending stand, the modification or revocation of a permit, the suitability of the stand location, the assignment of vending proceeds, the methods of operation of the stand, or other terms of the permit (including articles which may be sold) the State licensing agency shall have the right of appeal to the Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals. Such appeals shall be made in writing and shall be filed in the Office of the Director (address: Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals, 801 North Quincy Street, Arlington, VA 22203) within 15 days from the date of notice of the decision from which the appeal is taken. Such appeals shall comply otherwise with the general rules of the Office of Hearings and Appeals in subpart B of part 4 of this title and with the special regulations set forth in subpart G of part 4 of this title applicable to proceedings in appeals cases which do not lie within the appellate jurisdiction of an established Appeals Board of the Office of Hearings and Appeals. Upon appeal, full investigation shall be undertaken. A full report shall be obtained from the Interior representative from whose decision the appeal is being taken. The State licensing agency shall be given opportunity to present information. The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare shall be available for general advice on program activities and objectives. A final decision of the Director, Office f Hearings and Appeals, or of an Ad Hoc Appeals Board appointed by him to consider the appeal and to issue decision thereon, shall be rendered within ninety days of the filing of the appeal. Notification of the decision on appeal and the action taken thereon shall be given to the State licensing agency and to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The decision of the Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals, or of an Ad Hoc Appeals Board appointed by him, shall be final. At the end of each fiscal year the Office of the Secretary shall report to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare the total number of applications for vending stand locations received from State licensing agencies, the number accepted, the number denied, and the number still pending.</P>

          <P>(a) Pursuant to his authority and jurisdiction over Federal lands, the Secretary may enter into agreements with qualified applicants to dispose of the helium of the United States upon such terms and conditions as he deems fair, reasonable, and necessary to conserve such helium, whenever helium can be conserved that would otherwise be wasted or lost to Federal ownership or use in the production of oil or gas from Government lands embraced in an oil and gas lease or whenever federally owned deposits of helium-bearing gas are being drained. The precise nature of any agreement will depend on the conditions and circumstances involved in that particular case.</P>
          <P>(b) An agreement shall be subject to the existing rights of the Federal oil and gas lessee.</P>
          <P>(c) An agreement shall provide that in the extraction of helium from gas produced from Federal lands, it shall be extracted so as to cause no delay, except that required by the extraction process, in the delivery of the residue of the gas produced from such lands to the owner thereof. Title will be granted to the helium which is physically reduced to possession.</P>

          <P>(b) The Secretary may require that each agreement shall contain a renegotiation clause providing for renegotiation of the royalty percentage ten years from the effective date of the agreement and at five-year intervals thereafter.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The purpose of this part is to effectuate the provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to the end that no person in the United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from the Department of the Interior.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 17.2</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Application of this part.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) This part applies to any program for which Federal financial assistance is authorized under a law administered by the Department, including programs and activities that are federally-assisted under the laws listed in appendix A to this subpart. It applies to money paid, property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance extended after the effective date of the regulation pursuant to an application approved prior to such effective date. This part does not apply to (1) any Federal financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty contracts, (2) money paid, property transferred, or other assistance extended before the effective date of this part, (3) any assistance to any individual who is the ultimate beneficiary, or (4) except to the <PRTPAGE P="303"/>extent described in § 17.3, any employment practice, under any such program, of any employer, employment agency, or labor organization. The fact that a statute under which Federal financial assistance is extended to a program or activity is not listed in appendix A to subpart A shall not mean, if title VI is otherwise applicable, that such program or activity is not covered. Other statutes now in force or hereafter enacted may be added to this list by notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(b) In any program receiving Federal financial assistance in the form, or for the acquisition, of real property or an interest in real property, to the extent that rights to space on, over, or under any such property are included as part of the program receiving that assistance, the nondiscrimination requirement of that part shall extend to any facility located wholly or in part of the space.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Discrimination prohibited.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> No person in the United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program to which this part applies.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Specific discriminatory actions prohibited.</E> (1) A recipient to which this part applies may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin:</P>
            <P>(i) Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;</P>
            <P>(ii) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit to an individual which is different, or is provided in a different manner, from that provided to others under the program;</P>
            <P>(iii) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;</P>
            <P>(iv) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;</P>
            <P>(v) Treat an individual differently from others in determining whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, membership or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;</P>
            <P>(vi) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program through the provision of services or otherwise or afford him an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program (including the opportunity to participate in the program as an employee but only to the extent set forth in paragraph (c) of this section).</P>
            <P>(vii) Deny a person the opportunity to participate as a member of a planning or advisory body which is an integral part of the program.</P>
            <P>(2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other benefits or facilities will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respect individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.</P>

            <P>(3) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient or applicant may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding persons from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or effect if defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this part.<PRTPAGE P="304"/>
            </P>
            <P>(4)(i) In administering a program regarding which the recipient has previously discriminated against persons on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, the recipient must take affirmative action to overcome the effects of prior discrimination.</P>
            <P>(ii) Even in the absence of such prior discrimination, a recipient in administering a program may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions which resulted in limiting participation by persons of a particular race, color or national origin.</P>
            <P>(5) References in this section to services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial assistance shall be deemed to include any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal financial assistance.</P>
            <P>(6) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in this paragraph (b) and paragraph (c) of this section does not limit the generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Employment practices.</E> (1) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance to a program to which this part applies is to provide employment, a recipient or other party subject to this part shall not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, subject a person to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under such program (including recruitment or recruitment advertising, hiring, firing, upgrading, promotion, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, rates of pay or other forms of compensation or benefits, selection for training or apprenticeship, use of facilities, and treatment of employees). Such recipient shall take affirmative action to insure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, color, or national origin. The requirements applicable to construction employment under any such program shall be those specified in or pursuant to Part III of Executive Order 11246, as amended, or any Executive Order which supersedes it.</P>
            <P>(2) The requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section apply to programs under laws funded or administered by the Department where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is (i) to reduce the unemployment of such individuals or to help them through employment to meet subsistence needs, (ii) to assist such individuals in meeting expenses incident to the commencement or continuation of their education or training, or (iii) to provide work experience which contributes to the education or training of such individuals. Assistance given under the following laws has one of the above purposes as a primary objective: Water Resources Research Act of 1964, title I, 78 Stat. 329, and those statutes listed in appendix A to this subpart where the facilities or employment opportunities provided are limited, or a preference is given, to students, fellows, or other persons in training or related employment.</P>
            <P>(3) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation tends, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefit of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall apply to the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to this part, to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory treatment of, beneficiaries.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Benefits for Indians, natives of certain territories, and Alaska natives.</E> An individual shall not be deemed subjected to discrimination by reason of his exclusion from benefits which, in accordance with Federal law, are limited to Indians, natives of certain territories, or Alaska natives, if the individual is not a member of the class to which the benefits are addressed. Such benefits include those authorized by statutes listed in appendix B to this subpart.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Assurances required.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Every application for Federal financial assistance to which this part applies, except an application to which paragraph (b) of this section applies, and every application for Federal financial assistance to provide a facility shall, as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application, contain or be accompanied by, an assurance that the program will be conducted or the facility operated in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part. Every award of Federal financial assistance shall require the submission of such an assurance. In the case where the Federal financial assistance is to provide or is in the form of personal property, or real property or interest therein or structures thereon, or improvement of real property or structures, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits, or for as long as the recipient retains ownership or possession of the property, whichever is longer. In all other cases the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended to the program. In the case where the assistance is sought for the construction of a facility or part of a facility, the assurance shall in any event extend to the entire facility and to facilities operated in connection therewith. The Secretary shall specify the form of the foregoing assurances, and the extent to which like assurances will be required of subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants. Any such assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.</P>
            <P>(2) In the case where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property, structures, or improvements thereon, or interest therein, from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property or interest therein from the Federal Government is involved, but property is acquired or improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. When the property is obtained from the Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Department to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the Secretary, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In such event if a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the Secretary may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as he deems appropriate, to subordinate such right of reversion to the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Continuing Federal financial assistance.</E> (1) Every application by a State or any agency or political subdivision of a State for continuing Federal financial assistance to which this regulation applies shall as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application (i) contain or be accompanied by a statement that the program is (or, in the case of a new program, will be) conducted in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part, or a statement of the extent to which it is not, at the time the statement is made, so conducted, and (ii) provide or be accompanied by provision for such methods of administration for the program as <PRTPAGE P="306"/>are found by the Secretary or his designee to give reasonable assurance that the applicant and all recipients of Federal financial assistance under such program will comply with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this regulation, including methods of administration which give reasonable assurance that any noncompliance indicated in the statement under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section will be corrected.</P>
            <P>(2) With respect to some programs which are carried out by States or agencies or political subdivisions of States and which involve continuing Federal financial assistance administered by the Department, there has been no requirement that applications be filed by such recipients. From the effective date of this part no Federal financial assistance administered by this Department will be extended to a State or to an agency or a political subdivision of a State unless an application for such Federal financial assistance has been received from the State or State agency or political subdivision.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Elementary and secondary schools.</E> The requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section with respect to any elementary or secondary school or school system shall be deemed to be satisfied if such school or school system (1) is subject to a final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system, and provides an assurance that it will comply with such order, including any future modification of such order, or (2) submits a plan for the desegregation of such school or school system which the responsible official of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare determines is adequate to accomplish the purposes of the Act and this part within the earliest practicable time and provides reasonable assurance that it will carry out such plan; in any case of continuing Federal financial assistance the responsible official of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare may reserve the right to redetermine, after such period as may be specified by him, the adequacy of the plan to accomplish the purposes of the Act and this part. In any case in which a final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system is entered after submission of such a plan, such plan shall be revised to conform to such final order, including any future modification of such order.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Assurances from institutions.</E> (1) In the case of any application for Federal financial assistance to an institution of higher education (including assistance for construction, for research for a special training project, for student assistance, or for another purpose), the assurance required by this section shall extend to admission practices and to all other practices relating to the treatment of students.</P>
            <P>(2) The assurance required with respect to an institution of higher education, or any other institution, insofar as the assurance relates to the institution's practices with respect to admission or other treatment of individuals as students, or clients of the institution or to the opportunity to participate in the provision of services or other benefits to such individuals, shall be applicable to the entire institution.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Compliance reports.</E> Each recipient shall keep such records and submit to the Secretary or his designee timely, complete and accurate compliance reports, at such times, and in such form and containing such information, as the Secretary or his designee may determine to be necessary to enable him to ascertain whether the recipient has complied or is complying with this part. In general, recipients should have available for the Department racial and ethnic data showing the extent to which members of minority groups are beneficiaries of federally—assisted programs. In the case in which a primary recipient extends Federal financial assistance to any other recipient, such <PRTPAGE P="307"/>other recipient shall also submit such compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations under this part.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Access to sources of information.</E> Each recipient shall permit access by the Secretary or his designee during normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part. Where any information required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution or person and this agency, institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish this information, the recipient shall so certify in its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Information to beneficiaries and participants.</E> Each recipient shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this part and its applicability to the program for which the recipient receives Federal financial assistance, and make such information available to them in such manner as the Secretary or his designee finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by the Act and this part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedure for effecting compliance.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance or by any other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to, (1) a reference to the <PRTPAGE P="308"/>Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or other contractual undertaking, and (2) any applicable proceeding under State or local law.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Noncompliance with § 17.4.</E> If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 17.4 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section, Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The Department shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph, except that the Department shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor approved prior to the effective date of this part.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance.</E> No order suspending, terminating, or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until (1) the Secretary or his designee has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part, (3) the action has been approved by the Secretary pursuant to § 17.9(e), and (4) the expiration of 30 days after the Secretary has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Other means authorized by law.</E> No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) the Secretary or his designee has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) the recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and (3) the expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person. During this period of at least 10 days additional effort shall be made to persuade the recipient or other person to comply with this part and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Opportunity for hearing.</E> Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required by § 17.7(c), reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either (1) fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of the administrative law judge to whom the matter has been assigned that the matter be scheduled for hearing or (2) advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this paragraph or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a <PRTPAGE P="309"/>hearing under section 602 of the act and § 17.7(c) and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Time and place of hearing.</E> Hearings shall be held at the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department in the Washington, DC, area, at a time fixed by the administrative law judge to whom the matter has been assigned unless he determines that the convenience of the applicant or recipient or of the Department requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before an administrative law judge designated by the Office of Hearings and Appeals in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3105 and 3344.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Right to counsel.</E> In all proceedings under this section, the applicant or recipient and the Department shall have the right to be represented by counsel.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedures, evidence, and record</E> (1) The hearing, decision, and any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with 5 U.S.C. 554-557, and in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for findings, and other related matters. Both the Department and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearing.</P>
            <P>(2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent that the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Consolidated or joint hearings.</E> In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this part with respect to two or more Federal statutes, authorities, or other means by which Federal financial assistance is extended and to which this part applies or noncompliance with this part and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under title VI of the act, the Secretary may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies, where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules of procedure not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this part is concerned, shall be made in accordance with § 17.9.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity which receives Federal financial assistance.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Discriminatory actions prohibited.</E> (1) A recipient, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, on the basis of handicap:</P>
            <P>(i) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;</P>
            <P>(ii) Afford a qualified handicapped person an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others;</P>

            <P>(vii) Otherwise limit a qualified handicapped person in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving an aid, benefit, or service.</P>
            <P>(2) Aids, benefits, and services, to be equally effective, are not required to produce the identical result of level of achievement for handicapped and nonhandicapped persons, but must afford handicapped persons equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement, in the most integrated setting appropriate to the person's needs.</P>
            <P>(3) Despite the existence of separate or different aid, benefits, or services, a recipient may not deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate in all aid, benefits, or services covered by this subpart that are not separate or different.</P>
            <P>(4) A recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration (i) that have the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap, (ii) that have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the recipient's program or activity with respect to handicapped persons, or (iii) that perpetuate the discrimination of another recipient if both recipients are subject to common administrative control or are agencies of the same State.</P>
            <P>(5) In determining the site or location of a facility, an applicant for assistance or a recipient may not make selections (i) that have the effect of excluding handicapped persons from, denying them the benefits of, or otherwise subjecting them to discrimination under any program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance or (ii) that have the purpose of effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the program or activity with respect to handicapped persons.</P>

            <P>(2) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide personal property, the assurance will obligate the recipient for the period during which it retains ownership or possession of the property.</P>

            <P>(3) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of real property or interest in the property from the Department, the covenant shall unless prohibited by the conveyance authority, also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Department to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant. If a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on the property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the Director may, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing and upon such conditions as he or she deems appropriate, agree to forbear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.</P>

            <P>(4) Every application by a State or any agency or political subdivision of a State for continuing Federal financial assistance shall as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application (i) contain or be accompanied by a statement that the program or activity is (or, in the case of a new program, will be) conducted in <PRTPAGE P="319"/>compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this subpart, or a statement of the extent to which it is not, at the time the statement is made, so conducted, and (ii) provide or be accompanied by provision for such methods of administration for the program or activity as are found by the Secretary or his designee to give reasonable assurance that the applicant and all recipients of Federal financial assistance will comply with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this regulation, including methods of administration which give reasonable assurance that any noncompliance indicated in the statement under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section will be corrected.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For the purposes of this section, Historic Preservation Programs are those that receive Federal financial assistance that has preservation of historic properties as a primary purpose.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Historic properties</E> means those buildings or facilities that are listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, or such properties designated as historic under a statute of the appropriate State or local governmental body.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Substantial impairment</E> means a permanent alteration that results in a significant loss of the integrity of finished materials, design quality or special character.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Obligations.</E> (1) A recipient shall operate any program or activity involving Historic Preservation Programs so that when each part is viewed in its entirety it is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not necessarily require a recipient to make each of its existing historic properties or every part of an historic property accessible to and usable by qualified handicapped persons. Methods of achieving accessibility include:</P>
            <P>(i) Making physical alterations which enable qualified handicapped persons to have access to otherwise inaccessible areas or features of historic properties;</P>
            <P>(ii) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict otherwise inaccessible areas or features of historic properties;</P>
            <P>(iii) Assigning persons to guide qualified handicapped persons into or through otherwise inaccessible portions of historic properties;</P>
            <P>(iv) Adopting other innovative methods to achieve accessibility.</P>
            <FP>Because the primary benefit of an Historic Preservation Program is the experience of the historic property itself, in taking steps to achieve accessibility, recipients shall give priority to those means which make the historic property, or portions thereof, physically accessible to handicapped individuals.</FP>

            <P>(2) Where accessibility cannot be achieved without causing a substantial impairment of significant historic features, the Secretary may grant a waiver of the accessibility requirement. In determining whether accessibility can <PRTPAGE P="326"/>be achieved without causing a substantial impairment, the Secretary shall consider the following factors:</P>
            <P>(i) Scale of property, reflecting its ability to absorb alterations;</P>
            <P>(ii) Use of the property, whether primarily for public or private purpose;</P>
            <P>(iii) Importance of the historic features of the property to the conduct of the program or activity; and,</P>
            <P>(iv) Cost of alterations in comparison to the increase in accessibility.</P>
            <FP>The Secretary shall periodically review any waiver granted under this section and may withdraw it if technological advances or other changes so warrant.</FP>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Advisory Council comments.</E> Where the property is federally owned or where Federal funds may be used for alterations, the comments of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation shall be obtained when required by section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470), and 36 CFR part 800, prior to effectuation of structural alterations.</P>

When it is not reasonable to alter natural and physical features, the following other methods of achieving accessibility may include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(1) Reassigning aid, benefits, or services to accessible locations.</P>

              <P>(a) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the terms “normal operation” and “statutory objective” shall have the following meaning:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Normal operation</E> means the operation of a program or activity without significant changes that would impair its ability to meet its objectives.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Statutory objective</E> means any purpose of a program or activity expressly stated in any Federal, State, or local statute or ordinance adopted by an elected, general purpose legislative body.</P>
              <P>(b) Exceptions to the rules against age discrimination: Normal operation or statutory objective of any program or activity.</P>
              <FP>A recipient is permitted to take an action otherwise prohibited by § 17.310 if the action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation or the achievement of any statutory objective of a program or activity. An action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation or the achievement of any statutory objective of a program or activity, if:</FP>
              <P>(1) Age is used as a measure or approximation of one or more other characteristics; and</P>

              <P>(2) The other characteristic(s) must be measured or approximated in order for the normal operation of the program or activity to continue, or to <PRTPAGE P="329"/>achieve any statutory objective of the program or activity; and</P>
              <P>(3) The other characteristic(s) can be reasonably measured or approximated by the use of age; and</P>
              <P>(4) The other characteristic(s) are impractical to measure directly on an individual basis.</P>
              <P>(c) Exceptions to the rules against age discrimination: Reasonable factors other than age. A recipient is permitted to take an action otherwise prohibited by § 17.310 which is based on a factor other than age, even though that action may have a disproportionate effect on persons of different ages. An action may be based on a factor other than age only if the factor bears a direct and substantial relationship to the normal operation of the program or activity or to the achievement of a statutory objective.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
            <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities or every part of a facility accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>

            <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the <PRTPAGE P="337"/>burden of proving that compliance with § 17.550(a) would result in such an alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible locations, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157) and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, alternative, methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
            <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible.</P>
            <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Recreation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) in recreation programs, the agency shall provide that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. When it is not reasonable to alter natural and physical features, accessibility may be achieved by alternative methods as noted in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this part except that where structural changes in facilities are necessary, such changes shall be made within three years of the effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities are necessary to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, within six months of the effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The plan shall be developed with the assistance of interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons. A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
            <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>

            <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;<PRTPAGE P="338"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period;</P>

            <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
            <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.</P>
            <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, attendant services, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
            <P>(2) Where the agency communicate with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunications devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.</P>
            <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
            <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
            <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 17.560 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

An event that materially affects the accuracy of the information reported includes:</P>
            <P>(1) A cumulative increase of $25,000 or more in the amount paid or expected to be paid for influencing or attempting to influence a covered Federal action; or</P>

            <P>(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable at any time.</P>
            <P>(c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered Federal action:</P>
            <P>(1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,</P>

            <P>(2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,</P>
            <P>(3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended by Public Law 95-507 and other subsequent amendments.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Professional and technical services.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 18.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>

            <P>(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, <PRTPAGE P="344"/>technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.</P>
            <P>(c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.</P>

            <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 18.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>
            <P>(b) The reporting requirements in § 18.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.</P>

            <P>(e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.</P>

            <P>(a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such expenditure.</P>
            <P>(b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see Appendix B to this part) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such failure.</P>
            <P>(c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.</P>
            <P>(d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.</P>
            <P>(e) First offenders under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.</P>
            <P>(f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.</P>

            <P>(b) At least 30 days before the date of any such public hearing, the hearing officer shall advise the Governor of each State and the governing board of each county, or in Alaska the borough, in which the lands are located, and the other Federal departments and agencies concerned, and invite such officials and agencies to submit their views at the hearing. The Governor, the governing board, and the other Federal agencies may also submit views following the hearing but such views must be received in the Office of the Secretary by no later than 30 days following the date of the hearing to assure that they will receive consideration.</P>
            <P>(c) Any public views received pursuant to the provisions of this section will be accorded careful consideration and a summary thereof shall be forwarded with the recommendations of the Secretary to the President with respect to the area under consideration.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 20.301</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>General policy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Except as specifically authorized by law, when an employee is on official duty (no leave status), all travel and accommodations shall be at Government expense and his or her acceptance of outside reimbursement for travel expenses or services in kind from private sources, either in his or her behalf or in behalf of the Government, is not allowed.</P>
            <P>(b) Under certain circumstances, the Department may charge a fee or accept reimbursement for providing a service or thing of value to a private source when the service or thing of value provided benefits to both the Government and the particular private source (31 U.S.C. 9701). In such instances only a portion of the costs can be accepted from the private source. The Department must pay expenses associated with its usual official business and for the benefits it receives from participating in the event. The private source can be charged or may reimburse the Department for that portion of the service provided that exceeds the Department's usual expenses and the benefits to the Government. Under this provision, payments from private sources must be deposited in the U.S. Treasury unless the bureau receiving the payment is authorized by statute to accept such payments.</P>

            <P>(c) When a bureau is authorized by statute other than 31 U.S.C. 1353 to accept gifts, and 31 U.S.C. 1353 does not apply, the travel expenses incurred by an employee directed to participate in a convention, seminar, or similar meeting sponsored by a private source for the mutual interest of the Government and the private source may be reimbursed to the bureau and credited to its appropriation. The employee shall be paid by the bureau in accordance with the law relating to reimbursement for official travel and any accommodations and goods or services in kind furnished an employee shall be treated as a donation to the bureau and <PRTPAGE P="357"/>an appropriate reduction shall be made to the employee's reimbursement (46 CG 689 (1967)).</P>
            <P>(d) When participation at a function is not in an official capacity, an employee may accept reimbursement of travel and accommodation expenses from a private source, provided that such acceptance is permitted by law and Federal regulations. Participation as a private citizen must occur on one's own time, such as while on leave. If participation should occur during the course of official travel (i.e., evening or weekend hours during official travel status), the travel voucher submitted for Government reimbursement of official duty expenses must be adjusted to claim only that per diem and travel attributable to official duty. Employees who are in positions for which the rate of pay is specified in 5 U.S.C. 5311-5318 (the Executive Schedule) are on 24-hour duty, and determinations of what constitutes official duty and what is private participation should be carefully made.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 20.302</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Exclusions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Where employee travel is for attendance at a meeting or similar function (31 U.S.C. 1353(a)), the Department may accept payment for the employee and/or the employee's spouse's travel from a non-Federal source when proper consideration is given to the conditions in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and a written authorization to accept payment is issued in advance of the travel.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Conditions.</E> Such travel expenses paid for by a non-Federal source may be accepted by the Department only if all of the following conditions are met:</P>
            <P>(i) The travel relates to the employee's official duties;</P>
            <P>(ii) The travel, subsistence and related expenses are with respect to the attendance of an employee (and/or the accompanying spouse of such employee when applicable) at a meeting or similar function. This includes a conference, seminar, speaking engagement, symposium, training course, or similar event that takes place away from the employee's official station, and is sponsored or cosponsored by a non-Federal source;</P>
            <P>(iii) The non-Federal source is not disqualified because of a real or apparent conflict of interest as determined under paragraph (a)(2) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The travel event is not required to carry out the Department's statutory or regulatory functions. Examples of statutory or regulatory functions that are essential to the Department's mission include investigations, inspections, audits, site visits, compliance reviews or program evaluations.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Conflict of interest analysis.</E> (i) The Department's acceptance of any payment from a non-Federal source under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 1353 shall not be approved when an Authorized Approving Official, identified in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, determines that under the circumstances, acceptance of the travel expenses would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of all relevant facts to:</P>
            <P>(A) Question the integrity of the work to be performed by the employee receiving the benefit; or</P>
            <P>(B) Question the integrity of the Department's other program operations.</P>
            <P>(ii) When making these determinations, an Authorized Approving Official shall be guided by all relevant considerations including, but not limited to:</P>
            <P>(A) The identity of the non-Federal source and the source's relationship to the Department;</P>
            <P>(B) The purpose of the meeting or similar function and its relationship to the Department's programs or operations;</P>
            <P>(C) The identity of other expected participants and their relationship to the Department;</P>
            <P>(D) The nature and sensitivity of any pending Department matter which, when decided, may affect the interests of the non-Federal source;</P>
            <P>(E) The significance of the employee's role in any such pending matter;</P>
            <P>(F) The monetary value and character of the travel benefits offered by the non-Federal source; and</P>
            <P>(G) The potential reaction from Department customers, including the public, if the acceptance of travel expenses was made known to them.</P>

            <P>(iii) An “Authorized Approving Official” means that Department official who has been delegated authority to approve the usual travel authorizations <PRTPAGE P="358"/>of the employee who will benefit from the non-Federal travel payment.</P>
            <P>(iv) The procedures stated below must be satisfied before the employee (and/or the accompanying spouse) begin his or her travel:</P>
            <P>(A) Each employee (and/or the accompanying spouse) must have an approved Travel Authorization (Form DI-1020). Section 10 (“Purpose and Remarks”) of this Form must contain a statement that the authority to accept payment from a non-Federal source for the specified travel event is 31 U.S.C. 1353, and the travel situation complies with the conditions for acceptance under 41 CFR 304-1.4.</P>
            <P>(B) The supplementary form entitled, “Report of Payments Accepted From Non-Federal Sources Under 31 U.S.C. 1353” (Form DI-2000) must also be completed and signed by the employee and the Authorized Approving Official. A copy of Form DI-1020 and Form DI-2000 must be filed with the employee's Deputy Ethics Counselor.</P>
            <P>(C) Payment from a non-Federal source to cover the travel related expenses of an employee may be made in the form of a check or similar instrument made payable to the Department. Employees should not accept cash or negotiate checks or similar instruments payable to them. Any negotiable instruments received by an employee shall be transmitted immediately to the appropriate accounting office.</P>
            <P>(b) When on official duty, contributions and awards incident to training in non-Government facilities, and payment of travel, subsistence, and other expenses incident to attendance at meetings may be accepted by an employee when the payment is made by a non-profit, tax exempt organization as described in 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) and when no real or apparent conflict of interest will result. Prior advice should be obtained from the employee's ethics counselor in this circumstance (5 U.S.C. 4111).</P>
            <P>(c) Employees may accept reimbursement by the Department for travel and related expenses when on detail under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3375.</P>
            <P>(d) Should the Director of the United States Information Agency, with the approval of the employing agency, assign an employee to a foreign government, reimbursement for the employee's pay and allowances shall be made to the United States in an amount equal to the compensation, travel expenses, and allowances payable to such person during the period of such assignment, in accordance with 22 U.S.C. 1451.</P>
            <P>(e) Should an employee be detailed by the Secretary to an international organization which requests services, the employee is deemed to be (for the purpose of preserving his or her allowances, privileges, rights, seniority, and other benefits) an employee of the Department and the employee is entitled to pay, allowances, and benefits from funds available to the Department. The international organization may reimburse the Department for all or part of the pay, travel expenses, and allowances payable during the detail; or, the detailed employee may be paid or reimbursed directly by the international organization for allowances or expenses incurred in the performance of duties required by the detail without regard to 18 U.S.C. 209 (5 U.S.C. 3343).</P>

            <P>This subpart deals with disciplinary actions and remedial actions for violations, or potential violations, of conflict of interest laws or of the regulations in this part or in 5 CFR part 2635 or 5 CFR part 3501. Disciplinary action may include oral or written warning or admonishment, reprimand, suspension, reduction in grade or pay, removal from position or removal from office. Such action shall be taken in accordance with Departmental policies and procedures, applicable statutes, Executive Orders, regulations, and any applicable collective bargaining agreement provisions.

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 20.602</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Remedial action.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a)(1) Remedial action should normally be considered only after attempts to obtain voluntary resolution <PRTPAGE P="363"/>have failed. Voluntary resolution may include:</P>
            <P>(i) Voluntary divestiture;</P>
            <P>(ii) Voluntary conversion to securities which are not prohibited, or the holding of which would not violate law or regulation; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Voluntary reassignment to another position.</P>
            <P>(2) If the bureau Ethics Counselor decides that remedial action is required, such action shall be initiated within a reasonable time, usually 90 days.</P>
            <P>(b) Remedial action may include:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Reassignment or disqualification of the employee.</E> It may be possible for the employee to be reassigned to another job, or to be disqualified from performing particular duties. Although the number of cases where this remedy can be used should be rare, the possibility should be explored before divestiture of an interest is ordered.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Waiver.</E> (i) The Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO) is authorized to make a written advance determination pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(1) waiving the prohibitions of 18 U.S.C. 208(a) for any Department employee except the Secretary and those employees in the same organization as the DEAO, i.e., the Department's Office of Policy, Management and Budget. The Secretary or the Deputy Secretary shall issue individual waivers pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(1) for employees in the Office of Policy, Management and Budget.</P>
            <P>(ii) In the case of a special Government employee serving on an advisory committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C. App. (including an individual being considered for an appointment to such a position), the DAEO, after review of the financial disclosure report filed by the individual pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 5 U.S.C. App., is authorized to certify in writing that the need for the individual's services outweighs the potential for a conflict of interest created by the financial interest involved.</P>
            <P>(iii) The DAEO may grant a waiver under 5 CFR 3501.103(e) from the regulatory restrictions at 5 CFR 3501.103 (b) and (c).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Divestiture of the interest.</E> An employee may be required to divest an interest, including outside employment, that is prohibited by law or regulation. Divestiture of the interest shall be ordered in all situations where it is determined by the appropriate official that there is no other satisfactory remedy. Evidence of divestiture must be provided in the form of broker's sale receipt or other appropriate document.

            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note to paragraph (<E T="01">b</E>)(3):</HD>
              <P>It may be possible in certain cases for the tax consequences of divestiture to be delayed, if the interest is sold pursuant to a certificate of divestiture issued before the sale by the Director, U.S. Office of Government Ethics. See 5 CFR part 2634, subpart J.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Authority to order remedial action.</E> (1) Each bureau Ethics Counselor is authorized to order remedial actions within his or her bureau. The advice of the appropriate Regional Solicitor, the Associate Solicitor—Division of General Law, or the Designated Agency Ethics Official or his or her designee may be sought before such an order is issued. This authority to order remedial action may not be redelegated.</P>
            <P>(2) The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy is authorized to order remedial actions for employees within the Office of the Secretary, except that the Secretary shall order remedial actions in situations involving the Deputy Secretary.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
          <P>This part establishes (a) when, and by what standards, use of conservation and recreation areas under private cabin permits must be modified or discontinued so as to allow the public use of such areas and (b) the procedures for renewing, extending, phasing out, or terminating private cabin permits. No current permits or any valid existing rights, are, per se, canceled by the provisions of this part. However, permits may be canceled for cause, or pursuant to termination provisions within the permit itself.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Scope of regulations.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The provisions of this part apply to all recreation or conservation areas administered by the Department of the Interior, including recreation or conservation areas leased or transferred for administration to other Federal and non-Federal public agencies, wherever the Department of the Interior retains jurisdiction over the issuance of cabin site permits by such other agencies. The provisions of this part do not modify or cancel any existing arrangement whereby the Department of the Interior or bureau or office thereof has leased, or turned over for administration, a public recreation or conservation area to another Federal or non-Federal public agency. The provisions of this part will also provide policy guidelines for the Departmental handling of assignments, amendments, or modifications of existing permits or agreements, but do not apply to areas transferred by deed where the United States retains a reversionary interest, nor to areas of the National Park System other than those where private cabin sites are located.</P>
          <P>(a) The policies set out in this part shall not affect occupancy by private persons who have private rights, or rights of occupancy adjudicated or confirmed by court action, statute, or pursuant to a contract by which they conveyed to the Government the land on which a cabin or other substantial improvement is located.</P>
          <P>(b) The policies set out in this part shall not apply to any concession contract or to any other permit or occupancy primarily granted to serve public rather than private or individual purposes—such as, permits granted to groups who assist in maintaining historic trails, or permits for youth and church group camp facilities, etc.</P>
          <P>(c) The regulations in this part shall not supersede or substantially contravene the implementation of the Lower Colorado River Land Use Plan.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Public recreation area</E> or <E T="03">recreation area</E> means any land, title to which is in the United States and under the administration or jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior that is suitable for recreational purposes, including all such areas of the National Park System not excepted by § 21.2, Bureau of Reclamation Reservoir areas, and any other areas dedicated to or administered by the Department for public recreational use.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Conservation area</E> means any land, title to which is in the United States and under the administration or jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior that is designated for fish, wildlife, <PRTPAGE P="366"/>or other conservation purposes, including all such areas of the National Wildlife Refuge Systems, National Fish Hatchery Systems, and any other such areas administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; also, land administered by the Bureau of Land Management and suitable for conservation or protection of fish or wildlife.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Permit</E> means any lease, license, or other contract whereby a public recreation or conservation area is made available, in whole or part, to an individual or group for recreational purposes for a stipulated period of time, but does not include leases or transfers to other Federal or non-Federal public agencies.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Cabin site</E> means any area within a public recreation or conservation area whose occupancy and use is granted to an individual or group for a period of time by permit.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Substantial improvement</E> means any building, structure, or other relatively permanent facility or improvement affixed to a cabin site, utilized for human occupancy or related purposes, and costing or worth $1,000 or more. It does not include trailers or similar removable facilities.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Investment</E> in a substantial improvement refers to the basic expenditure of moneys or property in kind in connection with a particular improvement. Thus, for example, where property is conveyed by testamentary or inter vivos gift, the donee will be seen only as occupying the position of the donor with respect to the time and amount of the investment since it was the donor who made the investment.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Amortization</E> is the process whereby the investor in a substantial improvement derives sufficient use and/or economic benefit from the improvement over a period of time as to reasonably compensate for his investment.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Trespasser</E> means any person who is occupying land in a public recreation or conservation area without a valid permit.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Authorized Officer</E> means any person or persons designated by the head of any bureau or office of the Department with administrative jurisdiction over a particular conservation or recreation area, to make determinations and take other actions, consistent with the regulations in this part with respect to such area.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 21.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Occupancy under permit of privately owned cabins on recreation areas and conservation areas.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) In any areas where the Authorized Officer determines that the recreational requirements of the general public are limited, and is an area where private cabin site use has heretofore been permitted, he may extend or renew permits. Each such existing permit and any extension or renewal thereof will be:</P>
          <P>(1) Reviewed at least once in every 5-year period to determine that the continued use of the individual cabin site is not inconsistent with the needs of the general public for use of the area. In periodically reviewing whether the existence of private cabin sites conflicts with the best public use of an area, consideration shall be given to (i) existing and projected public need for the area, (ii) compatibility between public uses and private cabin sites, (iii) development potential and plans for the area, and (iv) other relevant factors.</P>

          <P>(2) Whenever the Authorized Officer determines that the public need for use of a recreation or conservation area has grown to a point where continued private cabin site use is no longer in the public interest, the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section will be invoked to phase out existing permits by reducing and eliminating renewals, or extensions, consistent with protection of legitimate investment in improvements. These determinations and the reasons therefor shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> together with such other forms of public notice as may be appropriate and necessary as determined by the Authorized Officer.</P>

          <P>(3) Except as otherwise provided in an existing permit, no substantial improvement may hereafter be placed on any cabin site under permit without the prior approval of the Authorized Officer, and on such terms as the Authorized Officer may provide, consistent with public need. All renewed or extended permits shall contain this provision. Any such provision shall expressly state that the permission to <PRTPAGE P="367"/>place a substantial improvement on the site is a limited license subject to public need for the area and does not give the owner of the improvement any interest in the land or any special rights or equities, other than the right to remove the improvement at any time, subject to the land being left in reasonably unimpaired condition. This provision shall expressly stipulate that the owner shall have as a time period within which to amortize his investment in a substantial improvement placed on the site after the date of the regulations in this part, only the period of his existing permit, together with such extensions of his permit as may be granted consistent with the regulations in this part.</P>

          <P>(b) Whenever the Authorized Officer determines, pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section that the needs of the general public for a particular public recreation or conservation area are sufficient to be inconsistent with further use of that area for private cabin sites, no further extension, or renewals of permits for any individual site shall, except as otherwise required by law, be granted for any period extending more than 5 years after the effective date of that determination: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That, except as otherwise required by law, if an investment was made in a substantial improvement upon a site before the effective date of this part, the extension or renewal of the permit for such site shall be made for a period sufficient to permit 20 years amortization of the investment from the date of the investment in the improvement upon the site, unless the Authorized Officer finds that the needs of the general public for that site require that the extension or renewal be for a lesser period. Thus, for example, if a permit for the site is purchased before the effective date of the regulations in this part with the substantial improvement then in place, for a consideration of $1,000 or more, such amortization period runs from the purchase date, and is not affected, in any event, by the date of the determination under paragraph (a) of this section. The amortization period for any investment in a substantial improvement on or after the effective date of the regulations in this part is covered by paragraph (a)(3) of this section, this paragraph (b), and paragraph (b)(5) of this section.</P>
          <P>(1) Any permit, in an area required for general public recreation or conservation use, that expires prior to 5 years after the determination described in this paragraph (b), may, if otherwise authorized by law, be extended to the end of such 5 years if the Authorized Officer determines that such extension is necessary to the fair and efficient administration of this part.</P>
          <P>(2) Any renewal or extension of a permit pursuant to this part shall be subject to the condition that the occupant maintain the site and the improvements thereon in a good and serviceable condition, ordinary wear and tear excluded.</P>
          <P>(3) Any renewal or extension of a permit shall expressly state its termination date and that there will be no extension or renewal thereafter, except as provided by this part. Permits shall expressly state that they grant no vested property right but afford only a limited license to occupy the land, pending a greater public use.</P>
          <P>(4) Upon termination of occupancy under a permit, its renewal or extension, the permittee shall remove his improvements from the site within 90 days from the date of termination, and the land shall be left in reasonably unimpaired condition and as near to its original undisturbed condition as possible. Any property not so removed shall become the property of the United States or may be moved off the site, at the cost of the permittee. Any renewal, or extension, of a permit shall state these requirements.</P>

          <P>(5) Voluntary and involuntary transfers of cabin site permits, including by sale, devise, inheritance, or otherwise, may be permitted, subject to approval by the Authorized Officer, subject to the terms, conditions, and restrictions in the permit. No such transfer shall operate to extend the terms of a permit. A transfer after the effective date of the regulations in this part shall give the transferee no rights in addition to those which the transferor had. Where any transfer of a cabin site permit is approved, the approval shall state in writing the requirements of <PRTPAGE P="368"/>this paragraph, and include the statement that the amortization period for any substantial improvement located on the site shall be limited to the period to which the transferor would have been entitled under the regulations in this part.</P>

          <P>(6) Nonuse of a site for a period of more than 2 consecutive calendar years shall terminate the permit without right of renewal (subject to the specific terms of the permit): <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That where the nonuse is the result of the death, illness, or military service of the permittee the Authorized Officer may waive such nonuse. In such case, sale or transfer of the improvement may be made for the unexpired portion of the permit and subject to the provisions for amortization set forth in this section. The Authorized Officer may make exceptions to this termination provision in any case where he determines that the needs of the general public so require (see introductory text of this paragraph (b)). All permits renewed, or extended after the effective date of this part shall state the requirements of this paragraph.</P>

          <P>(a) Those permittees who occupy Government-owned cabins, including those whose permits currently have expired, but previously have been renewed on a year-to-year basis, may have their permits renewed up to July 1, 1969. After that date, the permits shall not be renewed and shall be terminated finally except upon a determination by the Authorized Officer that a renewal or extension is fully consistent with the public use of the area.</P>

          <P>(a) After the effective date of this part, any agreement whereby a recreation or conservation area is leased or turned over to another Federal or non-Federal public agency for administration, shall include the requirement that any permits to individuals, groups or others issued or extended by another Federal or non-Federal public agency to whom an area has been leased or transferred for administration, shall comply with, and set forth on the face of the permit, the requirements stated in this part. Similar requirements shall be applied in situations where an existing agreement reserves such authority to this Department.</P>
          <P>(b) All such arrangements between another public agency and a permittee (see § 21.2) shall be reviewed by the Authorized Officer to assure full compliance with those provisions of the permit which are designed to assure performance in the best interests of the general public.</P>
          <P>(c) Renewals, extensions, or new leases or transfers to other Federal, State, or local agencies for administration of public recreation areas, shall be granted only pursuant to the policies set forth in this part, and only upon an affirmative finding by the Authorized Officer that they are fully consistent with present and future public uses. All applicable safeguards set forth in this part, including the protection of future public uses, shall be expressly incorporated into such leases or transfers.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 23.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Technical examination of prospective surface exploration and mining operations.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a)(1) In connection with an application for a permit or lease under the mineral leasing acts, the district manager shall make, or cause to be made, a technical examination of the prospective effects of the proposed exploration or surface mining operations upon the environment. The technical examination shall take into consideration the need for the preservation and protection of other resources, including recreational, scenic, historic, and ecological values; the control of erosion, flooding, and pollution of water; the isolation of toxic materials; the prevention of air pollution; the reclamation by revegetation, replacement of soil, or by other means, of lands affected by the exploration or mining operations; the prevention of slides; the protection of fish and wildlife and their habitat; and the prevention of hazards to public health and safety.</P>

          <P>(2) A technical examination of an area should be made with the recognition that actual potential mining sites and mining operations vary widely with respect to topography, climate, surrounding land uses, proximity to densely used areas, and other environmental influences and that mining and <PRTPAGE P="373"/>reclamation requirements should provide sufficient flexibility to permit adjustment to local conditions.</P>
          <P>(b) Based upon the technical examination, the district manager shall formulate the general requirements which the applicant must meet for the protection of nonmineral resources during the conduct of exploration or mining operations and for the reclamation of lands or waters affected by exploration or mining operations. The general requirements shall be made known in writing to the applicant before the issuance of a permit or lease or the making of a contract, and upon acceptance thereof by the applicant, shall be incorporated in the permit, lease, or contract. If an application or offer is made under the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands and if the lands are under the jurisdiction of an agency other than the Department of the Interior, the requirements must incorporate provisions prescribed by that agency. If the application or offer is made under the Mineral Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, and if the lands are under the jurisdiction of an agency other than the Department of the Interior, the district manager shall consult representatives of the agency administering the land and obtain their recommendations for provisions to be incorporated in the general requirements. If the district manager does not concur in the recommendations, the issues shall be referred for resolution to the Under Secretary of the Department of the Interior and the comparable officer of the agency submitting the recommendations. In the case of disagreement on the issues which are so referred, the Secretary of the Interior shall make a determination on the recommendations which shall be final and binding.</P>
          <P>(c) In each instance in which an application or offer is made under the mineral leasing acts, the mining supervisor shall participate in the technical examination and in the formulation of the general requirements. If the lands covered by an application or offer are under the jurisdiction of a bureau of the Department of the Interior other than the Bureau of Land Management, the district manager shall consult representatives of the bureau administering the land. If the lands covered by the application or offer are under the jurisdiction of an agency other than the Department of the Interior and that agency makes a technical examination of the type provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, district managers and mining supervisors are authorized to participate in that examination.</P>
          <P>(d) Whenever it is determined that any part of the area described in an application or offer for a permit, lease, or contract is such that previous experience under similar conditions has shown that operations cannot feasibly be conducted by any known methods or measures to avoid—</P>
          <P>(1) Rock or landslides which would be a hazard to human lives or endanger or destroy private or public property; or</P>
          <P>(2) Substantial deposition of sediment and silt into streams, lakes, reservoirs; or</P>
          <P>(3) A lowering of water quality below standards established by the appropriate State water pollution control agency, or by the Secretary of the Interior; or</P>
          <P>(4) A lowering of the quality of waters whose quality exceeds that required by the established standards—unless and until it has been affirmatively demonstrated to the State water pollution control agency and to the Department of the Interior that such lowering of quality is necessary to economic and social development and will not preclude any assigned uses made of such waters; or</P>
          <P>(5) The destruction of key wildlife habitat or important scenic, historical, or other natural or cultural features; the district manager may prohibit or otherwise restrict operations on such part of an area.</P>

          <P>(e) If, on the basis of a technical examination, the district manager determines that there is a likelihood that there will be a lowering of water quality as described in paragraphs (d) (3) and (4) of this section caused by the operation, no lease or permit shall be issued or contract made until after consultation with the Federal Water Pollution Control Administration and a finding by the Administration that the proposed operation would not be in <PRTPAGE P="374"/>violation of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. section 466 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) or of Executive Order No. 11288 (31 FR 9261). Where a permit or lease is involved the district manager's determination shall be made in consultation with the mining supervisor.</P>
          <P>(f) Each notice of a proposed appropriation of a materials site filed by the Department of Transportation under 23 U.S.C. 317 shall be transmitted to the proper district manager. The district manager shall cause a technical examination to be made as provided in paragraph (a) of this section and shall formulate the requirements which the State highway department or its nominee must meet. If the land covered by the proposed appropriation is under the jurisdiction of a bureau of the Department other than the Bureau of Land Management, the district manager shall consult representatives of the bureau administering the land. If the district manager determines, or, in an instance in which the land is administered by another bureau, a representative of that bureau determines that the proposed appropriation is contrary to the public interest or is inconsistent with the purposes for which such land or materials are reserved, the district manager shall promptly submit the matter to the Secretary of the Interior for his decision. In other instances, the district manager shall notify the Department of Transportation of the requirements and conditions which the State highway department or its nominee must meet.</P>

The mining supervisor shall consult with the district manager with respect to the surface protection and reclamation aspects before approving said plan.</P>
          <P>(b) Depending upon the size and nature of the operation and the requirements established pursuant to § 23.5 the mining supervisor or the district manager may require that the exploration plan submitted by the operator include any or all of the following:</P>
          <P>(1) A description of the area within which exploration is to be conducted;</P>
          <P>(2) Two copies of a suitable map or aerial photograph showing topographic, cultural and drainage features;</P>
          <P>(3) A statement of proposed exploration methods, i.e. drilling, trenching, etc., and the location of primary support roads and facilities;</P>
          <P>(4) A description of measures to be taken to prevent or control fire, soil erosion, pollution of surface and ground water, damage to fish and wildlife or other natural resources, and hazards to public health and safety both during and upon abandonment of exploration activities.</P>
          <P>(c) The mining supervisor or the district manager shall promptly review the exploration plan submitted to him by the operator and shall indicate to the operator any changes, additions, or amendments necessary to meet the requirements formulated pursuant to § 23.5, the provisions of the regulations in this part, and the terms of the permit.</P>
          <P>(d) The operator shall comply with the provisions of an approved exploration plan. The mining supervisor and the district manager may, with respect to such a plan, exercise the authority provided by paragraphs (f) and (g) of § 23.8 respecting a mining plan.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Approval of mining plan.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Before surface mining operations may commence under any permit or lease issued under the mineral leasing acts the operator must file a mining plan with the mining supervisor and obtain his approval of the plan. Paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section confer authority upon mining supervisors with respect to mining plans pertaining to permits or leases issued under the mineral leasing acts. The mining supervisor shall consult with the district manager with respect to the surface protection and reclamation aspects before approving said plan.</P>
          <P>(b) Depending on the size and nature of the operation and the requirements established pursuant to § 23.5, the mining supervisor or the district manager may require that the mining plan submitted by the operator include any or all of the following:</P>
          <P>(1) A description of the location and area to be affected by the operations;</P>
          <P>(2) Two copies of a suitable map, or aerial photograph showing the topography, the area covered by the permit, lease, or contract, the name and location of major topographic and cultural features, and the drainage plan away from the area to be affected;</P>
          <P>(3) A statement of proposed methods of operating, including a description of proposed roads or vehicular trails; the size and location of structures and facilities to be built;</P>
          <P>(4) An estimate of the quantity of water to be used and pollutants that are expected to enter any receiving waters;</P>
          <P>(5) A design for the necessary impoundment, treatment or control of all runoff water and drainage from workings so as to reduce soil erosion and sedimentation and to prevent the pollution of receiving waters;</P>
          <P>(6) A description of measures to be taken to prevent or control fire, soil erosion, pollution of surface and ground water, damage to fish and wildlife, and hazards to public health and safety; and</P>
          <P>(7) A statement of the proposed manner and time of performance of work to reclaim areas disturbed by the holder's operation.</P>
          <P>(c) In those instances in which the permit, lease, or contract requires the revegetation of an area of land to be affected the mining plan shall show:</P>
          <P>(1) Proposed methods of preparation and fertilizing the soil prior to replanting;</P>
          <P>(2) Types and mixtures of shrubs, trees, or tree seedlings, grasses or legumes to be planted; and</P>
          <P>(3) Types and methods of planting, including the amount of grasses or legumes per acre, or the number and spacing of trees, or tree seedlings, or combinations of grasses and trees.</P>
          <P>(d) In those instances in which the permit, lease, or contract requires regrading and backfilling, the mining plan shall show the proposed methods and the timing of grading and backfilling of areas to be affected by the operation.</P>
          <P>(e) The mining supervisor or the district manager shall review the mining plan submitted to him by the operator and shall promptly indicate to the operator any changes, additions, or amendments necessary to meet the requirements formulated pursuant to § 23.5, the provisions of the regulations in this part and the terms of the permit, lease, or contract. The operator shall comply with the provisions of an approved mining plan.</P>
          <P>(f) A mining plan may be changed by mutual consent of the mining supervisor or the district manager and the operator at any time to adjust to changed conditions or to correct any oversight.

          <SUBJECT>Performance bond.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a)(1) Upon approval of an exploration plan or mining plan, the operator shall be required to file a suitable performance bond of not less than $2,000 with satisfactory surety, payable to the Secretary of the Interior, and the bond shall be conditioned upon the faithful compliance with applicable regulations, the terms and conditions of the permit, lease, or contract, and the exploration or mining plan as approved, amended or supplemented. The bond shall be in an amount sufficient to satisfy the reclamation requirements of an approved exploration or mining plan, or an approved partial or supplemental plan. In determining the amount of the bond consideration shall be given to the character and nature of the reclamation requirements and the estimated costs of reclamation in the event that the operator forfeits his performance bond.</P>
          <P>(2) In lieu of a performance bond an operator may elect to deposit cash or negotiable bonds of the U.S. Government. The cash deposit or the market value of such securities shall be equal at least to the required sum of the bond.</P>
          <P>(b) A bond may be a nationwide or statewide bond which the operator has filed with the Department under the provisions of the applicable leasing regulations in subchapter C of chapter II of this title, if the terms and conditions thereof are sufficient to comply with the regulations in this part.</P>
          <P>(c) The district manager shall set the amount of a bond and take the necessary action for an increase or for a complete or partial release of a bond. He shall take action with respect to bonds for leases or permits only after consultation with the mining supervisor.</P>
          <P>(d) Performance bonds will not be required of Federal, State, or other governmental agencies. Where the exploration or mining is actually performed for such Federal, State, or governmental agencies by a contractor who would have to post a bond under the terms of paragraph (a) of this section if he were the operator, such agencies shall require the contractor to furnish a bond payable to the United States which meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. If, for some other purpose, the contractor furnishes a performance bond, an amendment to that bond which meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section will be acceptable in lieu of an additional or separate bond.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) In 1970, the Secretary of the Interior developed a policy statement on intergovernmental cooperation in the preservation, use and management of fish and wildlife resources. The purpose of the policy (36 FR 21034, Nov. 3, 1971) was to strengthen and support the missions of the several States and the Department of the Interior respecting fish and wildlife. Since development of the policy, a number of Congressional enactments and court decisions have addressed State and Federal responsibilities for fish and wildlife with the general effect of expanding Federal jurisdiction over certain species and uses of fish and wildlife traditionally managed by the States. In some cases, this expansion of jurisdiction has established overlapping authorities, clouded agency jurisdictions and, due to differing agency interpretations and accountabilities, has contributed to confusion and delays in the implementation of management programs. Nevertheless, Federal authority exists for specified purposes while State authority regarding fish and resident wildlife remains the comprehensive backdrop applicable in the absence of specific, overriding Federal law.</P>
          <P>(b) The Secretary of the Interior reaffirms that fish and wildlife must be maintained for their ecological, cultural, educational, historical, aesthetic, scientific, recreational, economic, and social values to the people of the United States, and that these resources are held in public trust by the Federal and State governments for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans. Because fish and wildlife are fundamentally dependent upon habitats on private and public lands managed or subject to administration by many Federal and State agencies, and because provisions for the protection, maintenance and enhancement of fish and wildlife and the regulation for their use are established in many laws and regulations involving a multitude of Federal and State administrative structures, the effective stewardship of fish and wildlife requires the cooperation of the several States and the Federal Government.</P>
          <P>(c) It is the intent of the Secretary to strengthen and support, to the maximum legal extent possible, the missions of the States <SU>1</SU>

            <FTREF/> and the Department of the Interior to conserve and manage effectively the nation's fish and wildlife. It is, therefore, important that a Department of the Interior Fish and Wildlife Policy be implemented to coordinate and facilitate the efforts of <PRTPAGE P="380"/>Federal and State agencies in the attainment of this objective.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>1</SU>“States” refers to all of the several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands and other territorial possessions, and the constituent units of government upon which these entities may have conferred authorities related to fish and wildlife matters.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The purpose of the Department of the Interior Fish and Wildlife Policy is to clarify and support the broad authorities and responsibilities of Federal <SU>2</SU>
            <FTREF/> and State agencies responsible for the management of the nation's fish and wildlife and to identify and promote cooperative agency management relationships which advance scientifically-based resource management programs. This policy is intended to reaffirm the basic role of the States in fish and resident wildlife management, especially where States have primary authority and responsibility, and to foster improved conservation of fish and wildlife.</P>
          <FTNT>
            <P>
              <SU>2</SU> Hereinafter, the Bureau of Reclamation, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service will be referred to collectively as “Federal agencies.”</P>
          </FTNT>
          <P>(b) In developing and implementing this policy, this Department will be furthering the manifest Congressional policy of Federal-State cooperation that pervades statutory enactments in the area of fish and wildlife conservation. Moreover, in recognition of the scope of its activities in managing hundreds of millions of acres of land within the several States, the Department of the Interior will continue to seek new opportunities to foster a “good neighbor” policy with the States.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 24.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>General jurisdictional principles.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) In general the States possess broad trustee and police powers over fish and wildlife within their borders, including fish and wildlife found on Federal lands within a State. Under the Property Clause of the Constitution, Congress is given the power to “make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.” In the exercise of power under the Property Clause, Congress may choose to preempt State management of fish and wildlife on Federal lands and, in circumstances where the exercise of power under the Commerce Clause is available, Congress may choose to establish restrictions on the taking of fish and wildlife whether or not the activity occurs on Federal lands, as well as to establish restrictions on possessing, transporting, importing, or exporting fish and wildlife. Finally, a third source of Federal constitutional authority for the management of fish and wildlife is the treaty making power. This authority was first recognized in the negotiation of a migratory bird treaty with Great Britain on behalf of Canada in 1916.</P>
          <P>(b) The exercise of Congressional power through the enactment of Federal fish and wildlife conservation statutes has generally been associated with the establishment of regulations more restrictive than those of State law. The power of Congress respecting the taking of fish and wildlife has been exercised as a restrictive regulatory power, except in those situations where the taking of these resources is necessary to protect Federal property. With these exceptions, and despite the existence of constitutional power respecting fish and wildlife on Federally owned lands, Congress has, in fact, reaffirmed the basic responsibility and authority of the States to manage fish and resident wildlife on Federal lands.</P>
          <P>(c) Congress has charged the Secretary of the Interior with responsibilities for the management of certain fish and wildlife resources, e.g., endangered and threatened species, migratory birds, certain marine mammals, and certain aspects of the management of some anadromous fish. However, even in these specific instances, with the limited exception of marine mammals, State jurisdiction remains concurrent with Federal authority.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 24.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Resource management and public activities on Federal lands.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The four major systems of Federal lands administered by the Department of the Interior are lands administered by the Bureau of Reclamation, Bureau of Land Management, units of the National Wildlife Refuge System and national fish hatcheries, and units of the National Park System.</P>

          <P>(b) The Bureau of Reclamation withdraws public lands and acquires non-<PRTPAGE P="381"/>Federal lands for construction and operation of water resource development projects within the 17 Western States. Recreation and conservation or enhancement of fish and wildlife resources are often designated project purposes. General authority for Reclamation to modify project structures, develop facilities, and acquire lands to accommodate fish and wildlife resources is given to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1946, as amended (16 U.S.C. 661-667e). That act further provides that the lands, waters and facilities designated for fish and wildlife management purposes, in most instances, should be made available by cooperative agreement to the agency exercising the administration of these resources of the particular State involved. The Federal Water Project Recreation Act of 1965, as amended, also directs Reclamation to encourage non-Federal public bodies to administer project land and water areas for recreation and fish and wildlife enhancement. Reclamation withdrawal, however, does not enlarge the power of the United States with respect to management of fish and resident wildlife and, except for activities specified in Section III.3 above, basic authority and responsibility for management of fish and resident wildlife on such lands remains with the State.</P>

          <P>(c) BLM-administered lands comprise in excess of 300 million acres that support significant and diverse populations of fish and wildlife. Congress in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) directed that non-wilderness BLM lands be managed by the Secretary under principles of multiple use and sustained yield, and for both wilderness and non-wilderness lands explicitly recognized and reaffirmed the primary authority and responsibility of the States for management of fish and resident wildlife on such lands. Concomitantly, the Secretary of the Interior is charged with the responsibility to manage non-wilderness BLM lands for multiple uses, including fish and wildlife conservation. However, this authority to manage lands for fish and wildlife values is not a preemption of State jurisdiction over fish and wildlife. In exercising this responsibility the Secretary is empowered to close areas to hunting, fishing or trapping for specified reasons viz., public safety, administration, or compliance with provisions of applicable law. The closure authority of the Secretary is thus a power to close areas to particular activities for particular reasons and does not in and of itself constitute a grant of authority to the Secretary to manage wildlife or require or authorize the issuance of hunting and/or fishing permits or licenses.</P>
          <P>(d) While the several States therefore possess primary authority and responsibility for management of fish and resident wildlife on Bureau of Land Management lands, the Secretary, through the Bureau of Land Management, has custody of the land itself and the habitat upon which fish and resident wildlife are dependent. Management of the habitat is a responsibility of the Federal Government. Nevertheless, Congress in the Sikes Act has directed the Secretary of the Interior to cooperate with the States in developing programs on certain public lands, including those administered by BLM and the Department of Defense, for the conservation and rehabilitation of fish and wildlife including specific habitat improvement projects.</P>

          <P>(e) Units of the National Wildlife Refuge System occur in nearly every State and constitute Federally owned or controlled areas set aside primarily as conservation areas for migratory waterfowl and other species of fish or wildlife. Units of the system also provide outdoor enjoyment for millions of visitors annually for the purpose of hunting, fishing and wildlife-associated recreation. In 1962 and 1966, Congress authorized the use of National Wildlife Refuges for outdoor recreation provided that it is compatible with the primary purposes for which the particular refuge was established. In contrast to multiple use public lands, the conservation, enhancement and perpetuation of fish and wildlife is almost invariably the principal reason for the establishment of a unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System. In consequence, Federal activity respecting management of migratory waterfowl and other wildlife residing on units of the National Wildlife Refuge System <PRTPAGE P="382"/>involves a Federal function specifically authorized by Congress. It is therefore for the Secretary to determine whether units of the System shall be open to public uses, such as hunting and fishing, and on what terms such access shall be granted. However, in recognition of the existing jurisdictional relationship between the States and the Federal Government, Congress, in the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd), has explicitly stated that nothing therein shall be construed as affecting the authority of the several States to manage fish and resident wildlife found on units of the system. Thus, Congress has directed that, to the maximum extent practicable, such public uses shall be consistent with State laws and regulations. Units of the National Wildlife Refuge System, therefore, shall be managed, to the extent practicable and compatible with the purposes for which they were established, in accordance with State laws and regulations, comprehensive plans for fish and wildlife developed by the States, and Regional Resource Plans developed by the Fish and Wildlife Service in cooperation with the States.</P>
          <P>(f) Units of the National Park System contain natural, recreation, historic, and cultural values of national significance as designated by Executive and Congressional action. Specific enabling legislation has authorized limited hunting, trapping or fishing activity within certain areas of the system. As a general rule, consumptive resource utilization is prohibited. Those areas which do legislatively allow hunting, trapping, or fishing, do so in conformance with applicable Federal and State laws. The Superintendent may, in consultation with the appropriate State agency, fix times and locations where such activities will be prohibited. Areas of the National Park System which permit fishing generally will do so in accordance with applicable State and Federal Laws.</P>
          <P>(g) In areas of exclusive Federal jurisdiction, State laws are not applicable. However, every attempt shall be made to consult with the appropriate States to minimize conflicting and confusing regulations which may cause undue hardship.</P>
          <P>(h) The management of habitat for species of wildlife, populations of wildlife, or individual members of a population shall be in accordance with a Park Service approved Resource Management Plan. The appropriate States shall be consulted prior to the approval of management actions, and memoranda of understanding shall be executed as appropriate to ensure the conduct of programs which meet mutual objectives.</P>
          <P>(i) Federal agencies of the Department of the Interior shall:</P>
          <P>(1) Prepare fish and wildlife management plans in cooperation with State fish and wildlife agencies and other Federal (non-Interior) agencies where appropriate. Where such plans are prepared for Federal lands adjoining State or private lands, the agencies shall consult with the State or private landowners to coordinate management objectives;</P>
          <P>(2) Within their statutory authority and subject to the management priorities and strategies of such agencies, institute fish and wildlife habitat management practices in cooperation with the States to assist the States in accomplishing their fish and wildlife resource plans;</P>
          <P>(3) Provide for public use of Federal lands in accordance with State and Federal laws, and permit public hunting, fishing and trapping within statutory and budgetary limitations and in a manner compatible with the primary objectives for which the lands are administered. The hunting, fishing, and trapping, and the possession and disposition of fish, game, and fur animals, shall be conducted in all other respects within the framework of applicable State and Federal laws, including requirements for the possession of appropriate State licenses or permits.</P>

          <P>(4) For those Federal lands that are already open for hunting, fishing, or trapping, closure authority shall not be exercised without prior consultation with the affected States, except in emergency situations. The Bureau of Land Management may, after consultation with the States, close all or any portion of public land under its jurisdiction to public hunting, fishing, or trapping for reasons of public safety, administration, or compliance with <PRTPAGE P="383"/>provisions of applicable law. The National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service may, after consultation with the States, close all or any portion of Federal land under their jurisdictions, or impose such other restrictions as are deemed necessary, for reasons required by the Federal laws governing the management of their areas; and</P>
          <P>(5) Consult with the States and comply with State permit requirements in connection with the activities listed below, except in instances where the Secretary of the Interior determines that such compliance would prevent him from carrying out his statutory responsibilities:</P>
          <P>(i) In carrying out research programs involving the taking or possession of fish and wildlife or programs involving reintroduction of fish and wildlife;</P>
          <P>(ii) For the planned and orderly removal of surplus or harmful populations of fish and wildlife except where emergency situations requiring immediate action make such consultation and compliance with State regulatory requirements infeasible; and</P>
          <P>(iii) In the disposition of fish and wildlife taken under paragraph (i) (5)(i) or (i) (5)(ii) of this section.</P>

          <SUBJECT>International agreements.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) International conventions have increasingly been utilized to address fish and wildlife issues having dimensions beyond national boundaries. The authority to enter into such agreements is reserved to the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. However, while such agreements may be valuable in the case of other nations, in a Federal system such as ours sophisticated fish and wildlife programs already established at the State level may be weakened or not enhanced.</P>
          <P>(b) To ensure that effective fish and wildlife programs already established at the State level are not weakened, the policy of the Department of the Interior shall be to recommend that the United States negotiate and accede to only those international agreements that give strong consideration to established State programs designed to ensure the conservation of fish and wildlife populations.</P>
          <P>(c) It shall be the policy of the Department to actively solicit the advice of affected State agencies and to recommend to the U.S. Department of State that representatives of such agencies be involved before and during negotiation of any new international conventions concerning fish and wildlife.</P>

          <P>(a) By reason of the Congressional policy (e.g., Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1956) of State-Federal cooperation and coordination in the area of fish and wildlife conservation, State and Federal agencies have implemented cooperative agreements for a variety of fish and wildlife programs on Federal lands. This practice shall be continued and encouraged. Appropriate topics for such cooperative agreements include but are not limited to:</P>
          <P>(1) Protection, maintenance, and development of fish and wildlife habitat;</P>
          <P>(2) Fish and wildlife reintroduction and propagation;</P>

          <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The Youth Conservation Corps (YCC) is a program of summer employment for young men and women, aged 15 through 18, who work, earn, and learn together by doing projects which further the development and conservation of the natural resources of the United States. The corps is open to youth of both sexes, and youth of all social, economic, and racial classifications who are permanent residents of the United States, its territories, possessions, trust territories or commonwealths.</P>
          <P>(b) The Youth Conservation Corps Act of 1970 (Pub. L. 91-378) provided for a 3-year pilot program to be carried out on lands and waters under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior. Public Law 92-597 amended the 1970 Act to include a pilot program (beginning in fiscal year 1974) of grants to States to assist them in meeting the cost of Youth Conservation Corps projects on non-Federal public lands and waters within the States. Public Law 93-408 made the Youth Conservation Corps program permanent.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Program purpose and objectives.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The purpose of the Act is to further the development and maintenance of the natural resources of the United States by American youth and in so doing prepare them for the ultimate responsibility of maintaining and managing these resources for the American people. The Departments of Agriculture and the Interior have stressed the following three equally important objectives of the Youth Conservation Corps as reflected in the law:</P>
          <P>(1) Accomplish needed conservation work on public lands.</P>
          <P>(2) Provide gainful employment for 15- through 18-year-old males and females from all social, economic, and racial backgrounds.</P>
          <P>(3) Develop an understanding and appreciation of the Nation's environment and heritage in participating youth.</P>
          <P>(b) These objectives will be accomplished in a manner that will provide the youth with an opportunity to acquire increased self-dignity and self-discipline, better work and relate with peers and supervisors, and build lasting cultural bridges between youth from various social, ethnic, racial and economic backgrounds.</P>
          <P>(c) Each YCC project will have, to the maximum extent possible as determined by the Secretaries' representatives, the following characteristics:</P>
          <P>(1) A properly balanced and integrated environmental work-learning program in which environmental knowledge and awareness derives principally from meaningful work activities on public lands.</P>
          <P>(2) A mixture of youth of both sexes from various social, economic, ethnic, and racial backgrounds which is representative of the youth residing within the recruiting area.</P>
          <P>(3) A group-living component, both in residential and nonresidential programs, wherein enrollees have an opportunity to relate to each other and to staff during nonworking hours in activities which promote social interaction and group learning (e.g., evening cookouts, overnight or weekend camping).</P>

          <P>(4) An enrollment of sufficient size (not less than 10 enrollees) that will permit social interaction and group learning. The program encourages <PRTPAGE P="386"/>projects of a size of 20 to 50 enrollees as the most desirable size.</P>

          </P>
          <EXTRACT>
            <P>Sec. 4(a).

            <P>(c)(1) The amount of any grant under this section shall be determined jointly by the Secretaries, except that no grant for any project may exceed 80 per centum of the cost (as determined by the Secretaries) of such project.</P>
            <P>(2) Payments under grants under this section may be made in advance or by way of reimbursement and at such intervals and on such conditions as the Secretaries find necessary.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Administrative requirements.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The following administrative requirements must be met:</P>
          <P>(a) Recruitment and selection will be conducted in accordance with a Statewide plan designed to assure:</P>
          <P>(1) An equal opportunity for both sexes, for all urban and rural youth regardless of social, economic, ethnic or racial background, with special outreach efforts toward minority, disadvantaged, non-public school youth, and youth having left school before graduation;</P>
          <P>(2) That selections will be made on a random basis, without consideration of race, creed, religion, or national origin. Each project should be assigned as near as possible an equal number of slots for males and females;</P>
          <P>(3) That enrollees have attained age 15 by June 1 but not age 19 by August 30;</P>
          <P>(4) That not more than 10 percent of the enrollees in a project have been YCC enrollees in previous years and all returnees be designated as youth leaders and paid $1.50 per day in addition to their hourly rate of pay.</P>
          <P>(b) To the maximum extent practicable, enrollees should be selected from an area within 1 day's surface travel from their home to a residential YCC project.</P>
          <P>(c) Capital outlays for facilities should be kept at a minimum. No grant is to be made for construction of residential facilities other than to provide temporary facilities and their necessary basic infrastructure, and necessary renovation or modification of existing facilities.</P>
          <P>(d) Operation of a project or session will be for a minimum of 26 consecutive calendar days. Projects during nonsummer periods may be authorized by the Secretaries when it can clearly be demonstrated that enrollment will not interfere with the established educational systems.</P>

          <P>(e) The enrollee is an employee of the grantee or subgrantee. Depending on grantee's or subgrantee's work-week, grantees will insure that enrollees are engaged in up to 40 hours of work-<PRTPAGE P="387"/>learning activities each week, 25 percent of which will be in environmental awareness.</P>
          <P>(f) To arrive at the enrollee weekly pay rate, the Federal or State minimum hourly wage (whichever is higher) should be multiplied by 30 hours per week, or 75 percent of the number of hours in the grantee or subgrantee established work-week, if less than 40 hours. To the maximum extent possible, the grantee should apply the same meal and lodging deduction as used by the Federal program.</P>
          <P>(g) The Federal Government will cost-share as part of the grant enrollee pay based on up to 30 hours per week; any cost based on enrollee compensation for more than 30 hours per week will be assumed by the grantee or sub-grantee and will not be part of the grant.</P>
          <P>(h) Grantees must provide for an effective accident control, health, and safety program. As a minimum, grantees shall follow U.S. Department of Labor Bulletin No. 101, “A Guide to Child Labor Provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.”</P>
          <P>(i) Grantees will have a financial management system which will provide the information called for in attachment G of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) circular A-102 (formerly FMC 74-7).</P>
          <P>(j) “Request for Advance or Reimbursement,” as outlined in OMB circular A-102, attachment H, item 4(a), will be used to obtain an advance to start and/or maintain the program. It can also be used to obtain a reimbursement during or at the end of a project. An advance, not to exceed 1 month's needs, may be made after approval of the grant application.</P>
          <P>(k) Grantees will prepare a “Financial Status Report” required by OMB circular A-102, attachment H, item (3)a. This report will be prepared on a cash basis. Instructions and forms will be supplied each grantee at the time of grant award. Grantees shall require similar reports from all subgrantees and contractors to facilitate their own reporting to the grantor agencies. The Financial Status Report will be prepared as of December 31 of each operating year. This report will be forwarded in time to reach the Secretaries by March 31 of the following operating year.</P>
          <P>(l) Allowable costs under the grant program are defined in FMC 74-4 and OMB circular A-102.</P>
          <P>(m) Records retention and custodial requirements for records are prescribed by attachment C to OMB circular A-102.</P>
          <P>(n) A budget revision is required in advance when the scope of the grant is to be changed through (1) addition or elimination of a project, (2) reduction in the State's grant program of 5 percent or more of enrollees, and/or (3) determination that the grantee will not utilize Federal funds in amount in excess of $5,000 or 5 percent of the Federal grant, whichever is greater. A budget revision must also be submitted when the State's matching ratio is reduced. No budget revision may be submitted later than March 31 following the end of the operating year. Procedures in attachment K of OMB circular A-102 will be followed.</P>
          <P>(o) Grantees shall comply with the provisions of attachments N and O of OMB circular A-102 in regard to nonexpendable personal property and procurement standards.</P>
          <P>(p) The Secretaries or their designees shall periodically review the conduct of the program of the State.</P>
          <P>(q) Grantees will supervise those projects in the State being administered by subgrantees and contractors. Subgrantees and contractors will be required to operate in accordance with the procedures outlined in these regulations and the grant agreement with the State. Periodic inspection of subgrantee projects will be made by the grantee under the direction of the program agent or his designee. Grantees or subgrantees may contract with any public agency or organization or any private nonprofit agency or organization which has been in existence for at least 5 years.</P>
          <P>(r) Grantees will meet the financial audit requirements of attachment G to OMB circular A-102 and will require the same of subgrantees. Copies of audits will be made available to the Secretaries upon request.</P>

          <P>(s) Grantees shall provide accidental injury compensation and tort claims <PRTPAGE P="388"/>coverage under State laws for its enrollees. Enrollees shall be employed without regard to State personnel laws, rules, and regulations applicable to full-time employees. It is not intended that State enrollees be covered for retirement, unemployment compensation, health and life insurance purposes, or that they earn or be granted leave-with-pay or sick leave; such charges shall not be considered a qualifiying expense for Federal cost-share purposes.</P>
          <P>(t) If the grantee fails to comply with the grant award stipulations, standards, or conditions, the Secretaries may jointly suspend the grant, in whole or in part, pending corrective action. Subsequent to or during any period of suspension of the grant, the Federal Government shall not be obligated to reimburse the grantee for any incurrence of obligations for suspended projects other than direct pay of enrollees and then only for a period of time which both the Secretaries shall determine to be reasonable. In addition, the Secretaries may jointly terminate the grant, in whole or in part. Termination shall be effected by notice of termination. Upon receipt of a notice of termination, the grantee shall:</P>
          <P>(1) Discontinue further commitments of grant funds for the terminated project(s).</P>
          <P>(2) Cancel all sub-grants or contracts, where possible, scheduled for payment with funds budgeted for the terminated project(s).</P>
          <P>(3) Within 90 days after receipt of the notice of termination for the entire grant, supply either of the Secretaries with a financial status report, along with a refund check for any unused portion of funds advanced, or a request for reimbursement for allowable expenditures incurred in the grant program.</P>

          <P>(a) Of the amount available for Youth Conservation Corps projects, 30 percent will be allocated for State projects. All States will be given an opportunity to participate in the program. Allocated funds not needed by a State will be reallocated, based on the merit of proposals submitted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
          <P>(b) Pursuant to section (4)(c)(1) of Public Law 93-408, States may receive grants up to but not to exceed 80 percent of the cost of funding any project from the Federal Government. The combined Federal/State costs of individual projects and other program expenses as established in the grant application determine the Federal/State cost-sharing ratio. Matching State costs can consist of either direct expenditures or services of an in-kind nature.</P>
          <P>(c) Application for Federal Assistance (Standard Form 424) will be used by applicants in applying for grants under this program. Application forms will be supplied to Program Agents. Only a Program Agent may submit an application. A single grant application must be submitted for the entire summer program within each State. A separate application must be used for non-summer projects. A non-summer project is defined as one which extends beyond September 30, or begins prior to May 1.</P>
          <P>(d) The Secretaries have designated individuals for each State who will jointly represent them. Grant applications (original and two copies) must be submitted to the designated reresentative of either Secretary. January 1 has been established as the deadline date for acceptance of applications for each operating year. Names and addresses of designated representatives will be furnished to each State. The Secretaries' representatives must jointly approve grant proposals. Approval or disapproval of proposals will be documented by a formal letter to the Program Agent. The Secretaries' representatives will also be available for technical assistance and will monitor the program.</P>

          <P>(c) <E T="03">Contracting practices.</E> Recipients to which this part applies and each of their contractors and subcontractors with a contract of $150,000 or more shall also include in their affirmative action plan a program in which the recipient, contractor or subcontractor agrees to take specific affirmative action as set forth below to utilize minority business enterprises as subcontractors and suppliers.

          <P>(6) Inform minority business enterprises and organizations of minority business enterprises of contracting opportunities and procedures.</P>
          <P>(7) Cooperate with the Department Compliance Officer in any studies and surveys of the recipient's minority business enterprise procedures and practices that the Department Compliance Officer may from time to time conduct.</P>
          <P>(8) Assist potential minority business enterprises in obtaining and maintaining suitable bonding capabilities, in those instances where bonds are required.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Records, reports, and access to books.</E> Each recipient, contractor, or subcontractor to which this part applies, shall keep such records and submit to the Department Compliance Officer complete and accurate reports, at such times, and in such form, and containing such information, as he may determine to be necessary to enable him to ascertain whether the recipient, contractor or subcontractor has complied or is complying with rules, regulations and orders implementing section 403 of Public Law 93-153. In the case where the recipient, contractor or <PRTPAGE P="395"/>subcontractor contracts with another, such other contractor shall also submit such compliance reports to the recipient, contractor or subcontractor as may be necessary to enable the recipient, contractor or subcontractor to determine and carry out his obligations under section 403 of Public Law 93-153 and implementing rules, regulations, and orders.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Access to sources of information.</E> Each recipient, contractor and subcontractor to which this part applies, shall permit access by the Department Compliance Officer or his designee or by the Secretary or his designee during normal business hours to such of his books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, and his facilities, as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with rules, regulations, and orders implementing section 403 of Public Law 93-153.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Information in possession of other agency, institution, or person.</E> Where any information required of a recipient, contractor or subcontractor is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution, or person and such agency, institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish this information, the recipient, contractor or subcontractor shall so certify in a report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Failure to submit reports.</E> Failure to file timely, complete and accurate reports as required constitutes noncompliance with the equal opportunity clause and is ground for the imposition by the agency, recipient, contractor, or subcontractor of any sanctions as authorized by section 403 of Public Law 93-153 and implementating rules, regulations, and orders.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Information to beneficiaries and participants.</E> Each recipient, contractor and subcontractor to which this part applies, shall make available to participants in and beneficiaries of its operations and services, information regarding the provisions of this part and the details of the recipient's, contractor's or subcontractor's compliance with this part, to the extent that it will enhance their participation in nondiscrimination programs of recipient, contractor, or subcontractor, and aid the recipient, contractor, or subcontractor in meeting its obligations under this part.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 27.8</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Compliance procedures.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Approval of affirmative action plans.</E> The Department Compliance Officer shall from time to time review the recipient's, contractor's or subcontractor's affirmative action plans to determine whether they meet the requirements of rules, regulations and orders implementing section 403 of Public Law 93-153. Where deficiencies are found to exist, the Department Compliance Officer or his designee will so inform the recipient, contractor or subcontractor and the matter will be resolved by informal means whenever possible. If it has been determined that the matter cannot be resolved by informal means, action will be taken as provided for in § 27.9.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Periodic compliance reviews.</E> The Department Compliance Officer shall from time to time review the practices of recipients, contractors and subcontractors to determine whether they are complying with the rules, regulations and orders implementing section 403 of Public Law 93-153. The purpose of the compliance review is to determine if the recipient, contractor or subcontractor maintains nondiscriminatory operations and practices and whether it is taking the action required by the rules, regulations, and orders implementing section 403 of Public Law 93-153 to assure that no person on the grounds of race, creed, color, national origin or sex is excluded from receiving or participating in any activity conducted under any permit, right-of-way, public land order or other Federal authorization to which this part applies. It shall consist of a comprehensive analysis of all aspects of the recipient's, contractor's or subcontractor's operations and practices which may be involved, and the policies and conditions resulting therefrom. Where necessary, recommendations for appropriate sanctions shall be made.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Complaints.</E> Any person who believes himself or any other individual to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part may file with the Department Compliance Officer or his designee, a written complaint. A complaint must be filed not later than 180 <PRTPAGE P="396"/>days from the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the Department Compliance Officer or his designee.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Investigations.</E> The Department Compliance Officer or his designee will make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review report, complaint, or any other information indicates a possible failure to comply with the rules, regulations, and orders implementing section 403 of Public Law 93-153. The investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, contractor, or subcontractor, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance occurred and other factors relevant to a determination as to whether the recipient, contractor or subcontractor has failed to comply with section 403 of Public Law 93-153 and implementing rules, regulations, and orders.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Resolution of matters.</E> (1) If an investigation pursuant to paragraph (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section indicates a failure to comply with the rules, regulations, and orders implementing section 403 of Public Law 93-153, the Department Compliance Officer or his designee will so inform the recipient, contractor or subcontractor and the matter will be resolved by informal means whenever possible. Before the recipient, contractor or subcontractor can be found to be in compliance, he must make specific commitments in writing, to correct all deficiencies. The commitments must include the precise actions to be taken and dates for completion. The time periods allotted shall be no longer than the minimum periods necessary to effect such changes. Upon approval of the Department Compliance Officer, the recipient, contractor or subcontractor, may be considered in compliance, on condition that the commitments are faithfully kept. The recipient, contractor or subcontractor shall be notified that making such commitments does not preclude future determinations of noncompliance when the commitments are not being met or when there is a determination by the Department Compliance Officer that the full facts were not known at the time commitments were accepted, and that commitments are not sufficient to correct deficiencies.</P>
          <P>(2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Department Compliance Officer shall so inform the recipient, contractor or subcontractor, and the complainant, if any, in writing.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited.</E> No recipient, contractor or subcontractor shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by section 403 of Public Law 93-153 and implementing rules, regulations, and orders, or because he has made a complaint, testified, assisted, benefited from, or participated in any manner in an investigation, compliance review, proceeding, or hearing under this part. The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this part including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising thereunder.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Approval of action by Authorized Officer.</E> During the period of construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, and until such time as this paragraph (g) is rescinded by the Secretary, the Department Compliance Officer shall coordinate all actions taken pursuant to this part with the Authorized Officer and shall secure the approval of the Authorized Officer prior to the taking of any final act hereunder.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> If there appears to be a failure or refusal of any recipient, contractor, or subcontractor to observe or comply substantially with section 403 of Public Law 93-153, or implementing rules, regulations, and orders, compliance may be effected through the use of conciliation conferences, informal hearings, and procedures to cause termination or suspension of or refusal to grant or to continue the permit, or other Federal authorization to which this part applies, or of the contracts to which this part applies, or by any other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to:<PRTPAGE P="397"/>
          </P>
          <P>(1) A reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States or any assurance or other contractural undertaking, and</P>
          <P>(2) Any applicable proceeding under State or local law.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Noncompliance with § 27.4.</E> In the event that a recipient fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 27.4, or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section the failure or refusal may, at the option of the Secretary, be grounds for authorizing proceedings to cause refusal of the Federal authorization in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The Department of the Interior shall not be required to provide the authorization in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue the Federal authorization</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> In those instances where a recipient fails or refuses to observe or comply substantially with section 403 of Public Law 93-153 or implementing rules, regulations, and orders, noncompliance at the option of the Secretary, may be grounds for termination, suspension, refusal to grant or continue the Federal authorization.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Recommendation to proceed.</E> The Department Compliance Officer may request that the Secretary commence procedures to suspend, terminate, or refuse to grant or continue the Federal authorization or to cause such suspension, termination, or refusal to grant. He shall indicate the specific grounds for alleging noncompliance with section 403 and implementing rules, regulations, and orders, the actions which would create compliance, and the time necessary to achieve compliance.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Commencement of proceedings.</E> Before the Secretary authorizes the commencement of an administrative proceeding for termination, suspension, or refusal to grant any Federal authorization to which this part applies, the Secretary or his designee shall give the recipient notice in writing of the alleged ground or grounds for termination or formal suspension, or refusal to grant, with sufficient particularity to enable the recipient to comply with section 403 of Public Law 93-153 and implementing rules, regulations and orders. The recipient shall have sixty (60) days from the date of delivery of the notice within which to comply. If compliance cannot be achieved in sixty (60) days, the recipient shall be entitled to additional time if he demonstrates that compliance is not possible within the sixty (60) day period and that the necessary curative actions were undertaken promptly and have been diligently prosecuted toward completion; <E T="03">Provided further</E> that the aforesaid additional time shall not exceed ninety (90) days from the last day of the said sixty (60) day period, without the prior written consent of the Secretary or his designee which shall specify the last day upon which the curative action must be completed to the satisfaction of the Secretary or his designee.</P>
          <P>(iii) <E T="03">Opportunity for a hearing.</E> No order suspending, terminating or refusing to grant or continue any Federal authorization to which this part applies shall become effective until there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for a formal hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply substantially with section 403 of Public Law 93-153 or implementing rules, regulations, and orders and the action has been approved by the Secretary pursuant to § 27.11(e).</P>
          <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Other means authorized by law.</E> No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) the action has been approved by the Secretary, (2) the recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and (3) the expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person. During this period of at least 10 days additional efforts shall be made to persuade the recipient or other person to comply and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Informal hearings</E>—(1) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The Department Compliance Officer may convene such informal hearings as may <PRTPAGE P="398"/>be deemed appropriate for the purpose of inquiring into the status of compliance of any recipient, contractor, or subcontractor to which this part applies.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice.</E> Recipients, contractors, and subcontractors shall be advised in writing as to the time and place of the informal hearings and may be directed to bring specific documents and records, or furnish other relevant information concerning their compliance status. When so requested, the recipient, contractor, or subcontractor shall attend and bring requested documents and records, or other requested information.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Conduct of hearings.</E> The hearing shall be conducted by hearing officers appointed by the Department Compliance Officer.

          <P>(b) <E T="03">Formal hearings</E>—(1) <E T="03">Opportunity for hearing.</E> Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required by § 27.9(c), reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either (i) fix a date not less than twenty (20) days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of the Secretary or his designee or the administrative law judge to whom the matter has been assigned that the matter be scheduled for hearing or (ii) advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this paragraph or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 403 of Public Law 93-153 and implementing rules, regulations, and orders and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of information on the record.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Time and place of hearing.</E> Hearings shall be conducted by the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department, at a time and place fixed by the administrative law judge to whom the matter has been assigned.

          <P>(4) <E T="03">Procedures, evidence, and record.</E> (i) The hearing, decision, and any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with 5 U.S.C. 554 through 557 and in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for findings, and other related matters. Both the Department and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the administrative law judge conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearing.</P>

          <P>(ii) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where determined reasonably necessary by the administrative law judge conducting the hearing. The administrative law judge may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to <PRTPAGE P="399"/>examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent that the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Consolidated or joint hearings.</E> In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this part with respect to two or more Federal authorizations to which this part applies, or asserted to constitute noncompliance with this part and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies, the Secretary may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies, where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules of procedure not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this part is concerned, shall be made in accordance with § 27.11.</P>

The Fund's maximum liability for any one incident is the amount of the claims over $14 million but not to exceed $100 million.</P>
          <P>(b) The Fund shall be subject to, and shall take all steps necessary to carry out its responsibilities under, the Act and these implementing regulations.</P>

The Board shall elect by a majority vote a Chairman and a Secretary annually.</P>
          <P>(2) Where any activity of the Fund creates a conflict of interest, or the appearance of a conflict of interest, on the part of any member of the Board of Trustees, the member involved shall excuse himself or herself from any consideration of such activity by the Board of Trustees.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Imposition of strict liability.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, where a vessel is engaged in any segment of transportation between the terminal facilities of the Pipeline and ports under the jurisdiction of the United States, and is carrying TAPS oil, the Owner and Operator (jointly and severally), and the Fund established by section 204(c) of the Act, shall be strictly liable without regard to fault in accordance with that section for all damages, including clean-up costs, sustained by any person or entity, public or private, including residents of Canada, as a result of any discharge of TAPS oil from such vessel. Strict liability under this section shall cease when the TAPS oil has first been brought ashore at a port under the jurisdiction of the United States.</P>
          <P>(b) Strict liability shall not be imposed under this part if the Owner or Operator of the vessel, or the Fund, can prove that the damages were caused by an act of war or by the negligence of the United States or other governmental agency. Strict liability shall not be imposed under the Act with respect to the claim of a damaged party if the Owner or Operator of the vessel, or the Fund, can prove that the damage was caused by the negligence of such damaged party.</P>
          <P>(c)(1) Strict liability for all claims arising out of any one incident shall not exceed $100 million. The Owner and Operator of the vessel shall be jointly and severally liable for the first $14 million of the claims that meet the definition of damages as provided for in these regulations. The Fund shall be liable for the balance of the claims that meet the same definition up to $100 million. If the total of these claims exceeds $100 million, they shall be reduced proportionately. The unpaid portion of any claim may be asserted and adjudicated under other applicable Federal or State law.</P>
          <P>(2) The Fund shall establish uniform procedures to determine whether claims from a TAPS oil spill might exceed $14 million and $100 million. These procedures shall provide that when a determination is made that claims may exceed $100 million, payment of claims may be withheld in full or in part for a twenty-four month period so that claims may be proportionately reduced prior to payment.</P>

          <P>(d)(1) Each Owner or Operator of a vessel shall obtain from the Federal Maritime Commission a “Certificate of Financial Responsibility (Alaska Pipeline)” demonstrating compliance with the provisions of section 311(p) of the <PRTPAGE P="406"/>Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1321(p)), and regulations promulgated pursuant to such act (33 CFR part 131). Notwithstanding inconsistent language in such act, financial responsibility in the amount of $14 million for all such vessels must be established.</P>
          <P>(2) The certificate obtained in accordance with this subsection shall be carried on board the vessel. No TAPS oil may be loaded on any vessel which has not been issued a valid certificate which is still in effect at the time of loading.</P>

          <P>(c) Prior to reaching $14 million in claims filed, the contact person shall notify the Fund whether the vessel Owner or Operator will assume responsibility to pay damages over the $14 million level.</P>

          <P>(d)(1) In the event the vessel Owner or Operator refuses to pay claims over the $14 million level, the Fund shall determine if the $14 million in claims already filed meet the definition of damage as established by this section. The Fund shall pay the claims, or portion of claims, over $14 million, which have been determined to meet that definition.<PRTPAGE P="407"/>
          </P>

          <P>(e) In the event the vessel Owner or Operator refuses payment of any claims up to $14 million, the injured parties have recourse to the district court for the Federal district in which the spill occurred or the appropriate State court for the State in which the spill occurred. The Fund only becomes liable after $14 million in claims meeting the definition of damages have been paid or have been acknowledged as payable by the vessel Owner or Operator.</P>
          <P>(f) The Fund may settle or compromise any claim presented to it.</P>
          <P>(g) No claim may be presented, nor any action be commenced, for damages recoverable under this part unless that claim is presented to or that action is commenced against the vessel Owner or Operator, or their guarantor, or against the Fund, as to their respective liabilities, within two years from the date of discovery of the damages caused by an incident, or of the date of the incident causing the damages, whichever is earlier.</P>
          <P>(h)(1) The Board of Trustees, by a majority vote, shall decide to allow or deny claims or settlements presented to the Fund in accordance with this section. In its discretion the Board may delegate the authority to settle classes of claims to the Administrator.</P>
          <P>(2)(i) Where a claim is presented to the Fund by or on behalf of any person having a close business, personal or governmental association with any member of the Board of Trustees, such as to create a conflict of interest or the appearance of such conflict of interest on the part of such member of the Board of Trustees, the member involved shall excuse himself or herself from any consideration of such claim.</P>
          <P>(ii) Where a claim presented to the Fund has previously been presented to the Owner or Operator and such Owner or Operator has a close business, personal or governmental association with any member of the Board of Trustees, such as to create a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest on the part of such member of the Board of Trustees, the member involved shall excuse himself or herself from any consideration of such claim.</P>

            <P>(a) When, after a decision and order in a formal probate proceeding, it is found that property has been improperly included in the inventory of an estate, the inventory must be modified to eliminate this property. A petition for modification may be filed by the superintendent of the agency where the property is located, or by any interested party.

            <SUBJECT>What happens if an error in BIA's estate inventory is alleged?</SUBJECT>
            <P>This section applies when, during a probate proceeding, an interested party alleges that the estate inventory prepared by BIA is inaccurate and should be corrected.</P>
            <P>(a) Alleged inaccuracies may include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Trust property should be removed from the inventory because the decedent executed a gift deed or gift deed application during the decedent's lifetime, and BIA had not, as of the time of death, determined whether to approve the gift deed or gift deed application;</P>
            <P>(2) Trust property should be removed from the inventory because a deed through which the decedent acquired the property is invalid;</P>
            <P>(3) Trust property should be added to the inventory; and</P>
            <P>(4) Trust property included in the inventory is described improperly, although an erroneous recitation of acreage alone is not considered an improper description.</P>

            <P>(b) When an error in the estate inventory is alleged, the OHA deciding official will refer the matter to BIA for resolution under 25 CFR parts 150, 151, <PRTPAGE P="418"/>or 152 and the appeal procedures at 25 CFR part 2.</P>
            <P>(1) If BIA makes a final determination resolving the inventory challenge before the judge issues a final decision in the probate proceeding, the probate decision will reflect the inventory determination.</P>
            <P>(2) If BIA does not make a final determination resolving the inventory challenge before the judge issues a final decision in the probate proceeding, the final probate decision will:</P>
            <P>(i) Include a reference to the pending inventory challenge; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Note that the probate decision is subject to administrative modification once the inventory dispute has been resolved.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 32.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Program operation requirements.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The State agencies cooperating with Interior and Forest Service having natural resource management responsibilities should be involved in the planning and implementation of the program.</P>
          <P>(b) Grantees shall be responsible for the management of each Corps camp and project, final selection of enrollees, determination of enrollee work assignments, training, discipline and termination, and camp operations in accordance with this part and guidelines issued by Interior and Forest Service.</P>
          <P>(1) Grantees shall assure that YACC program activities will not result in the displacement of employed workers (including partial displacement such as reduction in the hours of non-overtime work or wages or employment benefits), or impair existing contracts for services, or result in the substitution of YACC funds for other funds in connection with work that would otherwise be performed, or substitute jobs assisted under YACC for existing Federally-assisted jobs, or result in the hiring of any youth when any other person is on layoff from the same or any substantially equivalent job.</P>
          <P>(2) Grantees shall assure that the activities in which the YACC enrollees are employed will result in an increase in employment opportunities over those opportunities which would otherwise be available.</P>
          <P>(3) In addition, Grantees shall see that YACC enrollees do not, at the same time, share common facilities or property with, or work with members of the Job Corps, under title IV of the Act, except in emergency situations as outlined in paragraph (l)(4)(i) of this section.</P>
          <P>(c) Enrollee eligibility: Membership in the Corps will be limited to youths between the ages of 16 to 23, inclusive who are unemployed at the time of application. Citizens, lawfully permanent residents of the United States, or lawfully admitted refugees, or parolees, may apply for enrollment. Applicants also must be capable of carrying out the work of the Corps for the estimated duration of their enrollment.</P>
          <P>(d) Candidate recruitment and referral: (1) Interested youth may apply to their local Employment Service/Job Service for enrollment. State Employment Security Agencies (SESA) and their local Employment Service/Job Service (ES/JS) offices shall take applications for YACC from all interested youth and shall refer all candidates who self-certify that they meet eligibility requirements to Grantees for selection of those to be enrolled. Self-certification by applicants ages 16 through 18 who have left school shall include an assurance that they did not leave school for the purpose of enrolling in the Corps. Such referrals shall include all interested youth, including veterans, from both sexes, and all social, economic and racial classifications. Labor shall recruit candidates for YACC through the SESA and their local ES/JS offices, prime sponsors qualified under section 102 of the act, sponsors of Native-American programs qualified under section 302 of the act, sponsors of migrant and seasonal farmworkers programs under section 303 of the act, Interior and Agriculture and such other agencies and organizations as deemed appropriate by Labor. All candidates must be referred through the local ES/JS offices.</P>
          <P>(2) An equitable proportion of candidates shall be referred from each State, based on the State's total youth population. For YACC program purposes, total youth population is the number of youth, 16 through 23, as determined on the basis of the best available data. Youth of both sexes and of all social, economic, and racial classifications shall be referred equitably.</P>
          <P>(e) Enrollee selection: Grantees shall—(1) Notify ES offices when openings are available;</P>
          <P>(2) Select enrollees for the Corps only from those candidates referred by Labor and, in selection and assignment, shall provide, to the extent feasible, for equitable participation for youth of both sexes and of all social, economic, and racial classifications, and for equitable participation of youth from each State;</P>

          <P>(3) Notify selected applicants of the date, time and place to which they should report for work, and that enrollees must provide their own transportation to and from the project or camp;<PRTPAGE P="441"/>
          </P>
          <P>(4) Require that enrollees complete physical examinations prior to official enrollment (expenses, if any, for the physical examination will be borne by the prospective enrollee);</P>
          <P>(5) Require parental consent for those youth who have not reached the age of majority as defined by State law;</P>
          <P>(6) Require enrollees to provide their own clothing, with the exception of certain safety equipment which will be furnished;</P>
          <P>(7) Notify the referring ES/JS office as soon as possible but no later than 30 days after receipt of application, which applicants have been selected and have reported for employment and which have not been so selected.</P>
          <FP>Preference in enrollee selection shall be given to applicants in rural and urban areas having substantial unemployment rates equal to or in excess of 6.5 per centum as determined by the Department of Labor. Grantees shall comply with section 808 of the act, concerning antidiscrimination.</FP>
          <P>(f) Enrollment duration: (1) Grantees shall assure that no individual is enrolled in the Corps for a total period of more than 12 months. Such period may be completed in up to three separate enrollment periods so long as the youth meets the eligibility requirements at the time of each separate enrollment. An individual who attains age 24 while enrolled may remain in the program to complete the current period of enrollment.</P>
          <P>(2) No youth shall be enrolled if he or she desires such enrollment only for the normal periods between school terms.</P>
          <P>(g) Corpsmember activities. Grantees shall assure that work project activities on which YACC enrollees are employed are consistent with the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resource Planning Act of 1974, as amended by the National Forest Management Act of 1976. Enrollees will be assigned to work projects which are designed to diminish the backlog of work in such fields as:</P>
          <P>(1) Tree nursery operations, planting, pruning, thinning and other silvicultural measures;</P>
          <P>(2) Wildlife habitat improvement and preservation;</P>
          <P>(3) Range management improvements;</P>
          <P>(4) Recreation development, rehabilitation and maintenance;</P>
          <P>(5) Fish habitat and culture measures;</P>
          <P>(6) Forest insect and disease prevention and control;</P>
          <P>(7) Road and trail maintenance and improvements;</P>
          <P>(8) General sanitation, cleanup, and maintenance and improvements;</P>
          <P>(9) Erosion control and flood damage;</P>
          <P>(10) Drought damage measures; and</P>
          <P>(11) Other natural disaster damage measures.</P>
          <P>(h) Project criteria. YACC projects will be operated on a residential and nonresidential basis. Each project location will be jointly approved by Interior and Forest Service through their Regional/Area Offices. To the maximum extent practicable, projects shall:</P>
          <P>(1) Be labor-intensive;</P>
          <P>(2) Be projects for which work plans exist or can be readily developed;</P>
          <P>(3) Be able to be initiated promptly;</P>
          <P>(4) Be productive with positive impacts on both the Enrollee as well as the Corps from the standpoint of work performed and benefit to participating youth;</P>
          <P>(5) Provide work experience to participants in skill areas required for the projects;</P>
          <P>(6) If a residential camp, to the maximum extent feasible, be located in areas where existing residential facilities are available. The use of existing but unoccupied or underutilized Federal, State, and local government facilities and equipment shall be maximized; such utilization is subject to the approval of the Federal agency, State or local government having administrative control thereof;</P>
          <P>(7) If a non-residential project, be located within acceptable normal commuting distance from the geographic center of areas of substantial unemployment as designated by Labor;</P>
          <P>(8) Be similar to activities of persons employed in seasonal and part-time work by Federal natural resource agencies.</P>

          <P>(i) Cooperation with agencies and institutions: (1) Grantees shall, to the extent feasible, arrange for local linkages <PRTPAGE P="442"/>with educational systems, CETA and other employment and training programs, employment service offices, local apprenticeship sponsors and information centers, and employers, in order to arrange for the provision of available services to enrollees, both during non-work hours while enrolled, and after termination from YACC. Grantees shall establish procedures to ensure that enrollees are made aware of established linkages and related information and opportunities.</P>
          <P>(2) Grantees shall notify appropriate local ES/JS offices regarding enrollee status, in advance of the end of the enrollment period or upon termination and shall, to the extent feasible, assist the enrollee in making contact with ES/JS or other organizations to enhance the possibilities for placement.</P>
          <P>(3) Labor shall work with the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to make suitable arrangements whereby academic credit may be awarded by educational institutions and agencies for competencies derived from work experience obtained through the YACC program. Labor shall also encourage Grantees, through Interior and Forest Service, to make necessary arrangements with local education agencies so that academic credit for such work experience may be granted.</P>
          <P>(j) Enrollee wages and hours of work: (1) Grantees shall assure that enrollees in the State Grant Program are paid at the Federal minimum wage rate specified in section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. As an exception, Grantees shall provide for an additional cost-of-living adjustment for enrollees in the State of Alaska, not to exceed 25 percent of the Federal Wage Rate.</P>
          <P>(2) Wages in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Marianas shall be consistent with provisions of Federal, State, or local laws, otherwise applicable. Wages in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands shall be consistent with local law, except on Eniwetok and Kwajalein Atoll where section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act applies.</P>
          <P>(3) As an incentive, Grantees may authorize incremental increases, above the minimum wage, for a limited number of enrollees, to reflect additional responsibilities or competencies. For this purpose, two promotional categories may be established: (i) Enrollee Leader, and (ii) Enrollee Assistant Leader. No more than 15 percent of the enrollment of any individual camp or project shall be given such increases. For each enrollee thus compensated, the wage increase shall be 50 percent for the enrollee leader and 15 percent for the enrollee assistant leader, of the applicable basic hourly minimum wage.</P>
          <P>(4) Grantees shall reduce enrollee wages for each hour of unexcused absence.</P>

          <P>(B) The affirmative action plan of each contractor and subcontractor shall contain goals and timetables based upon the overall goals and timetables set by the applicant or recipient for the segment of the ANGTS upon which the contractor or subcontractor will work.</P>
          <P>(iii) It shall not be a violation of this part for a recipient, contractor or subcontractor to extend a preference in employment consistent with 41 CFR 60-2.12(j). For the purpose of this section the term “reservation” in Alaska shall be the same as in 25 CFR 80.1, 91.1, and 93.1. <SU>1</SU>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Records, reports, and access to books.</E> Each recipient, contractor, or subcontractor to which these regulations apply shall submit to the Federal Inspector reports in the form and manner that the Federal Inspector determines to be necessary to insure compliance with the rules, regulations, and orders implementing section 17 and Condition 11 of the President's <E T="03">Decision.</E>
          </P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Access to sources of information.</E> Each person to whom this part applies shall permit access by the Federal Inspector during normal business hours to books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, and to facilities, as the Federal Inspector determines to be necessary to insure compliance with the rules, regulations, and orders implementing section 17 and the President's <E T="03">Decision.</E>

          <P>(c) <E T="03">Failure to submit reports.</E> Failure to file timely, complete, and accurate reports, or failure to permit access to sources of information as required constitutes non-compliance with the Equal Opportunity Clause and with these regulations and, therefore, constitutes grounds for action by the Federal Inspector, recipient, contractor, or subcontractor to enforce compliance or levy sanctions as authorized by ANGTA, by the implementing rules, regulations, and orders thereunder, by contractual agreement, or by any other means authorized by law.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Information for beneficiaries and participants.</E> Each recipient or other entity required to develop an affirmative action plan pursuant to these regulations shall make the plan available for inspection by employees, participants, beneficiaries, local, State, and Federal government officials, and members of the public upon request.

          <SUBJECT>Compliance reviews.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Periodic compliance procedures.</E> (1) The Federal Inspector will review the practices of recipients, contractors, or subcontractors, which offer significant opportunities for employment or procurement, to determine whether such recipient, contractor, or subcontractor are complying with its affirmative action plans and the rules, regulations, and orders implementing section 17 and Condition 11 of the President's <E T="03">Decision.</E> The review will consist of a comprehensive analysis of all aspects of the recipient's, contractor's, or subcontractor's operations and practices and the conditions resulting therefrom. The review will include an on-site visit if the Federal Inspector determines that such a review is necessary.</P>
          <P>(2) The Federal Inspector will continually monitor and verify the status of MBE's and FBE's through procedures as the Inspector may determine appropriate.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Complaints.</E> (1) Complaints alleging discrimination or non-compliance with affirmative action plans shall be filed with the Federal Inspector.</P>
          <P>(2) A complaint must be filed within 180 days from the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the Federal Inspector for good cause shown.</P>
          <P>(3) The complaint should include the name, address, and telephone number of the complainant; the name and address of the person alleged to have discriminated; a description of the alleged discriminatory acts; and any other pertinent information which will assist the investigation and resolution of the complaint. The complaint should be signed by the complainant or his or her authorized representative.</P>
          <P>(4) The filing of a complaint with the Federal Inspector shall not constitute the filing of a complaint pursuant to title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with the Equal Opportunity Commission unless, by agreement between the two agencies, the Federal Inspector and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission so provide.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Investigations.</E> The Federal Inspector will make a prompt investigation <PRTPAGE P="458"/>whenever information indicates that a person may have failed to comply with section 17 or Condition 11 of the President's <E T="03">Decision</E> or the implementing rules, regulations, or orders thereunder. The investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the person under investigation, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance occurred, and other factors relevant to determine whether the person has failed to comply with section 17, Condition 11 of the President's <E T="03">Decision,</E> or the implementing rules, regulations, and orders thereunder.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Resolution of complaints and investigations.</E> (1) In exercising the broad authority to enforce these regulations, the Federal Inspector shall, within 90 days of the effective date of these regulations, establish the procedures to be followed in enforcing these regulations. These regulations shall thereafter be amended to incorporate these procedures. The procedures shall, to the extent consistent with ANGTA, be similar to those proposed to be adopted by the Department of Energy to resolve complaints of violations of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. See regulations proposed to be codified at 10 CFR 1040.104, (Nov. 16, 1978). At a minimum the procedures must incorporate the following paragraphs (d) (2) through (5) of this section.</P>
          <P>(2) The Federal Inspector will initiate action upon all complaints within 35 days of the date the complaint is filed with the Federal Inspector.</P>

          <P>(3) If an investigation pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section indicates probable non-compliance with section 17, Condition 11 of the President's <E T="03">Decision,</E> or the implementing rules, regulations, or orders thereunder, the Federal Inspector will attempt to resolve the matter by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion.</P>
          <P>(4) Resolution shall be effected through a written agreement between the Federal Inspector, the complainant, if any, and the person who has failed to comply. The agreement shall contain commitments to promptly eliminate all discriminatory conditions, shall identify the precise remedial actions to be taken and dates for completion of remedial actions, and shall include a provision that breath of the agreement may result in further enforcement actions by the Federal Inspector. The Federal Inspector will then certify compliance, on condition that the commitments are kept. Such certification will not preclude a subsequent determination by the Federal Inspector that the full facts were not known at the time agreement was executed, or the commitments undertaken are not sufficient to correct deficiencies.</P>
          <P>(5) If the Federal Inspector's investigation does not warrant enforcement action, the Federal Inspector shall so inform the complainant, if any, and the person who was investigated. The complainant shall also be notified of any action taken including the achievement of voluntary compliance.</P>
          <P>(6) Between the period of these effective dates of these regulations and the effective date of the enforcement procedures established by the Federal Inspector, pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Federal Inspector shall at a minimum adhere to paragraphs (d)(2) through (5) of this section.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Acts of intimidation or retaliation prohibited.</E> No person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, harass, or retaliate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by section 17, Condition 11 the President's <E T="03">Decision,</E> and implementing rules, regulations, orders, because such individual has opposed a practice prohibited by section 17 or by this part, made a complaint, testified, assisted in, benefited from, or participated in any manner in an investigation, compliance review, proceeding or hearing, conducted pursuant to these regulations. The identity of complainants may be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to carry out the purpose of this part, including investigatory actions, hearings, or judicial proceedings.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Determining the amount of penalties and assessments.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessments, the ALJ and the Director, upon appeal, should evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs of fraud, the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, ordinarily double damages and a significant civil penalty should be imposed.</P>
          <P>(b) Although not exhaustive, the following factors are among those that may influence the ALJ and the Director in determining the amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the misconduct (i.e., the false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements) charged in the complaint:</P>
          <P>(1) The number of false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements;</P>
          <P>(2) The time period over which such claims or statements were made;</P>

          <P>(4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or benefit falsely claimed;</P>
          <P>(5) The value of the Government's actual loss as a result of the misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the costs of investigation.</P>
          <P>(6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the amount of the Government's loss;</P>
          <P>(7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon national defense, public health or safety, or public confidence in the management of Government programs and operations, including particularly the impact on the intended beneficiaries of such programs;</P>
          <P>(8) Whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of the same or similar misconduct;</P>
          <P>(9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct;</P>
          <P>(10) The degree to which the defendant has involved others in the misconduct or in concealing it;</P>
          <P>(11) Where the misconduct of employees or agents is imputed to the defendant, the extent to which the defendant's practices fostered or attempted to preclude such misconduct;</P>
          <P>(12) Whether the defendant cooperated in or obstructed an investigation of the misconduct;</P>
          <P>(13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying and prosecuting other wrongdoers;</P>
          <P>(14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of the defendant's sophistication with respect to it, including the extent of the defendant's prior participation in the program or in similar transactions;</P>
          <P>(15) Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding to have engaged in similar misconduct or to have dealt dishonestly with the government of the United States or of a State, directly or indirectly; and</P>
          <P>(16) The need to deter the defendant and others from engaging in the same or similar misconduct.</P>
          <P>(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ALJ or the Director from considering any other factors that in any given case may mitigate or aggravate the offense for which penalties and assessments are imposed.</P>

          <P>(2) Upon identification of the lead agency, other involved agencies will provide assistance as requested by the lead agency.</P>
          <P>(b) Upon receipt of an application, the lead agency will review it and determine the filing date pursuant to § 36.4.

          <SUBJECT>Decision process.</SUBJECT>
          <P>There are two separate decision processes. The first is used when the appropriate Federal agencies have an applicable law to issue a right-of-way permit and the area involved is outside the National Wilderness Preservation System. The second is used when an area involved in the application is within the National Wilderness Preservation System or an appropriate Federal agency has no applicable law with respect to issuing a right-of-way permit across all or any area covered by a TUS application.</P>
          <P>(a) When the appropriate Federal agencies have an applicable law and the area involved is outside the National Wilderness Preservation System:</P>
          <P>(1) Within four months of the date of the notice of availability of a FONSI or final EIS, each appropriate Federal agency shall make a decision based on applicable law to approve or disapprove the TUS and so notify the applicant in writing.</P>
          <P>(2) Each appropriate Federal agency in making its decision shall consider and make detailed findings supported by substantial evidence as to the portion of the TUS, within that agency's jurisdiction, with respect to:</P>
          <P>(i) The need for and economic feasibility of the TUS;</P>
          <P>(ii) Alternative routes and modes of access, including a determination with respect to whether there is any economically feasible and prudent alternative to routing the system through or within an area and, if not, whether there are alternate routes or modes which would result in fewer or less severe adverse impacts upon the area;</P>

          <P>(iii) The feasibility and impacts of including different TUSs in the same area;<PRTPAGE P="479"/>
          </P>
          <P>(iv) Short and long term social, economic and environmental impacts of national, State or local significance, including impacts on fish and wildlife and their habitat and on rural, traditional lifestyles;</P>
          <P>(v) The impacts, if any, on the national security interests of the United States, that may result from approval or denial of the application for the TUS;</P>
          <P>(vi) Any impacts that would affect the purposes for which the Federal unit or area concerned was established;</P>
          <P>(vii) Measures which should be instituted to avoid or minimize negative impacts;</P>
          <P>(viii) The short and long term public values which may be adversely affected by approval of the TUS versus the short and long term public benefits which may accrue from such approval; and</P>
          <P>(ix) Impacts, if any, on subsistence uses.</P>
          <P>(3) To the extent the appropriate Federal agencies agree, the decisions may be developed jointly, singularly or in some combination thereof.</P>
          <P>(4) If an appropriate Federal agency disapproves any portion of the TUS, the application in its entirety is disapproved and the applicant may file an administrative appeal pursuant to section 1106(a) of ANILCA.</P>
          <P>(b) When an area involved is within the National Wilderness Preservation System or an appropriate Federal agency has no applicable law with respect to granting all or any part of a TUS application:</P>
          <P>(1) Within four months of the date of publication of the notice of the availability of the final EIS or FONSI, each appropriate Federal agency shall determine whether to tentatively approve or disapprove each right-of-way permit within its jurisdiction that applies with respect to the TUS and the Secretary of the Interior shall make notification pursuant to section 1106(b) of ANILCA.</P>
          <P>(i) The Federal agency having jurisdiction over a portion of a TUS for which there is no applicable law shall recommend approval of that portion of the TUS if it is determined that:</P>
          <P>(A) Such system would be compatible with the purposes for which the area was established; and</P>
          <P>(B) There is no economically feasible and prudent alternate route for the system.</P>
          <P>(ii) If there is applicable law for a portion of the TUS which is outside the National Wilderness Preservation System, the applicable law shall be applied in making the determination to approve or disapprove that portion of the TUS.</P>

          <P>(a) This section sets forth the procedures to provide adequate and feasible access to inholdings within areas in accordance with section 1110(b) of ANILCA. As used in this section, the term:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Adequate and feasible access</E> means a route and method of access that is shown to be reasonably necessary and economically practicable but not necessarily the least costly alternative for achieving the use and development by the applicant on the applicant's nonfederal land or occupancy interest.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Area</E> also includes public lands administered by the BLM designated as wilderness study areas.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Effectively surrounded by</E> means that physical barriers prevent adequate and feasible access to State or private lands or valid interests in lands except across an area(s). Physical barriers include but are not limited to rugged mountain terrain, extensive marsh areas, shallow water depths and the presence of ice for large periods of the year.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Inholding</E> means State-owned or privately owned land, including subsurface rights of such owners underlying public lands or a valid mining claim or other valid occupancy that is within or is effectively surrounded by one or more areas.</P>
          <P>(b) It is the purpose of this section to ensure adequate and feasible access across areas for any person who has a valid inholding. A right-of-way permit for access to an inholding pursuant to this section is required only when this part does not provide for adequate and feasible access without a right-of-way permit.</P>
          <P>(c) Applications for a right-of-way permit for access to an inholding shall be filed with the appropriate Federal agency on a SF 299. Mining claimants who have acquired their rights under the General Mining Law of 1872 may file their request for access as a part of their plan of operations. The appropriate Federal agency may require the mining claimant applicant to file a SF 299, if in its discretion, it determines that more complete information is needed. Applicants should ensure that the following information is provided:</P>

          <P>(1) Documentation of the property interest held by the applicant including, for claimants under the General Mining Law of 1872, as amended (30 U.S.C. 21-54), a copy of the location notice and recordations required by 43 U.S.C. 1744;<PRTPAGE P="481"/>
          </P>
          <P>(2) A detailed description of the use of the inholding for which the applied for right-of-way permit is to serve; and</P>
          <P>(3) If applicable, rationale demonstrating that the inholding is effectively surrounded by an area(s).</P>
          <P>(d) The application shall be filed in the same manner as under § 36.4 and shall be reviewed and processed in accordance with §§ 36.5 and 36.6.</P>
          <P>(e)(1) For any applicant who meets the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section, the appropriate Federal agency shall specify in a right-of-way permit the route(s) and method(s) of access across the area(s) desired by the applicant, unless it is determined that:</P>
          <P>(i) The route or method of access would cause significant adverse impacts on natural or other values of the area and adequate and feasible access otherwise exists; or</P>
          <P>(ii) The route or method of access would jeopardize public health and safety and adequate and feasible access otherwise exists; or</P>
          <P>(iii) The route or method is inconsistent with the management plan(s) for the area or purposes for which the area was established and adequate and feasible access otherwise exists; or</P>
          <P>(iv) The method is unnecessary to accomplish the applicant's land use objective.</P>
          <P>(2) If the appropriate Federal agency makes one of the findings described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, another alternate route(s) and/or method(s) of access that will provide the applicant adequate and feasible access shall be specified by that Federal agency in the right-of-way permit after consultation with the applicant.</P>
          <P>(f) All right-of-way permits issued pursuant to this section shall be subject to terms and conditions in the same manner as right-of-way permits issued pursuant to § 36.9.</P>
          <P>(g) The decision by the appropriate Federal agency under this section is the final administrative decision.</P>

In establishing a removal procedure, the appropriate Federal agency is authorized to establish a reasonable date by which aircraft removal operations must be complete and determine times and means of access to and from the downed aircraft.</P>
          <P>(i) The appropriate Federal agency may waive the requirements of this paragraph upon a determination that the removal of downed aircraft would constitute an unacceptable risk to human life, or the removal of a downed aircraft would result in extensive resource damage, or the removal of a downed aircraft is otherwise impracticable or impossible.</P>
          <P>(ii) Salvaging, removing, possessing or attempting to salvage, remove or possess any downed aircraft or component parts thereof is prohibited, except in accordance with a removal procedure established under this paragraph and as may be controlled by the other laws and regulations.</P>
          <P>(4) The use of a helicopter in any area other than at designated landing areas pursuant to the terms and conditions of a permit issued by the appropriate Federal agency, or pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between the appropriate Federal agency and another party, or involved in emergency or search and rescue operations is prohibited.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Off-road vehicles.</E> (1) The use of off-road vehicles (ORV) in locations other than established roads and parking areas is prohibited, except on routes or in areas designated by the appropriate Federal agency in accordance with Executive Order 11644, as amended or pursuant to a valid permit as prescribed in paragraph (g)(2) of this section or in § 36.10 or § 36.12.</P>
          <P>(2) The appropriate Federal agency is authorized to issue permits for the use of ORVs on existing ORV trails located in areas (other than in areas designated as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System) upon a finding that such ORV use would be compatible with the purposes and values for which the area was established.

            <SUBJECT>Collection of information.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The collections of information contained in this part have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 <E T="03">et seq.</E> and assigned clearance numbers 1004-0165 (cave nominations) and 1004-0166 (confidential information). The information provided for the cave nominations will be used to determine which caves will be listed as “significant” and the information in the requests to obtain confidential cave information will be used to decide whether to grant access to this information. Response to the call for cave nominations is voluntary. No action may be taken against a person for refusing to supply the information requested. Response to the information requirements for obtaining confidential cave information is required to obtain a benefit in accordance with Section 5 of the Federal Cave Resources Protection Act of 1988 (102 Stat. 4546; 16 U.S.C. 4301).</P>
            <P>(b) The public reporting burden is estimated to average 3 hours per response for the cave nomination and one-half hour per response for the confidential cave information request. The estimated response time for both of the information burdens includes time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to Bureau of Land Management Clearance Officer, WO-873, Mail Stop 401 LS, 1849 C Street NW., Washington, DC 20240; and the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project 1004-0165/6, Washington, D.C. 20503.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Nomination, evaluation, and designation of significant caves.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Nominations for initial and subsequent listings.</E> The authorized officer will give governmental agencies and the public, including those who utilize caves for scientific, educational, and recreational purposes, the opportunity to nominate potential significant caves. The authorized officer will give public notice, including a notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> calling for nominations for the initial listing, including procedures for preparing and submitting the nominations. Nominations for subsequent listings <PRTPAGE P="486"/>will be accepted from governmental agencies and the public by the agency that manages the land where the cave is located as new cave discoveries are made or as new information becomes available. Nominations not approved for designation during the listing process may be resubmitted if better documentation or new information becomes available.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Evaluation for initial and subsequent listings.</E> The evaluation of the nominations for significant caves will be carried out in consultation with individuals and organizations interested in the management and use of cave resources, within the limits imposed by the confidentiality provisions of § 37.12 of this part. Nominations will be evaluated using the criteria in § 37.11(c).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Criteria for significant caves.</E> A significant cave on Federal lands shall possess one or more of the following features, characteristics, or values.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Biota.</E> The cave provides seasonal or yearlong habitat for organisms or animals, or contains species or subspecies of flora or fauna that are native to caves, or are sensitive to disturbance, or are found on State or Federal sensitive, threatened, or endangered species lists.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Cultural.</E> The cave contains historic properties or archaeological resources (as described in 36 CFR 60.4 and 43 CFR 7.3) or other features that are included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places because of their research importance for history or prehistory, historical associations, or other historical or traditional significance.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Geologic/Mineralogic/Paleontologic.</E> The cave possesses one or more of the following features:</P>
            <P>(i) Geologic or mineralogic features that are fragile, or that exhibit interesting formation processes, or that are otherwise useful for study.</P>
            <P>(ii) Deposits of sediments or features useful for evaluating past events.</P>
            <P>(iii) Paleontologic resources with potential to contribute useful educational and scientific information.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Hydrologic.</E> The cave is a part of a hydrologic system or contains water that is important to humans, biota, or development of cave resources.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Recreational.</E> The cave provides or could provide recreational opportunities or scenic values.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Educational or Scientific.</E> The cave offers opportunities for educational or scientific use; or, the cave is virtually in a pristine state, lacking evidence f contemporary human disturbance or impact; or, the length, volume, total depth, pit depth, height, or similar measurements are notable.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">National Park Service policy.</E> The policy of the National Park Service, pursuant to its Organic Act of 1916 (16 U.S.C. 1, <E T="03">et seq.</E>) and Management Policies (Chapter 4:20, Dec. 1988), is that all caves are afforded protection and will be managed in compliance with approved resource management plans. Accordingly, all caves on National Park Service-administered lands are deemed to fall within the definition of “significant cave.”</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Special management areas.</E> Within special management areas that are designated wholly or in part due to cave resources found therein, all caves within the so-designated special management area shall be determined to be significant.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Designation and documentation.</E> If the authorized officer determines that a cave nominated and evaluated under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section meets one or more of the criteria in paragraph (c), the authorized officer will designate the cave as significant. The authorized officer will designate all caves identified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section to be significant. The authorized officer will notify the nominating party of the results of the evaluation and designation. Each agency Field Office will retain appropriate documentation for all significant caves located within its administrative boundaries. At a minimum, documentation shall include a statement of finding signed and dated by the authorized officer, and the information used to make the determination. This documentation will be retained as a permanent record in accordance with the confidentiality provision in § 37.12 of this part.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Decision final.</E> Decisions to designate or not designate a cave as significant are made at the sole discretion of the authorized officer and are not <PRTPAGE P="487"/>subject to further administrative review or appeal under 43 CFR part 4.</P>
            <P>(h) If a cave is determined to be significant, its entire extent, including passages not mapped or discovered at the time of the determination, is deemed significant. This includes caves that extend from lands managed by any Federal agency into lands managed by one or more other bureaus or agencies of the Department of the Interior, as well as caves initially believed to be separate for which interconnecting passages are discovered after significance is determined.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Confidentiality of cave location information.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Information disclosure.</E> No Department of the Interior employee shall disclose information that could be used to determine the location of any significant cave or cave under consideration for determination, unless the authorized officer determines that disclosure will further the purposes of the Act and will not create a substantial risk to cave resources of harm, theft, or destruction.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Requesting confidential information.</E> Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the authorized officer may make confidential cave information available to a Federal or State governmental agency, bona fide educational or research institute, or individual or organization assisting the land managing agency with cave management activities. To request confidential cave information, such entities shall make a written request to the authorized officer that includes the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Name, address, and telephone number of the individual responsible for the security of the information received.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Separate teams.</E> Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill <PRTPAGE P="502"/>or the activity involved is a contact sport. However, where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport.

            <P>(1) Develop appropriate audit guidelines that State auditors, independent Certified Public Accountants, or independent public accountants must use to audit the statements of the Governors or their designated officials and to certify the audits; and</P>
            <P>(2) Furnish copies of the guides to the Governor or designated official each year. You should send questions on the use or application of this guide to the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of the Interior, Washington, DC 20240.</P>
            <P>(d) The Department may waive the requirement to certify audits if the General Accounting Office or the Office of the Inspector General verifies the information in statements the Governor or designated official furnishes or if the Department determines it is not necessary.

The payment to qualified units of general local government will be the lesser of the two.</P>
            <P>(b) The Department disburses payments annually for a period of 5 years beginning in the year immediately following the year of Federal acquisition of the land or interest.</P>
            <P>(1) The difference, if any, between the amounts actually paid during each of the 5 years and 1 percent of the fair market value will be deferred to future years. However, a payment or any portion of a payment not paid because Congress appropriated insufficient monies will not be deferred.</P>
            <P>(2) The Department will begin annual payment of the deferred amount (calculated the same as in paragraph (a) of this section) starting with the sixth fiscal year following Federal acquisition.</P>

            <P>(b) When the Department receives a notification under paragraph (a) of this section, it must:</P>
            <P>(1) Determine if the State's process complies with 31 U.S.C. 6907. If the Department determines that it does not, we must notify the designated State government office that the Department will disburse payment directly to the eligible local governments; and</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Reserved authority.</E> Where DOI has notified or notifies FERC that it is reserving its authority to develop one or more conditions or prescriptions at a later time, the hearing and alternatives processes under this part for such conditions or prescriptions will be available if and when DOI exercises its reserved authority.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (1) This part applies to any hydropower license proceeding for which the license had not been issued as of November 17, 2005, and for which one or more preliminary conditions or prescriptions have been or are filed with FERC before FERC issues the license.</P>
            <P>(2) This part also applies to any exercise of DOI's reserved authority under paragraph (c) of this section with respect to a hydropower license issued before or after November 17, 2005.</P>

            <P>Yes. This rule contains provisions that would collect information from the public. It therefore requires approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <E T="03">et seq.</E> (PRA). According to the PRA, a Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number that indicates OMB approval. OMB has reviewed the information collection in this rule and approved it under OMB control number 1094-0001.</P>

            <P>(b) The Responsible Official will ensure that the decision making process for proposals subject to this part includes appropriate NEPA review.</P>
            <P>(c) During the decision making process for each proposal subject to this part, the Responsible Official shall consider the relevant NEPA documents, public and agency comments (if any) on those documents, and responses to those comments, as part of consideration of the proposal and, except as specified in paragraphs 46.210(a) through (j), shall include such documents, including supplements, comments, and responses as part of the administrative file.</P>
            <P>(d) The Responsible Official's decision on a proposed action shall be within the range of alternatives discussed in the relevant environmental document. The Responsible Official's decision may combine elements of alternatives discussed in the relevant environmental document if the effects of such combined elements of alternatives are reasonably apparent from the analysis in the relevant environmental document.</P>
            <P>(e) For situations involving an applicant, the Responsible Official should initiate the NEPA process upon acceptance of an application for a proposed Federal action. The Responsible Official must publish or otherwise provide policy information and make staff available to advise potential applicants of studies or other information, such as costs, foreseeably required for later Federal action.</P>

            <P>For purposes of this part, the following definitions supplement terms defined at 40 CFR parts 1500-1508.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Adaptive management</E> is a system of management practices based on clearly identified outcomes and monitoring to determine whether management actions are meeting desired outcomes; and, if not, facilitating management changes that will best ensure that outcomes are met or re-evaluated. Adaptive management recognizes that knowledge about natural resource systems is sometimes uncertain.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Bureau</E> means bureau, office, service, or survey within the Department of the Interior.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Community-based training</E> in the NEPA context is the training of local participants together with Federal participants in the workings of the environmental planning effort as it relates to the local community(ies).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Controversial</E> refers to circumstances where a substantial dispute exists as to the environmental consequences of the proposed action and does not refer to the existence of opposition to a proposed action, the effect of which is relatively undisputed.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Environmental Statement Memoranda (ESM)</E> are a series of instructions issued by the Department's Office of Environmental Policy and Compliance to provide information and explanatory guidance in the preparation, completion, and circulation of NEPA documents.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Environmentally preferable alternative</E> is the alternative required by 40 CFR 1505.2(b) to be identified in a record of decision (ROD), that causes the least damage to the biological and physical environment and best protects, preserves, and enhances historical, cultural, and natural resources. The environmentally preferable alternative is identified upon consideration and weighing by the Responsible Official of long-term environmental impacts against short-term impacts in evaluating what is the best protection of these resources. In some situations, such as when different alternatives impact different resources to different degrees, there may be more than one environmentally preferable alternative.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">No action alternative.</E>
            </P>

            <P>(1) This term has two interpretations. First “no action” may mean “no change” from a current management direction or level of management intensity (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, if no ground-disturbance is currently underway, no action means no ground-disturbance). Second “no action” may mean “no project” in cases where a new project is proposed for implementation.</P>

            <P>(2) The Responsible Official must determine the “no action” alternative consistent with one of the definitions in paragraph (1) of this definition and appropriate to the proposed action to <PRTPAGE P="536"/>be analyzed in an environmental impact statement. The no action alternative looks at effects of not approving the action under consideration.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Proposed action.</E> This term refers to the bureau activity under consideration. It includes the bureau's exercise of discretion over a non-Federal entity's planned activity that falls under a Federal agency's authority to issue permits, licenses, grants, rights-of-way, or other common Federal approvals, funding, or regulatory instruments. The proposed action:</P>
            <P>(1) Is not necessarily, but may become, during the NEPA process, the bureau preferred alternative or (in a record of decision for an environmental impact statement, in accordance with 40 CFR 1505.2) an environmentally preferable alternative; and</P>
            <P>(2) Must be clearly described in order to proceed with NEPA analysis.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Reasonably foreseeable future actions</E> include those federal and non-federal activities not yet undertaken, but sufficiently likely to occur, that a Responsible Official of ordinary prudence would take such activities into account in reaching a decision. These federal and non-federal activities that must be taken into account in the analysis of cumulative impact include, but are not limited to, activities for which there are existing decisions, funding, or proposals identified by the bureau. Reasonably foreseeable future actions do not include those actions that are highly speculative or indefinite.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Responsible Official</E> is the bureau employee who is delegated the authority to make and implement a decision on a proposed action and is responsible for ensuring compliance with NEPA.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Federal action subject to the procedural requirements of NEPA.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A bureau proposed action is subject to the procedural requirements of NEPA if it would cause effects on the human environment (40 CFR 1508.14), and is subject to bureau control and responsibility (40 CFR 1508.18). The determination of whether a proposed action is subject to the procedural requirements of NEPA depends on the extent to which bureaus exercise control and responsibility over the proposed action and whether Federal funding or approval are necessary to implement it. If Federal funding is provided with no Federal agency control as to the expenditure of such funds by the recipient, NEPA compliance is not necessary. The proposed action is not subject to the procedural requirements of NEPA if it is exempt from the requirements of section 102(2) of NEPA.</P>
            <P>(b) A bureau shall apply the procedural requirements of NEPA when the proposal is developed to the point that:</P>
            <P>(1) The bureau has a goal and is actively preparing to make a decision on one or more alternative means of accomplishing that goal; and</P>
            <P>(2) The effects of the proposed action can be meaningfully evaluated (40 CFR 1508.23).</P>

            <P>A Responsible Official may use a contractor to prepare any environmental document in accordance with the standards of 40 CFR 1506.5(b) and (c). If a Responsible Official uses a contractor, the Responsible Official remains responsible for:</P>
            <P>(a) Preparation and adequacy of the environmental documents; and</P>

            <SUBJECT>Incorporating consensus-based management.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Consensus-based management incorporates direct community involvement in consideration of bureau activities subject to NEPA analyses, from initial scoping to implementation of the bureau decision. It seeks to achieve agreement from diverse interests on the goals of, purposes of, and needs for bureau plans and activities, as well as the methods anticipated to carry out those plans and activities. For the purposes of this Part, consensus-based management involves outreach to persons, organizations or communities who may be interested in or affected by a proposed action with an assurance <PRTPAGE P="537"/>that their input will be given consideration by the Responsible Official in selecting a course of action.</P>
            <P>(b) In incorporating consensus-based management in the NEPA process, bureaus should consider any consensus-based alternative(s) put forth by those participating persons, organizations or communities who may be interested in or affected by the proposed action. While there is no guarantee that any particular consensus-based alternative will be considered to be a reasonable alternative or be identified as the bureau's preferred alternative, bureaus must be able to show that the reasonable consensus-based alternative, if any, is reflected in the evaluation of the proposed action and discussed in the final decision. To be selected for implementation, a consensus-based alternative must be fully consistent with NEPA, the CEQ regulations, and all applicable statutory and regulatory provisions, as well as Departmental and bureau written policies and guidance.</P>
            <P>(c) The Responsible Official must, whenever practicable, use a consensus-based management approach to the NEPA process.</P>
            <P>(d) If the Responsible Official determines that the consensus-based alternative, if any, is not the preferred alternative, he or she must state the reasons for this determination in the environmental document.</P>
            <P>(e) When practicing consensus-based management in the NEPA process, bureaus must comply with all applicable laws, including any applicable provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Consideration of past actions in the analysis of cumulative effects.</SUBJECT>
            <P>When considering the effects of past actions as part of a cumulative effects analysis, the Responsible Official must analyze the effects in accordance with 40 CFR 1508.7 and in accordance with relevant guidance issued by the Council on Environmental Quality, such as “The Council on Environmental Quality Guidance Memorandum on Consideration of Past Actions in Cumulative Effects Analysis” dated June 24, 2005, or any superseding Council on Environmental Quality guidance.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Using existing environmental analyses prepared pursuant to NEPA and the Council on Environmental Quality regulations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) When available, the Responsible Official should use existing NEPA analyses for assessing the impacts of a proposed action and any alternatives. Procedures for adoption or incorporation by reference of such analyses must be followed where applicable.</P>
            <P>(b) If existing NEPA analyses include data and assumptions appropriate for the analysis at hand, the Responsible Official should use these existing NEPA analyses and/or their underlying data and assumptions where feasible.</P>
            <P>(c) An existing environmental analysis prepared pursuant to NEPA and the Council on Environmental Quality regulations may be used in its entirety if the Responsible Official determines, with appropriate supporting documentation, that it adequately assesses the environmental effects of the proposed action and reasonable alternatives. The supporting record must include an evaluation of whether new circumstances, new information or changes in the action or its impacts not previously analyzed may result in significantly different environmental effects.</P>
            <P>(d) Responsible Officials should make the best use of existing NEPA documents by supplementing, tiering to, incorporating by reference, or adopting previous NEPA environmental analyses to avoid redundancy and unnecessary paperwork.</P>

            <P>(a) Bureau proposed action. The analysis of the proposed action and any alternatives must include an analysis of <PRTPAGE P="538"/>the effects of the proposed action or alternative as well as analysis of the effects of any appropriate mitigation measures or best management practices that are considered. The mitigation measures can be analyzed either as elements of alternatives or in a separate discussion of mitigation.</P>
            <P>(b) Applicant proposals (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, bureau decision-making on such proposals is the proposed action). An applicant's proposal presented to the bureau for analysis must include any ameliorative design elements (including stipulations, conditions, or best management practices), required to make the proposal conform to applicable legal requirements, as well as any voluntary ameliorative design element(s). The effects of any mitigation measures other than the ameliorative design elements included in the applicant's proposal must also be analyzed. The analysis of these mitigation measures can be structured as a matter of consideration of alternatives to approving the applicant's proposal or as separate mitigation measures to be imposed on any alternative selected for implementation.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Using tiered documents.</SUBJECT>
            <P>A NEPA document that tiers to another broader NEPA document in accordance with 40 CFR 1508.28 must include a finding that the conditions and environmental effects described in the broader NEPA document are still valid or address any exceptions.</P>
            <P>(a) Where the impacts of the narrower action are identified and analyzed in the broader NEPA document, no further analysis is necessary, and the previously prepared document can be used for purposes of the pending action.</P>
            <P>(b) To the extent that any relevant analysis in the broader NEPA document is not sufficiently comprehensive or adequate to support further decisions, the tiered NEPA document must explain this and provide any necessary analysis.</P>

            <P>(c) An environmental assessment prepared in support of an individual proposed action can be tiered to a programmatic or other broader-scope environmental impact statement. An environmental assessment may be prepared, and a finding of no significant impact reached, for a proposed action with significant effects, whether direct, indirect, or cumulative, if the environmental assessment is tiered to a broader environmental impact statement which fully analyzed those significant effects. Tiering to the programmatic or broader-scope environmental impact statement would allow the preparation of an environmental assessment and a finding of no significant impact for the individual proposed action, so long as any previously unanalyzed effects are not significant. A finding of no significant impact other than those already disclosed and analyzed in the environmental impact statement to which the environmental assessment is tiered may also be called a “finding of no <E T="03">new</E> significant impact.”</P>

            <P>Bureaus should use adaptive management, as appropriate, particularly in circumstances where long-term impacts may be uncertain and future monitoring will be needed to make adjustments in subsequent implementation decisions. The NEPA analysis conducted in the context of an adaptive management approach should identify the range of management options that may be taken in response to the results of monitoring and should analyze the effects of such options. The environmental effects of any adaptive management strategy must be evaluated in this or subsequent NEPA analysis.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Emergency responses.</SUBJECT>
            <P>This section applies only if the Responsible Official determines that an emergency exists that makes it necessary to take urgently needed actions before preparing a NEPA analysis and documentation in accordance with the provisions in subparts D and E of this part.</P>
            <P>(a) The Responsible Official may take those actions necessary to control the immediate impacts of the emergency that are urgently needed to mitigate harm to life, property, or important natural, cultural, or historic resources. When taking such actions, the Responsible Official shall take into account the probable environmental consequences of these actions and mitigate foreseeable adverse environmental effects to the extent practical.</P>
            <P>(b) The Responsible Official shall document in writing the determination that an emergency exists and describe the responsive action(s) taken at the time the emergency exists. The form of that documentation is within the discretion of the Responsible Official.</P>
            <P>(c) If the Responsible Official determines that proposed actions taken in response to an emergency, beyond actions noted in paragraph (a) of this section, are not likely to have significant environmental impacts, the Responsible Official shall document that determination in an environmental assessment and a finding of no significant impact prepared in accordance with this part, unless categorically excluded (see subpart C of this part). If the Responsible Official finds that the nature and scope of the subsequent actions related to the emergency require taking such proposed actions prior to completing an environmental assessment and a finding of no significant impact, the Responsible Official shall consult with the Office of Environmental Policy and Compliance about alternative arrangements for NEPA compliance. The Assistant Secretary, Policy Management and Budget or his/her designee may grant an alternative arrangement. Any alternative arrangement must be documented. Consultation with the Department must be coordinated through the appropriate bureau headquarters.</P>
            <P>(d) The Department shall consult with CEQ about alternative arrangements as soon as possible if the Responsible Official determines that proposed actions, taken in response to an emergency, beyond actions noted in paragraph (a) of this section, are likely to have significant environmental impacts. The Responsible Official shall consult with appropriate bureau headquarters and the Department, about alternative arrangements as soon as the Responsible Official determines that the proposed action is likely to have a significant environmental effect. Such alternative arrangements will apply only to the proposed actions necessary to control the immediate impacts of the emergency. Other proposed actions remain subject to NEPA analysis and documentation in accordance with this part.</P>

            <P>Categorical Exclusion means a category or kind of action that has no significant individual or cumulative effect on the quality of the human environment. See 40 CFR 1508.4.</P>
            <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if an action is covered by a Departmental categorical exclusion, the bureau is not required to prepare an environmental assessment (see subpart D of this part) or an environmental impact statement (see subpart E of this part). If a proposed action does not meet the criteria for any of the listed Departmental categorical exclusions or any of the individual bureau categorical exclusions, then the proposed action must be analyzed in an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement.</P>
            <P>(b) The actions listed in section 46.210 are categorically excluded, Department-wide, from preparation of environmental assessments or environmental impact statements.</P>
            <P>(c) The CEQ Regulations at 40 CFR 1508.4 require agency procedures to provide for extraordinary circumstances in which a normally excluded action may have a significant environmental effect and require additional analysis and action. Section 46.215 lists the extraordinary circumstances under which actions otherwise covered by a categorical exclusion require analyses under NEPA.</P>
            <P>(1) Any action that is normally categorically excluded must be evaluated to determine whether it meets any of the extraordinary circumstances in section 46.215; if it does, further analysis and environmental documents must be prepared for the action.</P>

            <P>(2) Bureaus must work within existing administrative frameworks, including any existing programmatic agreements, when deciding how to apply any of the section 46.215 extraordinary circumstances.<PRTPAGE P="541"/>

            <P>(h) Legislative proposals of an administrative or technical nature (including such things as changes in authorizations for appropriations and minor boundary changes and land title transactions) or having primarily economic, social, individual, or institutional effects; and comments and reports on referrals of legislative proposals.</P>
            <P>(i) Policies, directives, regulations, and guidelines: that are of an administrative, financial, legal, technical, or procedural nature; or whose environmental effects are too broad, speculative, or conjectural to lend themselves to meaningful analysis and will later be subject to the NEPA process, either collectively or case-by-case.</P>

            <P>(2) Any Federal agency that is qualified to participate in the development of an environmental impact statement by virtue of its special expertise, as defined in 40 CFR 1508.26; or</P>
            <P>(3) Any non-Federal agency (State, tribal, or local) with qualifications similar to those in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) Except as described in paragraph (c) of this section, the Responsible Official for the lead bureau must invite eligible governmental entities to participate as cooperating agencies when the bureau is developing an environmental impact statement.</P>

            <P>(c) The Responsible Official for the lead bureau must consider any request by an eligible governmental entity to participate in a particular environmental impact statement as a cooperating agency. If the Responsible Official for the lead bureau denies a request, or determines it is inappropriate to extend an invitation, he or she must state the reasons in the environmental impact statement. Denial of a request or not extending an invitation for cooperating agency status is not subject to any internal administrative appeals process, nor is it a final agency action subject to review under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 <E T="03">et seq.</E>

            <SUBJECT>NEPA scoping process.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Scoping is a process that continues throughout the planning and early stages of preparation of an environmental impact statement. Scoping is required for an environmental impact statement; scoping may be helpful during preparation of an environmental assessment, but is not required (see paragraph 46.305(a) Public involvement in the environmental assessment process). For an environmental impact statement, bureaus must use scoping to engage State, local and tribal governments and the public in the early <PRTPAGE P="544"/>identification of concerns, potential impacts, relevant effects of past actions and possible alternative actions. Scoping is an opportunity to introduce and explain the interdisciplinary approach and solicit information as to additional disciplines that should be included. Scoping also provides an opportunity to bring agencies and applicants together to lay the groundwork for setting time limits, expediting reviews where possible, integrating other environmental reviews, and identifying any major obstacles that could delay the process. The Responsible Official shall determine whether, in some cases, the invitation requirement in 40 CFR 1501.7(a)(1) may be satisfied by including such an invitation in the notice of intent (NOI).</P>
            <P>(b) In scoping meetings, newsletters, or by other communication methods appropriate to scoping, the lead agency must make it clear that the lead agency is ultimately responsible for determining the scope of an environmental impact statement and that suggestions obtained during scoping are only options for the bureau to consider.</P>

            <P>(1) Set time limits from the start to the finish of the NEPA analysis and documentation, consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR 1501.8 and other legal obligations, including statutory and regulatory timeframes;</P>
            <P>(2) Consult with cooperating agencies in setting time limits; and</P>
            <P>(3) Encourage cooperating agencies to meet established time frames.</P>
            <P>(b) Time limits should reflect the availability of Department and bureau personnel and funds. Efficiency of the NEPA process is dependent on the management capabilities of the lead bureau, which must assemble an interdisciplinary team and/or qualified staff appropriate to the type of project to be analyzed to ensure timely completion of NEPA documents.</P>

            <P>(a) The bureau must, to the extent practicable, provide for public notification and public involvement when an environmental assessment is being prepared. However, the methods for providing public notification and opportunities for public involvement are at the discretion of the Responsible Official.</P>
            <P>(1) The bureau must consider comments that are timely received, whether specifically solicited or not.</P>
            <P>(2) Although scoping is not required, the bureau may apply a scoping process to an environmental assessment.</P>

            <P>(b) Publication of a “draft” environmental assessment is not required. Bureaus may seek comments on an environmental assessment if they determine it to be appropriate, such as when the level of public interest or the uncertainty of effects warrants, and may <PRTPAGE P="545"/>revise environmental assessments based on comments received without need of initiating another comment period.</P>
            <P>(c) The bureau must notify the public of the availability of an environmental assessment and any associated finding of no significant impact once they have been completed. Comments on a finding of no significant impact do not need to be solicited, except as required by 40 CFR 1501.4(e)(2).</P>

            <P>(5) A list of agencies and persons consulted.</P>
            <P>(b) When the Responsible Official determines that there are no unresolved conflicts about the proposed action with respect to alternative uses of available resources, the environmental assessment need only consider the proposed action and does not need to consider additional alternatives, including the no action alternative. (See section 102(2)(E) of NEPA).</P>
            <P>(c) In addition, an environmental assessment may describe a broader range of alternatives to facilitate planning and decision-making.</P>
            <P>(d) A proposed action or alternative(s) may include adaptive management strategies allowing for adjustment of the action during implementation. If the adjustments to an action are clearly articulated and pre-specified in the description of the alternative and fully analyzed, then the action may be adjusted during implementation without the need for further analysis. Adaptive management includes a monitoring component, approved adaptive actions that may be taken, and environmental effects analysis for the adaptive actions approved.</P>
            <P>(e) The level of detail and depth of impact analysis should normally be limited to the minimum needed to determine whether there would be significant environmental effects.</P>
            <P>(f) Bureaus may choose to provide additional detail and depth of analysis as appropriate in those environmental assessments prepared under paragraph 46.300(b).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Timing of environmental impact statement development.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The bureau must prepare an environmental impact statement for each proposed major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment before making a decision on whether to proceed with the proposed action.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Remaining within page limits.</SUBJECT>
            <P>To the extent possible, bureaus should use techniques such as incorporation of referenced documents into NEPA analysis (46.135) and tiering (46.140) in an effort to remain within the normal page limits stated in 40 CFR 1502.7.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Environmental impact statement content, alternatives, circulation and filing requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The Responsible Official may use any environmental impact statement format and design as long as the statement is in accordance with 40 CFR 1502.10.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Contents.</E> The environmental impact statement shall disclose:</P>
            <P>(1) A statement of the purpose and need for the action;</P>
            <P>(2) A description of the proposed action;</P>
            <P>(3) The environmental impact of the proposed action;</P>
            <P>(4) A brief description of the affected environment;</P>
            <P>(5) Any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented;</P>
            <P>(6) Alternatives to the proposed action;</P>
            <P>(7) The relationship between local short-term uses of the human environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity;</P>
            <P>(8) Any irreversible or irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented; and</P>
            <P>(9) The process used to coordinate with other Federal agencies, State, tribal and local governments, and persons or organizations who may be interested or affected, and the results thereof.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Alternatives.</E> The environmental impact statement shall document the examination of the range of alternatives (paragraph 46.420(c)). The range of alternatives includes those reasonable alternatives (paragraph 46.420(b)) that meet the purpose and need of the proposed action, and address one or more significant issues (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(2-3)) related to the proposed action. Since an alternative may be developed to address more than one significant issue, no specific number of alternatives is required or prescribed. In addition to the requirements in 40 CFR 1502.14, the Responsible Official has an option to use the following procedures to develop and analyze alternatives.</P>
            <P>(1) The analysis of the effects of the no-action alternative may be documented by contrasting the current condition and expected future condition should the proposed action not be undertaken with the impacts of the proposed action and any reasonable alternatives.</P>

            <P>(2) The Responsible Official may collaborate with those persons or organization that may be interested or affected to modify a proposed action and alternative(s) under consideration prior to issuing a draft environmental impact statement. In such cases the Responsible Official may consider these modifications as alternatives considered. Before engaging in any collaborative processes, the Responsible Official must consider the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) implications of such processes.<PRTPAGE P="547"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) A proposed action or alternative(s) may include adaptive management strategies allowing for adjustment of the action during implementation. If the adjustments to an action are clearly articulated and pre-specified in the description of the alternative and fully analyzed, then the action may be adjusted during implementation without the need for further analysis. Adaptive management includes a monitoring component, approved adaptive actions that may be taken, and environmental effects analysis for the adaptive actions approved.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Circulating and filing draft and final environmental impact statements.</E> (1) The draft and final environmental impact statements shall be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Federal Activities in Washington, DC (40 CFR 1506.9).</P>
            <P>(2) Requirements at 40 CFR 1506.9 “Filing requirements,” 40 CFR 1506.10 “Timing of agency action,” 40 CFR 1502.9 “Draft, final, and supplemental statements,” and 40 CFR 1502.19 “Circulation of the environmental impact statement” shall only apply to draft, final, and supplemental environmental impact statements that are filed with EPA.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 46.420</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Terms used in an environmental impact statement.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The following terms are commonly used to describe concepts or activities in an environmental impact statement:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Statement of purpose and need.</E> In accordance with 40 CFR 1502.13, the statement of purpose and need briefly indicates the underlying purpose and need to which the bureau is responding.</P>
            <P>(1) In some instances it may be appropriate for the bureau to describe its “purpose” and its “need” as distinct aspects. The “need” for the action may be described as the underlying problem or opportunity to which the agency is responding with the action. The “purpose” may refer to the goal or objective that the bureau is trying to achieve, and should be stated to the extent possible, in terms of desired outcomes.</P>
            <P>(2) When a bureau is asked to approve an application or permit, the bureau should consider the needs and goals of the parties involved in the application or permit as well as the public interest. The needs and goals of the parties involved in the application or permit may be described as background information. However, this description must not be confused with the bureau's purpose and need for action. It is the bureau's purpose and need for action that will determine the range of alternatives and provide a basis for the selection of an alternative in a decision.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Reasonable alternatives.</E> In addition to the requirements of 40 CFR 1502.14, this term includes alternatives that are technically and economically practical or feasible and meet the purpose and need of the proposed action.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Range of alternatives.</E> This term includes all reasonable alternatives, or when there are potentially a very large number of alternatives then a reasonable number of examples covering the full spectrum of reasonable alternatives, each of which must be rigorously explored and objectively evaluated, as well as those other alternatives that are eliminated from detailed study with a brief discussion of the reasons for eliminating them. 40 CFR 1502.14. The Responsible Official must not consider alternatives beyond the range of alternatives discussed in the relevant environmental documents, but may select elements from several alternatives discussed. Moreover, the Responsible Official must, in fact, consider all the alternatives discussed in an environmental impact statement. 40 CFR 1505.1 (e).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Preferred alternative.</E> This term refers to the alternative which the bureau believes would best accomplish the purpose and need of the proposed action while fulfilling its statutory mission and responsibilities, giving consideration to economic, environmental, technical, and other factors. It may or may not be the same as the bureau's proposed action, the non-Federal entity's proposal or the environmentally preferable alternative.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 46.425</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Identification of the preferred alternative in an environmental impact statement.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Unless another law prohibits the expression of a preference, the draft environmental impact statement should <PRTPAGE P="548"/>identify the bureau's preferred alternative or alternatives, if one or more exists.</P>
            <P>(b) Unless another law prohibits the expression of a preference, the final environmental impact statement must identify the bureau's preferred alternative.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 46.430</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Environmental review and consultation requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Any environmental impact statement that also addresses other environmental review and consultation requirements must clearly identify and discuss all the associated analyses, studies, or surveys relied upon by the bureau as a part of that review and consultation. The environmental impact statement must include these associated analyses, studies, or surveys, either in the text or in an appendix or indicate where such analysis, studies or surveys may be readily accessed by the public.</P>
            <P>(b) The draft environmental impact statement must list all Federal permits, licenses, or approvals that must be obtained to implement the proposal. The environmental analyses for these related permits, licenses, and approvals should be integrated and performed concurrently. The bureau, however, need not unreasonably delay its NEPA analysis in order to integrate another agency's analyses. The bureau may complete the NEPA analysis before all approvals by other agencies are in place.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Inviting comments.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A bureau must seek comment from the public as part of the Notice of Intent to prepare an environmental impact statement and notice of availability for a draft environmental impact statement;</P>
            <P>(b) In addition to paragraph (a) of this section, a bureau must request comments from:</P>
            <P>(1) Federal agencies;</P>
            <P>(2) State agencies through procedures established by the Governor of such state under EO 12372;</P>
            <P>(3) Local governments and agencies, to the extent that the proposed action affects their jurisdictions; and</P>
            <P>(4) The applicant, if any, and persons or organizations who may be interested or affected.</P>
            <P>(c) The bureau must request comments from the tribal governments, unless the tribal governments have designated an alternate review process, when the proposed action may affect the environment of either:</P>
            <P>(1) Indian trust or restricted land; or</P>
            <P>(2) Other Indian trust resources, trust assets, or tribal health and safety.</P>
            <P>(d) A bureau does not need to delay preparation and issuance of a final environmental impact statement when any Federal, State, and local agencies, or tribal governments from which comments must be obtained or requested do not comment within the prescribed time period.</P>

            <P>The Secretary may approve an exchange only after making a determination that the exchange will advance the interests of the beneficiaries. In considering whether a land exchange will advance the interests of the beneficiaries, the Secretary will evaluate the extent to which it will:</P>
            <P>(a) Achieve better management of Hawaiian home lands;</P>
            <P>(b) Meet the needs of HHCA beneficiaries and their economic circumstances by promoting:</P>
            <P>(1) Homesteading opportunities,</P>
            <P>(2) economic self-sufficiency, and,</P>
            <P>(3) social well-being;</P>
            <P>(c) Promote development of Hawaiian home lands for residential, agricultural, and pastoral use;</P>
            <P>(d) Protect cultural resources and watersheds;</P>
            <P>(e) Consolidate lands or interests in lands, such as agricultural and timber interests, for more logical and efficient management and development;</P>
            <P>(f) Expand homestead communities;</P>
            <P>(g) Accommodate land use authorizations;</P>

            <SUBJECT>When does a land exchange advance the interests of the beneficiaries?</SUBJECT>
            <P>A determination that an exchange advances the interests of the beneficiaries must find that:</P>
            <P>(a) The exchange supports perpetuation of the Hawaiian Home Lands Trust;</P>
            <P>(b) The interests of the beneficiaries in obtaining non-Hawaiian home lands exceeds the interests of the beneficiaries in retaining the Hawaiian home lands proposed for the exchange, based on an evaluation of the factors in § 47.20; and</P>

            <P>Hawaiian home lands to be exchanged must be of equal or lesser value than the lands to be received in the exchange, as determined by the appraisal. Once the market value is established by an approved appraisal, an administrative determination as to the equity of the exchange can be made based on the market value reflected in the approved appraisal.</P>

            <P>(a) Based upon a survey completed in accordance with the Public Land Survey System laws and standards of the United States; or</P>
            <P>(b) If Public Land Survey System laws and standards cannot be applied, based upon a survey that both:</P>

            <P>(b) Whether or not a land exchange proposal is completed, the Chairman initiates the exchange by preparing the documentation, conducting appropriate studies, and submitting them to the Secretary in accordance with § 47.60.</P>
            <P>(c) Upon completing the review of the final land exchange packet under § 47.60, the Secretary will issue a Notice of Decision announcing the approval or disapproval of the exchange.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How will the formal government-to-government relationship between the United States Government and the Native Hawaiian Governing Entity be implemented?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Upon reestablishment of the formal government-to-government relationship, the Native Hawaiian Governing Entity will have the same formal government-to-government relationship under the United States Constitution and Federal law as the formal government-to-government relationship between the United States and a federally-recognized tribe in the continental United States, in recognition of the existence of the same inherent sovereign governmental authorities, subject to the limitation set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) The Native Hawaiian Governing Entity will be subject to the plenary authority of Congress to the same extent as are federally-recognized tribes in the continental United States.</P>
              <P>(c) Absent Federal law to the contrary, any member of the Native Hawaiian Governing Entity presumptively will be eligible for current Federal Native Hawaiian programs, services, and benefits.</P>
              <P>(d) The Native Hawaiian Governing Entity, its political subdivisions (if any), and its members will not be eligible for Federal Indian programs, services, and benefits unless Congress expressly and specifically has declared the Native Hawaiian community, the Native Hawaiian Governing Entity (or the official name stated in that entity's governing document), its political subdivisions (if any), its members, Native Hawaiians, or HHCA Native Hawaiians to be eligible.</P>
              <P>(e) Reestablishment of the formal government-to-government relationship will not authorize the Native Hawaiian Governing Entity to sell, dispose of, lease, tax, or otherwise encumber Hawaiian home lands or interests in those lands, or to diminish any Native Hawaiian's rights, protections, or benefits, including any immunity from State or local taxation, granted by:</P>
              <P>(1) The HHCA;</P>
              <P>(2) The HHLRA;</P>
              <P>(3) The Act of March 18, 1959, 73 Stat. 4; or</P>

              <P>(f) Reestablishment of the formal government-to-government relationship does not affect the title, jurisdiction, or status of Federal lands and property in Hawaii.</P>
              <P>(g) Nothing in this part impliedly amends, repeals, supersedes, abrogates, or overrules any applicable Federal law, including case law, affecting the privileges, immunities, rights, protections, responsibilities, powers, limitations, obligations, authorities, or jurisdiction of any federally-recognized tribe in the continental United States.</P>

              <P>(b) The Act of May 16, 1930 (46 Stat. 367; 43 U.S.C. 424 through 424e); or</P>
              <P>(c) The Act of March 31, 1950 (64 Stat. 39; 43 U.S.C. Sup. 375b through 375f).</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 402.2</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>What lands may be sold; method of sale; limit of acreage.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Lands which may be sold under the Act of May 20, 1920 (41 Stat. 605; 43 U.S.C. 375) are lands, not otherwise reserved, which have been withdrawn in connection with a Federal irrigation project and improved at the expense of the reclamation fund for administration or other like purposes and which are no longer needed for project purposes. Not more than 160 acres of such lands may be sold to any one person. With one exception, such lands must be sold at public auction. If, however, a tract is appraised at not more than $300, it may be sold at private sale or at public auction and without regard to the provisions of the Act of May 20, 1920 respecting notice of publication and mode of sale.</P>
              <P>(b) Lands which may be sold under the Act of May 16, 1930 (46 Stat. 367; 43 U.S.C. 424 through 424e) are tracts of temporarily or permanently unproductive land of insufficient size to support a family. A purchaser must be a resident farm owner or entryman on the Federal irrigation project where such lands are located and is permitted to purchase not more than 160 acres or an area which together with lands already owned or entered on such project, does not exceed 320 acres. A resident farm owner means a farm owner who is actually residing on the farm he owns, and a resident entryman means a homestead entryman who is actually residing on the land in his homestead entry. These lands may be sold either at public auction or at private sale.</P>
              <P>(c) Lands which may be sold under the Act of March 31, 1950 (64 Stat. 39; 43 U.S.C. Sup., 375b through 375f) are tracts of land too small to be classed as farm units under the Federal reclamation laws. A purchaser must be a resident farm owner or entryman (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) on the Federal irrigation project where such lands are located and is permitted to purchase not more than 160 acres or an area which, together with land already owned or entered on such project, does not exceed 160 irrigable acres. These lands may be sold either at public auction or at private sale.</P>

              <P>The Commissioner of Reclamation may, in accordance with the regulations in this subpart, sell lands under each of the three statutes listed in § 402.1.

              <P>(a) Before offering any land for sale under any of the statutes listed in § 402.1, the Commissioner should determine that the sale will be in the best interest of the project in which the lands are located and, if the lands sold are to be irrigated, that there is a sufficient water supply for such irrigation.</P>
              <P>(b) When a decision is made to offer lands for sale under any of the statutes listed in § 402.1: (1) The Commissioner should notify the State Supervisor of the Bureau of Land Management in whose State the lands are located, (2) a report showing the status of the lands should be obtained from the Manager of the appropriate office of the Bureau of Land Management, and (3) a report should be obtained from the Geological Survey with respect to the mineral resources of the lands.

Notice of such sales shall be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the vicinity of the lands to be sold for either not less than 30 days or once a week for five consecutive weeks prior to the date fixed for any such sale. Under the Act of May 20, 1920 (41 Stat. 605; 43 U.S.C. 375) notice of sales of lands appraised at more than $300 shall also be given by posting upon the land. In the case of all sales under this subpart notice may be given by such other means as the Commissioner may deem appropriate.

            <P>(a) Settlement lands, which the United States is not under contract to sell or exchange at the time a district makes its annual levy of assessments shall not be assessed, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. If the United States thereafter contracts to sell or exchange such lands before the end of the irrigation season following the date of the annual levy, the purchaser will be required to make appropriate payment to the district for the water service which will be available to the purchaser during that irrigation season or the remaining portion thereof.</P>
            <P>(b) From the date the United States contracts to sell or exchange settlement lands until title thereto passes to the purchaser under such contract, or until the rights of the purchaser are terminated or reacquired by the United States settlement lands shall be subject to assessment by a district on the same basis as other lands of like character within the operation of the district.</P>
            <P>(c) Settlement lands, which the United States is not under contract to sell or exchange at the time a district makes its levy may be assessed by a district to the extent of the construction charge obligation installment required to be levied for the following year on such lands on account of the district's construction cost obligation to the United States. No other levies shall be made by a district against settlement lands in this status.</P>
            <P>(d) While settlement lands which the United States has leased for use as irrigated lands and which the United States has not contracted to sell or exchange may not be assessed by a district except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, lessees shall pay the district the same amounts annually that would be required to be paid for water service if the lands were subject to assessment therefor, in addition to any assessment levied under paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) Assessments made by a district against settlement lands while the United States is under contract to sell or exchange such lands shall be subject to all interest and penalties for delinquency as provided by the laws of Washington, but interest and penalties shall cease to accumulate on the date such contract is terminated or the purchaser's interest therein reacquired by the United States.</P>
            <P>(f) No action shall be taken by or for a district to enforce any lien created as permitted under the regulations in this part by assessment foreclosure or other means that would purport to transfer any right in or title to any land or interests therein while title thereto is vested in the United States. Although the United States does not assume any obligation for the payment of such liens, it will in any conveyance of settlement lands covered thereby convey subject to those liens.</P>

            <P>(a) A district shall, as to other project act lands and rights of way the title to which passes to the United States on or after January 1 of any year and before the district has levied its assessments for that year, immediately remove the lands from its assessment rolls and shall not thereafter take any proceedings to complete or enforce the assessments. Any such removal from the rolls shall be effective as of January 1 of the year in which <PRTPAGE P="593"/>title passes to the United States Action so to remove shall be taken promptly after the giving of written notice by the Project Manager to the district as to the lands involved, and the district shall provide the United States with a certificate stating that the lands have not been and will not be assessed so long as title thereto remains in the United States.</P>
            <P>(b) There is no authority in law for the assessment of rights of way owned by the United States. Accordingly, a district shall make no assessment thereof while title thereto remains in the United States.</P>
            <P>(c) Other project act lands while title thereto remains in the United States shall not be assessed for any district charge so long as they are in the “other project act lands” category.</P>

              <P>(i) Notify the storing entity to develop a specific quantity of ICUA in the following calendar year;</P>
              <P>(ii) Ask the Secretary to release that ICUA; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Provide a copy of the notice or request to each Lower Division State.</P>
              <P>(8) The agreement must specify that when the storing entity receives a request to develop a specific quantity of ICUA:</P>
              <P>(i) It will ensure that the Storing State's consumptive use of Colorado River water will be decreased by a quantity sufficient to develop the requested quantity of ICUA; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Any actions that the storing entity takes will be consistent with its State's laws.</P>
              <P>(9) The agreement must include a description of:</P>
              <P>(i) The actions the authorized entity will take to develop ICUA;</P>

              <P>(iv) The notice given to entitlement holders, including Indian tribes, of opportunities to participate in development of this ICUA.</P>
              <P>(10) The agreement must specify that the storing entity will certify to the Secretary that ICUA has been or will be developed that otherwise would not have existed. The certification must:</P>
              <P>(i) Identify the quantity, the means, and the entity by which ICUA has been or will be developed; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Ask the Secretary to make the ICUA available to the consuming entity under Article II(B)(6) of the Decree and the Storage and Interstate Release Agreement.</P>
              <P>(11) The agreement must specify a procedure for verifying development of the ICUA appropriate to the manner in which it is developed.</P>
              <P>(12) The agreement must specify that the Secretary will release ICUA developed by the storing entity:</P>
              <P>(i) In accordance with a request of the consuming entity;</P>

              <P>(13) The agreement must specify that ICUA shall be released to the consuming entity only in the year and to the extent that ICUA is developed by the storing entity by reducing Colorado River water use within the Storing State.</P>
              <P>(14) The agreement must specify that the Secretary will release ICUA only after the Secretary has determined that all necessary actions have been taken under this part.</P>
              <P>(15) The agreement must specify that before releasing ICUA the Secretary must first determine that the storing entity:</P>
              <P>(i) Stored water in accordance with the Storage and Interstate Release Agreement in quantities sufficient to support the development of the ICUA requested by the consuming entity; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Certified to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the quantity of ICUA requested by the consuming entity has been developed in that year or will be developed in that year under § 414.3(f).</P>

              <P>(16) The agreement must specify that the non-Federal parties to the Storage and Interstate Release Agreement will indemnify the United States, its employees, agents, subcontractors, successors, or assigns from loss or claim for damages and from liability to persons or property, direct or indirect, and loss or claim of any nature whatsoever arising by reason of the actions taken <PRTPAGE P="597"/>by the non-federal parties to the Storage and Interstate Release Agreement under this part.</P>
              <P>(17) The agreement must specify the extent to which facilities constructed or financed by the United States will be used to store, convey, or distribute water associated with a Storage and Interstate Release Agreement.</P>
              <P>(18) The agreement must include any other provisions that the parties deem appropriate.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">How to address financial considerations.</E> The Secretary will not execute an agreement that has adverse impacts on the financial interests of the United States. Financial details between and among the non-Federal parties need not be included in the Storage and Interstate Release Agreement but instead can be the subject of separate agreements. The Secretary need not be a party to the separate agreements.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">How the Secretary will execute storage and interstate release agreements.</E> The Regional Director for the Bureau of Reclamation's Lower Colorado Region (Regional Director) may execute and administer a Storage and Interstate Release Agreement on behalf of the Secretary. The Secretary will notify the public of his/her intent to participate in negotiations to develop a Storage and Interstate Release Agreement and provide a means for public input. In considering whether to execute a Storage and Interstate Release Agreement, the Secretary may request, and the non-Federal parties must provide, any additional supporting data necessary to clearly set forth both the details of the proposed transaction and the eligibility of the parties to participate as State-authorized entities in the proposed transaction. The Secretary will also consider: applicable law and executive orders; applicable contracts; potential effects on trust resources; potential effects on entitlement holders, including Indian tribes; potential impacts on the Upper Division States; potential effects on third parties; potential environmental impacts and potential effects on threatened and endangered species; comments from interested parties, particularly parties who may be affected by the proposed action; comments from the State agencies responsible for consulting with the Secretary on matters related to the Colorado River; and other relevant factors, including the direct or indirect consequences of the proposed Storage and Interstate Release Agreement on the financial interests of the United States. Based on the consideration of the factors in this section, the Secretary may execute or decide not to execute a Storage and Interstate Release Agreement.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Assigning interests to an authorized entity.</E> Non-Federal parties to a Storage and Interstate Release Agreement may assign their interests in the Agreement to authorized entities. The assignment can be in whole or in part. The assignment can only be made if all parties to the agreement approve.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Requirement for contracts under the Boulder Canyon Project Act.</E> Release or diversion of Colorado River water for storage under this part must be supported by a water delivery contract with the Secretary in accordance with Section 5 of the BCPA. The only exception to this requirement is storage of Article II(D) (of the Decree) water by Federal or tribal entitlement holders. The release or diversion of Colorado River water that has been developed or will be developed as ICUA under this part also must be supported by a Section 5 water delivery contract.</P>
              <P>(1) An authorized entity may satisfy the requirement of this section through a direct contract with the Secretary. An authorized entity also may satisfy the Section 5 requirement of the BCPA, for purposes of this part, through a valid subcontract with an entitlement holder that is authorized by the Secretary to subcontract for the delivery of all or a portion of its entitlement.</P>
              <P>(2) For storing entities that do not otherwise hold a contract or valid subcontract for the delivery of the water to be stored, the Storage and Interstate Release Agreement will serve as the vehicle for satisfying the Section 5 requirement for the release or diversion of that water.</P>

              <P>(3) For consuming entities that do not otherwise hold a contract or valid subcontract for the delivery of the water to be released by the Secretary as ICUA, the Storage and Interstate <PRTPAGE P="598"/>Release Agreement will serve as the vehicle for satisfying the Section 5 requirement for the release or diversion of that water.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Anticipatory release of ICUA.</E> The Secretary may release ICUA to a consuming entity before the actual development of ICUA by the storing entity if the storing entity certifies to the Secretary that ICUA will be developed during that same year that otherwise would not have existed.</P>
              <P>(1) These anticipatory releases will only be made in the same year that the ICUA is developed.</P>
              <P>(2) Before an anticipatory release, the Secretary must be satisfied that the storing entity will develop the necessary ICUA in the same year that the ICUA is to be released.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Treaty obligations.</E> Prior to executing any specific Storage and Interstate Release Agreements, the United States will consult with Mexico through the International Boundary and Water Commission under the boundary water treaties and other applicable international agreements in force between the two countries.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Annual report to the Secretary.</E> Each storing entity will submit an annual report to the Secretary containing the material required by this section. The report will be due on a date to be agreed upon by the parties to the Storage and Interstate Release Agreement. The report must include:</P>
              <P>(1) The quantity of water diverted and stored during the prior year under all Storage and Interstate Release Agreements; and</P>
              <P>(2) The total quantity of stored water available to support the development of ICUA under each Storage and Interstate Release Agreement to which the storing entity is a party as of December 31 of the prior calendar year.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">How the Secretary accounts for diverted and stored water.</E> The Secretary will account for water diverted and stored under Storage and Interstate Release Agreements in the records maintained under Article V of the Decree.</P>
              <P>(1) The Secretary will account for the water that is diverted and stored by a storing entity as a consumptive use in the Storing State for the year in which it is stored.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary will account for the diversion and consumptive use of ICUA by a consuming entity as a consumptive use in the Consuming State of unused apportionment under Article II(B)(6) of the Decree in the year the water is released in the same manner as any other unused apportionment taken by that State.</P>
              <P>(3) The Secretary will maintain individual balances of the quantities of water stored under a Storage and Interstate Release Agreement and available to support the development of ICUA. The appropriate balances will be reduced when ICUA is developed by the storing entity and released by the Secretary for use by a consuming entity.</P>

The United States is not under any obligation to construct or furnish water treatment facilities to maintain or improve water quality except as may otherwise be provided in relevant Federal law.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Required water quality standards.</E> All entities, in diverting, using, and returning Colorado River water, must:</P>
              <P>(1) Comply with all applicable water pollution laws and regulations of the United States, the Storing State, and the Consuming State; and</P>
              <P>(2) Obtain all applicable permits or licenses from the appropriate Federal, State, or local authorities regarding water quality and water pollution matters.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Notice of recommendations and determinations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Following consultation with each Contractor and after consideration of all relevant comments and suggestions advanced by the Contractors in such consultations, the Regional Director will formulate his recommendations and determinations relating to the matters specified in § 417.2. The recommendations and determinations shall, with respect to each Contractor, be based upon but not necessarily limited to such factors as the area to be irrigated, climatic conditions, location, land classifications, the kinds of crops raised, cropping practices, the type of irrigation system in use, the condition of water carriage and distribution facilities, record of water orders, and rejections of ordered water, general operating practices, the operating efficiencies and methods of irrigation of the water users, amount and rate of return flows to the river, municipal water requirements and the pertinent provisions of the Contractor's Boulder Canyon Project Act water delivery contract. The Regional Director shall give each Contractor written notice by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, of his recommendations and determinations. If the recommendations and determinations include a reduction in the amount of water to be delivered, as compared to the calendar year immediately preceding, the notice shall be delivered to the Contractor or timely sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, so that it may reasonably be delivered at least 30 days prior to the first date water delivery would be affected thereby, and shall specify the basis for such reduction including any pertinent factual determinations. The recommendations and determinations of the Regional Director shall be final and conclusive unless, within 30 days of the date of receipt of the notice, the Contractor submits his written comments and objections to the Regional Director and requests further consultation. If, after such further consultation, timely taken, the Regional Director does not modify his recommendations and determinations and so advises the Contractor in writing, or if modifications are made but the Contractor still feels aggrieved thereby after notification in writing of such modified recommendations and determinations, the Contractor may, before 30 days after receipt of said notice, appeal to the Secretary of the Interior. During the pendency of such appeal, and until disposition thereof by the Secretary, the recommendations and determinations formulated by the Regional Director shall be of no force or effect. In the event delivery of water is scheduled prior to the new recommendations and determinations becoming final, said delivery shall be made according to the Contractor's currently proposed schedule or to the schedules approved for the previous calendar year, whichever is less.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Duties of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs with respect to Indian reservations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Commissioner of Indian Affairs (herein termed “Commissioner”) will engage in consultations with various tribes and other water users on the Indian Reservations listed in Article II (D) of said Supreme Court Decree, similar to those engaged in by the Regional Director with regard to Contractors as provided in § 417.2 of this part. After consideration of all comments and suggestions advanced by said tribes and other water users on said Indian Reservations concerning water conservation measures and operating practices in the diversion, delivery, distribution and use of Colorado River water, the Commissioner shall, within the limits prescribed in said decree, make a determination as to the estimated amount of water to be diverted for use on each Indian Reservation covered by the above decree. Said determination shall be made prior to the beginning of each calendar year. That determination shall be based upon, but not necessarily limited to, such factors as: The area to be irrigated, climatic conditions, location, land classifications, the kinds of crops raised, cropping practices, the type of irrigation system in use, the condition of water carriage and distribution facilities, record of water orders, and rejections of ordered water, general operating practices, the operating efficiencies and methods of irrigation of the tribes and water users on each reservation, the amount and rate of return flows to the river, municipal water requirements, and other uses on the reservation. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs shall deliver to the Regional Director written notice of the amount of water to be diverted for use upon each Indian Reservation for each year 60 days prior to the beginning of each calendar year and the basis for said determination. The determination of the Commissioner shall be final and conclusive unless within 30 days of the date of receipt of such notice the Regional Director submits his written comments and objections to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and requests further consultation. If after such further consultation, timely taken, the Commissioner does not modify his determination and so advises the Regional Director in writing or if modifications are made by the Commissioner but the Regional Director still does not agree therewith, the Regional Director may, within 30 days after receipt of the Commissioner's response, appeal to the Secretary of the Interior for a decision on the matter. During the pendency of such appeal and until disposition thereof by the Secretary, water deliveries will be made to the extent legally and physically available according to the Commissioner's determination or according to the Commissioner's determination for the preceding calendar year, whichever is less.</P>
            <P>(b) Modifications of said determinations due to changed conditions, emergency or hardship may be made by the Commissioner, subject, however, to the right of the Regional Director to appeal to the Secretary, as provided in the case of an initial determination by the Commissioner. During the pendency of such an appeal, water deliveries will be made on the basis of the initial determination.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligible land actually irrigated.</E> During each year, the District, in cooperation with the Bureau, must identify and report to the Bureau the location and number of acres of eligible land irrigated in the Project. Possible irrigation of ineligible land will also be identified. The Bureau will review data to ensure compliance with this part. The District, in cooperation with the Bureau, will be responsible for field checking potential violations and immediately stopping delivery of Project water to any ineligible land. The Bureau may also audit as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligible land with transferred water rights.</E> The District water rights maps dated August 1981 through January 1983 will be used as the basis for determining which lands have a valid water right. The original maps will be maintained by the District. The District must provide copies of the maps to the Bureau. The District will alter the maps and the copies to account for water right transfers as the transfers are approved by the Nevada State Engineer.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Reporting changes in eligible land.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligible land anticipated to be irrigated.</E> (1) Anticipated changes in irrigated eligible land from the prior year will be reported to the Bureau's Lahontan Area Office by the District by March 1 of each year. The District will adjust the acreage of the eligible land anticipated to be irrigated to correct for inaccuracies, water right transfers that have been finally approved by the Nevada State Engineer, and any other action that affects the number of eligible acres, acres anticipated to be irrigated, or water deliveries.</P>
              <P>(2) As the adjustments are made, the District will provide updated information to the Bureau for review and approval. The District must adjust anticipated water allocations to individual water users accordingly. The allocations will at all times be based on a maximum annual entitlement of 3.5 acre-feet (AF) per acre of bottom land, 4.5 AF per acre of bench land, and 1.5 AF per acre of pasture land that is anticipated to be irrigated and not on the number of water-righted acres.</P>
              <P>(3) The District will provide the individual water users with the approved data regarding the anticipated acreage to be irrigated and water allocations for each water user that year.</P>
              <P>(i) Any adjustments based on changes in lands anticipated to be irrigated during the irrigation season must be reported by the individual water user to the District.</P>
              <P>(ii) The District will, in turn, notify the Bureau of any changes in irrigated acreage which must be accounted for.</P>

              <P>(iii) Each landowner's anticipated acreage must be less than or equal to the landowner's eligible acreage.<PRTPAGE P="604"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) Should a landowner believe that the number of acres of eligible land he or she is entitled to irrigate is different from the number of acres as approved by the Bureau, the landowner must notify the District and present appropriate documentation regarding the subject acreage. The District must record the information and present the claim to the Bureau for further consideration.</P>
              <P>(i) If the Bureau determines there is sufficient support for the landowner's claim, then adjustments will be made to accommodate the changes requested by the landowner.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the Bureau disallows the landowner's claim, the Bureau must notify the District in writing. The District will, in turn, inform the landowner of the disposition of the claim and the reasons therefore, and will further instruct the landowner that he or she may seek judicial review of the Bureau's determination under the decrees. If the dispute affects the current year, then the Bureau and the District will seek to expedite any court proceeding.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Changes in domestic and other uses.</E> By March 1 of each year, the District must report to the Bureau all anticipated domestic and other water uses. This notification must include a detailed explanation of the criteria used in allowing the use and sufficient documentation on the type and amount of use by each water user to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Bureau that each water user is in compliance with the criteria. With adequate documentation, the District may notify the Bureau of any changes in domestic water requirements at any time during the year.</P>

              <P>(a) Eligible land may receive no more than the amount of water in acre-feet per year established as maximum farm headgate delivery allowances by the decrees. All water use is limited to that amount reasonably necessary for economical and beneficial use under the decrees.</P>
              <P>(b) The annual water duty as assigned by the decrees is a maximum of 4.5 AF per acre for bench lands and a maximum of 3.5 AF per acre for bottom lands. The water duty for fields with a mixture of bench and bottom lands must be the water duty of the majority acreage. Bench and bottom land designations as finally approved by the United States District Court for the District of Nevada will be used in determining the maximum water duty for any parcel of eligible land. The annual water duty for pasture land established by contract is 1.5 AF per acre.</P>

              <P>The valid water deliveries at the headgate are set by the product of eligible land actually irrigated multiplied by the appropriate water duty in accordance with §§ 418.8 and 418.10. The District will regularly monitor all water deliveries and report in accordance with § 418.9. No amount of water will be delivered in excess of the individual water user's headgate entitlement. In the event excess deliveries should occur, such amount will be automatically reflected in the efficiency deficit adjustment to the Lahontan storage. Water delivered in excess of entitlements must not be considered valid for purposes of computing project efficiency.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 418.12</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Project efficiency.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The principal feature of this part is to obtain a reasonable level of efficiency in supplying water to the headgate by the District. The efficiency targets established by this part are the cornerstone of the enforcement and the incentive provisions and when implemented will aid other competing uses.</P>

              <P>(b) The efficiency is readily calculable at the year's end, readily applicable to water appropriate to that year, able to be compared to other irrigation systems even though there may be many dissimilarities, appropriate for long term averaging, adjustable to any headgate delivery level including droughts or allocations, automatically adjusts to changes during the year and accurately accounts for misappropriated water. Efficiency also can be achieved through any number of measures from operations to changes in the facilities and can be measured as an <PRTPAGE P="605"/>end product without regard to the approach. Thus it is flexible enough to allow local decision making and yet is fact based to minimize disputes.</P>
              <P>(c) Assuming the headgate deliveries are valid and enforceable, conveyance efficiency is the only remaining variable in determining the quantity of water needed to be supplied to the District. Conveyance efficiency is a measure of how much water is released into the irrigation system relative to actual headgate deliveries. Differences in efficiency, therefore, are directly convertible to acre-feet. The differences in efficiency, expressed as a quantity in acre-feet, may be added to or subtracted from the actual Lahontan Reservoir storage level before it is compared to the monthly storage objective. Thus, the diversions from the Truckee River, operation of other facilities (e.g., Stampede Reservoir) and decisions related to Lahontan Reservoir are made after the efficiency storage adjustments have been made. Operating decisions are made as if the adjusted storage reflected actual conditions.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Efficiency incentive credits.</E> In any year that the District's actual efficiency exceeds the target efficiency for the actual headgate delivery, two-thirds of the resultant savings, in water, will be credited to the District as storage in Lahontan. This storage amount will remain in Lahontan Reservoir as water available to the District to use at its discretion consistent with Nevada and Federal law. Such uses may include wetlands (directly or incidentally), power production, recreation, a hedge against future shortages or whatever else the District determines. The storage is credited at the end of the irrigation season from which it was earned. This storage “floats” on top of the reservoir so that if it is unused it will be spilled first if the reservoir spills. The District may use all capacity of Lahontan Reservoir not needed for project purposes to store credits.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Efficiency disincentive debits.</E> In any year that the District's actual efficiency falls short of the target appropriate to the actual headgate deliveries, then the resultant excess water that was used is considered borrowed from the future. Thus it becomes a storage debit adjustment to the actual Lahontan Reservoir storage level for determining all operational decisions. The debit may accumulate but may not exceed a maximum as defined in § 418.13(b). The debit must be offset by an existing incentive credit or, if none is available, by a subsequent incentive at a full credit (not a <FR>2/3</FR> credit), or finally by a restriction of actual headgate deliveries by the District. This would only be done prospectively (a subsequent year) so the District and the water users can prepare accordingly. Since the debit does not immediately affect other competing uses or the District (except in a real drought), it allows for future planning and averaging over time.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Efficiency targets.</E> To determine the efficiency target, the system delivery losses were divided into categories such as seepage, evaporation and operational losses. The “reasonable” level of savings for each category was then determined by starting with current operating experience and applying the added knowledge from several measures. Means of achieving the efficiency targets, including the specific conservation measures and amounts, are identified in the table Possible Water Conservation Measures for the Newlands Project. Applicable target efficiencies will be determined each year as described in § 418.13 (a)(4).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Available conservation measures.</E> The water conservation measures referred to in paragraph (c)(3) of this section and others currently available to the District are listed in the following table. The table has been revised based upon the Bureau of Reclamation's Final Report to Congress of the Newlands Project Efficiency Study, 1994.<PRTPAGE P="606"/>

              <P>(5) The measures in paragraph (c)(4) of this section are discretionary choices for the District. The range of measures available to the District provides a level of assurance that the target efficiency is reasonably achievable. The resultant efficiency targets were also compared to the range of efficiencies actually experienced by other irrigation systems that were considered comparable in order to provide a further check on “reasonable.” Most of the delivery losses are relatively constant regardless of the amount of deliveries. The efficiency will necessarily vary with the amount of headgate deliveries.</P>
              <P>(6) The target efficiency for any annual valid headgate delivery can be derived from the table in Appendix A to this part.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Maximum allowable diversions.</E> (1) A provisional water budget in the Newlands Project Water Budget table must be recalculated for each irrigation season to reflect anticipated water-righted acres to be irrigated. At the start of the irrigation season, the maximum allowable diversion (MAD) <PRTPAGE P="607"/>for each year must be determined by revising the first 10 lines of the Newlands Project Water Budget table based on acres of eligible land anticipated to actually be irrigated in that year (§ 418.9(a)) and the water duties for those lands (§ 418.10). At the end of the irrigation season, the required target efficiency must be recalculated for the irrigation season based on the actual irrigated acres and percent use of headgate entitlements.</P>

              </GPH>

              <P>(2) The MAD will be calculated annually to ensure an adequate water supply for all water right holders whose water use complies with their decreed entitlement and this part. The MAD is the maximum amount of water permitted to be diverted for irrigation use on the Project in that year. It is calculated to ensure full entitlements can be provided, but is expected to significantly exceed Project requirements. The MAD will be established by the Bureau at least 2 weeks before the start of each irrigation season. All releases of <PRTPAGE P="608"/>water from Lahontan Reservoir and diversions from the Truckee Canal (including any diversions from the Truckee Canal to Rock Dam Ditch) must be charged to the MAD except as provided in §§ 418.23 and 418.35 of this part.</P>
              <P>(3) On the basis of the methodology adopted in this part (i.e., actual irrigated acres multiplied by appropriate water duties divided by established project efficiency) an example of the MAD calculated for the projected irrigated acreage as shown in the Newlands Project Water Budget table would be 308,319 acre-feet for the 1995 Example. The sample MAD corresponds to a system efficiency for full deliveries at 66.9 percent for 1995 actual acres. Target efficiencies must be based on the percentage of maximum headgate entitlement delivered and not on the percent of water supply available.</P>
              <P>(4) The table Expected Project Distribution System Efficiency shows the target efficiencies which will be used over the range of irrigated acreage and percent use of entitlement expected in the future. At the beginning of the irrigation season, the target efficiencies from the Expected Project Distribution System Efficiency table used to calculate the MAD will be based on the expected irrigated acreage and expected percent use of entitlement. At the end of the irrigation season, the actual acreage irrigated and actual percent use of entitlement will be used to determine the required efficiency from the Expected Project Distribution System Efficiency. The target efficiencies are read directly from the table if the acreage and use of entitlement values are shown, otherwise the target efficiency must be extrapolated from the table or calculated using the Efficiency Equation. Appendix A of this part shows the calculations used to derive the Efficiency Equation and the efficiency targets.</P>

              <P>(5) Adjustments in the MAD must be made by the Bureau each year based on changes in irrigated eligible land from the prior year and subsequent decisions concerning transfers of Project water rights, using the methodology established in this section.<PRTPAGE P="610"/>
              </P>
              <P>(6) If the MAD for a given year will not meet the water delivery requirements for the eligible land to be irrigated due to weather conditions, canal breaks, or some other unusual or unforeseen condition, the District must ask the Bureau for additional water.</P>
              <P>(i) The District's request must include a written statement containing a detailed explanation of the reasons for the request.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Bureau must promptly review the request and after consultation with the Federal Water Master and other interested parties, will determine if the request or any portion of it should be approved. The Bureau will make reasonable adjustments for unforeseen causes or events but will not make adjustments to accommodate waste or Project inefficiency or other uses of water not in accordance with this part or with State and Federal law.</P>
              <P>(iii) The Bureau will then notify the District of its determination. If the District does not agree with the Bureau's decision, it may seek judicial review. The Bureau and the District will seek to expedite the court proceeding in order to minimize any potential adverse effects.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Maximum allowable efficiency debits (MED).</E> The debits in Lahontan Reservoir storage from the District's actual conveyance efficiency not achieving the target efficiency can accumulate over time. If these amounts of borrowed storage get too large they may not be offset later by increased efficiencies and may severely affect the District's water users by imposing an added “drought” on top of a real one. Therefore, the maximum efficiency debit cushion is set at 26,000 acre-feet. However, unlike the MAD, it only applies to the subsequent year's operation. The MED is approximately 9 percent of the headgate entitlements.</P>

              <P>(a) Diversions of Truckee River water at Derby Dam must be managed to maintain minimum terminal flow to Lahontan Reservoir or the Carson River except where this part specifically permits diversions.</P>
              <P>(b) Diversions to the Truckee Canal must be managed to achieve an average terminal flow of 20 cfs or less during times when diversions to Lahontan Reservoir are not allowed (the flows must be averaged over the total time diversions are not allowed in that calendar year; i.e., if flows are not allowed in July and August and then are allowed in September then not allowed in October and November, the average flow will be averaged over the four months of July, August, October, and November).</P>
              <P>(c) The Bureau will work cooperatively with the District on monitoring the flows at the USGS gage on the Truckee Canal near Hazen to determine if and when flows are in excess of those needed in accord with this part and bringing the flows back into compliance when excessive.</P>
              <P>(d) Increases in canal diversions which would reduce Truckee River flows below Derby Dam by more than 20 percent in a 24-hour period will not be allowed when Truckee River flow, as measured by the gauge below Derby Dam, is less than or equal to 100 cfs.</P>
              <P>(e) Diversions to the Truckee Canal will be coordinated with releases from Stampede Reservoir and other reservoirs, in cooperation with the Federal Water Master, to minimize fluctuations in the Truckee River below Derby Dam in order to meet annual flow regimes established by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for listed species in the lower Truckee River.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Diversions from the Truckee River to Lahontan Reservoir, January through June.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Truckee River diversions through the Truckee Canal will be made to meet Lahontan Reservoir end-of-month storage objectives for the months of January through June. The current month storage objective will be based, in part, on the monthly Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) April through July runoff forecast for the Carson River near Fort Churchill. The forecast will be used to determine the target storage for Lahontan Reservoir and anticipated diversion requirements for the Carson Division. The Bureau, in consultation with the District, Federal Water Master, Fish and Wildlife Service, the Pyramid Lake <PRTPAGE P="612"/>Paiute Tribe, and other affected parties, will determine the exceedance levels and predicted Carson River inflows based on the reliability of the NRCS forecast and other available information such as river forecasts from other sources. The end-of-month storage objectives may be adjusted any time during the month as new forecasts or other information become available.</P>

              <P>(b) The January through June storage objective will be calculated using the following formula:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">LSOCM = TSM/J−(C1* AJ) + L + (C2* CDT)</FP>

                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">(2) TSM/J = current end-of-month May/June Lahontan Reservoir target storage.</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">(3) C1* AJ = forecasted Carson River inflow for the period from the end of the current month through May or June, with AJ being the Bureau's April through July runoff forecast for the Carson River at Fort Churchill and C1 being an adjustment coefficient.</FP>

                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">(5) C2* CDT = projected Carson Division demand from the end of the current month through May or June, with CDT being the total Carson Division diversion requirement (based on eligible acres anticipated to be irrigated times the appropriate duty times a 95 percent usage rate), and C2 being the estimate of the portion of the total diversion requirement to be delivered during this period.</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">(6) Values for TSM/J will vary with the Carson Division water demand as shown in § 418.22 and the Adjustments to Lahontan Reservoir Storage Targets table.

              </EXTRACT>
              

              <P>(e) The following procedure is intended to ensure that monthly storage objectives are not exceeded. It may be <PRTPAGE P="613"/>implemented only if the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(1) Diversions from the Truckee River are required to achieve the current month Lahontan Reservoir storage objective (LSOCM);</P>
              <P>(2) Truckee River runoff above Derby Dam is available for diversion to Lahontan Reservoir;</P>
              <P>(3) Sufficient Stampede Reservoir storage capacity is available.</P>
              <P>(f) The Bureau, in consultation with the Federal Water Master, the District, Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe will determine whether the calculated current month Truckee River diversion to Lahontan Reservoir (TRD-TDD-TCL) may be reduced during that month and the amount of reduction credit stored in Stampede Reservoir.</P>
              <P>(1) Reductions in diversions may begin in November and continue until the end of June.</P>
              <P>(2) Reductions in diversions to Lahontan Reservoir with credit storage in Stampede Reservoir may be implemented to the extent that:</P>
              <P>(i) The reduction is in lieu of a scheduled release from Stampede Reservoir for the purpose of supplementing flows to Pyramid Lake; and/or</P>
              <P>(ii) Water is captured in Stampede Reservoir that is scheduled to be passed through and diverted to the Truckee Canal.</P>
              <P>(3) The Fish and Wildlife Service must approve any proposal to reduce diversions to Lahontan Reservoir for Newlands Project credit purposes without a comparable reduction in release from Stampede Reservoir or any conversion of Stampede Reservoir project water to Newlands Project credit water.</P>
              <P>(4) The diversion to Lahontan Reservoir may be adjusted any time during the month as revised runoff forecasts become available. The accumulated credit will be added to current Lahontan Reservoir storage (ALRS) in calculating TRD. If the sum of accumulated credit and Lahontan Reservoir storage exceeds 295,000 acre-feet, credit will be reduced by the amount in excess of 295,000 acre-feet. Credit will also be reduced by the amount of precautionary drawdown or spills in that month. If the end-of-month storage in Lahontan Reservoir plus the accumulated credit in Stampede Reservoir at the end of June exceeds the end-of-month storage objective for Lahontan, the credit will be reduced by the amount exceeding the end-of-month storage objective.</P>
              <P>(5) Following consultation with the District, the Federal Water Master, and other interested parties as appropriate, the Bureau will release credit water as needed for Project purposes from July 1 through the end of the irrigation season in which the credit accrues with timing priority given to meeting current year Project irrigation demands.</P>
              <P>(6) Conveyance of credit water in the Truckee Canal must be in addition to regularly scheduled diversions for the Project and will be measured at the USGS gauge number 10351300 near Wadsworth.</P>
              <P>(7) Newlands credit water in Stampede Reservoir storage will be subject to spill and will not carry over to subsequent years. Newlands credit water in Stampede can be exchanged to other reservoirs and retain its priority. The credit must be reduced to the extent that Lahontan Reservoir storage plus accumulated credit at the end of the previous month exceeds the storage objectives for that month. If Newlands credit water is spilled, it may be diverted to Lahontan Reservoir subject to applicable storage targets.</P>
              <P>(i) The Bureau, in consultation with the District, the Federal Water Master, and other interested parties, may release Newlands Project credit water before July 1.</P>
              <P>(ii) If any Newlands credit water remains in Stampede Reservoir storage after the end of the current irrigation season in which it accumulated, it will convert to water for cui-ui recovery and will no longer be available for Newlands credit water.</P>
              <P>(iii) Newlands credit water stored in Stampede Reservoir will be available for use only on the Carson Division of the Newlands Project.</P>

              <P>(g) Subject to the provisions of § 418.20 (b), LSOCM may be adjusted as frequently as necessary when new information indicates the need and diversions from the Truckee River to the <PRTPAGE P="614"/>Truckee Canal must be adjusted daily or otherwise as frequently as necessary to meet the monthly storage objective.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Future adjustments to Lahontan Reservoir storage targets.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Lahontan Reservoir storage targets must be adjusted to accommodate changes in water demand in the Carson Division. Using the information reported by the District by March 1 of each year on eligible land expected to be irrigated and end-of-year data on eligible land actually irrigated (§ 418.9(b)), the Bureau will determine if the Lahontan Reservoir storage targets need to be changed. If no change is needed, the storage targets currently in effect will remain in effect.</P>
              <P>(1) Only the actual water demand reported for full water years (100 percent water supply) will be considered. Targets will not be changed based on water demand reported for less than full water years.</P>
              <P>(2) All changes in storage targets must start on October 1 of any year. If information provided by March 1 and other available information indicates that the Lahontan Reservoir storage targets must be changed, the new set of storage targets must be applied starting October 1 of the same year and remain in effect until changed according to this section.</P>
              <P>(b) All changes to storage targets will be made according to the table in this section. The table of storage targets has been developed to provide a consistent Project water supply over a range of demands.</P>
              <P>(1) A storage target adjustment must be made in increments of thousands of acre-feet for the change as indicated in the column listing Carson Division Demand and the complete set of monthly targets must be applied.</P>
              <P>(2) If the change in reported water demand is above or below the values in the table of storage targets, the adjustment to the storage targets can be calculated. The calculated adjustment is the number that would appear in the column Target Adjustment in the table. The calculated Target Adjustment is then added or subtracted to the base storage target for each month. Target Adjustments must be made in whole increments of 1,000 acre-feet and calculated values will be rounded to the nearest 1,000 acre-feet.</P>
              <P>(i) For demands greater than those set forth on the table, the formula for the Target Adjustment is: Target Adjustment = 0.00208 (Demand in acre-feet—271,000 acre-feet). For example, if water demand increased to 292,635 acre-feet per year, the Target Adjustment calculation would be = 0.00208 × (292,535−271,000). The result would be a Target Adjustment of 45 or 45,000 acre-feet. This would be added to the base monthly storage target values so, the January-May target would be 219,000 acre-feet, June would be 235,000 acre-feet, and so on.</P>
              <P>(ii) For demands less than those set forth on the table, the formula for the Target Adjustment is: Target Adjustment = 0.00174 (Demand in acre-feet—271,000 acre-feet). For example, if water demand decreased to 248,011 acre-feet per year, the Target Adjustment calculation would be = 0.00174 × (248,011−271,000). The result would be a Target Adjustment of −40 or −40,000 acre-feet. This would be subtracted from the base monthly storage target values so, the January-May target would be 134,000 acre-feet, June would be 150,000 acre-feet, and so on.</P>

              <P>Project water may be diverted directly to Rock Dam Ditch from the Truckee Canal only when diversions cannot be made from the outlet works of Lahontan Reservoir. Such diversions will require the prior written approval of the Bureau and be used in calculating Project diversions.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Precautionary drawdown and spills from Lahontan Reservoir.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Even though flood control is not a specifically authorized purpose of the Project, at the request of the District <PRTPAGE P="617"/>and in consultation with other interested parties and the approval of the Bureau, precautionary drawdown of Lahontan Reservoir may be made to limit potential flood damage along the Carson River. The Bureau will develop criteria for precautionary drawdown in consultation with the District and other interested parties.</P>
              <P>(1) The drawdown must be scheduled sufficiently in advance and at such a rate of flow in order to divert as much water as possible into the Project irrigation system for delivery to eligible land or storage in reregulating reservoirs for later use on eligible land.</P>
              <P>(2) During periods of precautionary drawdown, or when water is spilled from Lahontan Reservoir, Project diversions will be determined by comparison with other years' data and normalized by comparison of differences in climatological data. The Bureau will estimate the normalization in consultation with the District and other interested parties.</P>
              <P>(3) Spills from Lahontan Reservoir and precautionary drawdown of the reservoir to create space for storing flood waters from the Carson River Basin that are in excess of the normalized diversions will not be used in calculating Project diversions.</P>
              <P>(4) Water captured in Project facilities as a result of a precautionary drawdown or spill will not be counted as storage in Lahontan Reservoir for the purpose of calculating Truckee River Diversions. Such water will not be counted as diversions to the Project unless such water is beneficially applied as described in (a)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) Water from precautionary drawdowns or spills that is captured in Project facilities must be used to the maximum extent possible, and counted as deliveries to eligible lands in the year of the drawdown. If all the drawdown water captured in Project facilities cannot be used in the year of capture for delivery to eligible lands, then that water must be delivered to eligible lands in subsequent years to the maximum extent possible and counted against the water users' annual allocation.</P>
              <P>(b) If a precautionary drawdown in one month results in a failure to meet the Lahontan Reservoir storage objective for that month, the storage objective in subsequent months will be reduced by one-half of the difference between that month's storage objective and actual end-of-month storage. The Bureau is not liable for any damage or water shortage resulting from a precautionary drawdown.</P>

              <P>The District will release sufficient water to meet the vested water rights below Sagouspe Dam as specified in the <E T="03">Alpine</E> decree. These water rights are usually met by return flows. Releases for these water rights will in no case exceed the portion of 1,300 acre-feet per year not supplied by return flows. This water must be accounted for at the USGS gauge number 10312275 (the Carson River at Tarzyn Road near Fallon). Releases for this purpose will not be considered in determining Project diversions since the lands to which the water is being delivered are not part of the Project. (See § 418.15(b)(2)(ii).) Any flow past this gage in excess of the amount specified in this part will be absorbed by the District as an efficiency loss.</P>

Each agent must keep an accurate record of start and stop times for each delivery and the flow during delivery. This record will be given to the District for proper accounting of water delivered.</P>
              <P>(c) The program of using agents to operate individual headgates will be reviewed on a regular basis by the District and the Bureau. If it is found that problems such as higher than normal losses, water not accounted for, etc., have developed on an individual lateral, the program will be suspended and the system operated by District employees until the problems are resolved.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Valid headgate deliveries.</E> If water is delivered to ineligible land or in excess of the appropriate water duty then:</P>
              <P>(1) The District will stop the illegal delivery immediately;</P>
              <P>(2) The District will notify the Bureau of the particulars including the known or estimated location and amounts;</P>
              <P>(3) The amount will not be included as a valid headgate delivery for purposes of computing the Project efficiency and resultant incentive credit or debit to Lahontan storage; and</P>
              <P>(4) If the amount applies to a prior year, then the amount will be treated directly as a debit to Lahontan storage in the same manner as an efficiency debit.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">District efficiency.</E> To the extent that the actual District efficiency determined for an irrigation season is greater or less than the established target efficiency, as determined for the corresponding actual valid headgate deliveries, then the difference in efficiency, expressed as a quantity in acre-feet, may be added to or subtracted from the actual Lahontan Reservoir storage level before it is compared to the monthly storage objective as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Greater efficiency—Credited to the District as storage in Lahontan or subtracted from any accumulated debit, or two-thirds as storage in Lahontan for their discretionary use in accordance with state law.</P>
              <P>(2) Less efficient—Debited or added to Lahontan storage as an adjustment to the actual storage level.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Maximum Allowable Diversion (MAD).</E> The MAD must be computed each year to determine the amount of water required to enable the delivery of full entitlements at established Project efficiencies. Project diversions must not exceed the MAD. Within the operating year, the Bureau will notify the District in writing of any expected imminent violations of the MAD. The District will take prompt action to avoid such violations. The Bureau will exercise reasonable latitude from month to month to accommodate the District's efforts to avoid exceeding the MAD.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Maximum Efficiency Debit (MED).</E> If the MED exceeds 26,000 AF at the end of any given year, the District must prepare and submit to the Bureau for review and approval, a plan detailing the actions the District will take to either earn adequate incentive credits or to restrict deliveries to reduce the MED to less than 26,000 AF by the end of the next year. The plan must be submitted to the Bureau in writing before the date of March 1 immediately subsequent to the exceeding of the MED. If the District fails to submit an approvable plan, Project allocations will be reduced by an amount equal to the MED in excess of 26,000 plus 13,000 (one-half the allowable MED). Nominally this will mean a forced reduction of approximately five percent of entitlements. The Bureau will notify the District in writing of the specific allocation and method of derivation in sufficient time for the District to implement the allocation. Liabilities arising from shortages occasioned by operation of this provision must be the responsibility of the District or individual water users.</P>

              <P>Project water may be delivered to headgates only as provided in §§ 418.8 and 418.10. Water delivered to lands that are not entitled to be irrigated or not in accord with decreed water duties is difficult to quantify at best because it is not typically measured. Since it is not likely to be a part of the total actual headgate deliveries, yet is a part of the total deliveries to the Project, it will manifest itself directly as a lower efficiency. Thus, it will either reduce the District's incentive credit or increase the storage debit by the amount improperly diverted. All other users outside the Project are thereby held harmless but the District incurs the consequence. This approach should eliminate any potential disputes between the District and the Bureau regarding the quantity of water misappropriated.</P>

              <P>The established target efficiencies under this part are shown in the Expected Project Distribution System Efficiency table (§ 418.13 (a)(4)). The efficiency of the Project will vary with the amount of entitlement water actually delivered at the headgates. Since most of the distribution system losses such as evaporation and seepage do not change significantly with the amount of water delivered (i.e., these losses are principally a function of water surface area and the wetted perimeter of the canals), the Project efficiency requirement is higher as the percent of entitlement water actually delivered at the headgates increases. The actual efficiency is calculated each year after the close of the irrigation season based on actual measured amounts. The application of any adjustments to Lahontan Reservoir storage or Truckee River diversions resulting from the efficiency is always prospective.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Incentives for additional long term conservation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) As an incentive for the District to increase the efficiency of the delivery system beyond the expected efficiency of 65.7 percent (66.9 percent with full delivery) as shown in the Newlands Project Water Budget table, 1995 Example, the District will be allowed to store and use the Carson River portion of the saved water at its discretion, in accordance with Nevada State Law and this part.</P>
              <P>(1) If the District is able to exceed its expected efficiency, the District may store in Lahontan Reservoir two-thirds (2/3) of the additional water saved. (The remaining one-third (1/3) of the water saved will remain in the Truckee River through reduced diversions to Lahontan Reservoir). This water will be considered incentive water saved from the Carson River and will not be counted as storage in determining diversions from the Truckee River or computing the target storage levels for Lahontan Reservoir under this part.</P>
              <P>(2) For purposes of this part, incentive water is no longer considered Project water. The District may use the water for any purpose (e.g., wetlands, storage for recreation, power generation, shortage reduction) that is consistent with Nevada State Law and Federal Law. The water will be managed under the District's discretion and may be stored in Lahontan Reservoir until needed subject to the limitations in (a)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) The amount of incentive water stored in Lahontan Reservoir will be reduced under the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(i) There is a deficit created and remaining in Lahontan Reservoir from operations penalties in a prior year;</P>
              <P>(ii) The District releases the water from the reservoir for its designated use;</P>
              <P>(iii) During a spill of the reservoir, the amount of incentive water must be reduced by the amount of spill; and</P>
              <P>(iv) At the discretion of the District, incentive water may be used to offset the precautionary drawdown adjustment to the Lahontan storage objective.</P>

              <P>(v) At the end of each year, the amount of incentive water will be reduced by the incremental amount of evaporation which occurs as a result of the increased surface area of the reservoir due to the additional storage. The evaporation rate used will be either the net evaporation measured or the net historical average after precipitation is taken into account. The method of calculation will be agreed to <PRTPAGE P="621"/>by the District and the Bureau in advance of any storage credit.</P>
              <P>(b) An example of this concept is:
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
                <P>Incentive Operation—(1) At the end of the 1996 irrigation season, the Bureau and the District audit the District's water records for 1996. The District's water delivery records show that 194,703 acre-feet of water were delivered to farm headgates. On the basis of their irrigated acreage that year (59,075) the farm headgate entitlement would have been 216,337 acre-feet. On the basis of 90 percent deliveries for 59,075 acres (194,203 divided by 216,337 = 0.90) the established Project efficiency requirement was 65.1 percent.</P>
                <P>(2) On the basis of the established Project efficiency (66.1 percent), the Project diversion required to make the headgate deliveries would be expected to be 291,909 acre-feet (194,703 divided by 0.651 = 291,909). An examination of Project records reveals that the District only diverted 286,328 acre-feet which demonstrated actual Project efficiency was 68 percent and exceeded requirements of this part.</P>
                <P>(3) The 5,581 acre-feet of savings (291,909-286,328 = 5,581) constitutes the savings achieved through efficiency improvements and the District would then be credited two-thirds (3,721 acre-feet = 5,581 × 2/3) of this water (deemed to be Carson River water savings) as incentive water.</P>
                <P>(4) This incentive water may be stored in Lahontan Reservoir or otherwise used by the District in its discretion consistent with State and Federal Law (e.g., power generation, recreation storage, wildlife, drought protection, etc.).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Disincentives for lower efficiency.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If the District fails to meet the efficiencies established by this part, then, in effect, the District has borrowed from a subsequent year. The amount borrowed will be accounted for in the form of a deficit in Lahontan Reservoir storage. This deficit amount will be added to the actual Lahontan Reservoir storage quantity for the purpose of determining the Truckee River diversions to meet storage objectives as well as all other operating decisions.</P>
              <P>(b) The amount of the deficit will be cumulative from year to year but will not be allowed to exceed 26,000 acre-feet (the expected variance between the MAD and actual water use). This limit is expected to avoid increasing the severity of drought and yet still allow for variations in efficiency over time due to weather and other factors. This approach should allow the District to plan its operation to correct for any deficiencies.</P>
              <P>(c) The deficit can be reduced by crediting incentive water earned by the District or reducing the percentage of headgate entitlement delivered either through a natural drought or by the District and its water users administratively limiting deliveries while maintaining an efficiency greater than or equal to the target efficiency.</P>
              <P>(d) If there is a natural drought and the shortage to the headgates is equal to or greater than the deficit, then the deficit is reduced to zero. If the shortage to headgates is less than the deficit then the deficit is reduced by an amount equal to the headgate shortage. During a natural drought, if the percentage of maximum headgate entitlement delivered is 75 percent or more then the District will be subject to the target efficiencies and resultant deficits or credits.</P>
              <P>(e) If the District has a deficit in Lahontan Reservoir and earns incentive water, the incentive water must be used to eliminate the deficit before it can be used for any other purpose. The deficit must be credited on a 1 to 1 basis (i.e., actual efficiency savings rather than <FR>1/3</FR>-<FR>2/3</FR> for incentive water).</P>
              <P>(f) An example of the penalty concept is:
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
                <P>Penalty—In 1996 the District delivers 90 percent of the maximum headgate entitlement or 194,703 acre-feet 216,337 × .90) but actually diverts 308,000 acre-feet. The efficiency of the Project is 63.2 percent (194,703 divided by 308,000). Since the established efficiency of 65.1 percent would have required a diversion of only 299,083 acre-feet (194,703 divided by .651) the District has operated the system with 8,917 acre-feet of excess losses. Therefore, 8,917 acre-feet was borrowed and must be added to the actual storage quantities of Lahontan Reservoir for calculating target storage levels and Truckee River diversions.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 418.38</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Maximum allowable diversion.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The MAD established in this part is based on the premise that the Project should be operated to ensure that it is capable of delivering to the headgate of each water right holder the full water entitlement for irrigable eligible acres and includes distribution <PRTPAGE P="622"/>system losses. The MAD will be established (and is likely to vary) each year. The annual MAD will be calculated each year based on the actual acreage to be irrigated that year.</P>
              <P>(b) Historically, actual deliveries at farm headgates have been approximately 90 percent of entitlements. This practice is expected to continue but the percentage is expected to change. This variance between headgate deliveries and headgate entitlements will be calculated annually under this part and is allowed to be diverted if needed and thereby provides an assurance that full headgate deliveries can be made. The expected diversion and associated efficiency target for the examples shown in the Newlands Project Water Budget table would be: 285,243 AF and 65.1 percent in 1996 and beyond. These are well below the MAD limits; however, the District may divert up to the MAD if it is needed to meet valid headgate entitlements.</P>

            <P>(iii) If the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are met, then Reclamation will amend the contract, and the district becomes subject to the discretionary provisions from the date the district's request was submitted to Reclamation;</P>
            <P>(iv) If the district only wants to amend its contracts to become subject to the discretionary provisions, the amendments need only be to the extent required to conform to the discretionary provisions; or</P>
            <P>(3) The district amends its contract after October 12, 1982, to provide the district with additional or supplemental benefits. The amendment must also include the district's conformance to the discretionary provisions:</P>
            <P>(i) The discretionary provisions apply as of the date that Reclamation executes the contract amendment;</P>
            <P>(ii) For purposes of application of the acreage limitation provisions Reclamation considers a contract amendment as providing additional or supplemental benefits if that amendment:</P>
            <P>(A) Requires the United States to expend significant funds;</P>
            <P>(B) Requires the United States to commit significant additional water supplies; or</P>
            <P>(C) Substantially modifies contract payments due the United States; and</P>
            <P>(iii) For purposes of application of the acreage limitation provisions Reclamation does not consider the following contract actions as providing additional or supplemental benefits:</P>
            <P>(A) The construction of facilities for conveyance of irrigation water for which districts contracted on or before October 12, 1982;</P>

            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Both districts have contracts with the United States;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The rate paid by the district receiving the transferred water:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Is the higher of the applicable water rate for either district;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Does not result in any increased operating losses to the United States above those that would have existed in the absence of the transfer; and</P>

            <P>(G) Contract actions pursuant to the Reclamation Safety of Dams Act of 1978, as amended (43 U.S.C. 506); or</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Districts that are subject to prior law.</E> Any district which had a contract in force on October 12, 1982, that required landholders to comply with the ownership limitations of Federal reclamation law remains subject to prior law unless and until the district:</P>
            <P>(1) Enters into a new or renewed contract requiring it to conform to the discretionary provisions, as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section;</P>

            <P>(2) Prior law, then the subcontracting district can amend its subcontract to conform to the discretionary provisions without subjecting the master contractor or any other subcontractor of the master contractor to the discretionary provisions. If a subcontract that does not include the United States as a party is amended to conform to the discretionary provisions, or the subcontract is a new or renewed contract executed after October 12, 1982, then the amended, new, or renewed subcontract must include the United States as a party.</P>

            <P>(ii) The election shall be binding on the elector and his or her landholding, but will not be binding on subsequent landholders of that land;</P>
            <P>(iii) An irrevocable election by a legal entity is binding only upon that entity and not on the part owners of that entity;</P>
            <P>(iv) An irrevocable election by a part owner of a legal entity binds only the part owner making the election and not the entity or other part owners of the entity; and</P>

            <P>(2) A landholder makes an irrevocable election by completing a Reclamation issued irrevocable election form:</P>
            <P>(i) The elector's original irrevocable election form must be filed by the district with Reclamation and must be accompanied by a completed certification form, as specified in § 426.18;</P>
            <P>(ii) The elector must file copies of the irrevocable election and certification forms concurrently with each district where the elector holds nonexempt land;</P>
            <P>(iii) Reclamation will prepare a letter advising the recipient of the approval or disapproval of the election. Reclamation will base approval upon whether the election form and the accompanying certification form(s) indicate the elector's satisfaction of the various requirements of Federal reclamation law and these regulations;</P>
            <P>(iv) If the election is approved, the letter of approval, with a copy of the irrevocable election form and the original certification form(s), will be sent by Reclamation to each district where the elector holds land;</P>
            <P>(v) The district(s) shall retain the forms; and</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Prohibition on increasing acreage limitation entitlements.</E> Except as specifically provided in these rules, a landholder cannot increase acreage limitation entitlements or eligibility by acquiring or holding a beneficial interest in a legal entity. Similarly, the acreage limitation status of an individual or legal entity that holds or has acquired a beneficial interest in another legal entity will not be permitted to enlarge the latter legal entity's acreage limitation entitlements or eligibility.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Attribution of owned land.</E> For purposes of determining acreage to be counted against acreage limitation entitlements, acreage will be attributed to all:</P>
            <P>(1) Direct landowners in proportion to the direct beneficial interest the landowners own in the land; and</P>
            <P>(2) Indirect landowners in proportion to the indirect beneficial interest they own in the land.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Attribution of leased land.</E> Leased land will be attributed to the direct and indirect landowners as well as to the direct and indirect lessees in the same manner as described in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Attribution of land held through intermediate entities.</E> If land is held by a direct landholder and a series of indirect landholders, Reclamation will attribute that land to the acreage limitation entitlements of the direct landholder and each indirect landholder in proportion to each landholder's beneficial interest in the entity that directly holds the land.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Leasebacks.</E> Any land a landholder directly or indirectly owns and that is directly or indirectly leased back will only count once against that particular landholder's nonfull-cost entitlement.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Effect on an entity of attribution to part owners.</E> For purposes of determining eligibility, the entire landholding will be attributed to all the direct and indirect landholders. If the interests in a legal entity are:</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Except as provided in §§ 426.12 and 426.14, all nonexempt land directly or indirectly owned by a landholder counts against that landholder's ownership entitlement. In addition, land owned or controlled by a public entity that is leased to another party counts against the lessee's ownership entitlement, as specified in § 426.10.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Qualified recipient ownership entitlement.</E> A qualified recipient is entitled to receive irrigation water on a maximum of 960 acres of owned nonexempt land, or the Class 1 equivalent thereof. This entitlement applies on a westwide basis.</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Prior law recipient ownership entitlement.</E> (1) Ownership entitlements for prior law recipients are determined by whether the recipient is one individual or a married couple, and for entities by the type of entity, as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) An individual subject to prior law is entitled to receive irrigation water on a maximum of 160 acres of owned nonexempt land;</P>
            <P>(ii) Married couples who hold equal interests are entitled to receive irrigation water on a maximum of 320 acres of jointly owned nonexempt land;</P>

            <P>(iii) Surviving spouses until remarriage are entitled to receive irrigation <PRTPAGE P="656"/>water on that land owned jointly in marriage up to a maximum of 320 acres of owned nonexempt land. If any of that land should be sold, the applicable ownership entitlement would be reduced accordingly, but not to less than 160 acres of owned nonexempt land;</P>
            <P>(iv) Children are each entitled to receive irrigation water on a maximum of 160 acres of owned nonexempt land, regardless of whether they are independent or dependent;</P>
            <P>(v) Joint tenancies and tenancies-in-common subject to prior law are entitled to receive irrigation water on a maximum of 160 acres of owned nonexempt land per tenant, provided each tenant holds an equal interest in the tenancy;</P>
            <P>(vi) Partnerships subject to prior law are entitled to receive irrigation water on a maximum of 160 acres of owned nonexempt land per partner if the partners have separable and equal interests in the partnership and the right to alienate that interest. Partnerships where each partner does not have a separable interest and the right to alienate that interest are entitled to receive irrigation water on a maximum of 160 acres of nonexempt land owned by the partnership; and</P>
            <P>(vii) All corporations subject to prior law are entitled to receive irrigation water on a maximum of 160 acres of owned nonexempt land.</P>
            <P>(2) Prior law recipient ownership entitlements specified in this section apply on a westwide basis unless the land was acquired by the current owner on or before December 6, 1979. For land acquired by the current owner on or before that date, prior law ownership entitlements apply on a district-by-district basis.</P>
            <P>(3) For those entities where an equal interest held by the part owners would result in a 160-acre per part owner entitlement for the entity, if the part owners interests are not equal then the entitlement of the entity will be determined by the relative interest held in the entity by each part owner.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Conditions that a lease must meet.</E> Districts can make irrigation water available to leased land only if the lease meets the following requirements. Land that is leased under a lease instrument that does not meet the following requirements will be ineligible to receive irrigation water until the lease agreement is terminated or modified to satisfy these requirements.</P>
            <P>(1) The lease is in writing;</P>
            <P>(2) The lease includes the effective date and term of the lease, the length of which must be:</P>
            <P>(i) 10 years or less, including any exercisable options; however, for perennial crops with an average life longer than 10 years, the term may be equal to the average life of the crop as determined by Reclamation, and</P>
            <P>(ii) In no case may the term of a lease exceed 25 years, including any exercisable options;</P>
            <P>(3) The lease includes a legal description, that is at least as detailed as what is required on the standard certification and reporting forms, of the land subject to the lease;</P>
            <P>(4) Signatures of all parties to the lease are included;</P>
            <P>(5) The lease includes the date(s) or conditions when lease payments are due and the amounts or the method of computing the payments due;</P>
            <P>(6) The lease is available for Reclamation's inspection and Reclamation reviews and approves all leases for terms longer than 10 years; and</P>
            <P>(7) If either the lessor or the lessee is subject to the discretionary provisions, the lease provides for agreed upon payments that reflect the reasonable value of the irrigation water to the productivity of the land; except</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Nonfull-cost entitlements.</E> (1) The nonfull-cost entitlement for qualified recipients is 960 acres, or the Class 1 equivalent thereof.</P>

            <P>(2) The nonfull-cost entitlement for limited recipients that received irrigation water on or before October 1, 1981, is 320 acres or the Class 1 equivalent thereof. The nonfull-cost entitlement for limited recipients that did not receive irrigation water on or prior to October 1, 1981, is zero.<PRTPAGE P="657"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) The nonfull-cost entitlement for prior law recipients is equal to the recipient's maximum ownership entitlement as set forth in § 426.5(d). However, for the purpose of computing the acreage subject to full cost, all owned and leased irrigation land westwide must be included in the computation.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Application of the nonfull-cost and full-cost rates.</E> (1) A landholder may irrigate at the nonfull-cost rate directly and indirectly held acreage equal to his or her nonfull-cost entitlement.</P>
            <P>(2) If a landholding exceeds the landholder's nonfull-cost entitlement, the landholder must pay the appropriate full-cost rate for irrigation water delivered to acreage that equals the amount of leased land that exceeds that entitlement.</P>
            <P>(3) In the case of limited recipients, a landholder does not have to lease land to exceed a nonfull-cost entitlement, since the nonfull-cost entitlement is less than the ownership entitlement. Therefore, limited recipients must pay the appropriate full-cost rate for irrigation water delivered to any acreage that exceeds their nonfull-cost entitlement.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Types of lands that count against the nonfull-cost entitlement.</E> (1) All directly and indirectly owned irrigation land and irrigation land directly or indirectly leased for any period of time during 1-water year counts towards a landholder's nonfull-cost entitlement, except:</P>
            <P>(i) Involuntarily acquired land, as provided in §§ 426.12 and 426.14; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Land that is leased for incidental grazing or similar purposes during periods when the land is not receiving irrigation water.</P>
            <P>(2) Reclamation's process for determining if a nonfull-cost entitlement has been exceeded is as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) All land counted toward a landholder's nonfull-cost entitlement will be counted on a cumulative basis during any 1-water year;</P>
            <P>(ii) Once a landholder's nonfull-cost entitlement is met in a given water year, any additional eligible land may be irrigated only at the full-cost rate; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Irrigation land will be counted towards nonfull-cost entitlements on a westwide basis, even for prior law recipients, regardless of the date of acquisition.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Selection of nonfull-cost land.</E> (1) A landholder that has exceeded his or her nonfull-cost entitlement may select in each water year, from his or her directly held irrigation land, the land that can be irrigated at a nonfull-cost rate and the land that can be irrigated only at the full-cost rate. Selections for full-cost or nonfull-cost land may include:</P>
            <P>(i) Leased land;</P>
            <P>(ii) Nonexcess owned land;</P>
            <P>(iii) Land under recordable contract, unless that land is already subject to application of the full-cost rate under an extended recordable contract; or</P>
            <P>(iv) A combination of all three.</P>
            <P>(2) Once a landholder has received irrigation water on a given land parcel during a water year, the selection of that parcel as full cost or nonfull-cost is binding until the landholder has completed receiving irrigation water westwide for that water year.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Applicability of a full-cost selection to an owner or lessee.</E> If a landowner or lessee should select land as subject to full-cost pricing, then that land can receive irrigation water only at the full-cost rate, regardless of eligibility of the other party to receive the irrigation water at the nonfull-cost rate.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Subleased land.</E> Land that is subleased (the lessee transfers possession of the land to a sublessee) will be attributed to the landholding of the sublessee and not to the lessee.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Calculating full-cost charges.</E> Reclamation will calculate a district's full-cost charge using accepted accounting procedures and under the following conditions.</P>
            <P>(1) The full-cost charge does not recover interest retroactively before October 12, 1982. But, interest on the unpaid balance does accrue from October 12, 1982, where the unpaid balance equals the irrigation allocated construction costs for facilities in service plus cumulative federally funded O&amp;M deficits, less payments.</P>
            <P>(2) The full-cost charge will be determined:</P>

            <P>(i) As of October 12, 1982, for contracts entered into before that date regardless of amendments to conform to the discretionary provisions; and<PRTPAGE P="658"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) At the time of contract execution for new and renewed contracts entered into on or after October 12, 1982.</P>
            <P>(3) For repayment contracts, the full-cost charge will fix equal annual payments over the amortization period. For water service contracts, the full-cost charge will fix equal payments per acre-foot of projected water deliveries over the amortization period.</P>
            <P>(4) If there are additional construction expenditures, or if the cost allocated to irrigation changes, then a new full-cost charge will be determined.</P>
            <P>(5) Reclamation will notify the respective districts of changes in the full-cost charge at the time the district is notified of other payments due the United States.</P>
            <P>(6) In determining full-cost charges, the following factors will be considered:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Amortization period.</E> The amortization period for calculating the full-cost charge is the remaining balance of:</P>
            <P>(A) For contracts entered into before October 12, 1982, the contract repayment period as of October 12, 1982;</P>
            <P>(B) For contracts entered into on or after October 12, 1982, the contract repayment period;</P>
            <P>(C) For water service contracts, the period from October 12, 1982, or the execution date of the contract, whichever is later, to the anticipated date of project repayment; and</P>
            <P>(D) In cases where water services rates are designed to completely repay applicable Federal expenditures in a specific time period, that time period may be used as the amortization period for full-cost calculations related to these expenditures; but, in no case will the amortization period exceed the project payback period authorized by the Congress;</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Construction costs.</E> For determining full cost, construction costs properly allocable to irrigation are those Federal project costs for facilities in service that have been assigned to irrigation within the overall allocation of total project construction costs. Total project construction costs include all direct expenditures necessary to install or implement a project, such as:</P>
            <P>(A) Planning;</P>
            <P>(B) Design;</P>
            <P>(C) Land;</P>
            <P>(D) Rights-of-way;</P>
            <P>(E) Water-rights acquisitions;</P>
            <P>(F) Construction expenditures;</P>
            <P>(G) Interest during construction; and</P>
            <P>(H) When appropriate, transfer costs associated with services provided from other projects;</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Facilities in service.</E> Facilities in service are those facilities that are in operation and providing irrigation services;</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) deficits funded.</E> O&amp;M deficits funded are the annual O&amp;M costs including project-use pumping power allocated to irrigation that have been federally funded and that have not been paid by the district;</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Payments received.</E> In calculating the payments that have been received, all receipts and credits applied to repay or reduce allocated irrigation construction costs in accordance with Federal reclamation law, policy, and applicable contract provisions will be considered. These may include:</P>
            <P>(A) Direct repayment contract revenues;</P>
            <P>(B) Net water service contract income;</P>
            <P>(C) Contributions;</P>
            <P>(D) Ad valorem taxes; and</P>
            <P>(E) Other miscellaneous revenues and credits excluding power and municipal and industrial (M&amp;I) revenues;</P>
            <P>(vi) <E T="03">Interest rates.</E> Interest rates to be used in calculating full-cost charges will be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury as follows:</P>
            <P>(A) For irrigation water delivered to qualified recipients, limited recipients receiving water on or before October 1, 1981, and extended recordable contract land owned by prior law recipients, the interest rate for expenditures made on or before October 12, 1982, will be the greater of 7.5 percent per annum or the weighted average yield of all interest-bearing marketable issues sold by the Treasury during the fiscal year when the expenditures were made by the United States. The interest rate for expenditures made after October 12, 1982, will be the arithmetic average of:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The computed average interest rate payable by the Treasury upon its outstanding marketable public obligations that are neither due nor callable <PRTPAGE P="659"/>for redemption for 15 years from the date of issuance at the beginning of the fiscal year when the expenditures are made; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The weighted average yield on all interest-bearing marketable issues sold by the Treasury during the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year the expenditures are made;</P>
            <P>(B) For irrigation water delivered to limited recipients not receiving irrigation water on or before October 1, 1981, and prior law recipients, except for land owned subject to extended recordable contract, the interest rate will be determined as of the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year the expenditures are made, except that the interest rate for expenditures made before October 12, 1982, will be determined as of October 12, 1982. The interest rate will be based on the arithmetic average of:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The computed average interest rate payable by the Treasury upon its outstanding marketable public obligations that are neither due nor callable for redemption for 15 years from the date of issuance; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The weighted average yield on all interest-bearing marketable issues sold by the Treasury.</P>
            <P>(C) Landholders who were prior law recipients and become subject to the discretionary provisions after April 12, 1987, are eligible for the full-cost interest rate specified in paragraph (h)(6)(vi)(A) of this section, unless they are limited recipients that did not receive irrigation water on or before October 1, 1981, in that case they remain subject to the full-cost interest rate specified in paragraph (h)(6)(vi)(B) of this section.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Direct and proportional charges for full-cost water.</E> In situations where water delivery charges are contractually or customarily levied on a per-acre basis, full-cost assessments will be made on a per-acre basis. In situations where water delivery charges are contractually or customarily levied on a per acre-foot basis, one of the following methods must be used to make full-cost assessments:</P>
            <P>(1) Assessments will be based on the actual amounts of water used in situations where measuring devices are in use, to the satisfaction of Reclamation, to reasonably determine the amounts of irrigation water being delivered to full-cost and nonfull-cost land; or</P>
            <P>(2) In situations where, as determined by Reclamation, measuring devices are not a reliable method for determining the amounts of water being delivered to full-cost and nonfull-cost land, then water charges must be based on the assumption that equal amounts of water per acre are being delivered to both types of land during periods when both types of land are actually being irrigated.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Disposition of revenues obtained through full-cost water pricing</E>—(1) <E T="03">Legal deliveries.</E> If irrigation water has been delivered in compliance with Federal reclamation law and these regulations, then:</P>
            <P>(i) That portion of the full-cost rate that would have been collected if the land had not been subject to full cost will be credited to the annual payments due under the district's contractual obligation;</P>
            <P>(ii) Any O&amp;M revenues collected over and above those required under the district's contract will be credited to the project O&amp;M account; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The remaining full-cost revenues will be credited to the Reclamation fund unless otherwise provided by law, with any capital component of the full-cost rate credited to project repayment, if applicable.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Illegal deliveries.</E> Revenues resulting from the assessment of compensation charges for illegal deliveries of irrigation water will be deposited into the Reclamation fund in their entirety, and will not be credited toward any contractual obligation, or O&amp;M or repayment account of the district or project. For purposes of these regulations only, this does not include revenues from any charges that may be assessed by the district to cover district operation, maintenance, and administrative expenses.</P>

              <E T="03">Grantor revocable trust</E> means a trust that holds irrigable land or irrigation land that may be revoked at the discretion of the grantor(s), or terminated by the terms of the trust, and revocation or termination results in title to the <PRTPAGE P="660"/>land held in trust reverting either directly or indirectly to the grantor(s).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Irrevocable trust</E> means a trust that holds irrigable land or irrigation land and does not allow any individual, including the grantor or beneficiaries, the discretion to decide when or under what conditions the trust terminates, and that upon termination the title to the land held in trust transfers either directly or indirectly to a person(s) or entity(ies) other than the grantor(s).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Otherwise revocable trust</E> means a trust that holds irrigable land or irrigation land and that may be revoked at the discretion of the grantor(s) or other parties, or terminated by the terms of the trust, and revocation or termination results in the title to the land held in trust transferring either directly or indirectly to a person(s) or entity(ies) other than the grantor(s).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Attribution of land held by a trust.</E> The acreage limitation entitlements of a trust are only limited by the acreage limitation entitlements of the trustees, grantors, or beneficiaries to whom land held by the trust must be attributed as provided for in § 426.4. The entitlements of the parties to whom trusted land is attributed are determined according to §§ 426.5, 426.6, and 426.8, and other applicable provisions of Federal reclamation law and these regulations. Reclamation attributes nonexempt land held by a trust to the following parties:</P>
            <P>(1) For land held in an <E T="03">irrevocable trust,</E> the land is attributed to the beneficiaries in proportion to their beneficial interest in the trust. However, this attribution is only made if the criteria listed in paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section are met. If the trust fails to meet any portion of these criteria, Reclamation attributes the land held in the trust to the trustee.</P>
            <P>(i) The trust is in written form and approved by Reclamation; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The beneficiaries of the trust and the beneficiaries' respective interests are identified within the trust document.</P>
            <P>(2) For land held in a <E T="03">grantor revocable trust,</E> the land is attributed to the grantor according to the grantor's acreage limitation status and the land's eligibility immediately prior to its transfer to the trust. However, this attribution is only made if the criteria listed in paragraphs (b)(2) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section are met. If the trust fails to meet any portion of these criteria, the land held in trust will be ineligible to receive irrigation water until all of the criteria are met. The only exception is if the trust's and grantor's standard certification or reporting forms indicate that the land held by the trust has been attributed to the trust's grantor(s).</P>
            <P>(i) The trust meets the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;</P>
            <P>(ii) The grantor(s) of all land held by the trust is (are) identified within the trust document;</P>
            <P>(iii) The conditions under which the trust may be revoked or terminated are identified within the trust document; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The recipient(s) of the trust land upon revocation or termination is (are) identified within the trust document.</P>
            <P>(3) For land held in an <E T="03">otherwise revocable trust,</E> the land is attributed to the beneficiaries in proportion to their beneficial interests in the trust. However, this attribution is only made if the trust meets the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the trust meets the additional criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(i) If Reclamation cannot determine who will hold the land in trust upon termination or revocation of the trust, or who is the grantor(s) of the land held in trust, then irrigation water will not be made available to the land held in trust until the trust satisfies the additional criteria listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the trust fails to meet the criteria listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but does meet the additional criteria listed in paragraphs (b)(2) (ii) through (iv) of this section, then the land is attributed to the trustee.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Class beneficiaries.</E> For purposes of identifying beneficiaries, a class of beneficiaries specified within the trust document will be acceptable, as long as the trust document is specific as to the beneficial interest to which each member of the class will be entitled and the members of the class are identifiable.</P>

            <P>(1) Attribution during any given water year will be provided only to <PRTPAGE P="661"/>class beneficiaries that are natural persons and established legal entities. For purposes of administering the acreage limitation provisions, attribution to unborn or deceased persons, or entities not yet established, will not be allowed.</P>
            <P>(2) If a trust includes a class of beneficiaries to which land subject to the acreage limitation provisions will be attributed, the trustee and each of the beneficiaries will be required to submit standard certification or reporting forms annually. The submittal of verification forms, as provided in § 426.18(l), will not be applicable to such trusts.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Application of full-cost rate to land held by grantor revocable trusts.</E> If a grantor revocable trust that meets the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is revised by the grantor in a manner that precludes attribution of the land held in trust to the grantor:</P>
            <P>(1) Before April 20, 1988, Reclamation will not assess full-cost rates for the land held by the revised trust for the period before it was revised; or</P>
            <P>(2) On or after April 20, 1988, Reclamation will charge the full-cost rate for irrigation water delivered to any land held by the trust that exceeds the grantor's nonfull-cost entitlement, commencing December 23, 1987, until the trust agreement is revised to make it an irrevocable trust or an otherwise revocable trust.</P>

            <P>(3) If a nonresident alien or foreign entity meets the criteria listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and only holds eligible land subject to the acreage limitation provisions indirectly, then the nonresident alien may be treated as a United States citizen or the foreign entity may be treated as a domestic entity for purposes of application of the acreage limitation provisions for the land held indirectly.</P>

            <P>(i) The nonresident alien or foreign entity may submit an irrevocable election to conform to the discretionary provisions as provided for in § 426.3(f). Conformance to the discretionary provisions through the submittal of a certification form will not be allowed as specified in § 426.3(f)(3).<PRTPAGE P="662"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) Upon Reclamation's approval of the irrevocable election, a nonresident alien will be treated as having the ownership entitlement of a qualified recipient as described in § 426.5(b), for any land held indirectly. A foreign entity will be treated as a qualified recipient or a limited recipient as determined by the number of natural persons who are beneficiaries of the entity as specified by the definitions found in § 426.2, and the subsequent entitlement as provided in § 426.5(b) or (c), for any land held indirectly. The applicable nonfull-cost entitlements will be determined as described in § 426.6(b).</P>
            <P>(iii) Reclamation will not approve irrevocable elections submitted by a nonresident alien or a foreign entity that holds any land directly in any prior law district.</P>
            <P>(iv) Reclamation will not approve irrevocable elections submitted by a nonresident alien that is not a citizen of or foreign entity that has not been established in a country that has a treaty or international membership as specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Acreage limitation status of religious or charitable organizations that are subject to the discretionary provisions.</E> (1) Religious or charitable organizations or their subdivisions that are subject to the discretionary provisions have qualified recipient status, if:</P>
            <P>(i) The organization's or subdivision's agricultural produce and proceeds from the sales of such produce are used only for charitable purposes;</P>

            <SUBJECT>Class 1 equivalency.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General application.</E> Class 1 equivalency determinations will establish, on a district-wide basis, the acreage of land with lower productive potential (Classes 2, 3, and 4) that would be equivalent in productive potential to the most suitable land (Class 1) in the local agricultural economic setting.</P>
            <P>(1) Reclamation establishes equivalency factors by comparing the weighted average farm size required to produce a given level of income on each of the lower classes of land with the farm size required to produce that income level on Class 1 land.</P>
            <P>(2) For equivalency purposes, Reclamation will classify all irrigable land as Class 1, 2, or 3; no other classifications are permissible for irrigable land. Class 4 and special-use land classes will be allocated to one of these three classes on a case-by-case basis.</P>
            <P>(3) Once the Class 1 equivalency determinations have been made, individual landowners with land classified as 2 or 3 for equivalency purposes will have the right to adjust their actual landholding acreage to its Class 1 equivalent acreage.</P>
            <P>(4) In a district subject to prior law, Class 1 equivalency can be applied only to landholders who are subject to the discretionary provisions.</P>
            <P>(5) Requests for equivalency determinations will be scheduled by region, with the regional director of each Reclamation region having responsibility for such scheduling. Generally, requests will be honored on a first-come-first-served basis. However, if requests exceed the region's ability to fulfill them expeditiously, priority will be given on the basis of greatest immediate need.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Who may request a Class 1 equivalency determination?</E> Only districts may request Class 1 equivalency determinations. Upon the request of any district subject to the acreage limitation provisions, Reclamation will make a Class 1 equivalency determination for that district. Equivalency determinations can be made only on a district-wide basis.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Definition of Class 1 land.</E> Class 1 land is defined and will be classified as that irrigable land within a particular agricultural economic setting that:</P>
            <P>(i) Most completely meets the various parameters and specifications established by Reclamation for irrigable land classes;</P>
            <P>(ii) Has the relatively highest level of suitability for continuous, successful irrigation farming; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Is estimated to have the highest relative productive potential measured in terms of net income per acre (reflecting both productivity and costs of production). The equivalency analysis will establish the acreage of each of the lower classes of land which is equal in productive potential (measured in terms of net farm income) to 1 acre of Class 1 land.</P>

            <P>(2) All land that Reclamation has not classified, or for which Reclamation has not yet performed the necessary economic studies, will be considered <PRTPAGE P="664"/>Class 1 land for the purposes of determining entitlements under these rules until such time as the necessary classifications or studies have been completed.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Determination of land classes.</E> The extent and location of Class 1 land and land in lower land classes in a district have been, or will be, determined by Reclamation.</P>
            <P>(1) Reclamation will take into account the influence of economic and physical factors upon the productive potential of the land lying within the district. These factors will include, but are not limited to the following and their effect on agricultural practices:</P>
            <P>(i) The physical and chemical characteristics of the soil;</P>
            <P>(ii) Topography;</P>
            <P>(iii) Drainage status;</P>
            <P>(iv) Costs of production;</P>

            <P>(vi) Water quality and adequacy;</P>
            <P>(vii) Elevation;</P>
            <P>(viii) Crop adaptability; and</P>
            <P>(ix) Length of growing season.</P>
            <P>(2) Acceptable levels of detail for land classification studies to be utilized in making Class 1 equivalency determinations for a given district will be evaluated on the basis of the physical and agricultural economic characteristics of the area. For districts where the sole purpose of the land classification study is for a Class 1 equivalency determination, the level of detail of the land classification to be made will never be greater than that required to make a Class 1 equivalency determination.</P>
            <P>(3) Reclamation will pay for at least a portion of the costs associated with the land classification study. The amount to be paid by Reclamation will be determined as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) Reclamation has provided basic land classification data as part of the project development process since 1924. Accordingly, if Reclamation determines that acceptable land classification data are not available for making requested Class 1 equivalency determinations and if the project was authorized for construction since 1924, such data will be made available at Reclamation's expense; or</P>
            <P>(ii) For each district located in projects authorized for construction prior to 1924, Reclamation will pay 50 percent of the costs and the district must pay 50 percent of the costs of new land classification studies required to make accurate Class 1 equivalency determinations.</P>
            <P>(4) When basic land classification data are available for a district, but the district does not agree with the accuracy or asserts that the data have become outdated, the district may request, and Reclamation may perform, a reclassification under the authority contained in the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 (43 U.S.C. 485), with the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(i) The requesting district will pay 50 percent of the costs of performing such reclassifications and 100 percent of the costs of all other studies involved in the equivalency process; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The results of such reclassifications will be binding upon the requesting district and Reclamation.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Additional studies required for Class 1 equivalency determinations.</E> Economic studies related to Class 1 equivalency determinations will measure net farm income by land classes within the district.</P>
            <P>(1) Net farm income will be determined by considering the disposable income accruing to the farm operator's labor, management, and equity from the sale of farm crops and livestock produced on irrigated land, after all fixed and variable costs of production, including costs of irrigation service, are accounted for.</P>
            <P>(2) Net farm income will be the measure of productivity to establish equivalency factors reflecting the acreage of each of the lower classes of land which is equal in productive potential to 1 acre of Class 1 land.</P>
            <P>(3) The cost of performing new or additional economic studies and computations inherent in the equivalency process will be the responsibility of the requesting district.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Use of Class 1 equivalency with the acreage limitation provisions.</E> Class 1 land and land in lower classes will be identified on a district basis by Reclamation using a standard approach in which the land classification for the entire district is considered. Equivalency factors will then be computed for the district and applied to specific <PRTPAGE P="665"/>tracts within individual landholdings. If adequate land classification data are not available, they will be developed as specified in paragraph (d) of this section using standard procedures established by Reclamation.</P>
            <P>(1) For purposes of ownership entitlement, Class 1 equivalency will not be applied until a final determination has been made by Reclamation concerning the district's request for equivalency.</P>
            <P>(i) Reclamation will protect excess landowners' property interests by ensuring that equivalency determinations are completed in advance of maturity dates on recordable contracts, provided the district requests an equivalency determination at least 6 months prior to the maturity of the recordable contract, the district fulfills its obligations under this section, and the district notifies Reclamation 6 months in advance of the maturity dates for the need for an expedited review.</P>
            <P>(ii) Once the determination has been made, owners of land subject to recordable contracts may withdraw land from such recordable contracts in order to reach their ownership entitlement in Class 1 equivalent acreage.</P>
            <P>(iii) The requirement that land under recordable contract be sold at a price approved by Reclamation does not apply to land which is withdrawn from a recordable contract and included as part of a landowner's nonexcess landholding as a result of an equivalency determination.</P>
            <P>(iv) In cases of equivalency determination disputes, Reclamation will not undertake the sale of the reasonable increment of the excess land under a matured recordable contract which could be affected by a reclassification, provided the dispute is determined by Reclamation not to be an attempt to thwart the sale of excess land.</P>
            <P>(2) For purposes of nonfull-cost entitlement, Class 1 equivalency will not be applied until a final determination has been made by Reclamation on a district's request for equivalency.</P>
            <P>(i) During the time when such determinations are pending, the full-cost rate will be assessed based on a landholder's nonfull-cost entitlement as determined in the absence of Class 1 equivalency.</P>
            <P>(ii) Following Reclamation's final determination, Reclamation will reimburse the district for any full-cost charges that would not have been assessed had Class 1 equivalency been in place from the date of the district's request. Districts will return such reimbursements to the appropriate landholders.</P>
            <P>(3) A landholder with holdings in more than one district is entitled to equivalency only in those districts which have requested equivalency (or are already subject to equivalency). That part of the landholding in a district or districts not requesting equivalency will be counted as Class 1 land for purposes of overall entitlement.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Prior equivalency determinations.</E> In districts where equivalency was a provision of project authorization, those equivalency factor determinations will be honored as originally calculated unless the district requests a reclassification.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">The process of designating excess and nonexcess land.</E> If a landowner owns more land than the landowner's ownership entitlement, all of the landowner's nonexempt land must be designated as excess and nonexcess as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) The landowner designates which land is excess and which is nonexcess in accordance with the instructions on the appropriate certification or reporting forms; or</P>
            <P>(2) If a landowner fails to designate his or her land as excess or nonexcess on the appropriate certification or reporting forms:</P>
            <P>(i) And all of the landowner's nonexempt land is in only one district:</P>
            <P>(A) If the district's contract with Reclamation includes designation procedures, then the land is designated according to those procedures; or</P>
            <P>(B) If the district's contract with Reclamation does not include designation procedures, then:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Reclamation will notify the landowner and the district that the landowner must designate the land as excess and nonexcess on the appropriate certification or reporting forms within 30-calendar days of the notification;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the landowner fails to make the designation within 30-calendar days of <PRTPAGE P="666"/>notification, the district will make the designation within 30-calendar days thereafter; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) If the district does not make the designation within its 30-calendar days, Reclamation will make the designation; or</P>
            <P>(ii) If the landowner owns nonexempt land in more than one district, then Reclamation will notify the landowner and the districts that the landowner has 60-calendar days from the date of notification to make the designation. If the landowner does not make the designation in the 60-calendar days, Reclamation will make the designation.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Changing excess and nonexcess land designations.</E> (1) Landowners must file with the district(s) in which the land is located and with Reclamation the designation of excess and nonexcess land. The designation of land as excess is binding on the land. However, the landowner may change the designation under the following circumstances without Reclamation's approval if:</P>
            <P>(i) The excess land becomes eligible to receive irrigation water because the landowner becomes subject to the discretionary provisions as provided in § 426.3;</P>
            <P>(ii) A recordable contract is amended to remove excess land when the landowner's entitlement increases because the landowner becomes subject to the discretionary provisions as provided in paragraph (j)(5) of this section; or</P>
            <P>(iii) The excess land becomes eligible to receive irrigation water as a result of Class 1 equivalency determinations, as provided in § 426.11.</P>
            <P>(2) No other redesignation of excess land is allowable without the approval of Reclamation in accordance with established Reclamation procedures. Reclamation will not approve a redesignation request if:</P>
            <P>(i) The purpose of the redesignation is for achieving, through repeated redesignation, an effective farm size in excess of that permitted by Federal reclamation law; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The landowner sells some or all of his or her land that is currently classified as nonexcess.</P>
            <P>(3) When a redesignation involves an exchange of nonexcess land for excess land, a landowner must make an equal exchange of acreage (or Class 1 equivalent acreage) through the redesignation.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Land that becomes excess when a district first contracts with Reclamation.</E> (1) If a landowner owned irrigable land on the execution date of the district's first water service or repayment contract, and the execution date was on or before October 12, 1982, the landowner's excess land is ineligible until the landowner:</P>
            <P>(i) Becomes subject to the discretionary provisions and the landowner designates the excess land, up to his or her ownership entitlement, as nonexcess as provided for in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section;</P>

            <P>(iii) Sells or transfers such excess land to an eligible buyer at a price and on terms approved by Reclamation; or</P>
            <P>(iv) Redesignates the land as nonexcess with Reclamation's approval as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) If the landowner owned irrigable land on the execution date of the district's first water service or repayment contract and the execution date is after October 12, 1982, the landowner's excess land is ineligible until the landowner:</P>
            <P>(i) Places such excess land under a recordable contract, provided the period for executing recordable contracts under the district's contract has not expired;</P>

            <P>(e) <E T="03">If the status of land is changed by law or regulations.</E> (1) If the district had a contract with Reclamation on or before October 12, 1982, and eligible land became excess because the landowner's entitlement changed from being based on a district-by-district basis to a westwide basis, then such formerly eligible land is ineligible until:</P>
            <P>(i) The landowner places such land under recordable contract. The recordable contract does not need to include the sales price approval clause and application of the deed covenant provision will not be required; or</P>

            <P>(2) If the district had a contract with Reclamation on or before October 12, 1982, and the landowner was a nonresident alien or a legal entity not established under State or Federal law, who directly held eligible land and such land is no longer eligible to receive water, then such formerly eligible land is ineligible until:</P>
            <P>(i) The landowner places such land under recordable contract. The recordable contract does not need to include the sales price approval clause and application of the deed covenant provision will not be required; or</P>

This covenant expires on (date). <PRTPAGE P="669"/>Until the expiration date specified herein, sale price approval is required on this land. Sale by the landowner and his or her assigns of these lands for any value that exceeds the sum of the value of newly added improvements plus the value of the land as increased by the market appreciation unrelated to the delivery of irrigation water will result in the ineligibility of this land to receive Federal project water, provided however:</P>

              <P>(i) The terms of this covenant requiring price approval shall not apply to this land if it is acquired into excess status pursuant to a bona fide involuntary foreclosure or similar involuntary process of law, conveyance in satisfaction of a debt (including, but not limited to, a mortgage, real estate contract, or deed of trust), inheritance, or devise (hereinafter Involuntary Conveyance). Thereafter, this land may be sold to a landholder at its fair market value without regard to any other provision of the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 enacted on October 12, 1982, (43 U.S.C. 390aa <E T="03">et seq.</E>), or to Section 46 of the Act entitled “an Act to adjust water rights charges, to grant certain relief on the Federal irrigation projects, and for other purposes,” enacted May 25, 1926 (43 U.S.C. 423e);</P>
              <P>(ii) If the status of this land changes from nonexcess into excess after a mortgage or deed of trust in favor of a lender is recorded and the land is subsequently acquired by a bona fide Involuntary Conveyance by reason of a default under that loan, this land may thereupon or thereafter be sold to a landholder at its fair market value;</P>
              <P>(iii) The terms of this covenant requiring price approval shall not apply to the sales price obtained at the time of the Involuntary Conveyances described in subparagraphs (i) and (ii), nor to any subsequent voluntary sales by a landholder of this land after the Involuntary Conveyances or any subsequent Involuntary Conveyance;</P>
              <P>(iv) Upon the completion of an Involuntary Conveyance, Reclamation shall reconvey or otherwise terminate this covenant of record;</P>
              <P>(v) However, the deed covenant shall not be reconveyed or otherwise terminated if the involuntarily acquiring landowner is the landowner who sold this land from excess status, unless that landowner is a financial institution as defined in § 426.14(a) of the Acreage Limitation Rules and Regulations (43 CFR Part 426); and</P>
              <P>(vi) The party whose excess ownership originally required the placement of this covenant may not receive Federal reclamation project irrigation water on the land subject to this covenant as a direct or indirect landowner or lessee, unless an exception provided for in § 426.12(g) is met.</P>

            <P>(3) Upon expiration of the terms of the deed covenant, a landowner may resell such land at fair market value. A landowner may not sell more of such land in his or her lifetime than an amount equal to his or her ownership entitlement. Once the landowner reaches this limit, any additional excess land or land subject to a deed covenant the landowner acquires is ineligible to receive irrigation water, until such land is sold to an eligible buyer at a price approved by Reclamation.</P>
            <P>(4) If a landholder acquires land burdened by such a deed covenant through involuntary foreclosure or similar involuntary process of law, conveyance in satisfaction of a debt, including, but not limited to, a mortgage, real estate contract, or deed of trust, inheritance, or devise, and is not the party whose excess ownership originally required placement of the deed covenant, then Reclamation must terminate the deed covenant upon the landholder's request.

            <P>(j) <E T="03">Recordable contracts</E>—(1) <E T="03">Qualifications for recordable contracts.</E> A landowner can make excess land eligible to receive irrigation water by entering into a recordable contract with the United States if the landowner qualifies under applicable provisions of:</P>
            <P>(i) The district's contract with Reclamation;</P>

            <P>(iii) These regulations.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Clauses to be included in recordable contracts.</E> A recordable contract must include:</P>

            <P>(i) A clause whereby the landowner agrees to dispose of the excess land to an eligible buyer, excluding mineral rights and easements, under terms and <PRTPAGE P="670"/>conditions of the sale, in accordance with § 426.13; and within the period allowed for the disposition of excess land, that must be within 5 years from the date that the recordable contract is executed by Reclamation (except for the Central Arizona Project wherein the time period is 10 years from the date water becomes available to the land); and</P>
            <P>(ii) A clause granting power of attorney to Reclamation to sell the land held under the recordable contract, if the landholder has not already sold the land by the recordable contract's maturation.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Date Reclamation can make irrigation water available.</E> Reclamation can make available irrigation water to land that the landowner plans to place under a recordable contract on the day that Reclamation receives the landowner's written request to execute a recordable contract. The landowner has 20-working days in which to execute the recordable contract from the date Reclamation sends the recordable contract to the landowner. Reclamation, in its discretion, may extend this period upon the landowner's request.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Water rate.</E> The rate for irrigation water delivered to land placed under recordable contract will be determined as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) If both the landowner and any lessee are prior law recipients, land placed under a recordable contract can receive irrigation water at a contract rate that does not cover full operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs;</P>
            <P>(ii) If either landowner or any lessee is subject to the discretionary provisions, the water rate applicable to the recordable contract must cover, at a minimum, all O&amp;M costs; or</P>
            <P>(iii) If a landholder leases land subject to a recordable contract and is in excess of his or her nonfull-cost entitlement, the lessee may select such land as the land on which the full-cost rate will be charged for the delivery of irrigation water, unless the land is already subject to the full-cost rate because of an extended recordable contract.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Amending a recordable contract to include less acreage.</E> (i) Reclamation permits a landowner to amend a recordable contract to transfer land out of a recordable contract to nonexcess status, if:</P>
            <P>(A) The landowner has an increased ownership entitlement because of becoming subject to the discretionary provisions; or</P>

            <P>(ii) Landholders must receive Reclamation's approval to amend recordable contracts.</P>
            <P>(A) The disposition period for any land remaining under a recordable contract will not change because of an amendment to remove some land.</P>
            <P>(B) For land removed from a recordable contract based on paragraph (j)(5)(i) of this section, any requirement for application of a deed covenant will no longer be applicable.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Sale of land by Reclamation.</E> If the landowner does not dispose of the excess land held under recordable contract within the period specified in the recordable contract, Reclamation will sell that land. Reclamation will not sell the land if the landowner complies with all requirements for sale of excess land under these rules within the period specified, regardless if Reclamation gives final approval of the sale within that period or after.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Delivery of water when a recordable contract has matured.</E> Reclamation can make available irrigation water at the current applicable rate, pursuant to paragraph (j)(4) of this section, to excess land held under a matured recordable contract until Reclamation sells the land.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Procedures Reclamation follows in selling excess land.</E> If Reclamation must sell excess land, the following procedures will be used:</P>
            <P>(i) If Reclamation determines it to be necessary, a qualified surveyor will make a land survey. The United States will pay for the survey initially, but such costs will be added to the approved sales price for the land. The United States will be reimbursed for these costs from the sale of the land;</P>

            <P>(ii) Reclamation will appraise the value of the excess land, in the manner prescribed by § 426.13, to determine the appropriate sales price. The United <PRTPAGE P="671"/>States will pay for the appraisal initially, but such costs will be added to the approved sales price for the land. The United States will be reimbursed for these costs from the sale of the land; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Reclamation will advertise the sale of the property in farm journals and in newspapers within the county in which the land lies, and by other public notices as deemed advisable. The United States will pay for the advertisements and notices initially, but such costs will be added to the approved sales price for the land. The United States will be reimbursed for these costs from the sale of the land. The notices must state:</P>
            <P>(A) The minimum acceptable sales price for the property (which equals the appraised value plus the cost of the appraisal, survey, and advertising);</P>
            <P>(B) That Reclamation will sell the land by auction for cash, or on terms acceptable to the landowner, to the highest eligible bidder whose bid equals or exceeds the minimum acceptable sales price; and</P>
            <P>(C) The date of the sale (which must not exceed 90 calendar days from the date of the advertisement and notices);</P>
            <P>(iv) The proceeds from the sale of the land will be paid:</P>
            <P>(A) First, to the landowner in the amount of the appraised value;</P>
            <P>(B) Second, to the United States for costs of the survey, appraisal, advertising, etc.; and</P>
            <P>(C) Third, any remaining proceeds will be credited to the Reclamation fund or other funds as prescribed by law; and</P>
            <P>(v) Reclamation will close the sale of the excess land when parties complete all sales arrangements. Reclamation will execute a deed conveying the land to the purchaser. Reclamation will not require the purchaser to include a covenant in the deed, as specified in paragraph (i) of this section, that restricts any further resale of the land.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Excess land appraisals.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">When does Reclamation appraise the value of a landowner's land?</E> Reclamation appraises excess land or land burdened by a deed covenant upon a landowner's request or when required by Reclamation. If a landowner does not request an appraisal within 6 months of the maturity date of a recordable contract, Reclamation, in its discretion, can initiate the appraisal.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedures Reclamation uses to determine the sale price of excess land or land burdened by a deed covenant.</E> Reclamation complies with the following procedures to determine the sale price of excess land and land burdened by a deed covenant, except if a landholder owns land subject to a recordable contract that was in force on October 12, 1982, or other pertinent contract that was in force on that date, and these regulations would be inconsistent with provisions in such a contract:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Appraisals of land.</E> Reclamation will base all appraisals of land on the fair market value of the land at the time of appraisal without reference to the construction of the irrigation works. Reclamation must use standard appraisal procedures including: the income, comparable sales, and cost methods, as applicable. Reclamation will consider nonproject water supply factors as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section as appropriate; and</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Appraisal of improvements to land.</E> Reclamation will assess the contributory fair market value of improvements to land, as of the date of appraisal, using standard appraisal procedures.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Appraisals of nonproject water supplies.</E> (1) The appraiser will consider nonproject water supply factors, where appropriate, including:</P>
            <P>(i) Ground water pumping lift;</P>
            <P>(ii) Surface water supply;</P>
            <P>(iii) Water quality; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Trends associated with paragraphs (c)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section, where appropriate.</P>
            <P>(2) Reclamation will develop the nonproject water supply and trend information with the assistance of:</P>
            <P>(i) The district in which the land is located, if the district desires to participate;</P>
            <P>(ii) Landowners of excess land or land burdened by a deed covenant and prospective buyers who submit information either to the district or Reclamation; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Public meetings and forums, at the discretion of Reclamation.</P>
            <P>(3) Data submitted may include:<PRTPAGE P="672"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) Historic geologic data;</P>
            <P>(ii) Changing crops and cropping patterns; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Other factors associated with the nonproject water supply.</P>
            <P>(4) If Reclamation and the district cannot reach agreement on the nonproject water supply information within 60-calendar days, Reclamation will review and update the trend information as it deems necessary and make all final determinations considering the data provided by Reclamation and the district. Reclamation will provide these data to the appraisers who must consider the data in the appraisal process, and clearly explain how they used the data in the valuation of the land.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">The date of the appraisal.</E> The date of the appraisal will be the date of last inspection by the appraiser(s) unless there is a prior signed instrument, such as an option, contract for sale, agreement for sale, etc., affecting the property. In those cases, the date of appraisal will be the date of such instrument.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Cost of appraisal.</E> If the appraisal is:</P>
            <P>(1) The land's first appraisal, the United States will initially pay the costs of appraising the value of the land, but such costs will be added to the approved sale price for the land. The United States will reimburse itself for these costs from the sale of the land;</P>
            <P>(2) Not the land's first appraisal, the landowner requesting the appraisal must pay any costs associated with the reappraisal, unless the value set by the reappraisal differs by more than 10 percent, in which case the United States will pay for the reappraisal; or</P>
            <P>(3) Associated with a sales price reformation as specified in § 426.12(f)(1), the landowner requesting the appraisal must pay any costs associated with the appraisal.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Appraiser selection.</E> Reclamation will select a qualified appraiser to appraise the excess land or land burdened by a deed covenant, except as specified within paragraph (g) of this section.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Appraisal dispute resolution.</E> The landowner who requested the appraisal may request that the United States conduct a second appraisal of the excess land or land burdened by a deed covenant if the landowner disagrees with the first appraisal. The second appraisal will be prepared by a panel of three qualified appraisers, one designated by the United States, one designated by the district, and the third designated jointly by the first two. The appraisal made by the panel will fix the maximum value of the excess land and will be binding on both parties after review and approval as provided in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Review of appraisals of excess land or land burdened by a deed covenant.</E> Reclamation will review all appraisals of excess land or land burdened by a deed covenant for:</P>
            <P>(1) Technical accuracy and compliance with these rules and regulations;</P>
            <P>(2) Applicable portions of the “Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisition-Interagency Land Acquisition Conference 1973,” as revised in 1992;</P>
            <P>(3) Reclamation policy; and</P>
            <P>(4) Any detailed instructions provided by Reclamation setting conditions applicable to an individual appraisal.</P>

              <E T="03">Involuntarily acquired land</E> means land that is acquired through an involuntary foreclosure or similar involuntary process of law, conveyance in satisfaction of a debt (including, but not limited to, a mortgage, real estate contract or deed of trust), inheritance, or devise.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Ineligible excess land that is involuntarily acquired.</E> Reclamation cannot make available irrigation water to land that was ineligible excess land before the new landowner involuntarily acquired it, unless:</P>
            <P>(1) The land becomes nonexcess in the new landowner's ownership; and</P>

            <P>(2) The deed to the land contains the 10-year covenant requiring Reclamation sale price approval, and that deed <PRTPAGE P="673"/>commences when the land becomes eligible to receive irrigation water.</P>
            <P>(3) If either of these conditions is not met, the land remains ineligible excess until sold to an eligible buyer at an approved price, and the seller places the 10-year covenant requiring Reclamation price approval, as specified in § 426.12(i), in the deed transferring title to the land to the buyer.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Land that was held under a recordable contract and is acquired involuntarily.</E> Reclamation can make available irrigation water to land held under a recordable contract that is involuntarily acquired under the terms of the recordable contract to the extent the land continues to be excess in his or her landholding, if the landowner:</P>
            <P>(1) Assumes the recordable contract; and</P>
            <P>(2) Executes an assumption agreement provided by Reclamation.</P>
            <P>(3) This land will remain eligible to receive irrigation water for the longer of 5 years from the date that the land was involuntarily acquired, or for the remainder of the recordable contract period. The sale of this land shall be under terms and conditions set forth in the recordable contract and must be satisfactory to and at a price approved by Reclamation.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Mortgaged land.</E> Reclamation treats mortgaged land that changed from nonexcess status to excess status after the mortgage was recorded, and which is subsequently acquired by a lender through an involuntary foreclosure or similar process of law, or by a bona fide conveyance in satisfaction of a mortgage, in the following manner:</P>
            <P>(1) If the new landowner designates the land as excess in his or her holding, then:</P>
            <P>(i) The land is eligible to receive irrigation water for a period of 5 years or until transferred to an eligible landowner, whichever occurs first;</P>
            <P>(ii) During the 5-year period Reclamation will charge a rate for irrigation water equal to the rate paid by the former owner, unless the land becomes subject to full-cost pricing through leasing; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The land is eligible for sale at its fair market value without a deed covenant restricting its future sales price; or</P>
            <P>(2) If the new landowner is eligible to designate the land as nonexcess and he or she designates the land as nonexcess, the land will be treated in the same manner as any other nonexcess land and will be eligible for sale at its fair market value without a deed covenant restricting its future sales price.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Nonexcess land that becomes excess when acquired involuntarily.</E> (1) Reclamation can make irrigation water available for a period of 5 years to a landowner who involuntarily acquires land that becomes excess in the involuntarily acquiring landowner's holding provided the land was nonexcess to the previous owner and:</P>
            <P>(i) The acquiring landowner never previously held such land as ineligible excess land or under a recordable contract;</P>
            <P>(ii) The acquiring landholder is a financial institution; or</P>
            <P>(iii) The acquiring landowner previously held the land as ineligible excess or under a recordable contract and § 426.12(g)(1), (3), or (4) applies.</P>
            <P>(2) The following will be applicable in situations that meet the criteria specified under paragraph (e)(1) of this section:</P>
            <P>(i) Reclamation will charge a rate for irrigation water delivered to such land equal to the rate paid by the former owner, except Reclamation will charge the full-cost rate if:</P>
            <P>(A) The land becomes subject to full-cost pricing through leasing; or</P>
            <P>(B) If the involuntarily acquired land is eligible to receive irrigation water only because § 426.12(g)(3) applies and the deed covenant has not expired;</P>
            <P>(ii) The new landowner may not place such land under a recordable contract;</P>
            <P>(iii) The new landowner may request that Reclamation remove a deed covenant as provided in § 426.12(i)(4), and may sell such land at any time without price approval and without the deed covenant. However, the deed covenant will not be removed and the terms of the deed covenant will be fully applied if the new landowner is the landowner who sold the land in question from excess status, except for:</P>
            <P>(A) Financial institutions; or<PRTPAGE P="674"/>
            </P>
            <P>(B) Landowners for which § 426.12(g) (1) or (2) apply; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Such land will become ineligible to receive irrigation water 5 years after it was acquired and will remain ineligible until sold to an eligible buyer or redesignated as provided for in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Redesignation of excess land to nonexcess.</E> Landholders who designate involuntarily acquired land as excess as provided for in paragraphs (d)(1) and (e)(1) of this section and want to redesignate the land as nonexcess, must utilize the redesignation process specified under § 426.12(b)(2).</P>
            <P>(1) However, such redesignations will not be approved if the water rate specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) or (e)(2)(i) of this section is less than what would have been charged for water deliveries to the land in question if the landholder that involuntarily acquired the land had originally designated the land as nonexcess.</P>
            <P>(2) Such landholders may utilize the redesignation process, if they remit to Reclamation the difference between the rate paid and the rate that would have been paid, if the land had been designated as nonexcess when involuntarily acquired, for all irrigation water delivered to the land in question while the land was designated as excess.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Effect of involuntarily acquiring land subject to the discretionary provisions.</E> A landowner does not automatically become subject to the discretionary provisions if the landowner acquires irrigation land involuntarily which was formerly subject to the discretionary provisions. However, a landholder that is subject to the prior law provisions will become subject to the discretionary provisions upon involuntarily acquiring land if:</P>
            <P>(1) The land is located in a district that is subject to the discretionary provisions;</P>
            <P>(2) The landholder in question will be the direct landowner of the land; and</P>
            <P>(3) The landholder in question declares the land as nonexcess.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Land acquired by inheritance or devise.</E> If a landowner receives irrigation land through inheritance or devise, the 5-year eligibility period for receiving irrigation water on the newly acquired land per paragraphs (c)(3) and (e) of this section begins on the date of the previous landowner's death.</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Establishment of new commingling provision in contracts.</E> New, amended, or renewed contracts may provide that irrigation water can be commingled with nonproject water as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) If the facilities used for the commingling of irrigation water and nonproject water are constructed without funds made available pursuant to Federal reclamation law, the provisions of Federal reclamation law and these regulations will apply only to the landholders who receive irrigation water, provided:</P>
            <P>(i) That the water requirements for eligible lands can be established; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The quantity of irrigation water to be used is less than or equal to the quantity necessary to irrigate eligible lands.</P>
            <P>(2) If the facilities used for commingling irrigation water and nonproject water are funded with monies made available pursuant to Federal reclamation law, landholders who receive nonproject water will be subject to Federal reclamation law and these regulations unless:</P>
            <P>(i) The district collects and pays to the United States an incremental fee which reasonably reflects an appropriate share of the cost to the Federal Government, including interest, of storing or delivering the nonproject water; and</P>

            <P>(ii) The fee will be established by Reclamation and will be in addition to the district's obligation to pay for capital, operation, maintenance, and replacement costs associated with the facilities required to provide the service.<PRTPAGE P="675"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) If paragraphs (c)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section are met, the provisions of Federal reclamation law and these regulations will be applicable to only those landholders who receive irrigation water. Accordingly, the provisions of Federal reclamation law and these regulations will not be applicable to landholders who receive nonproject water delivered through facilities funded with monies made available pursuant to Federal reclamation law if those paragraphs are met.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">When Federal reclamation law and these regulations do not apply.</E> Federal reclamation law and these regulations do not apply to landholders receiving irrigation water from federally financed facilities if the irrigation water is acquired by an exchange and that exchange results in no material benefit to the recipient of the irrigation water.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) projects.</E> (1) If Reclamation determines that land receives its agricultural water from a Corps project, Reclamation will exempt that land from specific provisions of Federal reclamation law, including the RRA, unless:</P>
            <P>(i) Federal law explicitly designates, integrates, or incorporates that land into a Federal Reclamation project; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Reclamation provides project works for the control or conveyance of the agricultural water supply from the Corps project to that land.</P>
            <P>(2) Upon such determination, Reclamation will:</P>
            <P>(i) Notify the district of its exemption status;</P>
            <P>(ii) Require the district's agricultural water users to continue, under contracts made with Reclamation, to repay their share of construction, operation and maintenance, and contract administration costs of the Corps project allocated to conservation or irrigation storage; and</P>
            <P>(iii) At the request of the district delete provisions of the district's repayment or water service contract that imposes acreage limitation for those lands served by Corps projects.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Repayment of construction obligations.</E> The acreage limitation provisions do not apply to land in a district after the district has repaid, in accordance with the district's contract with Reclamation, all obligated construction costs for project facilities.</P>
            <P>(1) Payments by periodic installments over the contract repayment term, as well as lump-sum and accelerated payments, if allowed by the district's contract with Reclamation, will qualify the district to become exempt.</P>
            <P>(2) If a district has a contract with the United States providing for individual landowner repayment of construction charges allocated to land, and the landowner has repaid all obligated construction costs allocated for that landowner's land, that landowner will become exempt from the acreage limitation provisions.</P>
            <P>(3) Upon payout Reclamation will:</P>
            <P>(i) Notify the district, and individual landowner in cases of individual landowner payout, of the exemption from the acreage limitation provisions;</P>
            <P>(ii) Notify the district or individual landowner that the exemption does not relieve the district or individual landowner of the obligation to continue to pay, on an annual basis, O&amp;M costs applicable to the district or landowner;</P>
            <P>(iii) Upon request by the owner of land for which repayment has occurred, provide a certificate from Reclamation acknowledging that the land is free of the acreage limitation provisions of Federal reclamation law;</P>
            <P>(iv) Except as provided for in § 426.19(e), no longer apply the certification and reporting requirements to the district, if the entire district is exempt, or to exempt landowners as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and</P>

            <P>(1) Considers the loan as a loan for maintenance, including replacements that cannot be financed currently;<PRTPAGE P="676"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) Does not consider the loan in determining whether the district has discharged its obligation to repay the construction cost of project facilities used to make irrigation water available for delivery to land in the district; and</P>
            <P>(3) Will not allow such a loan to serve as the basis for reinstating acreage limitation provisions in a district that has completed payment of its construction obligation, nor serve as the basis for increasing the construction obligation of the district and thereby extending the period during which acreage limitation provisions will apply.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Temporary supplies of water.</E> If Reclamation announces availability of temporary supplies of water resulting from an unusually large water supply, not otherwise storable for project purposes, or from infrequent and otherwise unmanaged floodflows of short duration a district may request that Reclamation make such supplies available to excess land. However, such water deliveries must not have an adverse effect on other authorized project purposes. Upon approval of the district's request, Reclamation will notify the requesting district of the availability of the temporary supply of water under the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(1) The contract for the temporary supply of water will be for 1 year or less in accordance with prior policies and practices;</P>
            <P>(2) The acreage limitation provisions will not be applicable to the temporary supply of water;</P>
            <P>(3) An applicable price for the water, if any, will be established; and</P>
            <P>(4) Such other conditions as Reclamation may include.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Isolated tracts.</E> If a landowner requests that Reclamation determine that portions of his or her owned land are isolated tracts that can be farmed economically only if included in a farming operation that already exceeds the landowners ownership entitlement, and Reclamation makes such a determination, then Reclamation:</P>
            <P>(1) Will exempt such land from the ownership limitations of Federal reclamation law; and</P>
            <P>(2) Will assess the full-cost rate for any irrigation water delivered to the isolated tract that exceeds the landowner's nonfull-cost entitlement.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Indian trust or restricted lands.</E> (1) Indian trust or restricted lands are excluded from application of the acreage limitation provisions.</P>
            <P>(2) Indian tribes and tribal entities operating on Indian trust or restricted lands are excluded from application of the water conservation provisions.</P>

            <P>(i) If in the year the election is executed, the district's contract rate was more than the O&amp;M costs allocated to the district in that year, then that positive difference at the time of the contract amendment must continue to be factored into the contract rate. This would be in addition to any adjusted O&amp;M cost that results from paragraph (f)(1) of this section. The positive difference would be factored into the contract rate for the remainder of the term of the contract; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Such collections must be forwarded annually to the United States.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Amount of O&amp;M that Reclamation charges if a landholder is subject to full- <PRTPAGE P="683"/>cost pricing.</E> In a district subject to prior law, if a landholder is subject to full-cost pricing the district must ensure that all O&amp;M costs are included in any full-cost assessment, regardless of whether the landholder is subject to the discretionary provisions. The revenues from such full-cost assessments must be collected and submitted to the United States.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Reclamation decisions and appeals.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Reclamation decisions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Decisionmaker for Reclamation's final determinations.</E> The appropriate regional director makes any final determination that these regulations require or authorize. If Reclamation's final determination is likely to involve districts, or landholders with landholdings located in more than one region, the Commissioner designates one regional director to make that final determination.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice to affected parties.</E> The appropriate regional director will transmit any final determination to any district and landholder, as appropriate, whose rights and interests are directly affected.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Effective date for regional director's final determinations.</E> A regional director's decisions will take effect the day after the expiration of the period during which a person adversely affected may file a notice of appeal unless a petition for stay is filed together with a timely notice of appeal.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Appeal of final determinations</E>—(1) <E T="03">Appeal Submittal.</E> Any district or landholder whose rights and interests are directly affected by a regional director's final determination can submit a written notice of appeal. Such notice of appeal must be submitted to the Commissioner of Reclamation within 30-calendar days from the date of the regional director's final determination.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Submittal of supporting information.</E> The affected party will have 60-calendar days from the date that the regional director issues a final determination to submit a supporting brief or memorandum to the Commissioner. The Commissioner may extend the time for submitting a supporting brief or memorandum, if:</P>
            <P>(i) The affected party submits a request to the Commissioner in a timely manner;</P>
            <P>(ii) The request includes the reason why additional time is needed; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The Commissioner determines the appellant has shown good cause for such an extension and the extension would not prejudice Reclamation.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Requests for stay of the final determination pending appeal.</E> (i) The Commissioner will determine whether to stay a regional director's final determination within 30 days after receiving a properly filed petition for stay if the requesting party:</P>
            <P>(A) Submits a request for stay in writing to the Commissioner, with, or in advance of, the notice of appeal, and states the grounds upon which the party requests the stay; and</P>
            <P>(B) Demonstrates that the harm that a district or landholder would suffer if the Commissioner does not grant the stay outweighs the interest of the United States in having the final determination take effect pending appeal.</P>
            <P>(ii) A decision, or that portion of the decision, for which a stay is not granted will become effective immediately after the Commissioner denies or partially denies the petition for stay, or fails to act within 30 days after receiving the request.</P>
            <P>(iii) A Commissioner's decision on a petition for a stay or any other Commissioner decision is appealable.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Appeal of Commissioner's decision</E>—(1) <E T="03">Appeal to the Office of Hearing and Appeals.</E> A party can appeal the Commissioner's decision to the Secretary by writing to the Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), U.S. Department of the Interior. For an appeal to be timely, OHA must receive the appeal within 30-calendar days from the date of mailing of the Commissioner's decision.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Rules that govern appeals to OHA.</E> 43 CFR part 4, subpart G, and other provisions of 43 CFR Part 4, where applicable, govern the OHA appeal process, except for the accrual of underpayment interest as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Effective date of an appeal decision.</E> Reclamation will apply decisions made by the Commissioner or by OHA under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section as <PRTPAGE P="684"/>of the date of the violation or other problem that was addressed in the regional director's final determination. If, during the appeal process, irrigation water has been delivered to land subsequently found to be ineligible, for other than RRA forms submittal violations, the compensation rate may be applied to such deliveries retroactively.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Accrual of interest on underpayments during appeal.</E> Interest on any underpayments, as provided in § 426.21, continues to accrue during an appeal of a regional director's final determination, an appeal of the Commissioner's decision, or judicial review of final agency action. Underpayment interest accrual will continue even during a stay under paragraphs (b)(4) or (c)(3) of this section.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Status of appeals made prior to the effective date of these regulations.</E> (1) Appeals to the Commissioner of a regional director's final determination which were decided by the Commissioner or his or her delegate prior to the effective date of these regulations are hereby validated.</P>
            <P>(2) Appeals to the Commissioner of final determinations made by a regional director and appeals to OHA, which are pending on appeal as of the effective date of these regulations will be processed and decided in accordance with the regulations in effect immediately prior to the effective date of these regulations.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Addresses.</E> All requests for stays, appeals, or other communications to the United States under this section must be addressed as follows:</P>

              <P>Unless otherwise provided by law or regulation, only Reclamation or another Federal agency acting for Reclamation under delegated authority is authorized to issue use authorizations that convey an interest in Reclamation land, facilities, or waterbodies. Recreation managing partners under the Federal Water Projects Recreation Act, 16 U.S.C. 4601 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> and water user organizations who have assumed responsibility for operation and maintenance of Reclamation land, facilities, or waterbodies, and provide a copy of the use authorization to the local Reclamation office, pursuant to a contract with Reclamation may issue limited use authorizations to third parties for activities on Reclamation land, facilities, or waterbodies when all of the following apply:</P>
              <P>(a) The recreation managing partner or water user organization is authorized to do so under its contract with Reclamation;</P>
              <P>(b) Such limited use authorizations do not convey ownership or other interest in the Federal real property;</P>
              <P>(c) The uses authorized are not permanent or for an indefinite period;</P>

              <P>(d) The limited use authorization does not provide for an automatic right of renewal;<PRTPAGE P="692"/>

              <P>(e) The limited use authorization is fully revocable at the discretion of Reclamation; and</P>
              <P>(f) All revenues collected for the use of Reclamation land, facilities, and waterbodies are handled in compliance with all statutory, regulatory, and policy requirements.</P>

              <P>(a) Use authorizations for easements and rights-of-way for periods in excess of 25 years are also subject to approval from water user organizations under contract obligation for repayment of the project or division. This requirement does not apply to any other type of use authorizations.</P>
              <P>(b) At a minimum, the appropriate water user organizations will be notified of all use authorizations prior to their issuance to avoid potential conflicts between the requested use authorization and the water user organizations' need to operate and maintain the facilities for which they have contractual responsibility.</P>
              <P>(c) At the discretion of the responsible Regional Director, concurrence of the appropriate water user organizations not addressed in paragraph (a) of this section may be requested.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(2) The United States, acting through Reclamation, Department of the Interior, reserves rights to construct, operate, and maintain public works now or hereafter authorized by the Congress without liability for termination of the use authorization or other damage to the grantee's activities or facilities.</P>

Further, failure to construct within the timeframe specified in the terms of the use authorization may constitute a presumption of abandonment of the requested use and cause termination of the use authorization.</P>
              <P>(6) Reclamation may, at any time and at no cost or liability to the United States, terminate any use authorization if the grantee fails to comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws, regulations, ordinances, or terms and conditions of any use authorization, or to obtain any required permits or authorizations.</P>

              <P>The administration and potential renewal of use authorizations, existing as of January 1, 2008, for private exclusive recreational or residential uses of Reclamation land, facilities, and waterbodies, as defined in this part, <PRTPAGE P="697"/>will be administered in accordance with the following requirements.</P>
              <P>(a) Existing private exclusive recreational or residential uses must be compatible with public needs and with authorized project purposes, project operations, safety, and security. A review of whether existing private exclusive recreational or residential uses is compatible with public needs and authorized project purposes, project operations, safety, and security will be made at least once every 20 years, except where part 21 requires a more frequent review.</P>
              <P>(1) Reclamation will only make final determinations regarding the compatibility of existing private exclusive recreational or residential uses with public needs or project purposes through a public process involving one or more public meetings. Examples of such public processes include resource management plan development, recreation demand analysis studies, and project feasibility studies.</P>
              <P>(2) Reclamation will notify in writing all potentially affected holders of existing authorizations for private exclusive recreational or residential use regarding the opportunities for public participation when any action is proposed that could lead to an incompatibility determination.</P>

              <P>(3) Determinations that existing private exclusive recreational or residential uses are not compatible with public needs will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(4) If a determination of incompatibility with public needs is made, affected use authorizations may be extended up to 5 years from the date of publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> if the Regional Director determines that such extension is necessary to the fair and efficient administration of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) Reclamation will conduct a compliance review of all existing private exclusive recreational or residential uses at least once every 5 years to determine if the following criteria are being met:</P>
              <P>(1) Environmental requirements;</P>
              <P>(2) Public health and safety requirements; and</P>
              <P>(3) Current in financial obligations to Reclamation.</P>
              <P>(c) Reclamation will provide the holder of the use authorization with a written report of the results of the compliance review by certified mail, return receipt requested. The report will state whether the existing use meets the required criteria listed in paragraph (b) of this section and will list any deficiencies that can be corrected. A minimum of 90 days will be provided to make corrections identified in the report. Failure to correct the deficiencies within the time provided in the report will result in termination of the use authorization.</P>
              <P>(d) In addition to the compliance reviews described above, Reclamation will initiate a review of the existing private exclusive recreational or residential uses for compliance with the required criteria listed in paragraph (b) of this section at least 6 months prior to the expiration date of the existing use authorization. Reclamation will provide the holder of the use authorization with a written report of the results of the compliance review results by certified mail, return receipt requested. The report will state whether the existing use meets the required criteria under this section as applicable and will list any deficiencies that must be corrected prior to a renewal of the use authorization. A minimum of 90 days will be provided prior to the expiration of the permit to make corrections identified in the report. In addition, this report will serve as a reminder that it is time to seek renewal of the use authorization and provide information on the process that needs to be followed.</P>
              <P>(e) Reclamation must be notified in advance by certified mail, return receipt requested, of any transfers of use authorizations for existing private exclusive recreational or residential uses.</P>

              <P>(f) Any renewal of use authorizations for existing private exclusive recreational or residential uses of Reclamation land, facilities, and waterbodies will not exceed 20-year terms. Any such renewals will be subject to the periodic reviews described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and these reviews could potentially result in the termination of the use agreement prior to the end of the term of years.<PRTPAGE P="698"/>
              </P>
              <P>(g) Upon non-renewal or termination of a use authorization for an existing private exclusive recreational or residential use of Reclamation land, facilities, and waterbodies, the grantee will remove any improvements from the site within 90 days from the date of termination or non-renewal of the use authorization. The grantee will return the property as near as possible to its original undisturbed condition. Any property not removed within 90 days may be removed by Reclamation at the expense of the prior grantee.</P>
              <P>(h) Renewal decisions of use authorizations for existing private exclusive recreational or residential uses located on Reclamation land, facilities, and waterbodies will be made by the Regional Director. If the Regional Director determines that deficiencies identified under paragraph (d) of this section cannot be corrected prior to the expiration date of the use authorization, the use authorization may be extended for a period not to exceed 6 months.</P>
              <P>(i) Requests for the renewal, extension, or reissuance of use authorizations for private exclusive recreational or residential uses that expired and were not renewed prior to the effective date of this part and were not renewed or are subsequently not renewed or terminated under the procedures of this section will be considered requests for uses prohibited under § 429.31 and will not be approved. Conversely, requests for the renewal, extension, or reissuance of use authorizations for private exclusive recreational or residential uses that were in existence on the effective date of these regulations and that are in compliance with all requirements of the applicable use authorization at the time a request is made will not be considered requests for uses prohibited under § 429.31. Requests for renewal, extension, or reissuance of use authorizations for private exclusive recreational or residential uses must be made by submitting Form 7-2540 as stated under § 429.10(b) and in compliance with subpart D of this part.</P>
              <P>(j) Unauthorized existing private exclusive recreational or residential uses will be administered under §§ 429.31 and 429.33 and part 423 of this chapter.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 429.33</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>What are the consequences for using Reclamation land, facilities, and waterbodies without authorization?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Reclamation may seek to collect the following:</P>
              <P>(1) All administrative costs incurred by Reclamation in resolving the unauthorized use;</P>
              <P>(2) All costs of removing structures, materials, improvements, or any other real or personal property;</P>
              <P>(3) All costs of rehabilitation of the land, facilities, or waterbodies as required by Reclamation.</P>
              <P>(4) The use fee that would have applied had your use been authorized from the date your unauthorized use began;</P>
              <P>(5) Interest accrued on the use fee from the date your unauthorized use began as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section; and</P>

              <P>(6) The interest charge rate shall be the greater of either the rate prescribed quarterly in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> by the Department of the Treasury for application to overdue payments or the interest rate of 0.5 percent per month. The interest charge rate will be determined as of the due date and remain fixed for the duration of the delinquent period.</P>
              <P>(b) As an unauthorized user, you will receive a written notice in which Reclamation will outline the steps you need to perform to cease your unauthorized use.</P>
              <P>(c) If appropriate, you will receive a final determination letter detailing the applicable costs and fees, as set forth under paragraph (a) of this section, which must be paid to Reclamation for your unauthorized use. Payment must be made within 30 days of receipt of this letter unless Reclamation extends this deadline in writing. Failure to make timely payment may result in administrative or legal action being taken against you.</P>

              <P>(d) Reclamation may determine that issuing a use authorization to you for an existing unauthorized use is not appropriate; and may deny future use applications by you because of this behavior. As noted at § 429.15, use authorizations are always issued at Reclamation's discretion.<PRTPAGE P="699"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) If, however, your unauthorized use is deemed by Reclamation to be an unintentional mistake, consideration may be given to issuing a use authorization provided that you qualify and meet the criteria at § 429.14; and, in addition to the normal costs, you agree to pay the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The use fee that would have been owed from the date your unauthorized use began; and</P>
              <P>(2) Interest accrued on the use fee from the date your unauthorized use began as specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) Under no circumstances will your unauthorized use or payment of monies to the United States in association with an unauthorized use either:</P>
              <P>(1) Create any legal interest or color of title against the United States; or</P>
              <P>(2) Establish any right or preference to continue the unauthorized use.</P>
              <P>(g) Under part 423 of this chapter, unauthorized use of Reclamation land, facilities, or waterbodies is a trespass against the United States. You may be subject to legal action including criminal prosecution as specified under § 423.71.</P>

The decision of the Commissioner shall be subject to appeal to the Secretary by a notice of appeal accompanied by a statement of reasons filed with the Secretary within 30 days after such decision.

In the event of their failure collectively to name such arbitrator within 15 days after their first meeting, that arbitrator shall be named as provided in the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The two arbitrators thus selected shall name a third arbitrator within 30 days of their first meeting. In the event of their failure to so name such third arbitrator, that arbitrator shall be named as provided in the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The third arbitrator shall act as chairperson of the panel. The arbitration shall be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall be limited to the issue submitted. The panel of arbitrators shall render a final decision in this dispute within 60 days after the date of the naming of the third arbitrator. A decision of any two of the three arbitrators named to the panel shall be final and binding on all parties involved in the dispute.</P>
