      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
        
        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

                  Classification of cotton.
                  For purposes of subsection 15b (f) of The Act, classification of cotton is the determination of the quality of a sample in accordance with the Universal Cotton Standards (the official cotton standards of the United States) for the color grade and leaf grade of American upland cotton, and fiber property measurements such as micronaire. High Volume Instruments will determine all fiber property measurements except extraneous matter. High Volume Instrument colormeter measurements will be used for determining the official color grade. Cotton classers authorized by the Cotton and Tobacco Programs will determine the presence of extraneous matter and authorized employees of the Cotton and Tobacco Programs will determine all fiber property measurements using High Volume Instruments.

                  Terms defined for purposes of classification.
                  For the purposes of classification the following terms shall be construed, respectively, to mean:
                  (a) Cotton of perished staple. Cotton that has the strength of fiber as ordinarily found in cotton destroyed or unduly reduced through exposure to the weather either before picking or after baling, or through heating by fire, or on account of water packing, or by other causes.
                  (b) [Reserved]
                  (c) Gin cut cotton. Cotton that shows damage in ginning, through cutting by the saws, to an extent that reduces its value more than two grades.
                  (d) Reginned cotton. Cotton that has passed through the ginning process more than once, and cotton that, after having been ginned, has been subjected to a cleaning process and then baled.
                  (e) Repacked cotton. Cotton that is composed of factors', brokers', or other samples, or of loose or miscellaneous lots collected and rebaled, or cotton in a bale which is composed of cotton from two or more smaller bales or parts of bales that are combined after the cotton leaves the gin.
                  (f) False packed cotton. Cotton in a bale (1) containing substances entirely foreign to cotton, (2) containing damaged cotton in the interior with or without any indication of such damage upon the exterior, (3) composed of good cotton upon the exterior and decidedly inferior cotton in the interior, in such manner as not to be detected by customary examination, or (4) containing pickings or linters worked into the bale.
                  (g) Mixed packed cotton. Cotton in a bale which, in the sample taken therefrom, shows (1) a difference of three or more grades, or (2) a difference of three or more color groups, or (3) a difference in length of staple of one-eighth inch or more. For purposes of this paragraph, White Cotton (including the Plus grades), Light Gray Cotton, and Gray Cotton shall constitute one color group, and Light Spotted Cotton, Spotted Cotton, Tinged Cotton, and Yellow Stained Cotton shall each constitute a color group.
                  (h) Water packed cotton. Cotton in a bale that has been penetrated by water during the baling process, causing damage to the fiber, or a bale that through exposure to the weather or by other means, while apparently dry on the exterior, has been damaged by water in the interior.

                  For the business convenience of a holder of a cotton class certificate issued under this subpart a new certificate may be issued at the request of the holder, to take the place of the former certificate without the reclassification of the cotton and without a new Micronaire determination for the cotton. In any case where a new certificate is issued in accordance with this section, the former certificate shall be surrendered for cancellation, and such new certificate shall bear a new number, the date of its issuance, and the date of original certification, and shall otherwise comply with this subpart.

                  For services rendered by the Cotton and Tobacco Programs pursuant to this subpart, whether the cotton involved is tenderable or not, the person requesting the services shall pay fees as follows:
                  (a) For each calendar year, AMS will calculate the rate for services, per hour per program employee using the following formulas:
                  (1) Regular rate. The total AMS grading or classification program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase, plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.
                  (2) Overtime rate. The total AMS grading or classification program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 1.5 plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.
                  (3) Holiday rate. The total AMS grading or classification program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 2, plus benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.
                  (b) For each calendar year, based on historical costs, AMS will calculate the benefits, operating, and allowance for bad debt components of the regular, overtime and holiday rates as follows:
                  (1) Benefits rate. The total AMS grading or classification program direct benefits costs divided by the total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the next calendar year's percentage cost of living increase. Some examples of direct benefits are health insurance, retirement, life insurance, and Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement basic and matching contributions.
                  (2) Operating rate. The total AMS grading or classification program operating costs divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the percentage of inflation.
                  (3) Allowance for bad debt rate. Total AMS grading or classification program allowance for bad debt divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked.
                  (c) Basis. The calendar year cost of living expenses and percentage of inflation factors used in the formulas in this section are based on the most current Office of Management and Budget's Presidential Economic Assumptions.

                  The buyers and sellers of cotton in each spot market shall be responsible for providing accurate and timely price, quality, and volume of purchases data by growth area to the Cotton Division. The Cotton Division is responsible for ascertaining the accuracy of the price quotations in each designated spot market.

                  (b) In the process of determining price quotations, the Cotton Division will contact a minimum of three buyers and sellers of cotton in each bona fide market at least two times per week during the active trading season and one time per week during the remainder of the year to obtain information on prices, qualities, volume, and terms of sales in sufficient detail to determine quotations.

                  (d) Quotations for each spot market shall be reviewed and approved by the Cotton Division's Market News Branch Chief or Assistant Branch Chief prior to publication.

                  (e) The Cotton Division will publish the appropriate quotations by bale volume for grades, staple lengths, micronaire determinations, and other quality factors for each spot market on a daily basis.

                  As provided in § 27.96, whenever no sale of a particular grade of cotton shall have been made on a given day in a particular spot market, the value of such grade in the market on that day will be determined as follows:
                  (a) If on such given day there shall have been in such market both a sale of any higher grade and a sale of any lower grade, the average of the declines, or advances, or decline and advance, as the case may be, of the next higher grade and the next lower grade so sold shall be deducted from, or added to, as the case may be, the value, on the last preceding business day, of the grade the value of which on such given day is sought to be ascertained.
                  (b) If on such given day there shall have been in such market a sale of either a higher or a lower grade, but not sales of both, the decline or advance of the next higher or the next lower grade so sold shall be deducted from, or added to, as the case may be, the value on the last preceding business day of the grade the value of which on such given day is sought to be ascertained.
                  (c) If on such given day there shall have been in such market no sale of spot cotton of any grade, the value of each grade shall be deemed to be the same as its value therein on the last preceding business day, unless in the meantime there shall have been bona fide bids and offers, or sales of hedged cotton, or other sales of cotton, or changes in prices of futures contracts made subject to the act, which in the usual course of business would clearly establish a rise or fall in the value of spot cotton in such market, in which case such rise or fall may be calculated and added to or deducted from the value on the preceding business day of cotton of all grades affected thereby.

                  Suspension or revocation of license.
                  (a) Any license issued to a warehouse or gin to sample cotton may be suspended or revoked, following notice and opportunity for hearing, if the licensee has knowingly or carelessly sampled cotton improperly, or has submitted improper samples for classification, or has violated any provision of the Act or the regulations, or has used the license, or allowed it to be used, for any improper purpose.
                  (b) Procedure. (1) All cases arising under this paragraph shall be conducted under the Uniform Rules of Practice, 7 CFR 1.130 et seq., and instituted upon a complaint filed by the Administrator.
                  (2) In all cases except those involving willfulness, or in which the public health, interest, or safety otherwise requires, prior to the institution of a formal proceeding, the Administrator shall give written notice to the licensee of facts or conduct which appear to warrant institution of such a proceeding and shall afford the licensee the opportunity, within a reasonable time, to demonstrate or achieve compliance with the Act and regulations.
                  (c) Suspension pending adjudication. In any situation where the integrity of sampling procedures would be seriously jeopardized if a license remained valid pending formal adjudication, the Administrator may temporarily suspend the license effective on or after the third day after mailing notice thereof to the licensee's last know address. Notice of temporary suspension may be made at or after the filing of a complaint and shall contain the reasons for the action.
                  (d) Conditional suspension. (1) The Administrator may temporarily suspend a license, without hearing, for a correctable cause. Such suspension, after appropriate corrective action is taken, will terminate.
                  (2) Written notice shall be given to the licensee in advance of a temporary suspension if practicable, or within 2 days of oral notice, stating the reasons and grounds for temporary suspension.
                  (3) A licensee may request a formal hearing procedure following receipt of oral or written notice of temporary suspension.
                  (e) During any period in which the cotton sampling license of a warehouse or gin is suspended or revoked, the Division will not accept any samples from the licensee for Form A determination, or for classification pursuant to §§ 28.901 through 28.917.

                  Samples for Form A determination shall be drawn, handled, identified, and shipped by a licensed warehouse according to the methods and procedures specified in this section. Any samples or set of samples which do not meet these specified requirements may be rejected by the Area Director.
                  (a) Samples shall be freshly drawn.
                  (b) Each sample shall consist of two portions, one drawn from each side of the bale. Each portion shall be at least six (6) inches wide and approximately twelve (12) inches long and shall weigh at least three (3) ounces.
                  (c) Where it is necessary to draw two sets of samples, a single cut should be made in each side of the bale, and the portion of cotton removed from each cut should be broken in half across the layers to provide two complete samples. In those cases where this method would result in samples of insufficient length, it will be acceptable to split the sample lengthwise along the layers provided the outside portion from each side is submitted for the official classification.
                  (d) Dressing, trimming, or discarding part of the sample is prohibited. No part of the cotton or pieces of bagging, leaf, grass, dirt, sand, or any other material shall be removed from either side of the sample.
                  (e) A coupon showing the correct warehouse bale number and name and address of warehouse shall be placed between the two portions of each sample.
                  (f) Samples shall be identified and sacked immediately after they are cut without further handling prior to shipment to the Classing Office.
                  (g) Samples shall be addressed to and mailed, shipped, or delivered direct to the Classing Office serving the territory in which the warehouse is located. Samples shall in no case be consigned or routed through the owner or custodian of the cotton. Samples mailed or shipped shall be prepaid.
                  (h) The Area Director may require that any licensed warehouse shall provide the crop year, gin name and gin bale number for each sample submitted whenever the Area Director deems that such information is necessary in order to assure that each sample is properly identified with the correct bale of cotton.
                  (i) The licensed warehouse shall cooperate with employees of the Division making inspections of sampling procedures, and shall draw or permit the drawing of such additional samples, without charge as may be deemed necessary to appraise sampling procedures.

                  Terms defined; cotton classification.
                  For the purposes of classification of any cotton or of its comparison with a type or other samples, the following terms shall be construed, respectively, to mean:
                  (a) Fire-damaged cotton. In those cases where it is certain that the cotton is fire damaged, the classification record shall be marked Code 97 (Fire-Damaged Upland Cotton saw ginned) and no official color grade assigned to the sample.
                  (b) Micronaire (mike) reading. The measurement of the fiber fineness and maturity, in combination, of cotton as determined by an airflow instrument. For any cotton that has a micronaire reading of 2.6 or lower, the Classing Office will enter the micronaire reading on all classification memoranda issued for such cotton.
                  (c) Extraneous matter. Extraneous matter is any substance appearing in a cotton sample that is not discernible in the official cotton standards. Such material may consist of rough preparation, sand, dust, oil, grass, whole seeds, parts of seeds, motes, spindle twist, bark, stems, cloth and plastic.
                  (d) Re-ginned cotton. Cotton that, after having been ginned and baled, has been subjected to a ginning process and then re-baled. Responsibility for identifying cotton, which has been actually re-ginned, rests with the owner of the cotton or the owner's agent.
                  (e) Repacked cotton. Cotton that is composed of factors', brokers', or other samples, or of loose or miscellaneous lots collected and rebaled, or cotton in a bale which is composed of cotton from two or more smaller bales or parts of bales that are combined after the cotton leaves the gin.
                  (f) False packed cotton. Cotton in a bale (1) containing substances entirely foreign to cotton; (2) containing damaged cotton in the interior with or without any indication of such damage upon the exterior; (3) composed of good cotton upon the exterior and decidedly inferior cotton in the interior, in such manner as not to be detected by customary examination; or (4) containing pickings or linters worked into the bale.
                  (g) Mixed-packed cotton. Cotton in a bale which, in the sample taken therefrom, shows a difference of two or more color grades, and/or a difference of two or more color groups, or grade of the other side that is one color grade and one color group higher between the two portions of the sample. White, Light Spotted, Spotted, Tinged, and Yellow Stained shall each constitute a color group. The classification assigned will be that of the portion showing the lower color grade. The classification record for the bale will contain a code 75, to designate mixed quality.
                  (h) Water-damaged cotton. Cotton in a bale that has been penetrated by water during the baling process, causing damage to the fiber, or a bale that through exposure to the weather or by other means, while apparently dry on the exterior, has been damaged by water in the interior. If such condition can be ascertained, the classification record shall be marked Code 98 (Water-Damaged Upland Cotton saw ginned) and no official color grade will be assigned.

                  § 28.116
                  Amounts of fees for classification; exemption.
                  (a) For the classification of any cotton or samples, the person requesting the services shall pay a fee, based on the description that follows, subject to the additional fee provided by paragraph (c) of this section.
                  (1) For each calendar year, AMS will calculate the rate for services per hour per program employee using the following formulas:
                  (i) Regular rate. The total AMS grading or classification program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase, plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.
                  (ii) Overtime rate. The total AMS grading or classification program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 1.5 plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.
                  (iii) Holiday rate. The total AMS grading or classification program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 2, plus benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.
                  (2) For each calendar year, based on historical costs, AMS will calculate the benefits, operating, and allowance for bad debt components of the regular, overtime and holiday rates as follows:
                  (i) Benefits rate. The total AMS grading or classification program direct benefits costs divided by the total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the next calendar year's percentage cost of living increase. Some examples of direct benefits are health insurance, retirement, life insurance, and Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement basic and matching contributions.
                  (ii) Operating rate. The total AMS grading or classification program operating costs divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the percentage of inflation.
                  (iii) Allowance for bad debt rate. Total AMS grading or classification program allowance for bad debt divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked.
                  (3) The calendar year cost of living expenses and percentage of inflation factors used in the formulas in this section are based on the most current Office of Management and Budget's Presidential Economic Assumptions.
                  (b) When a comparison is requested of any samples with a type or with other samples, the fees prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section shall apply to every sample involved, including each of the samples of which the type is composed.

                  (c) An additional fee based on current shipping rates shall be assessed for returning samples unless the request for service is so worded that the samples become government property immediately after classification.
                  (d) For any review of classification or comparison of any cotton, the fees prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section shall apply. The additional fee prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section is not applicable to review of classification if made on the same sample as the original class or comparison.

                Methods of cotton classification and comparison.
                (a) The classification of foreign-growth cotton samples shall be determined by the quality of a sample in accordance with the Universal Cotton Standards (the official cotton standards of the United States) for the color grade and the leaf grade of Upland Cotton, the length of staple, and fiber property measurements such as length uniformity, strength, and micronaire. High Volume Instruments will determine all fiber property measurements except the determination of the presence of extraneous matter, special conditions and remarks. High Volume Instrument colorimeter measurements will be used for determining the official color grade. Cotton classers certified by the Cotton and Tobacco Program will determine the presence of extraneous matter, special conditions and remarks and authorized employees of the Cotton and Tobacco Program will determine all fiber property measurements using High Volume Instruments. The classification record issued by the Quality Assurance Division with respect to any cotton sample shall be deemed to be the classification record of the Department.
                (b) Additional procedures and methods pertaining to the classification of foreign-growth cotton samples are outlined in §§ 28.36 through 28.40.
                (c) When a comparison of such cotton samples with other actual samples or with a type is requested, the procedure and methods shall be as outlined in §§ 28.45 through 28.47.

                  In determining in terms of micronaire readings, the fiber fineness and maturity, in combination, of cotton, the following procedures shall apply:
                  (a) Facilities and equipment shall include:

                  (1) Air flow instrument complete with accessories to measure the fineness and maturity, in combination, of cotton in terms of micronaire reading on the curvilinear scale adopted in September 1950 by the Department of Agriculture, or its equivalent.
                  
                  (2) A suitable supply of compressed air filtered to remove moisture and other impurities.
                  (3) Balance or scales suitable for accurately weighing the specimens required for the particular instrument.
                  (4) International Calibration Cotton Standards with established micronaire reading values for calibration of the air flow instrument.
                  (b) The instrument shall be calibrated each day before routine testing begins, as follows:
                  (1) The air shall be allowed to flow through the instrument until the indicator stabilizes.
                  (2) Specimens from at least two of the calibration cottons shall be tested to insure proper calibration of the instrument. The instrument shall be considered in calibration if the values obtained on the test specimens agree with the established values of the calibration cottons within 0.1 micronaire reading.
                  (c) Testing of the cotton specimen shall be performed as follows:
                  (1) Approximately the same amount of cotton shall be taken from each side of the sample for a test specimen. The weight of the test specimen shall be that weight prescribed for the air flow instrument being used.
                  (2) The weighed specimen shall be tested in a properly calibrated instrument.
                  (3) The specimen shall be inserted into the specimen holder of the instrument so that the mass of fibers is well distributed within the specimen holder.
                  (4) The air shall then be allowed to flow through the specimen in accordance with the method of operation of the instrument.
                  (5) The position of the instrument indicator shall be determined to the nearest 0.1 micronaire reading when it becomes stable.
                  (d) The accuracy of the instrument shall be checked at least every 2 hours during operation by testing appropriate calibration cottons. If the value obtained on a specimen from the calibration cotton is outside the established limits of 0.1 micronaire reading, or when successive readings show the results to be within the established limits, but consistently high or low, the instrument and technique shall be thoroughly checked to remedy the discrepancies. Additional tests using calibration cottons shall be made until acceptable results are obtained before routine testing is resumed.

                  § 28.906
                  Sampling arrangements.
                  (a) Cotton must be sampled by a gin or warehouse that holds a valid license to sample cotton issued pursuant to §§ 28.20 through 28.22.
                  (b) The Director, or an authorized representative may direct that sampling be performed by employees of the Department of Agriculture for the purpose of appraising the sampling procedures at cotton gins or warehouses, or for the purpose of providing service to producers in special cases where a licensed gin or warehouse is not available.
                
                
                  § 28.907
                  Responsibilities of licensed gins or warehouses.
                  Each licensee shall be primarily responsible for drawing, identifying, handling, and shipping samples of cotton in accordance with this subpart and with instructions furnished by the Director or an authorized representative from time to time.
                
                
                  § 28.908
                  Samples.
                  (a) Only one sample to be submitted. Only one sample from each bale of eligible cotton shall be submitted for classification under this subpart. This does not prohibit the submission of an additional sample from a bale for review classification if the producer so desires.
                  (b) Drawing of samples manual. (1) Each cut sample shall be drawn from the bale after it is tied out following the ginning process, and shall be approximately 6 ounces in weight, not less than 3 ounces of which are to be drawn from each side of the bale: Provided, That each sample from a bale of American Pima cotton shall be approximately 10 ounces in weight, not less than 5 ounces of which are to be drawn from each side of the bale.
                  (2) Where it is necessary to draw two sets of samples, a single cut should be made in each side of the bale, and the portion of cotton removed from each cut should be broken in half across the layers to provide two complete samples. In those cases where this method would result in samples of insufficient length, it will be acceptable to split the sample lengthwise along the layers, provided the outside portion from each side is submitted for the official classification.
                  (c) Mechanical sampling. Samples may be drawn in gins equipped with mechanical samplers approved by the Division and operated according to sampling instructions furnished by the Director or an authorized representative. Such samples shall not be less than 6 ounces in weight.
                  (d) Samples must be representative. Each sample must be representative of the bale from which drawn.
                  (e) Handling samples. Samples shall not be dressed or trimmed and shall be carefully handled in such manner as not to cause loss of leaf, sand, or other material, or otherwise change their representative character. Samples shall be handled only by employees of the licensee prior to shipment or delivery to the cotton classing office of the Division.
                  (f) Identifying and shipping samples. Each sample shall be identified with a tag, supplied or approved by the Division, bearing the gin or warehouse number of the bale from which the sample was drawn and the name and address of the producer of the bale. The tag shall be placed between the two halves of the sample, the sample tightly rolled and enclosed in a package or bag for shipment. Each package or bag shall be labeled or marked with the name and address of the licensed gin or warehouse. The packages shall be shipped or delivered direct to the cotton classing office serving the territory in which the cotton is ginned. Samples that were drawn by a mechanical sampler at the gin may be transported with the bales to the warehouse and then shipped or delivered direct to the classing office by the warehouse.
                  (g) Request for classification. Samples received from a licensed gin or warehouse with the identification tag required in § 28.908(f) shall constitute a request for classification service by the producer.
                
                
                  § 28.909
                  Costs.
                  (a) Costs incident to sampling, tagging, and identification of samples and transporting samples to points of shipment shall be assumed by the producer, but tags and containers for the shipment of samples and shipping charges via U.S. Postal Service or duly authorized common carrier will be furnished by the service. After classification the samples shall become the property of the Government. The proceeds of the sale of cotton samples shall be used to defray the costs of providing the services under this subpart.
                  (b) The cost of High Volume Instrument (HVI) cotton classification service to producers will be based on formulas set forth in § 28.116. The proceeds of the sale of cotton samples shall be used to defray the costs of providing the service under this subpart.
                  (c) The Division will periodically bill producers or the voluntary agents designated by producers for the cost of classification. A discount of 5 cents per sample will be granted for services provide under this section when billing is made to voluntary agents.

If provided as an additional method of data transfer, the minimum fee for each method issued shall also be determined as described in § 28.116.
                  (b) Owners of cotton, other than producers, may receive classification data showing the official quality determination of each sample by means of telecommunications from a central database to be maintained by the Division. The fee for this service shall be determined as described in § 28.116, with all communication charges paid by the receiver of data.
                  (c) Upon request of an owner of cotton for which classification memoranda have been issued under the subpart, a new memorandum shall be issued for the business convenience of such owner without the reclassification of the cotton. Such rewritten memorandum shall bear the date of its issuance and the date or inclusive dates of the original classification. The per-hour fee for a new memorandum shall be determined according to § 28.116, with a minimum per-sheet fee determined under the same provisions.

                § 29.2
                Policy statement.
                Inspection and price support services currently provided in auction marketing areas are adequate and the lack of these services is not a limiting factor to accelerated marketings or the extension of price support to producers. Consequently, the extension of inspection and price support services, without limitation even though the cost of such service is paid by the seller, would not contribute to the effectuation of the purposes of either of these services. The additional cost incident to the unlimited extension of these services would be unjustifiable and excessive in relation to the total quantity of tobacco available for market. Accordingly, inspection and price support services shall be made available on new markets at warehouses which are located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), and additional sales for other than flue-cured tobacco only as hereinafter provided. With regard to flue-cured tobacco, allocation of inspection services is based on producer designation, as provided for in 7 CFR 1464.2(e)(2)(iii), see subpart G. Also, since these services shall be made available to new markets to warehouses which are located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), and additional sales only as herein provided, referenda incident to market designations shall not be conducted until auction markets seeking designation have qualified for inspection and price support services as herein provided.
                (a) Reasonable inspection and price support services. The extension of tobacco inspection and price support services to new markets to warehouses which are located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), and additional sales will be conditioned upon the reasonableness of such services existing in the marketing area of the proposed new market or additional sale. Transactions in tobacco as conducted at auction markets customarily involve the sale of tobacco at a bona fide auction sale. Determination with respect to reasonableness, and consequently with respect to granting or denying additional services, will be based on evidence (1) that the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale will function as a bona fide auction sale, and (2) that additional services are justifiable in relation to other market data, including the volume of tobacco produced in the area surrounding the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale; the roads and road distances involved in moving tobacco to the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale in relation to other tobacco marketing centers; the relative availability or congestion of all facilities for redrying and packing tobacco handled or to be handled in the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale; the location of other auction markets on which tobacco produced in the marketing area of the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale may be marketed; the number of tobacco growers to be affected by the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale; the volume of tobacco likely to be sold in the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale; the relationship of sales in the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale to sales in other auction markets in the producing area for that kind of tobacco; other economic factors affecting the marketing of tobacco, by growers, in the marketing area of the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale and in the producing area for that kind of tobacco, including limitations on sales imposed by any marketing agreement and/or order, or by any other means; and also, as to flue-cured tobacco, data with regard to producer designations which shall include, but not be limited to, the markets and warehouses currently available for the producers, who would be eligible to designate the new market or, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), who already designate and who desire to designate the new market.
                (b) Order of priority. If the Secretary finds that there are insufficient qualified tobacco inspectors available to service adequately all applicants otherwise found to be qualified for additional inspection service pursuant to this subpart for a kind of tobacco, those applicants found to be eligible for additional services on auction markets designated for mandatory inspection shall be given priority over applicants for additional inspection service on other auction markets. If it becomes necessary to determine which of several qualified applicants having an equal order of priority under the preceding sentence shall receive additional inspection and price support services, those auction sales or auction markets where the greatest number of growers needing such service may be served with the qualified inspectors shall have priority. If an application for an additional sale on a designated market is denied for lack of qualified inspectors, the Secretary, on application from such market, may temporarily suspend the requirement of inspection and certification on such market pursuant to section 5 of the Tobacco Inspection Act.
                (c) Price support services to be through warehouses. Price support services on any auction market will be offered through tobacco auction warehouses operating in such market, and, notwithstanding any provision of this subpart, the offering of price support services through any auction warehouse located on any auction market will be conditioned upon a qualified, responsible warehouseman entering into an approved auction warehouse contract under the provisions of the applicable tobacco price support program, published at part 1464 of this title.

                § 29.3
                Procedures for filing, hearing, and determination of applications.
                (a) Time and place of filing. Applications for the extension of tobacco inspection and price support services to new markets, to warehouses located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e) and to additional sales on designated markets shall be filed, in triplicate, with the Hearing Clerk not later than September 15 in the case of flue-cured tobacco, December 1 in the case of Maryland tobacco, and July 15 in the case of burley and all other kinds of tobacco. Applications should be addressed to the Hearing Clerk, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250. Applications which are not received by the Hearing Clerk on or before the foregoing cutoff date for the kind of tobacco shall be rejected as untimely filed. After denial of an application for additional inspection and price support services for a marketing season, no application from the same auction market or proposed new market shall be considered for the next consecutive marketing season, unless the application contains a statement by the applicant setting forth new facts that constitute evidence of such a substantial change in conditions since the previous hearing as the review committee as specified in paragraph (h) of this section deems would warrant such further hearing.
                (b) Form and content of application. The application shall be in writing, shall set forth the grounds for the application and shall be signed by the applicant or applicants. If an applicant is a corporation, the application shall be executed by a responsible officer of such corporation. The application shall include a statement of the name, address and form of business organization of each party to the application and the location of the proposed new market or additional sale.
                (c) Hearings on applications. Following the closing date for filing applications for each kind of tobacco, a hearing or hearings shall be held on the applications, if any, filed for additional inspection and price support services for the kind of tobacco in question. Such hearing or hearings shall be scheduled to begin within 60 days following the closing date for such applications. Notice of hearing shall be issued by the Secretary, filed with the Hearing Clerk, and published in the Federal Register, and a copy shall be mailed by the Hearing Clerk to each applicant. Such publication and mailing shall be not less than 5 days prior to the opening of the hearing.
                (d) Hearing officer. A hearing officer shall preside over each such hearing. The hearing officer shall determine the order of procedure at the hearing, shall have power to administer oaths and affirmations, to rule on and admit evidence, and, following the opening of the hearing, to recess the hearing to such other times and places as he deems desirable or necessary.
                (e) Scope of hearing and burden of proof. Each applicant shall have the burden of presenting evidence relative to the factors specified in § 29.2(a).
                (f) Record and evidence. The proceedings at each such hearing shall be transcribed verbatim. All oral testimony shall be under oath or affirmation. All documentary exhibits shall be submitted in triplicate by the person offering the same. The Hearing Officer shall, insofar as possible, exclude testimony and exhibits which are irrelevant, immaterial, or not of the sort upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely. Cross-examination shall be allowed only to the extent that the Hearing Officer in his discretion deems it desirable or necessary to develop the material facts.
                (g) Briefs. If requested at the hearing, the presiding officer shall fix a time, not to exceed 20 days from the close of the hearing, within which interested persons may mail briefs to the Hearing Clerk.
                (h) Certification and referral. As soon as practicable following the close of the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall certify the transcript of the proceedings at the hearing together with all exhibits and shall transmit the same to the Hearing Clerk for referral to a review committee comprised of the Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service, the Administrator, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, and a representative of the Office of the Secretary to be designated by the Secretary.
                (i) Recommended action. The review committee shall review and consider the applications, hearing record, including exhibits, and all other available information and data relating to applications for each kind of tobacco and shall submit a recommendation thereon to the Secretary.
                (j) Final decision. The Secretary shall issue the decision on each application and such decision shall be final: Provided, That any determination that additional services will be provided may be reconsidered and may be vacated if it is subsequently found that any material fact upon which such determination was based was materially erroneous or false, or that the new market or additional sale in question is not functioning as a bona fide auction sale. Such decision shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk who shall mail a true copy thereof, by certified mail, to the applicant.

                  Designation of markets; termination of designation.
                  An auction market where tobacco bought or sold thereon at auction or the products customarily manufactured therefrom move in commerce may be designated under the Act by the Secretary after the Director has advised the Secretary that two-thirds of the growers voting in the referendum held in accordance with § 29.74 favored the designation of such market. When a market is designated by the Secretary, he shall give public notice of the fact and in such public notice he shall specify the date on which the requirement of inspection and certification of tobacco sold at auction on such market shall become effective. The Director may temporarily suspend the requirement of inspection and certification on a designated market when it is found impracticable to provide such services because competent inspectors are not obtainable or because the quantity of tobacco available for inspection is insufficient to justify the cost of such service. A designation shall terminate automatically at the end of any two consecutive marketing seasons during which a designated market does not conduct any sales of tobacco at auction. A market whose designation is terminated under this section shall be considered as a new market, as defined in § 29.1, and any future application for services shall be filed and determined in accordance with the provisions of §§ 29.3 and 29.2.

                  Growers' referendum.
                  (a) Method of conducting. Any referendum held as provided in section 5 of the Act shall be conducted by the Division in accordance with this section. The Director shall determine (1) the market or group of markets to be covered by a referendum; (2) when a referendum is to be held; and (3) the period during which growers, entitled to vote therein, may cast their ballots. When a referendum is held for a group of markets, the result of such referendum may be construed to apply either individually or collectively to such markets. Before holding a referendum, the Division shall establish from the records of the collectors of internal revenue for the preceding marketing season, or in the absence of such records then from such other reliable sources of information as are available, a list showing the names of all growers who are entitled to vote in the referendum, and from the list so established the eligibility of growers to vote in a referendum shall be determined by the Division: Provided, That if a grower, whose name appears on such lists for two or more markets selling the same class of tobacco, votes in one referendum for a market selling such type, he shall not be eligible to vote in a referendum for any other market selling such type. If no growers sold tobacco at auction on a proposed new market during the preceding marketing season, then the list of growers entitled to vote in the referendum shall be comprised of the growers residing in the county where the pRoposed new market is located and in the adjacent counties.
                  (b) Form of ballot. Ballots to be used for voting in a referendum held under the Act shall be in a form approved for the purpose by the Director.
                  (c) Distribution of ballots. Ballots to be used by growers in a referendum under the act may be distributed by mail or otherwise as the Director may select. The Director may establish and publish a list of voting places for the purpose of any referendum and distribute ballots therefrom. When ballots are not mailed directly to growers who are entitled to vote, insofar as their addresses are known, the Director shall announce the voting places at which ballots can be secured, and copies of such announcement shall be given to the press and mailed, for posting and distribution, to the post offices of the market or group of markets covered by the referendum and to post offices in the vicinity of such markets or group of markets. Any explanatory statement with reference to a referendum, provisions of the Act and these regulations, or the operation and benefits of the services authorized by the act may be attached to or supplied with ballots.
                  (d) Filing and tabulation of votes. Each ballot, when filled in and signed by a grower entitled to vote in a referendum, shall be mailed or delivered by him as specified in the ballot. Persons authorized by the Director to receive votes in any referendum shall promptly file all votes received or collected by them with the Division. All ballots filed in a referendum shall be examined to verify the eligibility of the voter and the Director shall have compiled the result of the referendum and furnish the Secretary a statement showing whether or not two-thirds of the growers voting favored the designation of the market or group of markets covered by the referendum. In verifying votes, ballots which do not show the desire of the voter, or ballots which are defective or illegible, or ballots on which the signature or other identification does not correspond with the established list shall not be counted. The choice of any individual voter shall not be divulged by any official of the Division, except to the Secretary when requested. Votes, ballots, and other documents pertaining to a referendum shall be preserved in the Division for a period of 2 years from the closing date of such referendum, and may be destroyed thereafter.

                  § 29.74a
                  Producer referenda on mandatory grading.
                  (a)(1) Method of conducting. Referenda shall be conducted among producers who were engaged in the production of the following types of tobacco harvested in the immediately preceding crop year: flue-cured tobacco, types 11, 12, 13, 14; Kentucky-Tennessee fire-cured tobacco, types 22 and 23; Virginia fire-cured tobacco, type 21; Virginia sun-cured tobacco, type 37; dark air-cured tobacco, types 35 and 36; burley tobacco, type 31; and cigar filler and binder tobacco, types 42, 43, 53, 54, and 55. A referendum will be conducted for each kind of tobacco and the results will apply to each individual kind. A producer is eligible to vote in referenda for each kind of tobacco they produce.
                  (2) Farmers engaged in the production of tobacco. For purposes of the referenda, persons engaged in the production of tobacco includes any person who is entitled to share in a crop of the tobacco or the proceeds thereof because he or she shares in the risks of production of the crop as an owner, landlord, tenant, or sharecropper (a landlord whose return from the crop is fixed regardless of the amount of the crop produced is excluded) on a farm on which such crop is planted in a workmanlike manner for harvest: Provided, That any failure to harvest the crop because of conditions beyond the control of such person shall not affect his or her status as a person engaged in the production of the crop. In addition, persons engaged in the production of tobacco also includes each person who it is determined would have had an interest as a producer in the crop on a farm for which a farm allotment under the quota program (7 CFR part 723, subpart B) for the crop was established and no acreage of the crop was planted but an acreage of the crop was regarded as planted for history acreage purposes under the applicable Farm Service Agency commodity regulations of the Department of Agriculture.
                  (3) One vote limitation. Each person eligible to vote in a particular referendum shall be entitled to only one vote in such referendum regardless of the number of farms in which such person is interested or the number of communities, counties, or States in which farms are located in which farms such person is interested: Provided, That:
                  (i) The individual members of a partnership shall each be entitled to one vote, but the partnership as an entity shall not be entitled to vote;
                  (ii) An individual eligible voter shall be entitled to one vote even though he or she is interested in an entity (including but not limited to a corporation) which entity is also eligible to vote;
                  (iii) A person shall also be entitled to vote in each instance of his or her capacity as a fiduciary (including but not limited to a guardian, administrator, executor or trustee) if in such fiduciary capacity he or she is eligible to vote but the person for whom he or she acts as a fiduciary shall not be eligible to vote.
                  (4) Joint and family interest. Where several persons, such as members of a family, have participated or will participate in the production of tobacco under the same lease or cropping agreement, only the person or persons who signed the lease or agreement, or agreed to an oral lease or agreement, shall be eligible to vote. Where two or more persons have produced or will produce tobacco as joint tenants, tenants in common, or owners of community property, each such person shall be entitled to one vote if otherwise eligible. The eligibility of one spouse does not affect the eligibility of the other spouse.
                  (5) Minors. A minor shall be entitled to one vote if he or she is otherwise eligible and is 18 years of age or older when he or she votes.
                  (6) Interpretation. In the case of tobacco on a farm where no acreage of tobacco is actually planted but an acreage of the commodity is regarded as planted under applicable regulations of the Department of Agriculture, persons on the farm who it is determined would have had an interest in the commodity as a producer if an acreage of the commodity had been actually planted shall be eligible to vote in the referendum.
                  (b) Referenda procedures. See part 717 of chapter VII of this title for eligibility criteria and the procedures to be used in carrying out mandatory grading referenda. Where not inconsistent with this part, the definitions contained in parts 717, 718 and 723 of this title will govern administration of these referenda. A copy of the regulations in parts 717, 718, and 723 of this title, a referendum ballot, and voting procedures are available for review in any USDA Service Center.

                  § 29.75
                  Accessibility of tobacco.
                  (a) All tobacco subject to mandatory inspection shall be made readily accessible for inspection.
                  (b)(1) Each warehouse operator shall block off in his warehouse adequate space for each basket of flue-cured tobacco offered for sale on the auction market, and shall prominently number each 10th basket space. The blocking and numbering arrangement shall follow the order of sale; that is, down one row and back on the adjacent row.

                  (2) Each warehouse shall display a plainly visible sign with the total number of baskets of flue-cured tobacco allotted to be sold each day. Each warehouse operator shall designate to the inspector the number of the starting space for each day's sale and grading will begin at this designated space. All spaces, whether empty or full, shall be counted. No tobacco will be graded beyond the numbered space corresponding with the number of baskets allotted for each day's sale. The grading shall proceed from the beginning point of the sale to the closing point of the sale in an orderly sequence. An inspector shall not go back and grade any basket of tobacco placed in a space which was empty when grading for the day's sales passed such sales space.
                  (c) Before starting inspection of the day's sale of flue-cured tobacco in each warehouse, the head grader or market supervisor grader shall determine if there is compliance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. If he determines that the prescribed system has not been followed, the inspectors shall proceed to the next scheduled warehouse and shall return to the noncomplying warehouse on the next sales day for such warehouse when the head grader or market supervisor grader shall again determine if the prescribed system has been followed before starting the inspection.
                  (d) A reduction in daily sales for any warehouse resulting from noncompliance with this section, including empty spaces, shall not prevent the maximum number of baskets allotted per day per set of buyers from being sold in the market.
                  (e) Each receiving station operator shall make tobacco accessible to the inspector for proper examination including any necessary display in adequate light for determination of grade, class, type, or other characteristics.

                  § 29.75a
                  Display of burley tobacco on auction warehouse floors in designated markets.
                  (a)(1) Each lot of burley tobacco displayed for sale on auction warehouse floors shall have a minimum space of 24 inches from butts to butts between the rows. Distances between lots of tobacco within the row shall be no less than 8 inches between immediately adjacent lots.
                  (2) The number of bales on a pallet shall not exceed eight. Tobacco packed in bales shall have the stems turned toward the aisle.
                  (3) Each warehouse operator shall display a plainly visible sign showing the total number of lots of burley tobacco allotted to be sold each day. Such sign shall be displayed at the point of lots where the days' sales will conclude and no additional tobacco shall be graded beyond that point.
                  (4) Each warehouse operator shall arrange his entire day's sale in a continuous and orderly arrayed sequence of lots and rows of tobacco. Any arrangement of tobacco in rows of progressively varying lengths, or any deviations from an orderly arrayed sequence of lots and rows of tobacco, shall have prior approval of the Set Work Leader or Circuit Supervisor.
                  (5) Each warehouse operator shall designate to the Set Work Leader or Circuit Supervisor the starting point or lot for each day's sale, and counting and grading will begin at this designated point and proceed to the closing point of the sale in an orderly sequence. All lot spaces, containing or not containing a lot of tobacco, and all lots of tobacco, covered or uncovered, shall be counted and included in the daily sales allotment. Lots of tobacco shall not be removed, added, rearranged, or substituted between the time they are counted for the day's sale and the time they are graded for the day's sale, provided, however, that with prior approval of the Set Work Leader or Circuit Supervisor compensating lots of tobacco may be substituted for empty spaces and covered lots included in a daily sales count.
                  (6) Each operator of a warehouse at which baled burley tobacco is offered for sale shall open the particular bale, in a lot of tobacco, chosen by a grader for inspection and reseal that bale after inspection.
                  (7) Each seller, by offering burley tobacco for sale, certifies that the lot inspected by a grader is representative of the grade of all the tobacco in that lot, that the leaf was stalk-cured, that the bales do not contain any foreign matter or material, and are not nested.

                  (b) Before starting inspection of the day's sale of burley tobacco in each warehouse, the Set Work Leader or Circuit Supervisor shall determine if there is compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. If he determines that the prescribed requirements have not been followed, the inspector shall proceed to the next sale or sales as originally scheduled for that day and grade the number of lots of tobacco scheduled for such sale or sales, and shall return to the noncomplying warehouse on the next regularly scheduled sales day for such warehouse, at which time the Set Work Leader or Circuit Supervisor shall again determine if the prescribed system has been followed before starting the inspection. If noncompliance or failure to observe requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are discovered after inspection for the day's sale has started, the inspector shall discontinue inspection and proceed to the next sale or sales scheduled for that day and shall return to the noncomplying warehouse on the next regularly scheduled sales day for such warehouse.
                  (c) The provisions of this section shall not preclude the application of other administrative remedies or the institution of criminal proceedings in appropriate cases as provided by the Act.

                  Each lot of tobacco delivered for sale at receiving stations and transferred to a conveyor system for unloading shall maintain a distance between adjacent lots of not less than 18 inches during the inspection process. The platform area used for examination with a conveyor system shall be a minimum of 4 × 4 feet. Any lots of tobacco displayed in a manner other than a conveyor system shall maintain a minimum clearance of 18 inches on all sides. If the tobacco is inspected or graded by the recipient, it shall be made available for mandatory inspection at the same time and location within the receiving station.

                  One copy of the mandatory inspection ticket shall be attached to, or placed on, the tobacco certificated as a further identification of the lot and all copies of such ticket shall become null and void when such identifying copy is removed from the lot. When and as requested by the Director, one copy of such ticket, showing (a) the certification of type and grade; (b) the weight and other identification; and (c) the details of the sale at auction, shall be delivered by the warehouseman to the Division or the head inspector of the market.

                  The grade of each lot of tobacco as certified by an official inspector on a designated market shall be clearly announced by the warehouseman or his representative at the time the lot is offered in the auction: Provided, That the Director may waive the requirement of announcing grades in the auction if he finds it impractical for the warehouseman to render this service.
                
                
                  § 29.81
                  Interference with inspectors.
                  (a) Auction. (1) No person, including the owner, producer, warehouseman, purchaser, agent, or employee thereof shall attempt, in any manner, to influence an inspector with respect to the grade designation of tobacco, or impede, in any manner, an inspector while the inspector is in the process of grading tobacco on the warehouse auction floor, or ask any question or discuss any matter pertaining to the grading of tobacco while the inspector is grading any tobacco on the warehouse auction floor. While inspectors are engaged in grading the day's sale, all requests for information concerning the grade designation on or requests to review the grade of any lot of tobacco shall be made only to the head grader or to the market supervisor grader.
                  (2) In the event that the head grader or market supervisor grader determines that a person has violated any provision of this section, inspection ticket(s) if already issued on the lot(s) of unsold tobacco involved shall be null and void and no further inspection shall be performed on such lot(s) offered for sale by the warehouseman in whose premises the violation occurred until the next regularly-scheduled sale for such warehouse: Provided, That if violation consists of talking to the inspector while he/she is grading the tobacco, a warning shall be given on first offense and penalty provisions shall apply on any subsequent offense. A reduction in daily sales for any warehouse resulting from a violation of this section shall not prevent the maximum number of lots or pounds allotted per day per set of buyers from being sold in a designated market.

                  (a) The date; (b) the name and post office address of the appellant and of the person, if any, making the appeal in his behalf; (c) the financial interest of the appellant in the tobacco; (d) the reasons for making the appeal; and such other information as may be required by the Director. The appeal shall be accompanied by the certificate or sample from which the appeal is taken, unless such requirement is waived by the Division when it is impracticable for the appellant to furnish such certificate. The appeal inspector may require the appellant to furnish any other relevant and necessary information for the proper consideration of the appeal.

When an appeal is denied or dismissed, the appeal inspector shall (a) notify the appellant by telegraph or in writing giving the reason for such denial or dismissal; (b) mail a copy of such notification to the Division; and (c) return or release to the appellant, or other person designated by him, any certificate or sample which was filed with the appeal.

                  Appeals shall be passed upon by an appeal inspector designated for the purpose by the Director.

                  Appeal findings.
                  Immediately after an appeal has been heard and the tobacco involved therein has been reexamined, an appeal certificate shall be issued or an appeal sample prepared by the appeal inspector. Such certificate or sample shall show the finding of the appeal inspector and shall be labeled “Appeal Certificate” or “Appeal Sample”, as the case may be, over the signature of the appeal inspector. An appeal certificate or sample shall supersede all other certificates or samples for the same lot of tobacco and shall refer specifically to the certificate or sample from which the appeal was made. In all other respects the provisions of this subpart relative to certificates or samples shall apply to an appeal certificate or sample. The findings of the appeal inspector as certificated shall be final, unless the Director shall direct a review of such findings.

                  When superseded under this subpart by an appeal certificate or an appeal sample, such superseded certificate or sample shall become null and void and shall not thereafter be used to represent the tobacco described therein. If the original and the copies of the old certificate were not delivered to the appeal inspector for cancellation, the appeal inspector shall notify such persons or firms as he may consider necessary to prevent fraudulent use of any such null and void certificate.

A separate certificate shall be issued for each lot of tobacco inspected or weighed, except when a certificate covering two or more lots is specifically authorized by the Director. In case of a lost or destroyed certificate, a duplicate thereof may be issued under the same number, date, and name by an authorized supervising official. Any such duplicate certificate shall be plainly marked “Duplicate” above the signature of the supervising official who issued it.

                  The determination of type, grade, size, form, condition, or other tobacco characteristics shall be based upon a thorough examination of the lot of tobacco to be certificated or an official sample of such lot. The certification of a lot of tobacco shall be a true representation of the lot, or of the official sample, at the time of inspection.
                
                
                  § 29.110
                  Method of sampling.
                  In sampling tobacco under the Act, at least three breaks shall be made at different points in the lot, and in the discretion of the sampler as many more breaks shall be made as seem necessary to show the range of the entire lot. From the breaks so made tobacco to be used in the official sample shall be selected. The official shall, so far as practicable, include tobacco of each quality, color, length, and other characteristics found in the lot in such proportions as would truly represent the lot. In case a lot is found to be damaged, nested, or in doubtful keeping order, the official sample tag shall be so marked. Official sample tags shall be attached to the sample, in a manner prescribed by the Director.
                
                
                  § 29.111
                  Weight determinations.
                  Daily before weighing any tobacco for the purposes of the Act, a weigher shall verify the accuracy of the scales to be used by him. Except as may be otherwise specified by the Director, all weights certificated shall be within an accuracy of 1 pound.
                
                
                  § 29.112
                  Proper light.
                  Tobacco shall not be inspected or sampled for the purposes of the Act except when displayed in proper light for correct determination of grade or other characteristics of tobacco. No tobacco shall be inspected or sampled for the purposes of the Act in the direct rays of the sun or by any artificial light which does not permit the inspector correctly to determine the grade or other characteristics of tobacco.
                
                
                  § 29.113
                  Suspension and termination.
                  The license of an inspector, sampler, or weigher may be suspended, pending final action by the Secretary, by any official authorized to countersign licenses whenever he considers such action to be for the best interest of the service. The designation of an appeal inspector may be withdrawn at any time by the Division. Before the license of an inspector, sampler, or weigher is terminated or revoked pursuant to the Act and the regulations in this subpart, such appointee or licensee shall be furnished by the Secretary, or his designated representative, with a written statement specifying the charges, and within 7 days after his suspension, the licensee may file an appeal in writing with the Secretary supported by any evidence he may wish to offer in connection therewith.
                
              
              
                fees and charges
                
                  § 29.123
                  Fees and charges.

                  Fees and charges for tobacco inspection and certification service shall be collected by the Director to cover, insofar as practicable, all costs of the services, including establishment of standards, administrative, and supervisory costs, as follows:
                  (a) Mandatory inspection. For each year, AMS will calculate the rate for services, per hour per program employee as described in § 29.123(b) and (c). The fee shall be paid by sellers of tobacco and assessed against the warehouse or receiving station operator irrespective of ownership or interest in the tobacco. When the warehouse or receiving station operator pays the Department, it is presumed the fee was collected from the seller. Inspection and related services shall be suspended or denied if the warehouse or receiving station operator fails to pay the fees and charges imposed under this section. The fee shall be based on total poundage of tobacco inspected and sold during each calendar month. The fee shall be due and payable on the first day of the immediately following month and on the day immediately following the last sale each marketing year. Mandatory inspection and certification services shall take precedence over permissive inspections, other than reinspections.
                  (b) Domestic permissive inspection and certification—(1) Regular rate. The total AMS grading, inspection, or sampling program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase, plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.
                  (2) Overtime rate. The total AMS grading, inspection, or sampling program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 1.5 plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.
                  (3) Holiday rate. The total AMS grading, inspection, or sampling program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 2, plus benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.
                  (4) Applicability. The fees in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section shall be applicable for hogshead, bale cases, or sample inspections.
                  (c)(1) For each calendar year, based on previous fiscal year/historical actual costs, AMS will calculate the benefits, operating, and allowance for bad debt components of the regular, overtime and holiday rates as follows:
                  (i) Benefits rate. The total AMS grading, inspection, or sampling program direct benefits costs divided by the total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the next calendar year's percentage cost of living increase. Some examples of direct benefits are health insurance, retirement, life insurance, and Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement basic and matching contributions.
                  (ii) Operating rate. The total AMS grading, inspection, or sampling program operating costs divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the percentage of inflation.
                  (iii) Allowance for bad debt rate. Total AMS grading, inspection, or sampling program allowance for bad debt divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked.
                  (2) The calendar year cost of living expenses and percentage of inflation factors used in the formulas in this section are based on the most recent Office of Management and Budget's Presidential Economic Assumptions.
                  (d) Export permissive inspection and certification. The inspection and certification fee for export tobacco will be determined as described in § 29.123(b) and (c).

                  (e) Fees and charges fixed in accordance with this subpart shall be paid by the applicant or person obtaining the service in accordance with a statement rendered by the Division. A deposit to cover all, or a part of, fees and charges for services to be rendered may be required by the Division. Fees for services rendered shall be remitted by check or draft made payable to “Agricultural Marketing Service”, United States Department of Agriculture.
                  
                  (f) Fees for special tests and services will be determined by agreement between the Deputy Administrator, Tobacco Programs, and the applicant or applicants for service.

                  An inspector, sampler, or weigher, when authorized by the Division, may of his own initiative, or upon the request of an interested party, review for the purpose of verification or confirmation any tobacco which he has certificated, and any supervising official may review the work of any inspector, sampler, or weigher: Provided, That such review shall not be made if the ownership of the tobacco involved has changed since the date of certification, unless there is intimation or evidence of deterioration or of irregularities or fraud in connection with the certification or sampling. When such review discloses an error in the certification, the inspector, sampler, or weigher concerned, or supervising official shall immediately correct the error by making an appropriate change in the certificate or by canceling the certificate and issuing a new certificate in lieu thereof. Any correction made on a certificate shall be initialed by the issuing official or by the supervising official. When a new certificate is issued for a lot of tobacco, the old certificate and copies thereof shall become null and void and shall not thereafter be used to represent the tobacco described therein.

                  Elements of quality and degrees of each element.
                  These standardized words or terms are used to describe tobacco quality and to assist in interpreting grade specifications. Tobacco attributes or characteristics which constitute quality are designated as elements of quality. The range within each element is expressed by the use of words or terms designated as degrees. These several degrees are arranged to show their relative value, but the actual value of each degree varies with group.

                  § 29.1107
                  Rule 1.
                  Each grade shall be treated as a subdivision of a particular type. When the grade is stated in an inspection certificate, the type also shall be stated.
                
                
                  § 29.1108
                  Rule 2.
                  The determination of a grade shall be based upon a thorough examination of a lot of tobacco or of an official sample of the lot.
                
                
                  § 29.1109
                  Rule 3.
                  In drawing an official sample from a hogshead or other package of tobacco, three or more breaks shall be made at such points and in such manner as the inspector or sampler may find necessary to determine the kinds of tobacco and the percentage of each kind contained in the lot. All breaks shall be made so that the tobacco contained in the center of the package is visible to the sampler, except for baled tobacco that is not opened for inspection (see Rule 30). Tobacco shall be drawn from at least three breaks from which a representative sample shall be selected. The sample shall include tobacco of each different group, quality, color, length, and kind found in the lot in proportion to the quantities of each contained in the lot.

                  Rule 5.
                  The grade assigned to any lot of tobacco shall be a true representation of the tobacco at the time of inspection and certification. If, at any time, it is found that a lot of tobacco does not comply with the specifications of the grade previously assigned, it shall not thereafter be represented as such grade.

                  The application of these official standard grades shall be in accordance with the following rules.
                
                
                  § 29.2392
                  Rule 1.
                  Each grade shall be treated as a subdivision of a particular type. When the grade is stated in an inspection certificate, the type also shall be stated.
                
                
                  § 29.2393
                  Rule 2.
                  The determination of a grade shall be based upon a thorough examination of a lot of tobacco or of an official sample of the lot.
                
                
                  § 29.2394
                  Rule 3.
                  In drawing an official sample from a hogshead or other package of tobacco, two or more breaks shall be made at such points and in such manner as the inspector or sampler may find necessary to determine the kinds of tobacco and the percentage of each kind contained in the lot. All breaks shall be made so that the tobacco contained in the center of the package is visible to the sampler. Tobacco shall be drawn from at least two breaks from which a representative sample shall be selected.
                
                
                  § 29.2395

                  § 29.2396
                  Rule 5.
                  The grade assigned to any lot of tobacco shall be a true representation of the tobacco at the time of inspection and certification. If, at any time, it is found that a lot of tobacco does not comply with the specifications of the grade previously assigned it shall not thereafter be represented as such grade.
                
                
                  § 29.2397
                  Rule 6.
                  A lot of tobacco on the marginal line between two colors shall be placed in the color with which it best corresponds with respect to body or other associated elements of quality.
                
                
                  § 29.2398

                  Any lot of tobacco which meets the specifications of two grades shall be placed in the higher grade. Any lot of tobacco on the marginal line between two grades shall be placed in the lower grade.
                
                
                  § 29.2399
                  Rule 8.
                  A lot of tobacco meets the specifications of a grade when it is not lower in any degree of any element of quality than the minimum specifications of such grade.
                
                
                  § 29.2400
                  Rule 9.
                  In determining the grade of a lot of tobacco, the lot as a whole shall be considered. Minor irregularities which do not affect over 1 percent of the tobacco shall be overlooked.
                
                
                  § 29.2401
                  Rule 10.
                  Any special factor symbol approved by the Director of the Tobacco Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, may be used after a grademark to show a peculiar side or characteristic of the tobacco which tends to modify the grade.

                  Rule 12.

                  The use of any grade may be restricted by the Director during any marketing season, when it is found that the grade is not needed or appears in insufficient volume to justify its use.

                  Rule 15.
                  Uniformity shall be expressed in percentages. These percentages shall govern the portion of a lot which must meet each specification of the grade. The minor portion must be closely related but may be of a different group, quality, and color from the major portion. Specified percentages of uniformity shall not affect limitations established by other rules.

                  Rule 1.
                  Each grade shall be treated as a subdivision of a particular type. When the grade is stated in an inspection certificate, the type also shall be stated.
                
                
                  
                  § 29.2618
                  Rule 2.
                  The determination of a grade shall be based upon a thorough examination of a lot of tobacco or of an official sample of the lot.
                
                
                  § 29.2619
                  Rule 3.
                  In drawing an official sample from a hogshead or other package of tobacco, two or more breaks shall be made at such points and in such manner as the inspector or sampler may find necessary to determine the kinds of tobacco and the percentage of each kind contained in the lot. All breaks shall be made so that the tobacco contained in the center of the package is visible to the sampler. Tobacco shall be drawn from at least two breaks from which a representative sample shall be selected.

                  Rule 5.
                  The grade assigned to any lot of tobacco shall be a true representation of the tobacco at the time of inspection and certification. If, at any time, it is found that a lot of tobacco does not comply with the specifications of the grade previously assigned it shall not thereafter be represented as such grade.
                
                
                  § 29.2622
                  Rule 6.
                  A lot of tobacco on the marginal line between two colors shall be placed in the color with which it best corresponds with respect to body or other associated elements of quality.
                
                
                  § 29.2623

                  Any lot of tobacco which meets the specifications of two grades shall be placed in the higher grade. Any lot of tobacco on the marginal line between two grades shall be placed in the lower grade.
                
                
                  § 29.2624
                  Rule 8.
                  A lot of tobacco meets the specifications of a grade when it is not lower in any degree of any element of quality than the minimum specifications of such grade.
                
                
                  § 29.2625
                  Rule 9.
                  In determining the grade of a lot of tobacco, the lot as a whole shall be considered. Minor irregularities which do not affect over one percent of the tobacco shall be overlooked.
                
                
                  § 29.2626
                  Rule 10.
                  Any special factor approved by the Director of the Tobacco Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, may be used to show a peculiar side or characteristic of the tobacco which tends to modify the grade.

                  § 29.3104
                  Rule 1.
                  Each grade shall be treated as a subdivision of a particular type. When the grade is stated in an inspection certificate, the type also shall be stated.
                
                
                  § 29.3105
                  Rule 2.
                  The determination of a grade shall be based upon a thorough examination of a lot of tobacco or of an official sample of the lot.
                
                
                  § 29.3106
                  Rule 3.
                  In drawing an official sample from a hogshead or other package of tobacco, three or more breaks shall be made at such points and in such manner as the inspector or sampler may find necessary to determine the kinds of tobacco and the percentage of each kind contained in the lot. One break shall be made not more than six inches from the top of the package and one not more than six inches from the bottom. All breaks shall be made so that the tobacco contained in the center of the package is visible to the sampler. Tobacco shall be drawn from at least three breaks from which a representative sample shall be selected. The sample shall include tobacco of each different group, quality, color, length, and kind found in the lot in proportion to the quantities of each contained in the lot.

                  Rule 4.
                  The grade assigned to any lot of tobacco shall be a true representation of the tobacco at the time of inspection and certification. If, at any time, it is found that a lot of tobacco does not comply with the specifications of the grade previously assigned, it shall not thereafter be represented as such grade.

                  Degrees of uniformity shall be expressed in terms of percentages. The percentages shall govern the portion of a lot which must meet the specifications of the grade. The minor portion must be closely related but may be of a different group, quality, and color from the major portion. These percentages shall not affect limitations established by other rules.

                  Rule 1.
                  Each grade shall be treated as a subdivision of a particular type. When the grade is stated in an inspection certificate, the type also shall be stated.
                
                
                  § 29.3603
                  Rule 2.
                  The determination of a grade shall be based upon a thorough examination of a lot of tobacco or of an official sample of the lot.
                
                
                  § 29.3604
                  Rule 3.
                  In drawing an official sample from a hogshead or other package of tobacco, three or more breaks shall be made at such points and in such manner as the inspector or sampler may find necessary to determine the kinds of tobacco and the percentage of each kind contained in the lot. All breaks shall be made so that the tobacco contained in the center of the package is visible to the sampler. Tobacco shall be drawn from at least three breaks from which a representative sample shall be selected. The sample shall include tobacco of each different group, quality, color, length, and kind found in the lot in proportion to the quantities of each contained in the lot.

                  Rule 5.
                  The grade assigned to any lot of tobacco shall be a true representation of the tobacco at the time of inspection and certification. If, at any time, it is found that a lot of tobacco does not comply with the specifications of the grade previously assigned it shall not thereafter be represented as such grade.

                  § 29.3609
                  Rule 8.
                  A lot of tobacco meets the specifications of a grade when it is not lower in any degree of any element of quality than the minimum specifications of such grade.
                
                
                  § 29.3610
                  Rule 9.
                  In determining the grade of a lot of tobacco, the lot as a whole shall be considered. Minor irregularities which do not affect over one percent of the tobacco shall be overlooked.

                  Rule 14.
                  Degrees of uniformity shall be expressed in terms of percentages. The percentages shall govern the portion of a lot which must meet the specifications of the grade. The minor portion must be closely related but may be of a different group, quality, and color from the major portion. These percentages shall not affect limitations established by other rules.

                  § 29.6086
                  Rules.
                  The application of these official standard grades shall be in accordance with the following rules.
                
                
                  § 29.6087
                  Rule 1.
                  Each grade shall be treated as a subdivision of a particular type. When the grade is stated in an inspection certificate, the type also shall be stated.
                
                
                  § 29.6088
                  Rule 2.
                  The determination of grade shall be based upon a representative sample or a thorough examination of a packing of tobacco.
                
                
                  § 29.6089
                  Rule 3.
                  The grade of unsorted tobacco shall be based upon a representative sample of the packing. A minimum of 10 percent of the bundles or bales shall be selected at random for sampling; a higher percentage may be sampled at the discretion of the inspector. To obtain the sample, a sufficient amount of tobacco shall be drawn to be representative of each selected bale. In determining the grade, the inspector shall consider the quality of all samples. The grade assigned shall represent the quality of the lot as a whole.
                
                
                  § 29.6090
                  Rule 4.
                  Standard grades shall be assigned to clean and sound tobacco only.
                
                
                  
                  § 29.6091
                  Rule 5.
                  Tobacco leaves shall be placed straight in bundles or bales of normal weight, size, and shape with the butts out and tips overlapping from 6 to 8 inches or sufficiently to make a level, solid, and uniform pack. The sides of the bundles shall be completely covered with paper, or other suitable protective material, and tightly bound with not less than three large twines spaced so that the tobacco will be held securely together. Improperly packed tobacco shall be designated as “No—G.”
                
                
                  § 29.6092
                  Rule 6.
                  The grade assigned to any lot of tobacco shall be a true representation of the tobacco at the time of inspection and certification. If, at any time, it is found that a lot of tobacco does not comply with the specifications of the grade previously assigned, it shall not thereafter be represented as such grade.
                
                
                  § 29.6093
                  Rule 7.
                  Any lot of tobacco which meets the specifications of two grades shall be placed in the higher grade. Any lot of tobacco on the marginal line between two grades shall be placed in the lower grade.
                
                
                  § 29.6094
                  Rule 8.
                  A lot of tobacco meets the specifications of a grade when it is not lower in any degree of any element of quality than the minimum specifications of such grade.
                
                
                  § 29.6095
                  Rule 9.
                  In determining the grade of a lot of tobacco, the lot as a whole shall be considered. Minor irregularities which do not affect over one percent of the tobacco shall be overlooked.
                
                
                  § 29.6096
                  Rule 10.
                  Interpretations, the use of specifications, and the meaning of terms shall be in accordance with determinations or clarifications made by the Chief of the Standardization Branch and approved by the Director of the Tobacco Division, Agricultural Marketing Service.
                
                
                  § 29.6097
                  Rule 11.
                  The use of any grade may be restricted by the Director during any marketing season when it is found that the grade is not needed or appears in insufficient volume to justify its use.
                
                
                  § 29.6098
                  Rule 12.
                  Uniformity shall be expressed in percentages. These percentages shall govern the portion of a lot which must meet each specification of the grade; the remaining portion must be related. Grade specifications state the minimum acceptable degree of each element of quality. Specified percentages of uniformity shall not affect limitations established by other rules.
                
                
                  § 29.6099
                  Rule 13.
                  Injury tolerance shall be expressed in percentages. The appraisal of injury shall be based upon the percentage of affected leaf surface or the degree of injury, and consideration shall be given to the kinds of injury normal to the group or grade.
                
                
                  § 29.6100
                  Rule 14.
                  Stem rot shall not exceed 40 percent of the specified injury tolerance for any grade.
                
                
                  § 29.6101
                  Rule 15.
                  In grade specifications the tolerance of crude shall apply to the entire leaf surface of the lot.
                
                
                  § 29.6102
                  Rule 16.
                  In grade specifications frozen shall be treated as a separate kind of injury and the tolerance shall apply to the entire leaf surface of the lot.
                
                
                  § 29.6103
                  Rule 17.
                  Tobacco shall be designated as No Grade, using the grademark “No—G,” when it is damaged, dirty, nested, offtype, semicured, wet, improperly packed, contains foreign matter, or has an odor foreign to the type.
                
                
                  § 29.6104
                  Rule 18.

                  Burn shall be determined as the average burning time of leaves selected at random from the sample. A minimum of 10 leaves shall be selected as representative regardless of the number of bundles or bales in the lot. All burn tests shall be made in the bindercutting area on the same side of the leaf. The leaf shall be punctured to permit quick ignition when placed over a candle, alcohol lamp, or electrical-lighting device. Good burn shall average 6 seconds or longer; fair burn, 3 to 5 seconds; and poor burn, under 3 seconds. B1 and B2 shall require good burn and B3, fair burn.

                Sec. 5, 49 Stat. 732, as amended by sec. 157(a)(1), 95 Stat. 374 (7 U.S.C. 511d).
              
              
                § 29.8001
                Designation of tobacco markets.

                The Act of Congress approved August 23, 1935 (49 Stat. 731; 7 U.S.C., Chapter 21A) entitled “The Tobacco Inspection Act” contains the following provisions:
                
                
                  Sec. 2. That transactions in tobacco involving the sale thereof at auction as commonly conducted at auction markets are affected with a public interest; that such transactions are carried on by tobacco producers generally and by persons engaged in the business of buying and selling tobacco in commerce; that the classification of tobacco according to type, grade, and other characteristics affects the prices received therefor by producers; that without uniform standards of classification and inspection the evaluation of tobacco is susceptible to speculation, manipulation, and control, and unreasonable fluctuations in prices and quality determinations occur which are detrimental to producers and persons handling tobacco in commerce; that such fluctuations constitute a burden upon commerce and make the use of uniform standards of classification and inspection imperative for the protection of producers and others engaged in commerce and the public interested therein. * * *

                  Sec. 5. That the Secretary is authorized to designate those auction markets where tobacco bought and sold thereon at auction, or the products customarily manufactured therefrom, moves in commerce. Before any market is designated by the Secretary under this section he shall determine by referendum the desire of tobacco growers who sold tobacco at auction on such market during the preceding marketing season. The Secretary may at his discretion hold one referendum for two or more markets or for all markets in a type area. No market or group of markets shall be designated by the Secretary unless two-thirds of the growers voting favor it. The Secretary shall have access to the tobacco records of the Collector of Internal Revenue and of the several collectors of internal revenue for the purpose of obtaining the names and addresses of growers who sold tobacco on any auction market, and the Secretary shall determine from said records the eligibility of such grower to vote in such referendum, and no grower shall be eligible to vote in more than one referendum. After public notice of not less than thirty days that any auction market has been so designated by the Secretary, no tobacco shall be offered for sale at auction on such market until it shall have been inspected and certified by an authorized representative of the Secretary according to the standards established under this Act, except that the Secretary may temporarily suspend the requirement of inspection and certification at any designated market whenever he finds it impracticable to provide for such inspection and certification because competent inspectors are not obtainable or because the quantity of tobacco available for inspection is insufficient to justify the cost of such service: Provided, That, in the event competent inspectors are not available, or for other reasons, the Secretary is unable to provide for such inspection and certification at all auction markets within a type area, he shall first designate those auction markets where the greatest number of growers may be served with the facilities available to him. No fee or charge shall be imposed or collected for inspection or certification under this section at any designated auction market. Nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to prevent transactions in tobacco at markets not designated by the Secretary or at designated markets where the Secretary has suspended the requirement of inspection or to authorize the Secretary to close any market.

                  Policy statement.
                  Public Law 97-98 enacted on December 22, 1981, amended section 320 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, to preserve the effectiveness of the tobacco program by discouraging the production of tobacco not under quota in states where tobacco farmers have elected to comply with marketing quotas. Under the amendment, any tobacco represented by the producer as nonquota which is produced in a state where producers have approved marketing quotas shall be determined to be subject to marketing quotas for the quota tobacco produced in that state having the highest price support, with the specific exemptions provided for in section 320(b) and set out in 7 CFR parts 724, 725, and 726 of these regulations. The regulations in this subpart set out procedures for requesting a Tobacco Classification Certificate which would certify that the inspected tobacco is readily and distinguishably different from all kinds of quota tobacco, as determined through application of the standards for inspection and identification of tobacco.

                  In certifications based on permissive inspection of nonquota tobacco produced in a state where any quota tobacco is produced, the inspector shall use the Official Standard Grades for all types of quota tobacco. The inspector shall determine by inspecting each lot in the crop-lot whether the crop-lot can be certified as the nonquota tobacco requested by the applicant. If the inspector determines upon inspection that any individual lot in the crop-lot meets the specifications of any grade of any quota tobacco, no certificate will be issued on any tobacco in the crop-lot.

                § 29.9402
                Policy statement.
                The sets of inspectors available to serve the flue-cured marketing areas are currently adequate to provide inspection service as rapidly as tobacco can be purchased, handled and processed by the currently existing facilities of the buyers, and the lack of inspection personnel is not a limiting factor to accelerated marketings or the extension of price support to producers. The sets of buyers assigned to the flue-cured markets by the buying industry are adequate to purchase tobacco as rapidly as it can be handled and processed by the buyers' facilities. However, the tobacco ready for marketing during most weeks of the marketing season substantially exceeds the quantities which can be purchased, handled and processed by the currently existing facilities of the buyers. Moreover, the total number of flue-cured markets are substantially greater than the number of sets of buyers assigned by the buying companies or the number of sets of available inspectors. In this situation, about 6 months is required to market a year's crop of flue-cured tobacco and all warehouses cannot be served at the same time by the available sets of inspectors and the sets of buyers assigned by the buying companies. As additional sets of inspectors would not relieve the situation, inspection service will be provided by assigning the available inspectors to the various marketing areas and to warehouses within the marketing areas in a manner determined by the Secretary to provide the best and most equitable service to all growers.
              
              
                § 29.9403
                Flue-Cured Tobacco Advisory Committee.
                To assist the Secretary in making the apportionment and assignment of inspectors, a Flue-Cured Tobacco Advisory Committee, appointed in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. appendix I), shall advise and recommend to the Secretary marketing area opening dates and selling schedules for both designated and undesignated flue-cured tobacco to be sold in each marketing area and in each warehouse within each marketing area.
                [39 FR 30475, Aug. 23, 1974, as amended at 49 FR 4067, Feb. 2, 1984; 50 FR 45806, Nov. 4, 1985; 51 FR 5987, Feb. 19, 1986; 67 FR 61468, Oct. 1, 2002]
              
              
                § 29.9404
                Marketing area opening dates and marketing schedules.
                (a) The Flue-Cured Tobacco Advisory Committee shall recommend, to the Secretary, marketing areas in the flue-cured tobacco production area and marketing area opening dates and selling schedules for both designated and undesignated tobacco for each marketing area and for the individual warehouses in each marketing area, which specify the length of time inspectors will be available to inspect designated tobacco and undesignated tobacco and/or the quantity of designated or undesignated tobacco to be marketed in each area and through each warehouse within such marketing area. In developing such opening date and selling schedules, the Committee shall take into account the following:
                (1) When a sufficient volume of tobacco produced within a specific area of the flue-cured tobacco production area will be ready for marketing;
                (2) The volume of tobacco ready for marketing which the producers have designated under § 1464.2(e) of this title to be sold at specific warehouses and also the volume of tobacco ready for marketing which has not been so designated by the producer;

                (3) With regard to undesignated tobacco, the Committee shall first determine, on the basis of all information available to it, the volume of undesignated tobacco in a geographical area, and then shall provide sales opportunity for each warehouse to sell an amount of the undesignated tobacco available for sale from that geographical area in proportion to the amount of tobacco designated to the warehouse in comparison to the total amount of tobacco designated in the marketing area in which the warehouse is located. Provided, however, that the Secretary may authorize additional undesignated sales opportunity if the warehouse provided proper proof that it does, in fact, have available for sale a volume of tobacco which has not previously been designated and which was eligible for designation to that warehouse had the producer chosen to designate and that such additional volume of tobacco warrants more sales opportunity than allowed by the schedule;
                (4) The processing or redrying capacity of the industry and the number of inspectors available to provide inspection service during the specific period involved;
                (5) Such other factors or information as may be necessary to develop an effective and equitable opening date and selling schedule.
                (b) The Flue-Cured Tobacco Advisory Committee shall thereupon submit its recommended opening date and selling schedules for designated and undesignated tobacco and the geographic areas to be included in specific marketing areas to the Secretary together with a basis supporting its recommendations.

                § 29.9405
                Issuance of marketing area opening date and selling schedules by the Secretary.
                (a) The Secretary shall review the recommendations of the Flue-Cured Tobacco Advisory Committee and based upon such recommendations and the basis therefor and such other information as may be available to him, shall specify the geographic areas to be encompassed by specific marketing areas, set the opening dates for sale within the marketing areas and issue the selling schedules for designated and undesignated tobacco. The inspection of flue-cured tobacco shall be in accordance with said schedules.
                (b) The Flue-Cured Tobacco Advisory Committee shall recommend modifications in the opening date and marketing schedule during the flue-cured tobacco marketing season as may be warranted by changes in marketing conditions and the Secretary shall act thereon in the same manner as approving the initial opening date and marketing schedules.

                § 29.9406
                Failure of warehouse to comply with opening and selling schedule.
                (a) Each warehouse shall comply with opening and selling schedules issued by the Secretary for designated and undesignated flue-cured tobacco.
                (b) For each of any two consecutive sales days during the marketing season a warehouse may exceed its scheduled sales opportunity for designated or undesignated tobacco, but the pounds sold during the second or third sales day must be adjusted so the warehouse will be back in compliance at the end of the third sales day or no tobacco inspection or price support services will be made available on the next succeeding sales day. Any such adjustment which is within 100 pounds of the required reduction shall be considered as in compliance with this section. During the closeout period, if a warehouse sells tobacco in excess of that allowed by the sales schedule on either of the last two sales days of the marketing season, then such excess sales shall be deducted from its scheduled sales opportunity on the first, or more, sales days of the next marketing season.
                (c) The amount of the poundage adjustment specified in paragraph (b) of this section for a warehouse selling in excess of the sales schedule shall be as follows:

                (1) If the excess is 5,000 pounds or less of designated producer tobacco, the adjustment in producer sales opportunity shall be one pound for each pound of excess; sales in excess of 5,000 pounds shall be a violation of the sales schedule and the adjustment for the first violation shall be 5,000 pounds plus the larger of 3 pounds for each pound in excess of 5,000 pounds or 5,000 pounds; for the second violation, the adjustment shall be 5,000 pounds plus the larger of 5 pounds for each pound in excess of 5,000 or 15,000 pounds; and for the third and subsequent violations, the adjustment shall be 5,000 pounds plus the larger of 5 pounds for each pound in excess of 5,000 pounds or 50 percent of a scheduled day's sales opportunity.
                (2) If the excess is 1,000 pounds or less of undesignated producer tobacco, the adjustment in producers sales opportunity is one pound for each pound of excess; if the excess is larger than 1,000 pounds, the adjustment is 1,000 pounds plus the larger of 3 pounds for each pound in excess of 1,000 or 2,000 pounds.
                (3) If the excess is designated producer tobacco that is not eligible for sale at the warehouse on the day of the sale, the adjustment in producers sales opportunity for the first violation is the larger of 3 pounds for each pound in excess or 5,000 pounds, and for the second and succeeding violations, the larger of 5 pounds for each pound in excess or 10,000 pounds.
                (d) If, on any sales day, a warehouse does not sell the full quantity of designated or undesignated tobacco authorized to be sold at such warehouse, the designated or undesignated sales opportunity at such warehouse on the next immediate sales day shall automatically be increased by the unsold quantity except that no such increase in sales opportunity shall exceed 5,000 pounds for designated tobacco or 500 pounds for undesignated tobacco.

                (b) Each warehouse shall keep records for a period of two years from the opening of the marketing season in which the tobacco is sold, and make available to the Secretary such records as are necessary for the Secretary to verify the information required by paragraph (a) of this section.
                (c) Failure to comply with the requirements of this section including but not limited to failure to provide information which is accurate, shall result in suspension of tobacco inspection services for a minimum of the equivalent of one sales day or until such time as the warehouse comes into compliance.

              § 36.1
              General information.
              The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS or agency) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) facilitates the fair and efficient marketing of agricultural products by promulgating voluntary official grade standards for dairy, fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, livestock, meats and meat products, eggs, poultry and rabbit products, tobacco, wool, mohair, and other agricultural products. AMS standards provide a uniform language for describing the quality of various agricultural commodities in the marketplace. These standards may cover (but are not limited to) terms, classes, sizes (including quantities of packaged consumer agricultural commodities), dimensions, capacities, quality levels, performance criteria, inspection requirements, marking requirements, testing equipment, test procedures, and installation procedures.
              (a) Grade standards are officially designated as U.S. Grade Standards and the AMS assigns each grade standard an appropriate identification number. AMS develops, revises, suspends, or terminates official grade standards under procedures that allows for input by interested parties.
              (b) These procedures set forth the process by which AMS will develop, revise, suspend, or terminate the U.S. standards.
              (c) Communications about AMS standards in general should be addressed to the Administrator, Attention: Functional Committee for Standards. Communications about specific standards (such as a request to develop or revise a standard) should be addressed to the Director of the appropriate Division (Dairy, Fruit and Vegetable, Livestock and Seed, Poultry, or Tobacco). All communications should include in the address: Agricultural Marketing Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090-6456.
            
            
              § 36.2
              Initiating action on grade standards.
              The Agency will develop, revise, suspend, or terminate grade standards if it determines that such action is in the public interest. Any standardization action should reflect the broad interest of individuals or an industry involved in manufacturing, producing, packaging, distributing, testing, consuming, or using the product; or the interest of a Federal, State, or local agency. Proposed actions should always be based on sound technical and marketing information and should include careful consideration of the factors that determine a commodity's quality and condition and that will allow trained personnel to determine objectively conformance or non-conformance.
              (a) AMS encourages interested parties to participate in the review, development, and revision of grade standards. Interested parties include growers, producers, processors, shippers, distributors, consumers, individuals or groups, trade associations, companies, and State or Federal agencies. Such groups and individuals may at any time recommend that AMS develop, revise suspend, or terminate a grade standard. Requests for Agency action should be in writing, preferably accompanied by a draft of the suggested change.
              (1) The Agency, in cooperation with interested parties, as applicable, will:
              (i) Determine the need for new or revised standards;
              (ii) Collect technical, marketing, or other appropriate data;
              (iii) Conduct research regarding new or revised standards, as appropriate; and,
              (iv) Draft the proposed standards;
              (2) [Reserved]
              (b) If the Agency determines that new standards are needed, existing standards need to be revised, or the suspension or termination of existing standards is justified, it will undertake the action, with input from all interested parties.
            
            
              
              § 36.3
              Public notification of grade standards action.

              After developing a standardization proposal, the Agency will publish a notice in the Federal Register describing new or changes to existing standards or to suspend or terminate existing standards. AMS will simultaneously issue a news release about these actions. AMS will also distribute copies of the full text of the proposals to anyone requesting a copy or to anyone the Agency believes may be interested, including other Federal, State, or local government agencies, and on the Internet. For other than minor editorial or technical changes, the notice will provide at least 60 days for interested parties to submit comments to the Agency.
              (a) All comments received within the comment period will be part of the public record maintained by the Agency, will be available to the public for review, and will be considered by the Agency before final action is taken on the proposal.
              (1) Based on the comments received, the Agency's knowledge of standards, grading, marketing, and other technical factors, and any other relevant information AMS will decide whether the proposed actions should be implemented.

              (2) If AMS concludes that the actions as proposed or with minor modifications should be adopted, AMS will publish a description of the changes or actions in a Federal Register notice. The Agency, through the appropriate AMS Divisions, will make the grade standards and related information available in printed form and electronic media.

              (3) If the Agency determines that proposed changes are not warranted, or otherwise are not in the public interest, the Agency will either publish in the Federal Register a notice withdrawing the proposal, or will revise the proposal and again seek public input.

                Definitions, general.
                For the purpose of this part, unless the context otherwise requires, the following terms shall be construed, respectively, to mean:
                
                  Acceptable Quality Level (AQL). The maximum number of defects per hundred units (DHU) which is acceptable as a process average. Lots, or portions of production, having a quality level equal to a specified AQL will be accepted approximately 95 percent of the time when using the sampling plans prescribed for the AQL.
                
                  Acceptance Number (Ac). The number in a sampling plan that indicates the maximum number of defects permitted in a sample in order to consider a lot as meeting a specific requirement.
                
                  Administrator. The Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) of the Department or any other officer or employee of the Agency who is delegated, or who may be delegated the authority to act in the Administrator's stead.
                
                  Basic Inspection Period. A specified period of consecutive production designated for on-line inspection (e.g., one shift's production, one day's production, etc.).
                
                  Condition. The degree of acceptability of the container with respect to freedom from defects which affect the serviceability, including appearance as well as usability, of the container for its intended purpose.
                
                  Cumulative Sum Sampling (CuSum) Plan. An on-line sampling plan that accumulates the number of defects which exceed the subgroup tolerance (“T”) in a series of consecutive subgroups. Terms specified to the CuSum sampling plans are:
                (a) Acceptance Limit (“L”). The maximum accumulation of defects allowed to exceed the subgroup tolerance (“T”) in any subgroup or consecutive subgroups.
                (b) CuSum value. The accumulated number of defects that exceed the subgroup tolerance (“T”).
                (c) Subgroup tolerance (“T”). The allowable number of defects in any subgroup.
                (d) Starting value (“S”). The initial CuSum value used to begin a CuSum sampling plan.
                
                  Defect. Any nonconformance of a container from specified requirements.
                
                  Defect classifications. The terms used to denote the severity of a defect. The terms are as follows:
                (a) Critical defect. A defect that seriously affects, or is likely to seriously affect, the usability of the container for its intended purpose.
                (b) Major defect. A defect that materially affects, or is likely to materially affect, the usability of the container for its intended purpose.
                (c) Minor defect. A defect that materially affects the appearance of the container but is not likely to affect the usability of the container for its intended purpose.
                (d) Insignificant defect. A flaw in the container that does not materially affect the appearance and does not affect usability of the container for its intended purpose. When performing examinations, insignificant defects shall not be recorded.
                
                  Defective. A container which has one or more defects.
                
                  Department. The U.S. Department of Agriculture.
                
                  Double sampling. A sampling scheme which involves use of two independently drawn but related samples, a first sample and a second sample which is added to the first to form a total sample size. A double sampling plan consists of first and total sample sizes with associated acceptance and rejection criteria. The first sample must be inspected first, and if possible, a decision as to acceptance or rejection of the lot made before a second sample is inspected. When the decision cannot be made on the first sample, a second sample is inspected; the decision to accept or reject is based on the total sample size.
                
                  Lot or inspection lot. A collection of filled food containers of the same size, type, and style. The term shall mean “inspection lot,” i.e., a collection of units of product from which a sample is to be drawn and inspected to determine conformance with the applicable acceptance criteria. An inspection lot may differ from a collection of units designated as a lot for other purposes (e.g., production lot, shipping lot, etc.).
                
                  On-line sampling. The random selection of samples from a production line.
                
                  Origin inspection. An inspection made at any location where the filled containers are examined prior to shipment or transfer to the purchaser.
                
                  Primary container. The immediate container in which the product is packaged and which serves to protect, preserve, and maintain the condition of the product. It may be metal, glass, fiber, wood, textile, plastic, paper, or any other suitable type of material and may be supplemented by liners, overwraps, or other protective materials.
                (b) For On-line Sampling. The chance that a portion of production with a given level of quality will be accepted. Probability of acceptance is synonymous with “Percent of Production Expected to be Accepted.” The probability of acceptance is normally designated as “Pa.” In on-line sampling inspection, the probability of acceptance of any portion of production depends on the sample results obtained from the preceding portions. The probability of acceptance values associated with these procedures are the values which would be expected if a large number of samples are to be inspected. For the CuSum plans referenced in this standard, the probability of acceptance at the Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) is approximately 95 percent. The starting value (“S”) associated with each CuSum plan helps to make the probability of acceptance of the first portions of production of a basic inspection period as close as possible to 95 percent.
                
                  Random sampling. A process of selecting a sample from a lot, or portion of production, whereby each unit in the lot of portion of production, has an equal chance of being chosen.
                
                  Rejection number (Re). The number in a sampling plan that indicates the minimum number of defects in a sample that will cause a lot to fail a specific requirement.
                
                  Sample. Any number of sample units which are to be used for inspection.
                
                  Sample size (n). The number of sample units included in the sample.
                
                  Sample unit. The individual container including any component parts.
                
                  Sampling plan. Any plan stating the number of sample units to be included in the sample as well as the corresponding plan parameters used to make acceptance and rejection decisions.
                
                  Secondary container. The container in which one or more primary containers are packed. For example, a shipping case containing canned product.
                
                  Shipping case. The container in which the product or primary containers of the product are placed to protect, preserve, and maintain the condition of the product during transit or storage. The shipping case may include strapping, liners or other protective material.
                
                  Single sampling. A sampling scheme where the decision to accept or reject an inspection lot with respect to a specified requirement is made after the inspection of a single sample. A single sampling plan consists of a single sample size with associated acceptance and rejection criteria.
                
                  Stationary lot sampling. The process of randomly selecting sample units from a lot whose production has been completed. This type of lot is usually stored in a warehouse or in some other storage facility and is offered in its entirety for inspection.
                
                  Subgroup. A group of sample units representing a portion of production.
                
                  Total defects. The sum of critical, major, and minor defects.
                
                
                  User. The person or agency at whose request inspection is conducted.

                § 42.103
                Purpose and scope.
                (a) This subpart outlines the procedure to be used to establish the condition of containers in stationary lots of packaged foods. This subpart shall be used to determine the acceptability of a lot based on specified acceptable quality levels and defects referenced in § 42.104 or any alternative plan which is approved by the Administrator. In addition, any other sampling plan in the tables with a larger first sample size than that indicated by the lot size range may be specified when approved by the Administrator. This subpart or approved alternative plan will be applied when a Government agency or private user of the inspection or grading services requests that filled primary containers or shipping cases, or both, be certified for condition. Unless the request for certification specifically asks that only the primary container or only the shipping case be examined, both containers will be examined.
                (b) Unless otherwise specified by the user of service, this subpart will not apply to inspection lots of less than 50 shipping cases or to inspection lots of less than 300 primary containers. When the primary container is the shipping case, the shipping case limit will apply. When the lot size exceeds either the 50 shipping case limit or the 300 primary container limit or both, the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section will apply.
                (c) Under certain conditions, special procedures (Skip Lot Sampling and Inspection) may be used to determine the condition of containers in stationary lots of packaged foods. Subpart C sets forth the requirements and procedures for Skip Lot Sampling and Inspection.

                § 42.104
                Sampling plans and defects.
                (a) Sampling plans. Sections 42.109 through 42.111 show the number of containers to examine for condition in relation to lot size ranges. The tables provide acceptance (Ac) and rejection (Re) numbers for lot acceptance (or rejection) based on the number, class, and type of defects present in the sample.
                (b) Defects. The tables in § 42.112 enumerate and classify defects according to the degree to which the individual defect affects the serviceability, including appearance as well as usability, of the container for its intended purpose. The table in § 42.113 enumerates and classifies defects of the label, marking, or code.

                § 42.105
                Basis for selection of sample.
                (a) Identification of lot. Selection of proper samples requires sufficient information to identify the lot; such information includes, but is not limited to:
                (1) The lot size (see § 42.103 for restriction on small lots);
                (2) The type and size of container;
                (3) The code marks or other identification marks and the number of containers represented by each mark.
                (4) The history of the lot regarding previous inspections; and
                (5) The inspection status (normal, tightened, or reduced).
                (b) Preliminary scanning. Prior to drawing the sample, the lot should be scanned to determine if any segments or portions are abnormal with respect to wet cases, blown cans, top layer rust, leaking bags, etc. If such segments or portions noted are of any consequence, the lot may be rejected for condition of containers without sampling.
                
                (c) Sample size. Determination of the number of containers to check for condition:
                (1) Refer to the table in §§ 42.109 through 42.111 (sampling plans) and find where the lot size (number of individual containers) fits into the column headed “Lot Size Ranges.”
                (i) Tables I-A (normal), II-A (tightened), or III-A (reduced), as applicable, will apply to origin inspections, unless the contractor requests that corresponding single sampling plans be used.
                (ii) The appropriate double sampling plans in Table I will apply to other than origin inspections, unless the contractor requests that corresponding single sampling plans be used.
                (2) Select the appropriate sample size for the corresponding lot size range as indicated in the appropriate column headed “Sample Size.”
                (3) Lots rejected for unsatisfactory condition of containers may be subsequently sampled after being reconditioned or reworked. Such lots or resulting portion of a lot may be sampled as a reoffered lot providing the reoffered portion is separately identifiable. When making such inspections, the appropriate sampling plan for tightened inspection shall be used. Except in the case of an appeal inspection, it is not permissible to reinspect a previously rejected lot until it has been reconditioned or reworked.
                (d) Sample selection. Select samples from the lot presented in accordance with either of the following two procedures as may be applicable. (A lot offered for inspection will be accepted or rejected in its entirety with either sampling procedure used to select the sample.)
                (1) Proportional random sampling. When the number of codes or other identifying marks within the lot and the approximate number of cases or containers per code are known, select sample units at random within each mark and in a number proportionate to the number of containers represented by such mark.
                (2) Simple random sampling. When there are no code or other identifying marks, or when the number of codes or identifying marks within the lot and/or approximate number of cases or containers per mark are not known, select sample units at random from the entire lot.
                (e) Maximum sample units per case. If the lot is cased, predetermine the number of containers to draw from each sampled case as well as the position within the case. Do not restrict the sampling to the top or bottom layers or to the corners. The best sample is one selected from all the various positions in the shipping case. It is desirable but not mandatory to limit the number of sample units to a single container from any one case. Multiple sample units may be taken from a single case but not in excess of the following plan:
                (1) When containers are packed 12 or less to a case, draw a maximum of 6 sample units from any one case; and
                (2) When containers are packed more than 12 to a case but not more than 60, draw a maximum of 12 sample units from any one case; and
                (3) When containers are packed more than 60 to a case but not more than 250, draw a maximum of 16 sample units from any one case; and
                (4) When containers are packed more than 250 in a case, draw a maximum of 24 sample units from any one case.

                § 42.106
                Classifying and recording defects.
                (a) Classifying defects. Examine each sample unit for the applicable type of defects listed in the table covering the container being inspected in §§ 42.112 and 42.113. Other defects, not specifically listed, shall be classified according to their effect on the intended use of the container.

                (1) Related defects are defects on a single container that are related to a single cause. If the initial incident causing one of the defects had not occurred, none of the other related defects on the container would be present. As an example of related defects, a can may be a leaker and the exterior may also be seriously rusted due to the leakage of the contents. In this case, the container is scored only once for these two defects since the rust condition can be attributed to the leak. Score the container according to whichever condition is the most serious. In this example, score as a “leaker” (a critical defect) and not as “pitted rust” (a major defect).
                (2) Unrelated defects are defects on a single container that result from separate causes. If the incident that caused one of the defects had not occurred, the other unrelated defects on the container would still be present. As an example of unrelated defects, a can may be seriously rusted, may have a bad dent along the seam, and the label may also be detached from the can because of improper gluing. In this case it is unlikely that any of the three defects exist because of a common cause. Therefore, they are considered unrelated defects and should be scored as three defects.
                (3) The lot acceptance portion of this procedure is based on the number of defects per 100 containers. It is necessary to determine if the defects on any one container are “related” defects or “unrelated” defects. A container is scored for the most serious of related defects, and is also scored for each unrelated defect.
                (b) Recording defects. Record on a worksheet the number, type, and class (critical, major, or minor) of defects on each sample unit.
                (c) Totaling defects. Add the number of defects in each class, then add the number of minor, major, and critical defects to obtain the total defects.

                § 42.107
                Lot acceptance criteria.
                (a) The acceptability of the lot is determined by relating the number and class of defects enumerated on the worksheet to the acceptance and rejection numbers shown in §§ 42.109 through 42.111 for the respective sample size and Acceptable Quality Level (AQL).
                (b) Unless otherwise specified, use the following AQL's for the respective class of defects:
                
                  
                    Defect class
                    AQL at origin inspection

                    10.0
                  
                
                (c) Refer to the appropriate sample size and AQL and compare the number of defects found in the sample with the acceptance (Ac) and rejection (Re) numbers in the sampling plan.
                (1) Accept the lot after examining the single sample or first sample of a double sampling plan when all of the following conditions are met:
                (i) The number of critical defects does not exceed the applicable acceptance number (Ac) for critical defects, and
                (ii) The number of major defects does not exceed the applicable acceptance number (Ac) for major defects, and
                (iii) The total number of critical, major, and minor defects does not exceed the applicable acceptance number (Ac) for total defects.
                (2) Reject the lot after examining the single sample or first sample of a double sampling plan when any one or more of the following conditions occur:
                (i) The number of critical defects equals or exceeds the applicable rejection number (Re) for critical defects, or
                (ii) The number of major defects equals or exceeds the applicable rejection number (Re) for major defects, or
                (iii) The total number of critical, major, and minor defects equals or exceeds the applicable rejection number (Re) for total defects.
                (3) If the lot can neither be accepted nor rejected on the first sample, when a double sampling plan is used, select and examine the prescribed second sample. Accept the lot if the accumulated defects of the first and second sample meet conditions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, otherwise, reject the lot.

                § 42.108
                Normal, tightened, or reduced inspection.
                (a) Normal inspection. Sampling plans for normal inspection are those in Tables I and I-A. These plans shall be used except when the history of inspection permits reduced inspection or requires tightened inspection.
                (b) Tightened inspection. Sampling plans for tightened inspection are those in Tables II and II-A.
                (c) Reduced inspection. Sampling plans for reduced inspection are those in Tables III and III-A.
                (d) Switching rules. The normal inspection procedure shall be followed except when conditions in paragraph (d) (1) or (3) of this section are applicable or unless otherwise specified. Application of the following switching rules will be restricted to the inspection of lots for one applicant at a single location (plant, warehouse, etc.), and will be based upon records of original inspections of lots (excluding resubmitted lots) at that same location.
                (1) Normal inspection to reduced inspection. When normal inspection is in effect, reduced inspection shall be instituted providing that reduced inspection is considered desirable by the Administrator and further provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied for each class of defect:
                (i) The preceding 10 inspection lots (or more, as indicated by the note to Table III-B) which have been inspected within the preceding 6 months have been on normal inspection and none has been rejected on original inspection; and
                (ii) The total number of defects in the samples from the preceding 10 inspection lots (or such other number of lots used for condition in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) is equal to or less than the applicable number given in Table III-B. If a double sampling plan is used, all samples inspected should be included, not “first” samples only; and
                (2) Reduced inspection to normal inspection. When reduced inspection is in effect, normal inspection shall be reinstituted if any of the following occur:
                (i) An inspection lot is rejected on original inspection; or
                (ii) Production becomes irregular (delayed or accelerated); or
                (iii) Other valid conditions warrant that normal inspection shall be reinstituted.
                (3) Normal inspection to tightened inspection. When normal inspection is in effect, tightened inspection shall be instituted when 2 out of 5 consecutive inspection lots have been rejected on original inspection.
                (4) Tightened inspection to normal inspection. When tightened inspection is in effect, normal inspection shall be reinstituted when five consecutive inspection lots have been considered acceptable on original inspection.
                (e) When the rules require a switch in the inspection status because of one or more classes of defects, all classes of defects shall be inspected under the new inspection criteria. At the option of the user of the service and when approved by the Administrator, such user may elect to remain on normal inspection when qualified for reduced inspection, or on tightened inspection when qualified for normal inspection.
                (f) Appeal inspection—(1) Appeal request. Any interested party who is not satisfied with the results of a condition inspection on packaged food containers, as stated on an official certificate, may request an appeal inspection.
                (2) How to file an appeal. A request for an appeal inspection may be made orally or in writing. If made orally, written confirmation may be required. The applicant shall clearly state the reasons for requesting the appeal service and a description of the product to be appealed.
                (3) When an application for an appeal inspection may be refused. When it appears that: (i) The reasons given in the request are frivolous or not substantial; or (ii) the condition of the containers has undergone a material change since the original inspection; or (iii) the original lot is no longer intact, the applicant's request for the appeal inspection may be refused. In such case, the applicant shall be promptly notified of the reason(s) for such refusal.
                (4) Who shall perform the appeal. An appeal inspection shall be performed by a person(s) other than the person who made the inspection being appealed.
                (5) Sampling procedures. The sampling plan for an appeal inspection shall be the next larger sampling plan from the plan in the table used in the original inspection.
                (6) Appeal certificate. Immediately after an appeal inspection is completed, an appeal certificate shall be issued to show that the original inspection was sustained or was not sustained. Such certificate shall supersede any previously issued certificate for the inspection involved and shall clearly identify the number and date of the superseded certificate. The issuance of the appeal certificate may be withheld until the previously issued certificate and all copies have been returned when such action is deemed necessary to protect the interest of the Government.

                § 42.114
                Procedures for evaluating interior container defects.
                (a) Sections 42.101-42.136 provide procedures for determining lot conformance with the U.S. Standards for Condition of Food Containers. This determination is based on the examination of the external characteristics of the food containers.
                (b) As an option, if a user of the inspection service requests to have the interior characteristics of containers examined, and apply these results in the determination of lot acceptability, the defects listed in Table XII may be used.
                (c) The determination of lot acceptability based on internal container defects shall be independent of the determination of lot acceptability for U.S. Standards for Condition of Food Containers. A user of the inspection service may choose to require inspection for internal can defects as well as inspection for U.S. Standards for Condition of Food Containers.

                (d) If a user of the inspection service requests an examination for internal container defects in addition to an official USDA/USDC inspection for product quality and/or U.S. grade, the containers opened by the official inspection service for inspection of product quality and/or U.S. grade will be used for examination of interior container defects. The minimum sample size for evaluation of interior container defects will be 13 containers. As a result, additional containers will be required if the inspection for quality or U.S. grade calls for fewer than 13 containers. Table XIII provides acceptance numbers for internal container defects for selected sample sizes.

                § 42.120
                Description and qualification.
                Skip lot sampling and inspection are special procedures for inspecting stationary lots in which only one-half or one-fourth of the lots offered for inspection are formally inspected. Skip lot sampling and inspection procedures may be instituted only when all of the following conditions are met:
                (a) When authorized by the Administrator and acceptable to the user and producer, if different from the user.
                (b) When inspection is origin inspection (see § 42.102).
                (c) When all lots can be expected to be of essentially the same quality.
                (d) When lots from the producer are currently on, or eligible to be on, either normal or reduced inspection.
              
              
                § 42.121
                Sampling and inspection procedures.

                (a) Following skip lot procedure authorization, inspect every lot consecutively offered for inspection using normal inspection procedures as set forth in Subpart B of this part. When 10 consecutive lots are acceptable, inspect only one-half of the lots offered for inspection using normal inspection procedures. While on the one-half inspection rate, when 10 consecutively inspected lots are acceptable, inspect only one-fourth of the lots offered for inspection using normal inspection procedures. While on the one-half or one-fourth inspection rate, if any formally inspected lot is unacceptable, revert immediately to the inspection of every lot using normal inspection procedures and recommence the above procedure. See § 42.123 for a flow diagram of the skip lot sampling plan.
                (b) Two exceptions to the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section are as follows:
                (1) The skip lot sampling and inspection rate of one-half can be instituted immediately if the lots from the producer are currently on, or eligible to be on, reduced inspection and all other conditions in § 42.120 are met. After skip lot sampling and inspection begins, however, only normal inspection is permitted.
                (2) While inspecting every lot consecutively as offered for inspection, i.e., while not on the one-half or one-fourth sampling and inspection rate, if requirements for switching from normal to tightened inspection are met as specified in § 42.108 then skip lot procedures terminate, tightened inspection is initiated, and stationary lot sampling and inspection procedures in Subpart B are instituted. Skip lot procedures may be instituted again only when all conditions of § 42.120 are met.
                (c) All lot selections for the one-half and one-fourth inspection rates must be strictly random (for example, not every other lot or every fourth lot). Use of random number tables, coin flipping, or numbered cards is encouraged.
                (d) Preliminary scanning procedures (see § 42.105) shall be used on all lots scheduled for formal inspection and also shall be used on lots not scheduled for inspection (“skipped” lots) whenever the inspector feels such action is prudent to further insure the acceptability of such lots.
              
              
                § 42.122
                Applicability of other procedures.
                Whenever appropriate, the procedures for classifying and recording defects in § 42.106 and for appeal inspections in § 42.108 also apply to skip lot sampling and inspection.

                  1. Only normal inspection is permitted.
                  2. All lot selections for the one-half and one-fourth sampling rates must be strictly random (for example, not every other lot or every fourth lot).

                § 42.130
                Description and qualifications.
                (a) In many instances, food containers are loaded directly into carriers immediately after final packaging. This situation makes stationary lot sampling and inspection impractical. For such circumstances, the optional procedure for on-line sampling and inspection using cumulative sum sampling plans is provided. On-line sampling and inspection is a procedure in which subgroups of sampling units are selected randomly from predesignated portions of production. The acceptability of the portions of production is determined by inspecting, at the time of the sampling, the subgroups which represent these portions. On-line sampling and inspection contrasts with stationary lot procedures in which sample units are selected randomly and inspected and lot acceptability determinations are made only after lot production is completed.
                (b) On-line sampling and inspection procedures may be instituted only when all of the following conditions are met:
                (1) When authorized by the Administrator and acceptable to the user and producer, if different from the user.
                (2) When inspection is origin inspection (see § 42.102).
                (3) When previous production lots from the producer are currently on, or eligible to be on, either normal or reduced inspection. (When shifting from stationary lot sampling and inspection to on-line sampling and inspection, normal on-line inspection shall be initially used.)
                (4) When inspection of the containers is performed at a point after which all condition of container related characteristics are fixed and will not be subject to change during final handling.
              
              
                § 42.131
                Selection of samples.
                (a) Prior to commencement of on-line sampling and inspection, the total amount of production for a given day or shift is predicted and is then subdivided into conveniently designated portions of production approximately equal in size. Portions may be designated by sequential numbers (e.g., containers 1 through 500 are portion 1, containers 501 through 1000 are portion 2, etc.) or by time intervals (e.g., the first half hour of production is portion 1, the second half hour of production is portion 2, etc.) during which the containers are identified by individual production codes for each time interval.
                (b) Determine the number of sample units in a subgroup as follows:
                
                  Type of Inspection and Number of Sample Units
                  Normal—25
                  Tightened—50
                  Reduced—13
                
                
                (c) Subgroups are drawn randomly from portions of production throughout the production process and are inspected for defects. The drawing of sampling units may be done in either of two ways: (1) The number of sample units (13, 25 or 50) comprising a subgroup may be drawn at the same time from a randomly chosen point in the production of each portion, or (2) sample units may be drawn individually, but in a random manner, throughout the production of each portion. At least 6 subgroups must be obtained during each basic inspection period regardless of the system used to designate portions of production.
                (d) A shift to on-line sampling plans from stationary lot sampling plans (or vice versa) during a basic inspection period is not permitted.

                (b) At the beginning of the basic inspection period, the CuSum value is set equal to the starting value (“S”) for the specified CuSum plan. The CuSum value is then determined for each consecutive subgroup as follows:
                (1) Add the number of defects for the present subgroup to the CuSum value of the previous subgroup.
                (2) Subtract the subgroup tolerance (“T”).
                (3) The CuSum value is reset in the following situations; however, determine portion of production acceptability (see § 42.133) prior to resetting the CuSum value:
                (i) Reset the CuSum value to zero (0) if the CuSum value is less than zero (0).
                (ii) Reset the CuSum value to the acceptance limit (“L”) if the CuSum value exceeds the acceptance limit (“L”).

                (a) The acceptability of a portion of production is determined by comparing the calculated CuSum value with the acceptance limit (“L”) for the specified AQL.
                (b) A portion of production is acceptable if the CuSum value, calculated from the subgroup representing that portion, is equal to or less than the acceptance limit (“L”) for all classes of defects.
                (c) A portion of production is rejected if the CuSum value, calculated from the subgroup representing that portion, exceeds the acceptance limit (“L”) for one or more classes of defects.
              
              
                § 42.134
                Disposition of rejected portions of production.
                Rejected portions of production from the same basic inspection period may be reworked, combined together to form a lot, and resubmitted for inspection under the criteria for tightened inspection using stationary lot sampling procedures described in subpart B of this part.
              
              
                § 42.135
                Normal, tightened or reduced on-line inspection.
                (a) Normal, tightened and reduced on-line sampling plans are specified in § 42.132 (Determining cumulative sum values). Normal plans shall be used except when the history of inspection permits reduced inspection or requires tightened inspection.
                (b) Switching rules: Normal on-line inspection procedures shall be followed except when conditions in paragraph (b) (1) or (3) of this section are applicable or unless otherwise specified. Application of the following switching rules will be restricted to the inspection of production for one applicant at a single production location and will be based upon records of original inspections of production (excluding resubmitted portions previously rejected and reworked) at that same location.
                (1) Normal inspection to reduced inspection. When normal inspection is in effect, reduced inspection shall be instituted provided that reduced inspection is considered desirable by the Administrator and further provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied for each class of defect:
                (i) The preceding 40 consecutive portions of production have been on normal inspection and no more than one of these portions has been rejected on original inspection; and
                (ii) The total number of defects in the subgroups (1000 sample units) from these preceding 40 consecutive portions of production is less than or equal to the following limit numbers for the specified AQL's:
                
                  
                    Acceptable quality levels
                    Limit No.

                (2) Reduced inspection to normal inspection. When reduced inspection is in effect, normal inspection shall be reinstituted if any of the following occurs:
                (i) More than one portion of production in any 40 consecutive portions of production is rejected on original inspection; or
                (ii) Production becomes irregular (delayed or accelerated); or
                (iii) Other valid conditions warrant that normal inspection shall be reinstituted.
                (3) Normal inspection to tightened inspection. When normal inspection is in effect, tightened inspection shall be instituted when two out of five consecutive portions of production have been rejected.
                (4) Tightened inspection to normal inspection. When tightened inspection is in effect, normal inspection shall be reinstituted when five consecutive portions of production have been considered acceptable.
                (c) When the rules require a switch in the inspection status because of one or more classes of defects, all classes of defects shall be inspected under the new inspection criteria. At the option of the user of the service, and when approved by the Administrator, such user may elect to remain on normal inspection when qualified for reduced inspection, or on tightened inspection when qualified for normal inspection.
              
              
                § 42.136
                Applicability of other procedures.
                When appropriate, the procedures for classifying and recording defects in § 42.106 and for appeal inspections in § 42.108 also apply to on-line sampling and inspection.

                Authority:

                Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1621 et seq.).
              
              
                § 42.140
                Operating Characteristic (OC) curves for on-line sampling and inspection.
                (a) This section contains the Operating Characteristic (OC) curve for each of the sampling plans given in Tables I, I-A, II, II-A, III, and III-A. The OC curve and the corresponding sampling plans are listed by AQL.
                (b) Different acceptance and rejection criteria are provided for each AQL. The criteria for each AQL must be obtained from the applicable sampling plan tables.
                (c) The curves show the ability of the various sampling plans to distinguish between good and bad lots. This can be illustrated by examining OC curve 6 for an AQL of 0.25 defects per hundred units in the Reduced and Normal Inspection Plans. If the quality of the lots submitted for inspection is poorer than the AQL of 0.25 defects per hundred units, fewer lots will be accepted. For example, OC curve 6 shows that when the quality of lots submitted for inspection is 1.0 defects per hundred units, only 26 percent of the lots are expected to be accepted. Conversely when the quality of the lots submitted for inspection is better than the AQL of 0.25 defects per hundred units, most lots are expected to be accepted. For example, the same OC curve 6 shows that when the quality of lots submitted for inspection is 0.10 defects per hundred units, about 99 percent of the lots are expected to be accepted.
                (d) The table of sampling plans that correspond to OC curve 6 can be found over the curves for an AQL of 0.25 defects per hundred units in the Reduced and Normal Inspection Plan. An examination of this table reveals that there is one single and one double sampling plan that have OC curves comparable to OC curve 6. The first plan listed is a single plan requiring the inspection of 500 individual containers. Under this plan the lot is accepted as meeting the requirements for an AQL of 0.25 if there are 3 or less defects in the sample or rejected if there are 4 or more defects in the sample.
                (e) The next plan that is listed in the column headed 6 for an AQL of 0.25 is a double sampling plan that requires the initial inspection of 228 individual containers. The lot will be accepted as meeting the requirements of an AQL of 0.25 if there are no defects in the sample, and rejected if there are 3 or more defects in the sample. In the event that the number of defects is between the acceptance (0) and rejection (3) numbers, additional containers must be inspected. In this case, the table indicates that a total of 516 containers must be inspected before a decision can be made to either accept or reject the lot. This will require the inspection of 288 more containers (516 − 228 = 288).

                If there are 3 or less defects in the total sample, the lot will be accepted. If there are 4 or more defects in the total sample, the lot will be rejected. The other double sampling plans operate in a similar manner with the only differences being the sample sizes and acceptance and rejection numbers.

                § 42.141
                Obtaining Operating Characteristic (OC) curve information for skip lot sampling and inspection.
                The Operating Characteristic (OC) curve information (probability of acceptance) for skip lot sampling and inspection procedures described in § 42.121 is easily obtained from the single curve in § 42.142. The procedure for using the curve in § 42.142 is as follows:
                (a) Select any sampling plan for normal condition of container inspection from Table I or Table I-A of § 42.109.
                (b) For a given Quality of Submitted Lots, 100p, find the Percent of Lots Expected to be Accepted, Pa from the respective OC curve in § 42.140.
                (c) Refer to § 42.142 with this Percent of Lots Expected to be Accepted, Pa, and read the new Percent of Lots Expected to be Accepted, Pas, which results when using these skip lot procedures.
                For example, let's assume the lot size is 6,001 to 12,000 containers, and we use the single sampling plan of size 168 for normal inspection (Table I of § 42.109) along with an AQL for total defects of 6.5. The OC curve for this sampling plan is curve N and R3. Also, assume that the quality of the lot is 6.5 defects per hundred units. From curve N and R3, then, the Pa is determined to be 95 percent. Then refer to the graph in § 42.142 and locate Pa of 95 percent along the horizontal axis. From this point, proceed vertically to the curve and then horizontally to the left to the vertical axis. From this point on the vertical axis, Pas is determined to be approximately 98 1
                   percent for skip lot sampling and inspection.
                
                  
                    1 This slight increase of Pas over Pa results because all the lots offered for inspection are no longer being inspected. Some lots are being “skipped”, and thereby accepted, which would have been rejected if inspected. The largest increase in Pa which will occur using skip lot sampling is approximately 4 percent. It is for this reason that skip lot sampling procedures are applied only in instances where past production quality has been consistently high—as evidenced by the requirement to have 10 consecutively acceptable lots prior to a reduction in sampling rate—and where all requirements in § 42.120 also have been met.

                Operating Characteristic (OC) curves for on-line sampling and inspection.
                (a) This section contains the Operating Characteristic (OC) curve for each of the on-line cumulative sum sampling plans provided in subpart D. The OC curve and the corresponding cumulative sum sampling plans are listed by AQL.
                (b) Different plan parameters used to make acceptance and rejection decisions are provided for each AQL.

                (c) The curves show the ability of the various cumulative sum sampling plans to distinguish between good and bad portions of production. The interpretation of these curves for portions of production is similar to the interpretation of the OC curves for stationary lots as illustrated in § 42.140(c).

                Definitions.
                Statistical and inspection or sampling terms and their respective definitions that are used in the sampling plans and operating characteristic curves of which are pertinent to the understanding of inspection by attributes follow:
                
                  Acceptable quality level (AQL). The AQL is expressed in terms of percent defective or defects per 100 units. Lots having a quality level equal to a specified AQL will be accepted approximately 95 percent of the time when using the sampling plans prescribed for that AQL.
                
                  Acceptance number (Ac). The number in a sampling plan that indicates the maximum number of defects or defectives permitted in a sample in order to consider a lot as meeting a specific requirement.
                
                  Acceptance sampling. The art or science that deals with procedures in which decisions to accept or reject lots or processes are based on the examination of samples.
                
                  Attributes. Refers to the measurement of a given factor noting and recording the presence or absence of some characteristic (attribute) in each of the units in the group under consideration.
                
                  Consumer's risk. The risk a consumer takes that a lot will be accepted by a sampling plan even though the lot does not conform to requirements. In the standards of this subpart this risk is nominally set at ten percent.
                
                  Consumer protection. The ability of a sampling plan to reject unacceptable supplies. This is measured as the complement of the probability of acceptance (Pa) for the Limited Quality (LQ) lots. The consumer protection is 90 percent in these standards.
                
                  Defect. A failure to meet a requirement imposed on a unit with respect to a single quality characteristic. A unit may contain more than one defect.
                
                  Defective. A defective unit; one containing one or more defects with respect to the quality characteristic(s) under consideration.
                
                  Inspection. The examination (including testing) of supplies (including, when appropriate, raw materials, components and intermediate assemblies).
                (a) Acceptance inspection. An inspection to determine conformance of supplies to specified requirements in order to accept or reject the supplies.
                (b) Estimation inspection. In dealing with attributes, an inspection to determine the amount of the supplies conforming to a specified requirement—usually expressed as a percentage.
                
                  Inspection by attributes. Inspection whereby either the sample unit is classified as defective or non-defective with respect to a requirement or set of requirements (when on a “defective” basis); or, inspection whereby the number of defects in each sample unit is counted with respect to a requirement or set of requirements (when on a “defect” basis).
                
                  Limiting quality (LQ). The LQ is expressed in terms of percent defective or defects per 100 units. Lots inspected under the standards of this subpart that have a ten percent probability of acceptance are referred to as a lot having a quality level equal to LQ.
                
                  Lot. A collection of units of the same size, type and style which has been manufactured or processed under essentially the same conditions. The term shall mean “inspection lot,” i.e., a collection of units of product from which a sample is to be drawn and inspected to determine conformance with the acceptability criteria. An inspection lot may differ from a collection of units designated as a lot for other purposes (e.g., production lot, shipping lot, etc.).
                
                  Lot size. The number of units in the lot.
                
                  Operating characteristic curve (OC curve). A curve that gives the probability of acceptance as a function of a specific lot quality level.
                
                  Probability of acceptance (Pa). For a given sampling plan and a given quality of inspection lots, is that percentage of inspection lots expected to be accepted.
                
                  Process capability. Performance of a process under normal operating conditions. The performance is measured with respect to specific characteristics.
                
                  Producer's risk. The risk that a producer takes that a lot will be rejected by a sampling plan even though the lot conforms to requirements. In the standards of this subpart this risk is nominally set at five percent.
                
                  Random sampling. A process of selecting a sample from a lot whereby each unit in the lot has an equal chance of being chosen. Ordinary haphazard choice is generally insufficient to guarantee randomness. Devices such as tables of random numbers are used to remove subjective biases inherent in personal choice.
                
                  Rejection number (Re). The number in a sampling plan that indicates the minimum number of defects or defectives permitted in a sample that will cause a lot to fail a specific requirement.
                
                  Sample. Any number of sample units which are to be used for inspection.
                
                  Sample size. The number of sample units which are to be included in the sample.
                
                  Sample unit. A container, the entire contents of a container, a portion of the contents of a container, a composite mixture of a product, or any other unit of container or commodity to be used for inspection.
                
                  Sampling. The act of drawing or selecting sample units from a given lot.
                
                  Sampling plan. A specific plan which states the sample size(s), acceptance number(s) and rejection number(s). In the standards of this subpart two types of sampling plans are provided:
                (a) Single sampling plan. A sampling inspection scheme in which a decision to accept or reject an inspection lot is based on the inspection of a single sample. A single sampling plan consists of a single sample size with associated acceptance and rejection number(s).
                (b) Double sampling plan. A sampling inspection scheme which involves use of two independently drawn but related samples, a first sample (n1) and a second sample which is added to the first to form a total sample size (nt). A double sampling plan consists of a first and total sample size with associated acceptance and rejection number(s). Inspection of the first sample leads to a decision to accept, to reject, or to take a second sample and the examination of a second sample, when required, always leads to a decision to accept or reject.

                Purpose and scope.
                (a) This subpart contains selected single and double sampling plans for inspection by attributes. They are to serve as a source of plans for developing sound specifications, standards, or sampling and inspection procedures.
                (b) The sampling plans of this subpart and corresponding operating characteristic curves are indexed by acceptable quality level, AQL. The AQL's expressed in percent defectives or defects per hundred units are:

                § 43.104
                Master table of single and double sampling plans.

                (a) In the master table, a sampling plan is selected by first determining the sample size or sizes and AQL to be used. Then find the applicable acceptance (Ac) and rejection (Re) numbers at the intersection of the sample size(s) row and AQL column. These numbers together with the sample size or sizes constitute a sampling plan.
                
                (b) Single sampling plans having a sample size of 66 or greater and an acceptance number of 1 are not included in the Master Table. These plans are listed in the tables which supplement the Master Table and accompany the OC curves as indexes to the comparable double sampling plans. The use of these single sampling plans do not facilitate the practice of using two or more AQL's simultaneously with the same sample size.
              
              
                § 43.105
                Operating characteristics (OC) curves.
                The OC curves shows the ability of the various sampling plans, presented for each AQL, to distinguish between lots of different quality.
              
              
                § 43.106
                Choosing AQL's and sampling plans.
                (a) The selection of AQL's and sampling plans for given lot sizes depends on too many factors to permit the issuance of a “pre-selected” standard set of plans for specified lot sizes. Each user of the standards of this subpart should select AQL's and sampling plans that are tailored to best meet his needs.
                (b) Some of the factors that must be considered prior to selecting the AQL's are:
                (1) Class of defects such as major and minor: Major defects would generally require lower AQL's than those for minor defects;
                (2) Process capabilities under good commercial practice with respect to the defects in question: For example, if under normal production processes, the defect level cannot be kept below 2.0 percent defective, the selection of an AQL of 0.15 percent defective, although desirable for the defects in question, may not be practical;
                (3) Consumer preferences: These may require higher AQL's or permit lower AQL's than process capabilities would indicate; and
                (4) Time and cost required to sample and inspect a lot under various AQL's: The smaller the AQL the more time and cost of inspection.
                (c) Some of the factors that may be considered prior to selecting the sampling plans for given lot sizes are:
                (1) The applicable AQL(s): The AQL dictates, among other things, the smallest sample size that can be used and the size of the “jumps” from one sample size to the next larger one;
                (2) The relative ability of the plans to discriminate between “good” and “bad” lots: Although several plans in these standards have the same AQL, they differ in their ability to reject lots worse than the AQL's. The OC curve in the standards of this subpart provide the basis for determining the discriminating ability of each plan;
                (3) The amount, time, and cost of sampling required;
                (4) The size and value of the lots relative to the producer and consumer protection a sampling plan affords: One may be willing to take larger risks of passing “bad” lots that are small or of lesser value than they would for larger more valuable lots;
                (5) The knowledge about the lot(s) to be submitted for inspection: Lots consisting of product produced under essentially the same conditions may require smaller sample sizes than those consisting of product produced by different shifts and different raw stock for example; and

                (6) The record of the quality level of previously submitted lots: The sample size can be smaller for lots submitted from a supplier with a consistent record of quality levels significantly better than the specified AQL(s) than sample sizes for the supplier whose records show considerable variability in quality, “borderline” supplies or product worse than the AQL.

                (dd) Acceptance means:
                (1) Any act by the consignee signifying acceptance of the shipment, including diversion or unloading;
                (2) Any act by the consignee which is inconsistent with the consignor's ownership, but if such act is wrongful against the consignor it is acceptance only if ratified by him; or

                (3) Failure of the consignee to give notice of rejection to the consignor within a reasonable time as defined in paragraph (cc) of this section: Provided, That acceptance shall not affect any claim for damages because of failure of the produce to meet the terms of the contract.
                (ee) Employ and employment mean any affiliation of any person with the business operations of a licensee, with or without compensation, including ownership or self-employment.

                Bonds prescribed in section 4(c)(6), 4(e), 8(b), and 13(b) of the Act shall be in the form of cash or surety bonds in the form and amount satisfactory to the Director and shall not be less than $10,000. When cash is posted as surety, it shall be deposited into a special account of the United States Treasury and no interest is to accrue or be paid the licensee. When surety bonds are furnished, the surety shall be a company holding a certificate of authority from the Secretary of the Treasury under Act of Congress approved July 30, 1947 (6 U.S.C. 6 through 13) as acceptable surety on Federal bonds.

All fees, and any additional sums assessed by the Director in accordance with the Act, shall be deposited in a special fund designated as the “Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act fund.”

                Copies of licenses.
                Copies of licenses may be issued upon request and upon the payment of a fee of two dollars ($2) for each copy. Each copy shall bear the word “copy” in conspicuous letters on its face and shall be certified by the Director as a true copy of the original.
              
              
                § 46.9
                Termination, suspension, revocation, cancellation of licenses; notices; renewal.
                (a) Under section 3(c) of the Act the license can be suspended if the licensee continues to use a trade name after being notified by the Director that such trade name has been disapproved.
                (b) Under section 4(a) of the Act, after October 1, 1962, the license of any individual, corporation or association shall automatically terminate on the date of discharge in bankruptcy and the license of any partnership shall automatically terminate on the date of the discharge in bankruptcy of any of the general partners in the partnership.

                (c) Under section 4(c) of the Act if a license is issued under a bond and the bond is terminated for any reason without the approval of the Director, within four years from the date of the issuance of the license, the license shall be automatically cancelled as of the date of termination and no new license shall be issued to such person during the four-year period without a new surety bond covering the remainder of such period. Also, if the Director notifies the licensee that a bond in an increased amount is required and the licensee fails to provide such a bond within the specified time the license of such licensee shall be automatically suspended until such bond is provided.
                (d) Under section 8(a) of the Act a license can be suspended or revoked for violations of section 2 of the Act or when the licensee is found guilty in a Federal Court of having violated section 14(b) of the Act.
                (e) Under section 8(b) of the Act a license can be suspended or revoked if the licensee continues to employ any person in violation of the provisions of this section. Also, if any licensee is authorized to employ any person under a bond in accordance with this section and is notified by the Director subsequently to provide a bond in an increased amount and fails to provide such a bond within the time specified, approval of employment shall automatically terminate.
                (f) Under section 8(c) of the Act a license can be revoked for any false or misleading statement, or through a misrepresentation or concealment or withholding of facts in connection with an application for a license.
                (g) Under section 9 of the Act a license can be suspended if the licensee fails to keep such accounts, records, and memoranda as fully and correctly disclose all transactions involved in his business including the true ownership of such business by stock-holding or otherwise.
                (h) Under section 13 of the Act a license can be suspended:
                (1) If the licensee refuses to permit inspection of his records or of any lot of produce under his ownership or control; or
                (2) If the licensee, subsequent to a determination in a formal disciplinary proceeding that it has violated the prompt payment provision of Section 2(4) of the Act, refuses to permit an inspection of its accounts, records and memoranda to insure that it is in compliance with the prompt payment provision of section 2(4) of the Act or fails or refuses to furnish, maintain, or adjust a surety bond in a form and amount satisfactory to the Secretary.
                (i) Under section 4(a) of the Act, at least 30 days prior to the anniversary date of a valid and effective license, the Director shall mail a notice to the licensee at the last known address advising that the license will automatically terminate on its anniversary date unless an application for renewal is filed supplying all information requested on a form to be supplied by the Division, and unless the renewal fee (if any is applicable) is paid on or before such date. If the renewal application is not filed and/or the renewal fee (if required) is not paid by the anniversary date, the licensee may obtain a renewal of that license at any time within 30 days by submitting the required renewal application and/or paying the renewal fee (if required), plus $50. Within 60 days after the termination date of a valid and effective license, the former licensee shall be notified of such termination, unless a new license has been obtained in the meantime.
                (j) Beginning on December 1, 1998, the renewal period for new licenses issued to retailers and grocery wholesalers is three years.
                (k) Only a commission merchant, broker, or dealer holding a multi-year license, prior to phase out of this option, will receive a refund if business operations cease or a change in legal status occurs that requires issuance of a new license prior to the next license renewal date. If a refund is due, it will be issued for any remaining full-year portion of advance fee paid, minus a $100 processing fee.

                Any commission merchant, dealer, or broker who violates the Act by engaging in business subject to the Act without a license may settle its liability, if such violation is found by the Director not to have been willful but due to inadvertence, by submitting the required application and paying the amount of fees that it would have paid had it obtained and maintained a license during the period that it engaged in business subject to the Act, plus an additional sum not in excess of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250) as may be determined by the Director.

The licensee may place upon his stationery, trucks, or business sign an inscription indicating that he is licensed under the Act, but such inscription must not be of such form or arrangement as to be deceptive or misleading to the public, nor shall any such inscription be displayed or used unless the person using the inscription has a license valid and effective at the time.

                Forms of inscriptions.
                The following inscriptions, for use with or without the license number, meet the foregoing requirements and may be used by licensees: “Licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act”, or “Licensed under the PACA.”

                The licensee shall:
                (a) Promptly report to the Director in writing;
                (1) Any change of address;
                (2) Any change in officers, directors, members, managers, holders of more than 10 percent of the outstanding stock in a corporation, with the percentage of stock held by such person, and holders of more than 10 percent of the ownership stake in a limited liability company, and the percentage of ownership in the company held by each such person;
                (3) Any deletions or additions of trade names;
                (4) Any change in the number and address of any branches or additional business facilities, and;
                (5) When the licensee, or if the licensee is a partnership, any partner is subject to proceedings under the bankruptcy laws. A new license is required in case of a change in the ownership of a firm, the addition or withdrawal of partners in a partnership, or in case business is conducted under a different corporate charter, or in case a limited liability company conducts business under different articles or organization from those under which the license was originally issued.
                (b) Obtain approval from the Director prior to using any trade name.

                General.
                (a) Every commission merchant, dealer, and broker shall prepare and preserve for a period of two years from the closing date of the transaction the accounts, records, and memoranda required by the Act, which shall fully and correctly disclose all transactions involved in his business. Licensees shall keep records which are adapted to the particular business that the licensee is conducting and in each case such records shall fully disclose all transactions in the business in sufficient detail as to be readily understood and audited. It is impracticable to specify in detail every class of records which may be found essential since many different types of business are conducted in the produce industry and many different types of contracts are made covering a wide range of services by agents and others. The responsibility is placed on every licensee to maintain records which will disclose all essential facts regarding the transactions in his business.

                (b) Every commission merchant, dealer, and broker shall prepare and preserve records and memoranda required by the Act which shall fully and correctly disclose the true ownership and management of such business during the preceding four years. Such records shall include the number and location of all branches or additional business facilities operated by or for the commission merchant, dealer or broker. In the case of a corporation, such records shall include the corporate charter, record of stock subscription and stock issued, the amounts paid in for stock and minutes of stockholders' and directors' meetings showing the election of directors and officers, resignations and other pertinent corporate actions. In the case of a partnership, the records shall contain a copy of the partnership agreement showing the type of partnership, the full names and addresses of all partners including general, special or limited partners, the partnership interest of each individual and any other pertinent records of the partnership.

                All records required to be preserved under the Act shall be stored in an orderly manner and in keeping with sound business practices. The records being currently used shall be filed in order of dates, by serial numbers, alphabetically or by any other proper method which will enable the licensee to promptly locate and produce the records. Records in dead storage should be arranged in an orderly fashion, be packaged or wrapped to insure proper preservation, be adequately marked or identified, and stored in a safe, dry location. When part of the records are forwarded to others (such as accountants, traffic agencies, attorneys, etc.), proper notations should be filed in appropriate places in the records identifying the missing records and stating where they can be located.

                (1) In the investigation of complaints under the Act, including any petition, written notification, or complaint under section 6 of the Act,

                (5) If the licensee has been determined in a formal disciplinary proceeding to have violated the prompt payment provision of section 2(4) of the Act, to determine whether, at the time of the inspection, there is compliance with that section.
                (b) Any necessary facilities for such inspection shall be extended to such representative by the licensee, its agents, and employees.

                Market receivers shall keep in the order of receipt a record of all produce received and this record shall be in the form of a book (preferably a bound book) with numbered pages or comparable business record. This record shall clearly show for each lot the date of arrival and unloading; whether received by freight, express, truck, or otherwise; the car initials and number; the truck license number and the driver's name or the name of the trucking firm; the number of packages or the quantity received; the kind of produce; the name and address of the consignor or seller; whether the produce was purchased; consigned or received on joint account; and the disposition of the produce, whether jobbed or sold in carlots or trucklots, and the lot number assigned to the shipment by the receiver (as required by § 46.20).

No serial number shall be repeated within a 90-day period. The sales tickets shall be prepared and all the details of the sale shall be entered on the tickets in a legible manner in order that an audit can be readily made. Erasures, strike-outs, changes, etc., should be held to the minimum. When errors are made in preparing sales tickets, the tickets should be voided. Each sales ticket shall show the date of sale, the purchaser's name (so far as practicable), the kind, quantity, the unit price, and the total selling price of the produce. Each sales ticket shall show the lot number of the shipment if the produce is being handled on consignment or on joint account. Sales tickets on all other lots of the same commodity which are on hand at the same time shall also show a lot number. The original or a legible carbon copy of each sales ticket, including those voided or unused, shall be accounted for and shall be filed or stored either by dates of sales or in the order of the serial numbers for a period of two years.

                An identifying lot number shall be assigned to each shipment of produce to be sold on consignment or joint account or for the account of another person or firm. A lot number should be assigned to any purchased shipment in dispute between the parties to assist in proving damages. A lot number shall be assigned to each purchased shipment of similar produce on hand at that time or received later while the consigned or joint account or disputed lot is being sold. A lot number shall be assigned to each purchased shipment which is reconditioned if the seller is to be charged with the shrinkage or loss. The lot number shall be entered on the receiving record in connection with each shipment and entered on all sales tickets identifying and segregating the sales from the various shipments on hand. The lot number shall be entered on the sales tickets by the salesmen at the time of sale or by the produce dispatcher, and not by bookkeepers or others after the sales have been made. No lot number shall be repeated within a period of 30 days after the last sale from the preceding lot to which such number was assigned.

                In the event of the rejection and return of any produce sold for or on behalf of another, on consignment, or on joint account, or of any necessary allowance or adjustment being made to the buyers thereof, a credit memorandum showing the buyer's name, sales ticket number, lot number, date of the granting of the allowance, and amount of the credit or adjustment, with reasons therefor, shall be made or a notation shall be made on the original sales ticket referring to the adjustment and showing where the credit memorandum is filed. The credit memorandum shall be on a regular form, in a ledger book, or on a sales ticket or invoice properly completed to show the facts and shall be approved by a duly authorized person. Credits granted shall be entered in the same records as the original sales tickets.
              
              
                § 46.22
                Accounting for dumped produce.

                A clear and complete record shall be maintained showing justification for dumping of produce received on joint account, on consignment, or handled for or on behalf of another person if any portion of such produce regardless of percentage cannot be sold due to poor condition or is lost through re-sorting or reconditioning. In addition to the foregoing, if five percent or more of a shipment is dumped, an official certificate, or other adequate evidence, shall be obtained to prove the produce was actually without commercial value, unless there is a specific agreement to the contrary between the parties. The original certificate or other adequate evidence justifying dumping shall be forwarded to the consignor or joint account partner with the accounting and a copy shall be retained by the receiver.
              
              
                § 46.23
                Evidence of dumping.
                Reasonable cause for destroying any produce exists when the commodity has no commercial value or when it is dumped by order of a local health officer or other authorized official or when the shipper has specifically consented to such disposition. The term “commercial value” means any value that a commodity may have for any purpose that can be ascertained by the exercise of due diligence without unreasonable expense or loss of time. When produce is being handled for or on behalf of another person, proof as to the quantities of produce destroyed or dumped in excess of five percent of the shipment shall be provided by procuring an official certificate showing that the produce has no commercial value from any person authorized by the Department to inspect fruits and vegetables. Where such inspection service is not available certification may be obtained from (a) any health officer or food inspector of any State, county, parish, city or municipality or of the District of Columbia; (b) any established commercial agency or service making inspections for the fruit and vegetable industry; or (c) when no inspector or health officer designated above is available consideration will be given to other evidence such as inspection and certification made by any two persons having no financial interest in the produce involved or in the business of any person financially interested therein, and who are unrelated by blood or marriage to any such financially interested person, and who, at the time of the inspection and certification, and for a period of at least one year immediately prior thereto, have been engaged in the handling of the same general kind or class of produce with respect to which the inspections and certification are to be made. Any certificate issued by any persons designated in paragraph (c) of this section shall include a statement that each of them possesses the requisite qualifications. Any such certificate shall properly identify the produce by showing the commodity, lot number, brand or principal identifying marks on the containers, quantity dumped, name and address of shipper, name and address of applicant, condition of the produce, time, place, and date of inspection and a statement that the produce possesses no commercial value.

                Records of retailers.
                Notwithstanding the specific records and documents prescribed in the foregoing sections, licensees who purchase produce solely for sale at retail shall establish and maintain accounts and records, adapted to their type of operations, which will fully and correctly disclose all transactions relating to the purchase of produce. Such accounts and records should include the date of receipt of each lot, kind of produce, number of packages and quantity, price paid, evidence of agreement, or contract of purchase, bills of lading, paid bills, and any other documents relating to the purchase of produce.
              
            
            
              Auction Sales
              
                § 46.25
                Auction sales.

                Commission merchants, dealers and brokers who offer produce for sale through auction companies which publish catalogs of offerings will be responsible for furnishing the auction company for publication true and correct information concerning the ownership of the produce. When the produce is offered for sale by an owner, his name shall be shown in the catalog listing as owner. When a joint account partner makes an offering, his name as well as that of his joint partner, or partners, shall be shown. When any person offers produce for sale at auction for the account of another, the name, or names of the owner, if known, and of his principal shall be shown. In addition to listing such name or names he may show that he is acting in the capacity of agent. If a person instructs an auction company to catalog a shipment without disclosing true ownership, if known, or the name of an agent's principal, he shall be deemed to have made a false or misleading statement within the meaning of the Act. Since sales at auctions normally involve additional expenses, a broker, grower's agent or commission merchant shall have prior consent from his principal before such disposition is accomplished. Where a dispute exists regarding the ownership of produce, it may be listed in the auction catalog as being offered for sale “for the account of whom concerned” with the name of the party making the offering shown as agent.

                It is impracticable to specify in detail all of the duties of brokers, commission merchants, joint account partners, growers' agents and shippers because of the many types of businesses conducted. Therefore, the duties described in these regulations are not to be considered as a complete description of all of the duties required but is merely a description of their principal duties. The responsibility is placed on each licensee to fully perform any specification or duty, express or implied, in connection with any transaction handled subject to the Act.
              
            
            
              Brokers
              
                § 46.27
                Types of broker operations.
                (a) Brokers carry on their business operations in several different ways and are generally classified by their method of operation. The following are some of the broad groupings by method of operation. The usual operation of brokers consists of the negotiation of the purchase and sale of produce either of one commodity or of several commodities. A broker is usually engaged by only one of the parties, but in negotiating a contract the broker acts as a special agent of first one and then the other party in conveying offers, counter offers, and acceptances between the parties. Once the contract is formed, and the confirmation issued, the broker's duties are usually ended, and the broker is not the proper party to whom notice of breach or of rejection should be directed. However, a broker receiving notice has a duty to promptly convey the notice to the proper party. Frequently, brokers never see the produce they are quoting for sale or negotiating for purchase by the buyer, and they carry out their duties by conveying information received from the parties between the buyer and seller until a contract is effected. Generally, the seller of the produce invoices the buyer, however, when there is a specific agreement between the broker and its principal, the seller invoices the broker who, in turn, invoices the buyer, collects, and remits to the seller. Under other types of agreements, the seller ships the produce to pool buyers, and the broker as an accommodation to the seller invoices the buyers, collects, and remits to the seller. Also, there are times when the broker is authorized by the seller to act much like a commission merchant, being given blanket authority to dispose of the produce for the seller's account either by negotiation of sales to buyers not known to the seller or by placing the produce for sale on consignment with receivers in the terminal markets.

                (b) There is a second general grouping of brokers which are commonly referred to as buying brokers. Their operations are typified by the fact that they act as the buyer's representative in negotiating purchases at shipping points, terminal markets, or intermediate points. Their typical type of operation is to negotiate a purchase on the buyer's instructions and authorization. Sometimes the broker negotiates the purchase without seeing the produce. In other instances he may select the merchandise after forming an appraisal of the quality of the produce being offered for sale on the market. Generally, a purchase is made in the buyer's name and the seller invoices the buyer direct. On the other hand, acting on authority given him by the buyer, the broker may negotiate purchases in his own name, pay the seller for the produce, make arrangements for its loading and shipment, and bill the buyer direct for the cost price plus the brokerage fee and the cost of any agreed upon accessorial service charges such as ice, loading, etc.

                § 46.28
                Duties of brokers.
                (a) General. The function of a broker is to facilitate good faith negotiations between parties which lead to valid and binding contracts. A broker who fails to perform any specification or duty, express or implied, in connection with any transaction is in violation of the Act, is subject to the penalties specified in the Act, and may be held liable for damages which accrue as a result of the violation. It shall be the duty of the broker to fully inform the parties concerning all proposed terms and conditions of the proposed contract. After all parties agree on the terms and the contract is effected, the broker shall prepare in writing and deliver promptly to all parties a properly executed confirmation or memorandum of sale setting forth truly and correctly all of the essential details of the agreement between the parties, including any express agreement as to the time when payment is due. The confirmation or memorandum of sale shall also identify the party who engaged the broker to act in the negotiations. If the confirmation or memorandum of sale does not contain such information, the broker shall be presumed to have been engaged by the buyer. Brokers do not normally act as general agents of either party, and will not be presumed to have so acted. Unless otherwise agreed and confirmed, the broker will be entitled to payment of brokerage fees from the party by whom it was engaged to act as broker. The broker shall retain a copy of such confirmations or memoranda as part of its accounts and records. The broker who does not prepare these documents and retain copies in its files is failing to prepare and maintain complete and correct records as required by the Act. The broker who does not deliver copies of these documents to all parties involved in the transaction is failing to perform its duties as a broker. A broker who issues a confirmation or memorandum of sale containing false or misleading statements shall be deemed to have committed a violation of section 2 of the Act. If the broker's records do not support its contentions that a binding contract was made with proper notice to the parties, the broker may be held liable for any loss or damage resulting from such negligence, or for other penalties provided by the Act for failing to perform its express or implied duties. The broker shall take into consideration the time of delivery of the shipment involved in the contract, and all other circumstances of the transaction, in selecting the proper method for transmitting the written confirmation or memorandum of sale to the parties. A buying broker is required to truly and correctly account to its principal in accordance with § 46.2(y)(3). The broker should advise the appropriate party promptly when any notice of rejection or breach is received, or of any other unforeseen development of which it is informed.
                (b) Brokerage fees. A broker is not considered to be entitled to a brokerage fee unless he effects a sale or makes a valid and binding contract, fully performing his duties as a broker. Unless otherwise specifically agreed, the broker does not guarantee the performance of the contracting parties and is entitled to receive prompt payment of the brokerage fee whenever a valid and binding contract is negotiated. Brokerage fees may be charged to only one of the parties to the contract unless by prior agreement the parties agree to split the brokerage fee. If the brokerage fee is charged to both parties without a specific prior agreement, such action by the broker is a violation of the Act. A broker employed to negotiate the sale of produce may not employ another broker or selling agent, including auction companies, without the specific prior approval of his principal. When the broker is authorized to sell, invoice the buyer, collect and remit to his principal, he shall render an itemized accounting to the principal promptly on receipt of payment, showing the true gross selling price, all brokerage fees deducted, any auction charges and any other expenses incurred in connection with the sale of the shipment. The failure to account truly and correctly and make full payment promptly is a violation of the Act.
                (c) Broker's responsibility for payment. In the absence of a specific agreement, a broker is not responsible for payment to the seller by the buyer. Agreement to collect from the buyer and remit to the seller is not a guarantee by the broker that the buyer will pay for the produce purchased, unless there is a specific agreement by the broker that he will pay if the buyer does not pay. A broker who agrees to collect funds from the buyer for his principal shall render an itemized accounting to the principal promptly on receipt of payment showing the true gross selling price, all brokerage fees deducted and all expenses including auction charges, incurred in connection with the sale of the shipment. The failure to account truly and correctly and make full payment promptly is a violation of the Act. While the broker is not obliged to furnish his principal information regarding the financial condition of the buyer, if the broker furnishes such information, he must truthfully report the information available to him, and any false or misleading statements for a fraudulent purpose to the principal to encourage the sale will be a violation of the Act. A buying broker who negotiates a purchase in his own name under an agreement with his principal, is responsible for payment of the purchase price to the seller. A broker has no authority to grant allowances or adjust the seller's invoice price to the buyer without the specific prior approval of his principal.
                (d) Purchases and sales by brokers. A person who operates in a dual capacity, both as a broker and a dealer, shall clearly disclose his status in each transaction to all parties with whom he is dealing. If such a person misrepresents himself as a broker to the buyer or the seller when he is acting as a dealer purchasing produce or selling produce he has purchased, he shall be considered to have violated the Act. When a person purchases or sells produce as a dealer, he shall not request or receive a brokerage fee from the buyer or the seller. A broker shall not negotiate a transaction where the broker is subject to the direct or indirect control of any party to the transaction other than his principal, or where the other party is subject to the direct or indirect control of the broker without fully disclosing the circumstances to his principal and obtaining his specific prior approval.
                (e) Filing carrier claims by brokers. Without prior consent of the owner, a broker has no authority to file claims with carriers in his own name or any other name. A broker has no obligation to file carrier claims for the owners of the shipments. However, when a broker in a transaction receives information valuable to the owner in connection with carrier claim rights, the broker should promptly advise the owner. A broker who agrees to protect the carrier claims of owners shall at all times exercise reasonable care to fulfill such obligation. If a broker makes an agreement with a seller or a buyer to file and handle such a claim for the benefit of the owner of the produce, the claim shall be filed promptly with the carrier, supported by adequate evidence, and he shall take the necessary action to bring the matter to a conclusion. A copy of the claim shall be forwarded to the owner of the shipment when the claim is filed. When settlement of the claim is effected, the broker shall promptly remit the net amount due the owner, after deducting the agreed or customary charges for handling the claim. Adequate information shall be furnished the owner regarding the claim while the matter is being handled with the carrier. If the owner files the claim, the broker shall promptly furnish any necessary information available in his records which is requested by the owner.
                [28 FR 7067, July 11, 1963; 28 FR 7287, July 17, 1963, as amended at 37 FR 14561, July 21, 1972; 62 FR 15087, Mar. 31, 1997]
              
            
            
              Receiving Market Commission Merchants and Joint Account Partners
              
                § 46.29
                Duties.
                (a) General. All licensees who accept produce for sale on consignment or on joint account are required to exercise reasonable care and diligence in disposing of the produce promptly and in a fair and reasonable manner. A commission merchant engaged to sell consigned produce may not employ another person or firm, including auction companies, to dispose of all or part of such produce without the specific prior authority of the consignor. A commission merchant is not authorized to sell consigned produce outside the market area where he is located without obtaining the permission of the consignor. Averaging or pooling of sales is not permissible unless the receiver obtains the specific written permission of the consignor prior to rendering the accounting. Complete and detailed records shall be prepared and maintained by all commission merchants and joint account partners covering produce received, sales, quantities lost, dates and cost of repacking or reconditioning, unloading, handling, freight, demurrage or auction charges, and any other expenses which are deducted on the accounting, in accordance with the provisions of § 46.18 through § 46.23. When rendering account sales for produce handled for or on behalf of another, an accurate and itemized report of sales and expenses charged against the shipment shall be made. It is a violation of section 2 of the Act to fail to render true and correct accountings in connection with consignments or produce handled on joint account. Charges which cannot be supported by proper evidence in the records of the commission merchant or joint account partner shall not be deducted. The commission merchant or joint account partner may be held liable for any financial loss and for other penalties provided by the Act, due to his negligence or failure to perform any specification or duty, express or implied, arising out of any transaction subject to the Act.
                (b) Commission charges. Before accepting produce on consignment, the parties should reach a definite agreement on the amount of the commission and other charges which will be assessed by the commission merchant. In the absence of such an agreement, only the usual and customary commission and other charges shall be permitted. The receiver may not reconsign produce to another person or firm, including auction companies, and incur additional commissions, charges or expenses without the specific prior authority of the consignor. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties, joint account partners shall not charge a commission fee or other selling charges against the joint account for disposing of the produce. When a portion of a consigned shipment is purchased by the commission merchant he shall not charge or receive a commission fee for such sales.
                (c) Purchasing consigned produce. A commission merchant or joint account partner may not purchase produce received on consignment or joint account or sell such produce to any person or firm over whose business he has direct or indirect control, or to any person or firm having direct or indirect control over his business, without specific prior authority of the consignor or the joint account partner. However, produce may be purchased by the commission merchant or joint account partner at reasonable market value to clean up remnants of shipments so accountings will not be unduly delayed, provided the accounting shows the quantity and price of the goods bought by the commission merchant or joint account partner. “Remnants,” as used here, mean small quantities remaining after the bulk of the shipment has been sold but shall not exceed 5 percent of the shipment. When consigned produce is purchased by a commission merchant he shall not charge or receive a commission fee for such sales.
                (d) Filing carrier claims. Without the prior consent of the owner of the produce, a commission merchant has no authority to file claims with carriers in his own name or any other name: Provided, That the commission merchant may file a claim for breakage where the owner has been paid for the full value of the produce without any deduction for damage. Commission merchants have no obligation to file carrier claims on shipments for the owners. However, when a commission merchant in a transaction receives information valuable to the consignor in connection with carrier claim rights, the commission merchant should promptly advise the consignor. Before a commission merchant files a carrier claim on a consigned shipment, a specific agreement shall be reached with the consignor. If a commission merchant is authorized and agrees to file the claim, he shall forward a copy of the claim filed with the carrier to the consignor and shall exercise reasonable care to protect the interests of the consignor by filing the claim promptly and in the proper amount, supported by adequate evidence, and shall take the necessary action to bring the matter to a conclusion. When settlement of the claim is effected, he shall promptly remit the net amount due the consignor, after deducting the agreed handling charges. Full and complete information shall be furnished the consignor while the claim is being handled. If the consignor is to file the claim, the commission merchant shall exercise reasonable care to protect the claim rights of the consignor and shall promptly furnish all necessary information and evidence from his records to enable the consignor to file a proper claim. A joint account partner who files a carrier claim on behalf of the partnership shall forward a copy of the claim filed with the carrier to his partner, keep him advised of its status, and remit promptly his share of the net proceeds realized from such claim.
              
            
            
              Growers' Agents and Shippers
              
                § 46.30
                Types of operations by growers' agents and shippers.
                (a) The usual operations of shippers consist of purchasing produce from growers in their own names. They distribute the produce in commerce by selling, consigning, or jointing the shipments, assuming any loss or profits that result from these operations. In addition, shippers may handle produce on joint account with growers or others.
                (b) Growers' agents sell and distribute produce for or on behalf of growers and others and, in addition, may perform a wide variety of services, such as financing, planting, harvesting, grading, packing, furnishing labor, seed, containers, and other supplies or services. They usually distribute the produce in their own names and collect payment direct from the consignees. They render accountings to their principals, paying the net proceeds after deducting their expenses and fees. Some agents are limited by contract to making only sales and cannot joint or consign produce without obtaining the prior consent of the growers. Other agents are granted blanket authority by the growers to market and distribute the produce, using their discretion as to the best methods, depending on market conditions and the quality of the produce available. They can sell, consign or ship on joint account, use the services of brokers or sell through terminal market auctions. They are authorized to grant credits, make adjustments in the invoice price, handle claims with the carriers, or even abandon shipments, when circumstances justify such action, without consulting the growers. Some agents have an agreement with the growers to pool the produce and render accountings on the basis of the average or prorated selling prices after deducting the prorated expenses incurred for the various operations performed and the agents' selling fees. Some agents's contracts require an accounting on the basis of actual selling prices after deducting the actual expenses incurred for services performed and the selling fees. Some agents' contracts specify a fixed charge for harvesting, grading, packing, furnishing the container or other services, plus a selling fee, and thereby substantially reduce the record requirements necessary to prove the cost of the various operations.
              
              
                § 46.31
                Duties of shippers.
                (a) General. The responsibilities of shippers vary with their contracts with growers to purchase produce or to handle produce on joint account. Similarly, their responsibilities to their customers depend upon their contracts to sell, consign or joint account produce with dealers on terminal markets. Shippers shall pay promptly for produce purchased and any deficits incurred on consigned shipments. They shall fully comply with their obligations in connection with joint account transactions. A shipper who fails to perform any express or implied duty is in violation of the Act and may be held liable for any damages resulting therefrom. The shipper shall prepare and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the details of his transactions.
                (b) Receiving records. Each shipper shall prepare and maintain a record of all produce handled including his own production. This record shall be in the form of a book (preferably a bound book), with numbered pages or comparable business records. This receiving record shall show for each lot the date received, whether purchased or received on joint account, the quantity, quality, and kind of produce, the purchase price or joint account cost, and the name and address of the supplier. Shippers shall issue receipts to growers and others for all produce received.
                (c) Disposition records. When a shipper purchases produce from growers or others, his records shall also show the disposition of the produce, whether sold or consigned, date of shipment, car number, or if shipped by truck, the license number, name and address of the carrier, name and address of the buyer, commission merchant or auction, and other pertinent details of the transaction, such as the terms of sale, selling price, and date of payment.
                (d) Joint accounts with growers. When a shipper enters into a joint account transaction with growers or others, the agreement between the parties should be reduced to a written contract clearly defining the duties and responsibilities of both parties and the extent of the shipper's authority in distributing the produce. The shipper shall prepare and maintain records to show in detail the actual expenses incurred for the services he furnishes, such as harvesting, grading, packing and selling the produce (unless a fixed charge is agreed upon by the parties to cover the cost of these services), methods of distribution and proceeds received for the produce. If a shipper is at the same time handling similar produce not involved in the joint account transaction, a lot number or other positive means of identification shall be assigned to each lot of produce received in order to segregate and identify the various lots of produce. If a shipper consigns all or part of the produce or employs the services of brokers or terminal market auctions, his records shall show the results of these transactions, including the expenses involved and the names and addresses of the commission merchants, brokers, and the auctions. The shipper shall render a detailed and accurate accounting and pay promptly the net proceeds due the joint partner, in accordance with § 46.2(y), (z), and (aa). The accounting shall disclose the status of all claims collected or filed with the carriers.
                (e) Joint accounts with receivers. When a shipper enters into a joint account agreement with a terminal market dealer, the agreement should be reduced to writing clearly defining the terms of the agreement. The shipper's records shall show the expenses which may be properly charged in accordance with the joint agreement, purchase price or joint account cost of the produce, and cost of harvesting, packing, grading, or other expenses. His records shall show the quantity and quality of the produce packed and shipped, the dates and methods of shipment, and all other pertinent details of his operation. At the conclusion of the transaction, a detailed and accurate accounting shall be furnished promptly to the joint partner, in accordance with § 46.2(z). If a deficit results, the shipper shall pay promptly his share of the deficit.
              
              
                § 46.32
                Duties of growers' agents.
                (a) General. The duties, responsibilities, and extent of the authority of a growers' agent depend on the type of contract made with the growers. Agreements between growers and agents should be reduced to a written contract clearly defining the duties and responsibilities of both parties and the extent of the agent's authority in distributing the produce. When such agreements between the parties are not reduced to written contracts, the agent shall have available a written statement describing the terms and conditions under which he will handle the produce of the grower during the current season and shall mail or deliver this statement to the grower on or before receipt of the first lot. A grower will be considered to have agreed to these terms if, after receiving such statement, he delivers his produce to the agent for handling in the usual manner. In the event an unsolicited lot of produce is accepted by an agent for handling in his usual manner, he shall promptly deliver or mail a copy of such statement to the grower. A copy of this statement, showing the name of the grower and the date the statement was delivered to the grower, shall be retained in the agent's files. An agent who does not have in his files either written contracts or a written statement as required herein is failing to prepare and maintain full and complete records as required by the Act. Provided, That regulations or bylaws of cooperative marketing associations may be used in lieu of individual agreements or contracts to determine the methods of accounting and settlement with their grower members. An agent who fails to perform any specification or duty, express or implied, is in violation of the Act and may be held liable for any damages resulting therefrom and for other penalties provided under the Act for such failure.
                (b) Accounting for charges. A growers' agent whose operations include such services as the planting, harvesting, grading, packing, furnishing of containers or other supplies, storing, selling or distributing produce for or on behalf of growers shall prepare and maintain complete records on all transactions in sufficient detail as to be readily understood and audited. Agents must be in a position to render to the growers accurate and detailed accountings covering all aspects of their handling of the produce. Agents shall maintain a record of all produce received in the form of a book (preferably a bound book) with numbered pages or comparable business records, showing for each lot the date received, quantity, the kind of produce and the name and address of the grower. Agents shall issue receipts to growers and others for all produce received. A lot number or other positive means of identification shall be assigned to each lot in order to segregate the various lots of produce received from different growers from similar produce being handled at the same time. Each lot shall be so identified and segregated throughout all operations conducted by the agent, including the sale or other disposition of the produce. The records shall show the result of all packing and grading operations, including the quantity lost through packing and grading and the quantity and quality packed out. If the culls are sold, they shall be included in the accounting. Unless there is a specific agreement with the growers to pool all various growers' produce, the accounting to each of the growers shall itemize the actual expenses incurred for the various operations conducted by the agent and all the details of the disposition of the produce received from each grower including all sales, adjustments, rejections, details of consigned or jointed shipments and sales through brokers, auctions, and status of all claims filed with or collected from the carriers. The agent shall prepare and maintain full and complete records on all details of such distribution to provide supporting evidence for the accounting. If an agent is working under a pool agreement with growers, the accounting shall show how the pool cost and pool sales prices are computed. If the agent and the growers have agreed on a fixed charge to cover the various operations conducted by the agent, actual expenses incurred for these services covered by the agreement are not required to be shown in the accounting. The failure of the agent to render prompt, accurate and detailed accountings in accordance with § 46.2 (z) and (aa), is a violation of the Act.
                (c) Sales through brokers or auctions. Unless a growers' agent is specifically authorized in his contract with the growers to use the services of brokers, commission merchants, joint partners, or auctions, he is not entitled to use these methods of marketing the growers' produce. Any expense incurred for such services, without the growers' permission, cannot be charged to the growers.
                (d) Filing of carrier claims. Without the prior consent of the growers, an agent has no authority to file claims with the carriers in his own name or any other name. An agent has no obligation to file carrier claims on shipments for growers in the absence of a specific agreement to perform these duties. All information which an agent has received in handling the shipment which is essential for the growers to file such claims shall be made available to the growers. If an agent has an agreement with the growers to file and handle carrier claims, he shall exercise reasonable care in handling the claims with the carriers by filing the claim promptly in the proper amount, supported by adequate evidence, and take any necessary action to bring the matter to a conclusion.
                (e) Purchases and sales by growers' agents. A person who operates in a dual capacity, both as a growers' agent and as a shipper, shall clearly disclose his status in each transaction to all parties with whom he is dealing. If such a person misrepresents himself as an agent, when he is acting as a shipper selling produce he has purchased, he shall be considered to have violated the Act. A growers' agent shall not charge or receive a fee from the seller or the buyer when he purchases or sells produce as a shipper. A growers' agent shall not negotiate a transaction where he is subject to the direct or indirect control of any party to such transactions, other than his principal, or where the other party is subject to the agent's direct or indirect control, without fully disclosing the circumstances to his principal and obtaining his specific prior approval.
                (f) Negligence of agent. A growers' agent may be held liable for any loss or damage resulting to the growers due to his negligence or failure to perform any specification or duty, express or implied, arising out of any undertaking in connection with transactions subject to the Act.
                (g) Responsibility for payment. An agent is not responsible for the payment by the buyer who has purchased the growers' produce on credit, unless he guarantees payment or is negligent in extending credit. Agreement to collect from the buyer and remit to his principal is not a guarantee by the agent that the agent will pay if the buyer does not pay.
                (h) Responsibility for payment of selling fees and expenses to the growers' agent. In the absence of a specific agreement to the contrary, the agent does not guarantee the performance of the contracting parties and he is entitled to the payment of his selling fees and expenses incurred in handling the produce of growers or others, providing he fully performs his duties as agent.
                (i) Agent's financial responsibility to buyers for failure to comply with contracts. If a growers' agent contracts in his own name to deliver produce to a buyer and subsequently cannot deliver produce complying with the contract because the growers cannot or will not deliver such produce to him, he may be liable to the buyer for damages resulting from the breach of the contract.
              
            
            
              Conversion of Funds
              
                § 46.33
                Conversion of funds.
                Any licensee who collects or receives funds for or on behalf of another person or firm in connection with produce shall not make any use or disposition of such funds in his possession or control that will endanger or impair faithful and prompt payment to the owner or consignor of the produce or to any other person having a financial interest therein.
              
            
            
              Disclosure of Business
              
                § 46.34
                No disclosure of business of licensee.
                No representative of the Department shall, without the consent of the licensee, divulge or make known, except to financially interested parties, or to other representatives of the Department who may be required to have such knowledge in the regular course of their official duties, or except insofar as he may be directed by the Secretary, Deputy Administrator, Director, or a court of competent jurisdiction, any facts or information regarding the business of such licensee which may come to the knowledge of such representative through an examination or inspection of the business or the accounts of the licensee, unless such facts or information should be testified to at a hearing authorized by the act because they are relevant and material to the issue in the case being heard.
              
            
            
              Suspension and Revocation of Licenses
              
                § 46.35
                Suspension or revocation order.

                (a) Whenever the Secretary shall order the suspension or revocation of a license, the person against whom such order is directed shall be served by the Hearing Clerk with a copy of the order, and be notified of the effective date thereof. Service of orders shall be accomplished in accordance with § 47.4 of this chapter.

                (c) After the revocation of his license or during the effective period of any suspension thereof, no person shall, either directly or indirectly, through any agent, employee, or otherwise, carry on the business of a commission merchant, dealer, or broker until his status as a licensee has been restored.
                (d) The suspension or revocation of a license shall not prevent the licensee from collecting amounts due on contracts entered into prior to the date of suspension or revocation or from remitting promptly to his principals and obligees.

              Trade Terms and Definitions
              
                § 46.43
                Terms construed.
                The following terms and definitions, when used in any contract or communication involving any transaction coming within the scope of the Act, shall be construed as follows:
                (a) Today's shipment, or shipment on a specified date (such as shipment September 12), means in connection with shipments by rail, that the goods referred to shall be under billing by the transportation company on the date the order is given or on the date specified in time to be picked up by a train schedule to move that day's loadings from the shipping point. When used in connection with shipments by boat, this term shall mean that the goods shall be placed alongside the boat and be under billing in time to be loaded and shipped on a boat scheduled to leave before midnight of the date specified. When used in connection with shipments by truck, this term shall mean that the goods shall be loaded and shall actually start from loading point to destination before midnight of the date specified.
                (b) Tomorrow's shipment or immediate shipment means that the shipment referred to shall be under billing by the transportation company in time to move on a transportation facility scheduled to leave not more than 24 hours later than allowed under “today's shipment.”
                (c) Quick shipment means that the conditions of the offer, order, or confirmation will be met if the shipment is under billing by the transportation company in time to move on a transportation facility scheduled to leave not more than 48 hours later than allowed under “today's shipment.”
                (d) Prompt shipment means that the conditions of the offer, order, or confirmation will be met if the shipment is under billing by the transportation company in time to move on a transportation facility scheduled to leave not more than 72 hours later than allowed under “today's shipment.”
                (e) Shipment first part of week or shipment early part of week means that the produce referred to shall be under billing on Monday or Tuesday of the week specified in time to be picked up by a train scheduled to move these days' loadings from the shipping point. When used in connection with shipments by truck, this term shall mean that the goods shall be loaded and shall actually start from loading point to destination before midnight on Tuesday of the week specified.
                (f) Shipment middle of week means that the produce referred to shall be under billing by the transportation company in time to move on a transportation facility scheduled to leave Wednesday or Thursday of the week specified. When used in connection with shipments by truck, this term shall mean that the goods shall be loaded and shall actually start from loading point to destination before midnight on Thursday of the week specified.
                (g) Shipment last of week or shipment latter part of week means that the produce referred to shall be under billing by the transportation company in time to move on a transportation facility scheduled to leave on Friday or Saturday of the week specified. When used in connection with shipments by truck, this term shall mean that the goods shall be loaded and shall actually start from loading point to destination before midnight on Saturday of the week specified.
                
                (h) Shipment as soon as possible or Shipment as soon as car (truck) can be secured means that the shipper is uncertain as to when the shipment can be made, but expects to make it within a reasonable time and will make it soon as possible. But in any case where these words are used the buyer shall, at any time after 7 days from the date the order is given, have the right to cancel the order or contract of sale, if notice of his decision so to cancel shall have been received by the shipper before shipment has been made.
                (i) F.o.b. (for example, f.o.b. Laredo, Tex., or f.o.b. California) means that the produce quoted or sold is to be placed free on board the boat, car, or other agency of the through land transportation at shipping point, in suitable shipping condition (see definitions of “suitable shipping condition,” paragraphs (j) and (k) of this section), and that the buyer assumes all risk of damage and delay in transit not caused by the seller irrespective of how the shipment is billed. The buyer shall have the right of inspection at destination before the goods are paid for to determine if the produce shipped complied with the terms of the contract at time of shipment, subject to the provisions covering suitable shipping condition.
                (j) Suitable shipping condition, in relation to direct shipments, means that the commodity, at time of billing, is in a condition which, if the shipment is handled under normal transportation service and conditions, will assure delivery without abnormal deterioration at the contract destination agreed upon between the parties. If a good delivery standard for a commodity is set forth in § 46.44, and that commodity at the contract destination contains deterioration in excess of any tolerance provided therein, it will be considered abnormally deteriorated. The seller has no responsibility for any deterioration in transit if there is no contract destination agreed upon between the parties.
                (k) Suitable shipping condition, in connection with reconsigned rolling or tramp cars, means that the commodity, at time of sale, meets the requirements of this phrase as defined in paragraph (j) of this section, relating to direct shipments.
                (l) F.o.b. acceptance or Shipping point acceptance means that the buyer accepts the produce at shipping point and has no right of rejection. The buyer has recourse against the seller if the produce was not in suitable shipping condition (see definitions, paragraphs (j) and (k) of this section) or has recourse for a material breach of contract, providing the shipment is not rejected. The buyer's remedy under this method of purchase is by recovery of damages from the seller and not by rejection.
                (m) F.o.b. acceptance final or Shipping point acceptance final means that the buyer accepts the produce at shipping point and has no right of rejection. Suitable shipping condition does not apply under this trade term. The buyer does have recourse for a material breach of contract, providing the shipment is not rejected. The buyer's remedy under this type of contract is by recovery of damages from the seller and not by rejection of the shipment.
                (n) F.o.b. steamer means that the produce is to be placed free on board steamer at shipping point, in suitable shipping condition (see definitions of “suitable shipping condition”, paragraphs (j) and (k) of this section) in accordance with the terms of the contract, and that the buyer assumes all responsibility and risk of damage thereafter.
                (o) F.a.s. steamer means that the produce is to be delivered free alongside the steamer, in suitable shipping condition (see definitions of “suitable shipping condition”, paragraphs (j) and (k) of this section), in accordance with the terms of the contract, and that the buyer assumes all responsibility and risk of damage thereafter.
                (p) Delivered or delivered sale means that the produce is to be delivered by the seller on board car, or truck or on dock if delivered by boat, at the market in which the buyer is located, or at such other market as is agreed upon, free of any and all charges for transportation or protective service. The seller assumes all risks of loss and damage in transit not caused by the buyer For example, a sale of “U.S. No. 1 potatoes delivered Chicago” means that the potatoes, when tendered for delivery at Chicago, shall meet all the requirements of the U.S. No. 1 grade as to quality and condition.
                (q) In transit, roller, or rolling car means that the produce referred to is in possession of the transportation company and under movement from shipping point when the quotation is made, and that the car is moving over a route in line of haul between the point of origin and the market in which delivery is to be made, and has been so moving since date of shipment, without any delay attributable to the shipper or his agent. Unless otherwise specifically agreed, if a roller, rolling car, or a car in transit is sold f.o.b. shipping point, the buyer shall be deemed to have assumed only the lowest all-rail freight charges applicable for the shipment between the point of origin and the contract destination agreed upon between the parties together with such other charges which would have accrued if the car had been originally shipped direct to the contract destination: Provided, That the buyer is not liable for payment for protective services if the seller does not inform him of the kind and extent of such services ordered from the carrier.
                (r) Tramp car or tramp car sale means that the produce has left the shipping point under a bill of lading issued prior to the day on which the quotation is made and has moved or is moving over a route out of line of haul with the market in which it is to be delivered or in which it is being offered or quoted, or has been moving over a route in line of haul between the point of origin and the market in which it is to be delivered or in which it is being offered or quoted, but has been delayed in transit by the seller, or has been held by the transportation company at diversion or other points en route awaiting instructions from the shipper and by such holding or delay has missed scheduled movement between points of shipment and the market in which it is to be delivered as the result of the transaction in question. Unless otherwise specifically agreed, if a “tramp car” is sold f.o.b. shipping point or a “tramp car sale” is made f.o.b. shipping point, the buyer shall be deemed to assume only the lowest authorized all-rail freight charges applicable for the shipment between the point of origin and the contract destination agreed upon between the parties, together with such other charges which would have accrued if the car had been originally shipped direct to the contract destination: Provided, That the buyer is not liable for payment for protective services if the seller does not inform him of the kind and extent of such services ordered from the carrier.
                (s) Rolling acceptance means that the buyer accepts at time of purchase produce which is in the custody of the transportation company and under movement from shipping point, under the terms and conditions described in paragraphs (q) and (r) of this section, except that the buyer assumes full responsibility for transportation of the goods from time of purchase, has no recourse against the seller because of any change in condition after time of purchase unless the goods at the time of sale were not in suitable shipping condition, and has no right of rejection on arrival. The buyer's remedy under this method of purchase is by recovery of damages from the shipper and not by rejection of the shipment. By agreement between the parties, however, the purchase may be made subject to inspection at any specified point while the car is rolling or in transit and the point at which the buyer will assume transportation charges may be specified without affecting the time of acceptance of the commodity.
                (t) Rolling acceptance final means the same as Rolling acceptance except that the buyer has no recourse against the seller because of any change in condition of the produce in transit. The buyer has recourse against the seller for any material breach of the contract providing the shipment is not rejected. The buyer's remedy under this type of contract is recovery of damages from the seller and not by rejection.
                (u)(1) Track sale or sale on track means a sale of produce on track after transit and after inspection or opportunity for inspection by the buyer, or his agent, who shall be considered to have waived any right to reject the commodity so purchased upon receipt by him or his duly authorized representative from the seller or his duly authorized representative of the bill of lading, delivery order, or other document enabling him to obtain the goods from the carrier.
                (2) The above definition shall not be construed as depriving the buyer of a right to reparation when the unloading of the car demonstrates that a part of the lading which was not accessible to inspection was of a quality or condition materially inferior to that portion which was accessible to inspection; but notice of intention to file a claim for reparation must be given the seller within 24 hours after receipt by the buyer of the delivery order or bill of lading.
                (3) If the seller gives the date of arrival when quoting price, the buyer shall, in the absence of any written memorandum of sale to the contrary, assume all charges that accrue on the shipment from the date of its arrival. If the seller fails to furnish the date of arrival when quoting price the buyer may, in the absence of any written memorandum of sale which includes the date of arrival or specific written statement as to who shall assume such charges as have accrued after arrival, assume that the shipment arrived at point of sale on the day and date upon which the purchase was made, and shall be liable only for such charges as would properly attach to a shipment arriving on the date the purchase was made.
                (v) C.a.f., c.a.c., and c.i.f. mean cost and freight, cost and charges, and cost, insurance, and freight, respectively. C.a.f. sales shall be deemed to be the same as f.o.b. sales, except that the selling price shall include the correct freight charges to destination. C.a.c. sales shall be deemed to be the same as f.o.b. sales, except that the selling price includes the correct freight and refrigeration or heater charges to destination. C.i.f. sales shall be deemed to be the same as f.o.b. sales, except that the selling price includes insurance and the correct freight and refrigeration or heater charges to destination.
                (w) Carload, carlot, or car when used in offers, quotations, or contracts in which the quantity is not more definitely specified, and in the absence of well-established trade custom or standard as to size of a “carload,” “carlot,” or “car” of the produce in question, means not less than the minimum quantity required by the carrier's tariff applicable to the movement, and not more than 10 percent in excess of such minimum tariff requirements, except that, where the carrier's tariffs provide alternative rates and minimum, the buyer shall state which tariff minimum must be observed, and, in event of failure so to do, the shipper may exercise his discretion, in no case, however, exceeding the higher alternative minimum quantity provided by the tariff, with only such variations therefrom as are permitted by this paragraph.
                (x) Shipping-point inspection means that the seller is required to obtain Federal or Federal-State inspection, or such private inspection as has been mutually agreed upon, to show the compliance of the lot sold with the quality, condition, and grade specifications of the contract, and that the seller assumes the risk incident to incorrect certification.
                (y) Shipping-point inspection final, or inspection final following the name of the State or point, as California inspection final, means that the seller is required to obtain Federal or Federal-State inspection, or such private inspection as has been mutually agreed upon, to show the compliance of the lot sold with the quality, condition, and grade specifications of the contract, and that the buyer assumes the risk incident to incorrect certification and is without recourse against the seller on account of quality, condition, and grade.
                (z) Subject approval Government inspection means that the seller is required to obtain Federal or Federal-State inspection, or such private inspection as has been mutually agreed upon, and to correctly communicate, by wire or other agreed means, the statements on the certificate as to quality, condition and grade, and other essential information, whereupon the buyer, upon approval thereof, will be deemed to have accepted the produce without recourse against the seller on account of quality, condition, and grade.
                (aa) Guaranteed advance used in connection with an advance payment on consigned produce means that the person making the advance guarantees that the net proceeds to the consignor shall at least equal the amount so advanced, and that the consignor cannot be held liable for any deficit resulting from the sale of the produce, if such deficit is not occasioned by or contributed to by an act of the consignor.
                (bb) Accommodation advance or regular advance, used in connection with an advance of money or credit against anticipated net proceeds to be realized from the sale of consigned produce, means that the consignor has received an advance of money or credit and that, if the consigned produce does not sell for enough to cover the cost of transportation and handling, including customary or agreed commission and the advance made to him, the consignor must return to the person making the advance a sum equal to the deficit sustained.
                (cc) Price arrival, in the absence of a contrary specific understanding, means that the produce is shipped either direct to the customer or to an agent of the consignor, for the benefit of the customer, the price to be subject to agreement between the customer and the consignor upon the arrival of the produce at the customer's destination, with sufficient time being permitted for inspection.
                (dd) F.o.b. inspection and acceptance arrival means that the produce quoted or sold is to be placed by the seller free on board car or other agency of through transportation at shipping point, the cost of transportation to be borne by the buyer, but the seller to assume all risks of loss and damage in transit not caused by the buyer, who has the right to inspect the goods upon arrival and to reject them if, upon such inspection, they are found not to meet the specifications of the contract of sale at destination. The buyer may not reject without reasonable cause. Such a sale is f.o.b. only as to price and is on a delivered basis as to grade, quality, and condition.
                (ee) F.o.b. sale at delivered price means the same as f.o.b., except that transportation charges from shipping point to destination shall be borne by the seller; that is, the sale is f.o.b. as to grade, quality, and condition, and delivered as to price.
                (ff) Purchase after inspection means a purchase of produce after inspection or opportunity for inspection by the buyer or his agent. Under this term the buyer has no right of rejection and waives all warranties as to quality or condition, except warranties expressly made by the seller.
                (gg) Cash sale means that the buyer is required to pay the seller within 24 hours after his acceptance of the shipment.
                (hh) Joint Account—Split Above means that the receiving joint partner will pay promptly the agreed cost of the shipment to his joint partner. After disposition of the produce, the parties will divide equally the profits on the shipment after deduction of the cost of the shipment and proper expenses from the gross proceeds. The receiving joint partner will pay all expenses and cannot recover any loss resulting from the joint venture.
                (ii) Commercial Unit means a single shipment of one or more perishable agricultural commodities tendered for delivery on a single contract, such commercial unit must be accepted or rejected in its entirety. Acceptance of a commercial unit does not modify the parties' existing contractual rights and responsibilities.

              Good Delivery Standards
              
                § 46.44
                Good delivery.
                Unless otherwise agreed to between the contracting parties, “Good Delivery” in connection with f.o.b. contracts of purchase and sale means that the commodity meets the requirements of the contract at time of loading or sale and, if the shipment is handled under normal transportation service and conditions, will meet the following additional requirements on delivery at the contract destination:
                (a) Lettuce. (1) If the contract specifies a U.S. grade, the lettuce may contain an average of not more than 3 percent condition defects, including not more than 2 percent decay affecting any portion of the head exclusive of wrapper leaves in excess of the destination tolerances provided for the applicable grade in the U.S. Standards for Grades of Lettuce. (For example, the U.S. No. 1 grade provides a 12 percent tolerance for damage at destination. If a lot contains 5 percent damage by permanent grade factors, 7 percent of the tolerance can be applied to damage by condition factors. The additional 3 percent Good Delivery tolerance would then allow a total of 10 percent damage by condition factors in this shipment at destination.)
                (2) If the contract does not specify a U.S. grade or percentage of condition defects, the lettuce at destination may contain a maximum of 15 percent, by count, of the heads in any lot which are damaged by condition defects, including therein not more than 9 percent serious damage of which not more than 5 percent may be decay affecting any portion of the head exclusive of wrapper leaves. Sales made on a percentage of a U.S. grade, without specifying the percentage of condition defects separately from the permanent defects, fall under this provision, and the lettuce may not contain more than a total of 15 percent condition defects at destination. However, if the condition defects are specified, provision No. 3 will apply.
                (3) If the contract specifies a percentage of individual or combined condition defects, the lettuce at destination may contain either of the following, whichever is greater:

                (i) One and one-half times the specified percentage of damage or serious damage by condition defects: Provided, That, if serious damage is not specified, one-half of the allowance at destination may be serious damage, including therein not more than one-quarter of the total allowance may be decay affecting any portion of the head exclusive of wrapper leaves. (For example, a lot sold as “16 percent tipburn” could have a total of 24 percent damage by tipburn at destination, including not more than 12 percent serious damage of which not more than 6 percent may be decay affecting any portion of the head exclusive of wrapper leaves.) or
                (ii) Up to 15 percent, by count, of the heads in any lot which are damaged by condition defects, including therein not more than 9 percent serious damage of which not more than 5 percent may be decay affecting any portion of the head exclusive of wrapper leaves.
                Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, condition defects will be considered to be damage as defined in the U.S. Standards for Lettuce.
                (4) If the contract clearly indicates by descriptive terms that the lettuce is of inferior quality, larger allowances for damage by condition defects than those specified above will be applied.
                (5) If the buyer and the seller agree to percentages for defects at destination, higher or lower than those specified above, such percentages will determine whether good delivery is made.

              Misrepresentation or Misbranding
              
                § 46.45
                Procedure in administering section 2(5) of the Act.
                It is a violation of section 2(5) for a commission merchant, dealer, or broker to misrepresent by word, act, mark, stencil, label, statement, or deed, the character, kind, grade, quality, quantity, size, pack, weight, condition, degree, or maturity, or State, country, region of origin of any perishable agricultural commodity received, shipped, sold, or offered to be sold in interstate or foreign commerce. However, a person other than the first licensee handling misbranded perishable agricultural commodities shall not be held liable for a violation of section 2(5) of the Act by reason of the conduct of another if the person did not have knowledge of the violation or lacked the ability to correct the violation.
                (a) Violations. Violations are considered to be serious, very serious, or repeated and/or flagrant, depending upon the circumstances of the misrepresentation.
                (1) Serious violations. Include the following:

                (i) Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity shown by official inspection to contain scorable defects, off-size, off-count, exceeding the tolerance(s) in an amount up to and including double the tolerance provided in the applicable grades, standards or inspection procedures;
                
                (ii) Any lot of perishable agricultural commodity officially certified as failing to meet the declared weight;
                (iii) Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity in which the State, country, or region of origin of the produce is misrepresentated because the lot is made up of containers with various labels or markings that reflect more than one incorrect State, country or region of origin. Example: A lot with containers individually marked to show the origin as Idaho or Maine or Colorado when the produce was grown in Wisconsin; or
                (iv) Any other physical act, verbal or written declaration, or record entry that misrepresents a lot of a perishable agricultural commodity to the same extent as the examples listed.
                (2) Very serious violations. Include the following:
                (i) Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity shown by official inspection to contain scorable defects, off-size, off-count, in excess of double the tolerance(s) provided in the applicable grades, standards or inspection procedures;
                (ii) Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity packed in containers showing a single point of origin, which is other than that in which the produce was grown, such as containers marked “California” when the produce was grown in Arizona;
                (iii) Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity officially certified as having an average net weight more than four percent below the declared weight;
                (iv) Multiple sales or shipments of a misrepresented perishable agricultural commodity within a seven day period that can be attributed to one cause; or
                (v) Any other physical act, verbal or written declaration, or record entry that misrepresents a lot of a perishable agricultural commodity to the same extent as the examples listed.
                (3) Flagrant violations. Include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following examples:
                (i) Shipment or sale of a lot of a perishable agricultural commodity from shipping point after notification by official inspection that the inspected commodity fails to comply with any marking on the container without first correcting the misbranding;

                (ii) To offer for resale or consignment, a lot of a perishable agricultural commodity that has been officially inspected at destination and found to be misbranded without advising a prospective receiver that the lot is misbranded and that the misbranding must be corrected before resale. When a resale or consignment is finalized, written notice must be given that the lot is misbranded and must be corrected before resale; or
                (iii) To withhold or fail to disclose known material facts with respect to a misrepresentation or misbranding.
                (b) Evidence. (1) Evidence concerning a misrepresentation or misbranding includes official certificates of an inspection made by any person authorized by the Department to inspect fruits and vegetables or other public certifiers, and includes investigations and audit findings and any business records, testimony or other evidence bearing on the subject.

                (2) When a lot of a perishable agricultural commodity has been officially inspected, and certification is made that the descriptive container markings are correct, but a subsequent inspection reverses the original findings, both inspection certificates will be accepted as evidence to show that the shipper/seller has not misrepresented the lot. The receiver of the commodity will be in violation if the misrepresentation is not corrected before the commodity is shipped, sold or offered for resale.
                (c) Sanctions—(1) Informal. When liability for a violation of section 2(5) of the Act is to be settled informally, the violator may:
                (i) Be given written warnings; or

                (ii) Be given notice that liability for a violation may be settled by admitting the violation in writing and paying a penalty in an amount satisfactory to the Secretary in lieu of formal disciplinary action. In the event of a formal proceeding to suspend or revoke the license of such person because he has committed other violation(s), the admitted violation(s) will not be used to support the formal complaint but may be admitted to show a course of conduct prior to the filing of the formal complaint;
                
                (iii) (A) The schedule for informal disposition is as follows:

                    3 Very serious violation.
                
                (B) Informal disposition of misrepresentation violations is not limited to seven occurrences and will be considered for further violations.
                (2) Formal. Formal proceedings to suspend or revoke a license may be instituted at any time against a person who has committed repeated and/or flagrant violations.
                (d) Cumulative record. A cumulative record of licensee's misrepresentation violations will be maintained with the following limitations:
                (1) Two years after the date it was committed or after payment of a monetary penalty, the violation will not be used as a basis for instituting formal disciplinary action. However, it may be cited as a part of the pattern of violations if formal proceedings are instituted and will be used in determining the level of monetary penalty for informal settlements.
                (2) The record of violations not involved in formal proceedings will be expunged if there are no violations during a twenty-four (24) month period from the date of the most recent violation, or after thirty-six (36) months from the date of said violation, unless it was made a part of a formal disciplinary complaint.
                (e) Summary of procedure—(1) Compilation of authority. The rules defining misrepresentation, including misbranding, and for determining liability and disposition of violations are contained in the Act (7 U.S.C. 499 et seq.), in particular sections 2(5) and 8 (7 U.S.C. 449b(5) and 499h), § 46.45 of the Regulations (7 CFR 46.45), the Rules of Practice Governing Formal Adjudicatory Administrative Proceedings Instituted By the Secretary (7 CFR 1.130 et seq.), and in the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.).
                (2) Evidence of misrepresentation. Evidence of misrepresentation or misbranding violations includes results of official inspections, audit findings, business records, or other documentation or testimony bearing on the subject. When a lot of fruits and vegetables has been officially inspected, and certification made that the descriptive markings on the container do not misrepresent the produce, but a subsequent inspection reverses the original finding (such as to grade, size, weight, etc.), the shipper/seller will not be charged with violation of the Act. However, the misrepresentation must be corrected before the lot is shipped, sold, or offered for resale.
                (3) Warning letters. When informal settlement of liability is appropriate, violators are given two written warnings and an opportunity to take preventive action before formal action is considered. Warning letters include an explanation of the requirements of the Act and recommendations of actions which the violator can take to avoid future violations.
                (4) Informal sanctions. Violations subsquent to the sending of the warning letters referred to above, other than flagrant violations, may be settled informally pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. This procedure permits the violator to resolve the matter by payment of a monetary penalty pursuant to a schedule set out in lieu of a formal proceeding.
                (5) Formal sanctions. In cases involving repeated or flagrant violations of the Act, formal proceedings seeking the suspension or revocation of the violator's license may be instituted pursuant to the Rules of Practice governing such matters (7 CFR 1.130 et seq.). Except in cases of willfulness or where the public health, interest, or safety requires otherwise, a violator must be given written warning and opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with the Act before its license can be suspended or revoked (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.). The warning letters referred to above serve this purpose. If formal proceedings are instituted, the violator is afforded an oral hearing, if requested, before an Administrative Law Judge, an opportunity to appeal an adverse decision to the Department's Judicial Officer, and a further opportunity to appeal an adverse final decision to the appropriate United States Circuit Court of Appeals.
                (6) Use of record of misrepresentation. A cumulative record of misrepresentation is maintained. It is used as a basis for determining whether a warning letter should be considered, and, if so, the amount of monetary penalty which is appropriate, or whether there is cause for instituting a formal disciplinary proceeding seeking suspension or revocation of the violator's license. But after payment of a monetary penalty or after two years from the date of the last violation, no formal disciplinary use can be made of the previous record of violation. The record of misrepresentation shall be erased if there are no further violations in the twenty-four (24) month period immediately following the most recent violation, or after 36 months from the date of each individual violation unless it is involved in formal disciplinary proceedings.

              Statutory Trust
              
                § 46.46
                Statutory trust.
                (a) Definitions. (1) “Received” means the time when the buyer, receiver, or agent gains ownership, control, or possession of the perishable agricultural commodities: Provided, That when perishable agricultural commodities have not been received as described above, and where there is a rejection without reasonable cause as provided in § 46.2(bb) and (cc), the goods will be considered to have been received when proffered.
                (2) “Dissipation” means any act or failure to act which could result in the diversion of trust assets or which could prejudice or impair the ability of unpaid suppliers, sellers, or agents to recover money owed in connection with produce transactions.

                (3) “Default” means the failure to pay promptly money owed in connection with transactions in perishable agricultural commodities; i.e., within the period of time applicable to the type of transaction as established by the provisions of the regulations (§ 46.2(aa)), or as otherwise agreed upon by the parties.
                (4) “Calendar days” as used in section 5(c) 3 of the Act means every day of the week, including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, except that if the thirtieth calendar day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the final day with respect to the time for filing a written notice of intent to preserve the benefit of the trust shall be the next day upon which there is postal delivery service.
                (5) “Ordinary and usual billing or invoice statements” as used in section 5(c)(4) of the Act, and “invoice or other billing statement” as used in § 46.46(f)(3), mean communications customarily used between parties to a transaction in perishable agricultural commodities in whatever form, documentary or electronic, for billing or invoicing purposes.
                (b) Trust assets. The trust is made up of perishable agricultural commodities received in all transactions, all inventories of food or other products derived from such perishable agricultural commodities, and all receivables or proceeds from the sale of such commodities and food or products derived therefrom. Trust assets are to be preserved as a nonsegregated “floating” trust. Commingling of trust assets is contemplated.
                (c) Trust benefits. (1) When a seller, supplier or agent who has met the eligibility requirements of paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this section, transfers ownership, possession, or control of goods to a commission merchant, dealer, or broker, it automatically becomes eligible to participate in the trust. Participants who preserve their rights to benefits in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section remain beneficiaries until they are paid in full.

                (2) Any licensee, or person subject to license, who has a fiduciary duty to collect funds resulting from the sale or consignment of produce, and remit such funds to its principal, also has the duty to preserve its principal's rights to trust benefits in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section. The responsibility for filing the notice to preserve the principal's rights is obligatory and cannot be avoided by the agent by means of a contract provision. Persons acting as agents also have the responsibility to negotiate contracts which entitle their principals to the protection of the trust provisions: Provided, That a principal may elect to waive its right to trust protection. To be effective, the waiver must be in writing and separate and distinct from any agency contract, must be signed by the principal prior to the time affected transactions occur, must clearly state the principal's intent to waive its right to become a trust beneficiary on a given transaction, or a series of transactions, and must include the date the agent's authority to act on the principal's behalf expires. In the event an agent having a fiduciary duty to collect funds resulting from the sale or consignment of produce and remit such funds to its principal fails to perform the duty of preserving its principal's rights to trust benefits, it may be held liable to the principal for damages. A principal employing a collect and remit agent must preserve its rights to trust benefits against such agent by filing appropriate notices with the agent.
                (d) Trust maintenance. (1) Licensees and persons subject to license are required to maintain trust assets in a manner so that the trust assets are freely available to satisfy outstanding obligations to sellers of perishable agricultural commodities. Any act or omission which is inconsistent with this responsibility, including dissipation of trust assets, is unlawful and in violation of section 2 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 499b). Growers, licensees, and persons subject to license may file trust actions against licensees and persons operating subject to license. Licensees and persons subject to license are bound by the trust provisions of the Act (7 U.S.C. 499(e)).
                (2) Principals, including growers, who employ agents to sell perishable agricultural commodities on their behalf are “suppliers” and/or “sellers” as those words are used in section 5(c)(2) and (3) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 499e(c)(2) and (3)), and therefore must preserve their trust rights against their agents by filing a notice of intent to preserve trust rights with their agents as set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.
                (3) Agents who sell perishable agricultural commodities on behalf of their principals must preserve their principals' trust benefits against the buyers by filing a notice of intent to preserve trust rights with the buyers. Any act or omission which is inconsistent with this responsibility, including failure to give timely notice of intent to preserve trust benefits, is unlawful and in violation of section 2 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 499b).
                (e) Prompt payment and eligibility for trust benefits. (1) The times for prompt accounting and prompt payment are set out in § 46.2(z) and (aa). Parties who elect to use different times for payment must reduce their agreement to writing before entering into the transaction and maintain a copy of their agreement in their records, and the times of payment must be disclosed on invoices, accountings, and other documents relating to the transaction.
                (2) The maximum time for payment for a shipment to which a seller, supplier, or agent can agree, prior to the transaction, and still be eligible for benefits under the trust is 30 days after receipt and acceptance of the commodities as defined in § 46.2(dd) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
                (3) If there is a default in payment as defined in § 46.46(a)(3), the seller, supplier, or agent who has met the eligibility requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section will not forfeit eligibility under the trust by agreeing in any manner to a schedule for payment of the past due amount or by accepting a partial payment.
                (4) The trust provisions do not apply to transactions between a cooperative association (as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)), and its members.
                (5) The amount claimable against the trust by a beneficiary or grower will be the net amount due after allowable deductions of contemplated expenses or advances made in connection with the transaction by the commission merchant, dealer, or broker.
                (f) Filing notice of intent to preserve trust benefits. (1) Notice of intent to preserve benefits under the trust must be in writing, must include the statement that it is a notice of intent to preserve trust benefits and must include information which establishes for each shipment:
                (i) The names and addresses of the trust beneficiary, seller-supplier, commission merchant, or agent and the debtor, as applicable,
                (ii) The date of the transaction, commodity, invoice price, and terms of payment (if appropriate),
                (iii) The date of receipt of notice that a payment instrument has been dishonored (if appropriate), and
                (iv) The amount past due and unpaid; except that if a supplier, seller or agent engages a commission merchant or growers' agent to sell or market their produce, the supplier, seller or agent that has not received a final accounting from the commission merchant or growers' agent shall only be required to provide information in sufficient detail to identify the transaction subject to the trust.
                (2) Timely filing of a notice of intent to preserve benefits under the trust will be considered to have been made if written notice is given to the debtor within 30 calendar days:
                (i) After expiration of the time prescribed by which payment must be made pursuant to regulation,
                (ii) After expiration of such other time by which payment must be made as the parties have expressly agreed to in writing before entering into the transaction, but not longer than the time prescribed in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, or
                (iii) After the time the supplier, seller or agent has received notice that a payment instrument promptly presented for payment has been dishonored. Failures to pay within the time periods set forth in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section constitute defaults.
                (3) Licensees may choose an alternate method of preserving trust benefits from the requirements described in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section. Licensees may use their invoice or other billing statement as defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, whether in documentary or electronic form, to preserve trust benefits. Alternately, the licensee's invoice or other billing statement, given to the buyer, must contain:
                (i) The statement: “The perishable agricultural commodities listed on this invoice are sold subject to the statutory trust authorized by section 5(c) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, 1930 (7 U.S.C. 499e(c)). The seller of these commodities retains a trust claim over these commodities, all inventories of food or other products derived from these commodities, and any receivables or proceeds from the sale of these commodities until full payment is received.”; and
                (ii) The terms of payment if they differ from prompt payment set out in section 46.2(z) and (aa) of this part, and the parties have expressly agreed to such terms in writing before the affected transactions occur.
                (4) If the invoice or other billing statement is in electronic form, the licensee has met its requirement of giving the buyer notice of intent to preserve trust benefits on the face of the invoice or other billing statement if the electronic invoice or other billing statement containing the statement set forth in paragraph (f)(3)(i) is sent to the buyer and the electronic transmission can be verified. The licensee will be deemed to have given notice to the buyer of its intent to preserve trust benefits if the licensee can verify that the electronic invoice or other billing statement was sent to a third party electronic transaction vendor designated by the buyer. The licensee will have met the requirement of giving the buyer written notice of intent to preserve trust benefits using electronic means if it can verify that the electronic data invoice or other billing statement was transmitted to the buyer, or its designated electronic transaction vendor, irrespective of whether or not the buyer or third party vendor downloads or accepts the trust statement.

                (5) If a buyer conducts its transactions in perishable agricultural commodities using an electronic system, the buyer or its third party electronic vendor must allow sufficient space for the seller to include the required trust statement of intent to preserve trust benefits in the buyer's electronic invoices or other billing statement forms. A buyer or its designated third party electronic vendor must accept a seller's notice of intent to preserve benefits under the trust using the required trust statement, whether in documentary or electronic form, as set forth in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section. Any act or omission which is inconsistent with this responsibility is unlawful and in violation of Section 2 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 499b).

                § 46.48
                Procedure for investigating complaints involving commodities of a unique nature or coming from a distinct geographic area.
                (a) Scope: This section provides for the payment of fees and the investigation of allegations of misrepresentation or misbranding in which the commodity which is misbranded or misrepresented is purported to be a commodity of a unique name or geographical designation which is defined as:
                (1) A perishable agricultural commodity as that term is defined under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, 1930;

                (2) Subject to a federal marketing order under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);
                (3) Traditionally identified as being produced in a distinct geographic area, State, or region; and
                (4) Of a unique identity, based on such distinct geographic area, which has been promoted with funds collected through producer contributions pursuant to such marketing order.
                (b) Filing complaints: (1) Any person desiring to complain of a possible violation by any commission merchant, dealer, or broker as a result of misrepresentation or misbranding of any commodity subject to these regulations may file a complaint with the Secretary of Agriculture and request an investigation of the complaint by the Secretary.
                (2) Complaints shall be made in writing setting forth all the essential details, including but not limited to:

                (iv) The current location of the commodity;
                (v) If shipped, the shipping and destination points of the commodity;
                (vi) A statement of all other known material facts with respect to the complaint; and
                (vii) Copies of any documents or evidence of any kind in the possession of the complainant regarding the alleged violation.
                (3) The complaint shall be accompanied by a non-refundable $250.00 filing fee made payable to the Agricultural Marketing Service (see paragraph (e) of this section Collection of fees).
                (4) The complaint, all supporting evidence, and fee should be mailed to: PACA Branch, room 2095 So., Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090-6456.
                (c) Handling complaints. (1) Upon receiving a written complaint, supporting evidence, and the $250.00 preliminary investigation fee from a complaining person, the Director, Fruit and Vegetable Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, United States Department of Agriculture shall order a preliminary investigation to determine if the complaint can be substantiated. If the initial investigation discloses no violation of the Act, no further action shall be taken and the complaining person shall be informed of the finding. The $250.00 filing fee shall be considered full payment for the preliminary investigation.
                (2) If the Director finds reasonable cause for further investigation, the complaining person shall be duly notified of the findings. Prior to any further investigation, the Director shall advise the complaining person of the estimated fees and charges which the complaining person must pay. In calculating the estimated fees, the Director shall use the hourly salary rate of a GS-5, Step 4, for clerical time and GS-13, Step 1, for professional time, plus benefits and other related expenses including travel associated with the investigation.
                (3) At the conclusion of the investigation, the Department will inform the complaining person of the results, provided, however, that any findings, the release of which may jeopardize an ongoing formal disciplinary proceeding initiated under the PACA, may be withheld pending completion of the disciplinary case.
                (d) Investigative authority. Investigation of a complaint of this section shall be deemed to be an investigation under section 6(b) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (7 U.S.C. 499f(b)).
                (e) Collection of fees. (1) Any person bringing a complaint, alleging a violation of section 1309 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 shall reimburse the Secretary of Agriculture for any and all costs associated with the enforcement of that section.
                (2) A non-refundable $250.00 fee for the preliminary investigation shall accompany the written complaint.
                (3) An estimate of fees and charges to conduct the further investigation calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section will be provided the complaining person.
                (i) Payment of the fees and charges shall be collected in advance by the Secretary prior to continuation of investigation of a complaint.
                (ii) Payment of fees and charges may be made by cash, check, or money order payable to the Agricultural Marketing Service.
                (iii) In the event that the estimated fees and charges prove to be inadequate, the complaining person will be informed of the deficiency. Any complaining person that does not reimburse the Secretary full payment for fees and charges associated with a completed investigation shall be liable to be proceeded against in any court of competent jurisdiction in a suit by the United States to collect any monetary or other damages connected with the investigation.
                (iv) The complaining person will be reimbursed by the Secretary for any overpayment of fees and charges, except for the $250.00 preliminary investigation fee which is nonrefundable.

                § 46.49
                Written notifications and complaints.
                (a) Written notification, as used in section 6(b) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 499f (b)), means:
                (1) Any written statement reporting or complaining of a violation of the Act made by any officer or agency of any State or Territory having jurisdiction over licensees or persons subject to license, or a person filing a complaint under section 6(a), or any other interested person who has knowledge of or information regarding a possible violation of the Act, other than an employee of an agency of USDA administering the Act;
                (2) Any written notice of intent to preserve the benefits of, or any claim for payment from, the trust established under section 5 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 499e);
                (3) Any official certificate(s) of the United States Government or States or Territories of the United States; or

                (b) Any written notification may be filed by delivering the written notification to any office of USDA or any official of USDA responsible for administering the Act. Any written notification published in any public forum, including, but not limited to, a newspaper or an internet website shall be deemed filed upon visual inspection by any office of USDA or any official of USDA responsible for administering the Act. A written notification which is so filed, or any expansion of an investigation resulting from any indication of additional violations of the Act found as a consequence of an investigation based on written notification or complaint, also shall be deemed to constitute a complaint under section 13(a) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 499m(a)).
                (c) Upon becoming aware of a complaint under section 6(a) or written notification under 6(b) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 499f (a) or (b)) by means described in paragraph (a) and (b) of this section, the Secretary will determine if reasonable grounds exist to conduct an investigation of such complaint or written notification for disciplinary action. If the investigation substantiates the existence of violations of the Act, a formal disciplinary complaint may be issued by the Secretary as described in section 6(c)(2) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 499f(c)(2)).
                (d) Whenever an investigation, initiated as described in section 6(c) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 499f(c)(2)), is commenced, or expanded to include new violations of the Act, notice shall be given by the Secretary to the subject of the investigation within thirty (30) days of the commencement or expansion of the investigation. Within one hundred and eighty (180) days after giving initial notice, the Secretary shall provide the subject of the investigation with notice of the status of the investigation, including whether the Secretary intends to issue a complaint under section 6(c)(2) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 499f(e)(2)), terminate the investigation, or continue or expand the investigation. Thereafter, the subject of the investigation may request in writing, no more frequently than every ninety (90) days, a status report from the Director of the PACA Division who shall respond to the written request within fourteen (14) days of receiving the request. When an investigation is terminated, the Secretary shall, within fourteen (14) days, notify the subject of the termination of the investigation. In every case in which notice or response is required under this paragraph (d), such notice or response shall be accomplished by personal service; or by posting the notice or response by certified or registered mail, or commercial or private delivery service to the last known address of the subject of the investigation; or by sending the notice or response by any electronic means such as registered email, that provides proof of receipt to the electronic mail address or phone number of the subject of the investigation.

                (a) Informal complaints. (1) Any interested person (including any officer or agency of any State or Territory having jurisdiction over commission merchants, dealers, or brokers in such State or Territory, and any employee of the Department) desiring to complain of any violation of any provision of the Act by any commission merchant, dealer, or broker may file with the Deputy Administrator an informal complaint. Informal complaints may be made the basis of either a disciplinary complaint, or a claim for damages, or both. If the informal complaint is to be made the basis of a claim for damages, it must be received by the Deputy Administrator within 9 months after the cause of action accrues; if the informal complaint is not to be made the basis of a claim for damages, it may be filed at any time within 2 years after the violation of the act occurred: Provided, That the 2-year limitation herein prescribed shall not apply to complaints charging flagrant or repeated violations of the act.
                (2) Informal complaints may be made in writing by telegram, by letter, or by facsimile transmission, setting forth the essential details of the transaction complained of. So far as practicable, every such informal complaint shall state such of the following items as may be applicable:

                (4) The informal complaint shall be accompanied by a filing fee of $100 as authorized by the Act.
                (b) Investigations and disposition of informal complaints. (1) Upon receipt of all the information and supporting evidence submitted by the person filing the informal complaint, the Deputy Administrator shall cause such investigation to be made as, in the Deputy Administrator's opinion, is justified by the facts. If such investigation discloses that no violation of the Act has occurred, no further action shall be taken and the person filing the informal complaint shall be so informed.

                (2) If the statements in the informal complaint and the investigation thereunder seem to warrant such action, and, in any case except one of wilfullness or one in which public health, interest or safety otherwise requires, which may result in the suspension or revocation of a license, the Deputy Administrator, in an effort to effect an amicable or informal adjustment of the matter, shall give written notice to the person complained against of the facts or conduct concerning which complaint is made, and shall afford such person an opportunity, within a reasonable time fixed by the Deputy Administrator, to demonstrate or achieve compliance with the applicable requirements of the Act and regulations promulgated thereunder.

              Rules Applicable to Reparation Proceedings
              
                § 47.6
                Formal complaints.
                (a) Filing; contents; number of copies. (1) If the procedure provided in § 47.3(b) fails to effect an amicable or informal settlement, the person who filed the informal complaint may, if further proceedings are desired, file a formal complaint with the Fruit and Vegetable Programs. The formal complaint shall be filed within ninety days of notification of the opportunity to proceed formally. Failure to file a formal reparation complaint within the time prescribed shall result in the waiver of further proceedings on the claim alleged in the informal complaint.
                (2) The formal complaint shall set forth the information and be accompanied by the papers indicated in § 47.3(a)(2) and (3), including a statement of the amount of damages claimed, with the basis therefor, and the method of determination. The original and three copies shall be furnished for filing, and service on the respondent. If there is more than one respondent, a further copy shall be furnished for each additional respondent.
                (b) Bond required if complainant is nonresident. If formal complaint for reparation is filed by a nonresident of the United States, complainant shall first file a bond in double the amount of the claim either with a surety company approved by the Treasury Department of the United States as surety or with two personal sureties, each of whom shall be a citizen of the United States and shall qualify as financially responsible for the entire amount of the bond. The bond shall run to the respondent and be conditioned upon the payment of costs, including reasonable attorney's fees, for the respondent if the respondent shall prevail, and of any reparation award that may be issued by the Secretary against the complainant on any counterclaim asserted by respondent: Provided, That the furnishing of a bond may be waived at the discretion of the Secretary if the complainant is a resident of a country which permits the filing of a complaint in an administrative forum or its equivalent which is substantially similar to that provided under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act by a resident of the United States against a citizen of that country without the furnishing of a bond. Nothing in this section shall limit the discretion of the Secretary to deny such a waiver in order to effectuate the purposes of the Act or to protect the interests of the businesses concerned.
                (c) Service upon respondent; proof of service. Upon receipt by the Fruit and Vegetable Programs of the formal complaint, the accompanying papers and the $500 handling fee authorized by the Act, a copy thereof shall be served by the Fruit and Vegetable Programs upon the respondent in accordance with § 47.4 of this part. If the complaint is not in the proper form, the Fruit and Vegetable Programs shall return it and inform the complainant of the deficiencies therein.
                (d) Amendments. At any time prior to the close of the hearing, the complaint may be amended; but, in case of an amendment adding new provisions, the hearing shall, if the respondent so requests, be adjourned for a reasonable time to be determined by the examiner: Provided, That, if the amendment introduces a new or different cause of action, it must be filed within 9 months after the cause of action accrued. Amendments subsequent to the first amendment or subsequent to the filing of an answer by the respondent may be made only with leave of the examiner or with the written consent of the adverse party.

                § 47.7
                Report of investigation.

                Where the facts and circumstances are deemed by the Deputy Administrator to warrant such action, the Fruit and Vegetable Programs shall serve upon each of the parties a copy of the report made by the Fruit and Vegetable Programs in connection with its investigation of the informal or formal complaint. Whenever the Secretary, or the Deputy Administrator, or the examiner deems it necessary, a supplemental investigation shall be made by the Fruit and Vegetable Programs and a copy of the report thereon shall be served upon the parties. If an answer is filed by respondent, a copy of any report or reports of investigation served upon the parties shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk and shall be considered as part of the evidence in the proceeding: Provided, That either party shall be permitted to submit evidence in rebuttal in the same manner as is provided in the regulations in this part for the submission of other evidence in the proceeding.

                § 47.8
                The answer.
                (a) Filing and service. Within 20 days after service of the formal complaint, unless extension of time has been requested and granted, the respondent may file with the Fruit and Vegetable Programs, an answer, in triplicate, signed by the respondent or his attorney. A copy of the answer shall be served upon the complainant by the Fruit and Vegetable Programs as provided in § 47.4. If the answer includes a counterclaim, the answer shall be accompanied by the $300 handling fee required by the Act for formal complaints.
                (b) Contents. Such answer shall contain (1) a precise statement of the facts which constitute the grounds of defense, including any set-off or counterclaim, and shall specifically admit, deny, or explain each of the allegations of the complaint, unless respondent is without knowledge, in which case the answer shall so state; or (2) a statement that the respondent admits all of the allegations of the complaint; or (3) a statement containing an admission of liability in an amount less than that alleged in the complaint (in which event, an order may be made, pursuant to section 7(a) of the Act, directing payment of the undisputed amount), and a denial, as in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, of liability for the remaining amount. The answer may contain a waiver of hearing.
                (c) Failure to file answer; effect of. Failure to file an answer within the time prescribed shall constitute a waiver of hearing and an admission of the facts alleged in the complaint. If the facts deemed admitted are considered insufficient to support the amount of reparation sought, the proceeding shall continue on the question of damages only.
                (d) Procedure upon admission of facts. Upon the admission, in the answer or by failure to file an answer, of all the material allegations of fact contained in the complaint, an order may be issued without further procedure, official notice being taken of the license status of the respondent and the date of filing of the informal complaint, as disclosed by the records of the Department.

                § 47.9
                The reply.
                (a) Filing and service. If the answer asserts a counterclaim or a set-off, the complaining party, within 20 days after service of the answer, may file a reply with the Fruit and Vegetable Programs. A copy of the reply shall be served upon the respondent by the Fruit and Vegetable Programs as provided in § 47.4.
                (b) Contents. The reply shall be confined strictly to the matters alleged in the counterclaim or set-off in the answer. It shall contain a precise statement of the facts which constitute the grounds of defense to the counterclaim or set-off, and shall specifically admit, deny, or explain each of the allegations of the counterclaim or set-off, unless the complainant is without knowledge, in which case the reply shall so state; or a statement that the complainant admits all of the allegations of the counterclaim or set-off; or a statement containing an admission of liability in an amount less than that alleged in the counterclaim or set-off and a denial of liability for the remaining amount.
                (c) Failure to file reply. Failure to file a reply shall be deemed a waiver of hearing on the counterclaim or set-off and an admission of the allegations contained in the counterclaim or set-off. If no reply is filed, the allegations of the counterclaim or set-off shall be deemed admitted.

                Docketing of proceeding.
                Immediately following the expiration of the period of time heretofore prescribed for the filing of the answer or reply, the Fruit and Vegetable Programs shall transmit all of the papers which have been filed in the proceeding to the Hearing Clerk, who shall assign a docket number to the proceeding. Thereafter the proceeding may be identified by such number.

                (b) Request for disqualification of examiner. Any party may file with the Hearing Clerk a timely request, in affidavit form, for the disqualification of the examiner, which request shall set forth with particularity the grounds of alleged disqualification. After such investigation or hearing as the Secretary may deem necessary, the Secretary shall either deny or grant the request. If the request is granted, another examiner shall be assigned to the proceeding. If the request is denied, the request, any record made thereon, and the finding and order of the Secretary thereon shall be made a part of the record.
                (c) Powers. Subject to review by the Secretary, as provided in this part, the examiner who is an attorney employed in the Office of the General Counsel of the Department, in any proceeding assigned to him or her, shall have power to:
                (1) Rule upon motions and requests;

                (2) Set the time, place, and manner of the hearing, adjourn the hearing, and change the time, place, and manner of the hearing;
                
                (3) Administer oaths and affirmations and take affidavits;

                § 47.14
                Prehearing conferences.

                (a) In any proceeding in which it appears that a conference will expedite the proceeding, the examiner, at any time prior to or during the course of the oral hearing, may request the parties or their counsel to appear at a conference before the examiner to consider:
                (1) The simplification of the issues;
                (2) The necessity or the desirability of amendments to the pleadings;
                (3) The possibility of obtaining stipulations of fact and of documents which will avoid unnecessary proof;
                (4) The limitation of the number of expert or other witnesses; or
                (5) Such other matters as may expedite and aid in the disposition of the proceeding.
                (b) No transcript or recording of the conference shall be made. If the conference is conducted by correspondence, the examiner shall forward copies of letters and documents to the parties as circumstances require. The correspondence in connection with a conference shall not be part of the record. The examiner shall prepare and file for the record a written summary of the action agreed upon or taken at the conference, which shall incorporate any written stipulations or agreements made by the parties at the conference or as a result of the conference.
                (c) Manner of the Conference. (1) The conference shall be conducted by telephone or correspondence unless the examiner determines that conducting the conference by audio-visual telecommunication:
                (i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;
                (ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the conference; or
                (iii) Would cost less than conducting the conference by telephone or correspondence. If the examiner determines that a conference conducted by audio-visual telecommunication would measurably increase the United States Department of Agriculture's cost of conducting the conference, the conference shall be conducted by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the conference, by telephone, or by correspondence.
                (2) If the conference is not conducted by telephone or correspondence, the conference shall be conducted by audio-visual telecommunication unless the examiner determines that conducting the conference by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the conference:
                (i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;
                (ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the conference; or
                (iii) Would cost less than conducting the conference by audio-visual telecommunication.

                § 47.15
                Oral hearing before the examiner.
                (a) When permissible. (1) Where the amount of the damages claimed, either in the complaint or in the counterclaim, does not exceed $30,000 (excluding interest), an oral hearing shall not be held, unless deemed necessary or desirable by the Fruit and Vegetable Programs or unless granted by the examiner as defined in § 47.2(i)(1), upon application of complainant or respondent setting forth the peculiar circumstances making an oral hearing necessary for a proper presentation of the case.
                (2) Where the amount of damages claimed, either in the complaint or in the counterclaim, is in excess of $30,000 (excluding interest), the procedure provided in this section (except as provided in § 47.20(b)(2)) shall be applicable.
                (b) Request for hearing. Any party may request an oral hearing on the facts by including such request in the complaint. Failure to request an oral hearing within the time allowed for filing of the reply, or within 10 days after the expiration of the time allowed for filing an answer, shall constitute a waiver of such hearing, and any party so failing to request an oral hearing will be deemed to have agreed that the proceeding may be decided upon a record formed under the documentary procedure provided in § 47.20.
                (c) Time, place, and manner. (1) If and when the proceeding has reached the stage of oral hearing, the examiner, giving careful consideration to the convenience of the parties, shall set a time for hearing and shall file with the Hearing Clerk a notice stating the time and place of hearing. Unless the parties otherwise agree, the place of the hearing shall be the place in which the respondent is engaged in business. This notice shall state whether the hearing will be conducted by telephone, audio-visual telecommunication, or personal attendance of any individual expected to participate in the hearing and the examiner's determination regarding the manner of the hearing shall be made in accordance with paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section. If any change in the time, place, or manner of the hearing is made, the examiner shall file with the Hearing Clerk a notice of the change. The notice of any change in the time, place, or manner of the hearing shall be served on the parties, unless it is made during the course of an oral hearing and made part of the transcript or recording, or actual notice is given to the parties.
                (2)(i) If and when the proceeding has reached the stage of oral hearing, any party may move that the hearing be conducted by telephone or personal attendance of any individual expected to attend the hearing rather than by audio-visual telecommunication. Any motion that the hearing be conducted by telephone or personal attendance of any individual expected to attend the hearing must be accompanied by a memorandum in support of the motion stating the basis for the motion and the circumstances that require the hearing to be conducted other than by audio-visual telecommunication.
                (ii) Within 10 days after the examiner issues a notice stating the manner in which the hearing is to be conducted, any party may move that the examiner reconsider the manner in which the hearing is to be conducted. Any motion for reconsideration must be accompanied by a memorandum in support of the motion stating the basis for the motion and the circumstances that require the hearing to be conducted other than in accordance with the examiner's notice.
                (3) The hearing shall be conducted by audio-visual telecommunication unless the examiner determines that conducting the hearing by personal attendance of any individual expected to attend the hearing:
                (i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;
                (ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the hearing; or
                (iii) Would cost less than conducting the hearing by audio-visual telecommunication. If the examiner determines that a hearing conducted by audio-visual telecommunication would measurably increase the United States Department of Agriculture's cost of conducting the hearing, the hearing shall be conducted by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the hearing or by telephone.
                (4) The examiner may, in his or her sole discretion or in response to a motion by a party to the proceeding, conduct the hearing by telephone if the examiner finds that a hearing conducted by telephone:
                (i) Would provide a full and fair evidentiary hearing;
                (ii) Would not prejudice any party; and
                (iii) Would cost less than conducting the hearing by audio-visual telecommunication or personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the hearing.
                (d) Appearances—(1) Representation. In any proceeding under the Act, the parties may appear in person or by counsel or other representative.
                (2) Failure to appear. If any party to the proceeding, after being duly notified, fails to appear at the hearing, the party shall be deemed to have waived the right to an oral hearing in the proceeding. In the event that a party appears at the hearing and no party appears for the opposing side, the examiner may determine whether the party who is present shall present his or her evidence, in whole or in part, in the form of affidavits or by oral testimony.
                (3) Debarment of counsel or representative. (i) Whenever, while a proceeding is pending before him or her, the examiner finds that a person acting as counsel or representative for any party to the proceeding is guilty of unethical or unprofessional conduct, the examiner may order that such person be precluded from further acting as counsel or representative in such proceeding. An appeal to the Secretary may be taken from any such order, but the proceeding shall not be delayed or suspended pending disposition of the appeal: Provided, That the examiner may suspend the proceedings for a reasonable time for the purpose of enabling the party to obtain other counsel or representative.
                (ii) In case the examiner has issued an order precluding a person from further acting as counsel or representative in the proceeding, the examiner, within a reasonable time thereafter, shall submit to the Secretary a report of the facts and circumstances surrounding the issuance of the order and shall recommend what action the Secretary should take respecting the appearance of such person as counsel or representative in other proceedings before the Secretary. Thereafter, the Secretary may, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, issue such order respecting the appearance of such person as counsel or representative in proceedings before the Secretary as the Secretary finds to be appropriate.
                (e) Order of proceeding. The complainant shall proceed first at the hearing and shall have the burden of proof, except that a party asserting a set-off or counterclaim shall have the burden of proof on such issue.
                (f) Written statements of direct testimony. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, each party must exchange with all other parties a written narrative verified statement of the oral direct testimony that the party will provide at any hearing to be conducted by telephone; the direct testimony of each employee or agent of the party that the party will call to provide oral direct testimony at any hearing to be conducted by telephone; and the direct testimony of each expert witness that the party will call to provide oral direct testimony at any hearing to be conducted by telephone. The written direct testimony of witnesses shall be exchanged by the parties at least 10 days prior to the hearing. The oral direct testimony provided by a witness at a hearing conducted by telephone will be limited to the presentation of the written direct testimony, unless the examiner finds that oral direct testimony which is supplemental to the written direct testimony would further the public interest and would not constitute surprise.
                (2) The parties shall not be required to exchange testimony in accordance with this paragraph if the hearing is scheduled to begin less than 20 days after the examiner's notice stating the time of the hearing.
                (g) Evidence—(1) In general. (i) The testimony of witnesses at a hearing shall be upon oath or affirmation, subject to cross-examination, and shall be reported verbatim.
                (ii) Any witness may, in the discretion of the examiner, be examined separately and apart from all other witnesses except those who may be parties to the proceeding.
                (iii) The examiner shall exclude, insofar as practicable, evidence which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not of the sort upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely.
                (2) Objections. (i) If a party objects to the admission or rejection of any evidence or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or cross-examination, the party shall state briefly the grounds of such objections, whereupon an automatic exception will follow if the objection is overruled by the examiner. The transcript or recording shall not include argument or debate thereon except as ordered by the examiner. The ruling of the examiner on any objection shall be a part of the transcript or recording.
                (ii) Only objections made before the examiner may subsequently be relied upon in the proceeding.
                (3) Depositions. The deposition of any witness shall be admitted in the manner provided in and subject to the provisions of § 47.16.
                (4) Affidavits. Except as is otherwise provided in these rules, affidavits may be admitted only if the evidence is otherwise admissible and the parties agree (which may be determined by their failure to make timely objections) that affidavits may be used.
                (5) Proof and authentication of official records or documents. An official record or document, if admissible for any purpose, shall be admissible in evidence without the production of the person who made or prepared the same. Such record or document shall be evidenced by an official publication thereof or by a copy attested by the person having legal authority to make such attestation. The person attesting the copy shall make a certificate showing such authority.
                (6) Exhibits. (i) All written statements, charts, tabulations, or similar data offered in evidence at the hearing shall, after identification by the proponent and upon a satisfactory showing of the admissibility of the contents thereof, be numbered as exhibits, received in evidence, and made a part of the record. Unless the examiner finds that the furnishing of copies is impracticable, a copy of each exhibit shall be filed with the examiner for the use of each other party to the proceeding. The examiner shall advise the parties as to the exact number of copies which will be required to be filed.
                (ii) If the testimony of a witness refers to a statute, a report, document, recording, or transcript, the examiner, after inquiry relating to the identification of such statute, report, document, recording, or transcript, shall determine whether the same shall be produced at the hearing and physically be made a part of the evidence as an exhibit, or whether it shall be incorporated into the evidence by reference. If relevant and material matter offered in evidence is embraced in a report, document, recording, or transcript containing immaterial or irrelevant matter, such immaterial or irrelevant matter shall, insofar as practicable, be designated by the party and segregated and excluded.
                (7) [Reserved]
                (8) Offer of proof. Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be included in the transcript or recording. The offer of proof shall consist of a brief statement describing the evidence to be offered. If the evidence consists of a brief oral statement or of an exhibit, it shall be inserted into the transcript or recording in toto. In such event, it shall be considered a part of the transcript or recording if the Secretary decides that the examiner's ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous. The examiner shall not allow the insertion of such evidence in toto if the taking of such evidence will consume a considerable length of time at the hearing. In the latter event, if the Secretary decides that the examiner erred in excluding the evidence, and that such error was substantial, the hearing shall be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence.
                (h) Oral argument before examiner. The examiner may permit the parties or their counsel to argue orally at the hearing or at some other time prior to the transmittal of the record to the Secretary as provided in this part. Such argument may be limited by the examiner to any extent that the examiner finds necessary for the expeditious or proper disposition of the proceeding.
                (i) Transcript or recording. (1) Hearings to be conducted by telephone shall be recorded verbatim by electronic recording device. Hearings conducted by audio-visual telecommunication or the personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the hearing shall be transcribed, unless the examiner finds that recording the hearing verbatim would expedite the proceeding and the examiner orders the hearing to be recorded verbatim.
                (2) If a hearing is recorded verbatim, a party requests the transcript of a hearing or part of a hearing, and the examiner determines that the disposition of the proceeding would be expedited by a transcript of the hearing or part of a hearing, the examiner shall order the verbatim transcription of the recording as requested by the party.
                (3) If a reporter transcribes or records the testimony at a hearing, the reporter shall deliver the original transcript or recording, with exhibits thereto attached, to the examiner, who will retain such copy for the official file and for use in preparing his or her report. The reporter will also deliver to the examiner such other copy or copies as may be ordered by the Department, which copy or copies the examiner will forward to the Hearing Clerk.

                (4) Parties to the proceeding, or others, who desire a copy of the transcript or recording of the hearing may place orders at the hearing with the reporter, who will furnish and deliver such copies direct to the purchaser upon payment of the applicable rate.

                Depositions.
                (a) Application for taking deposition. Upon the application of a party to the proceeding, the examiner as defined in § 47.2(i)(1) may, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, at any time after the filing of the moving papers, order, over the facsimile signature of the Secretary, the taking of testimony by deposition. The application shall be in writing, shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk, and shall set forth:
                (1) The name and address of the proposed deponent; (2) the name and address of the person (referred to hereinafter in this section as the “officer”), qualified under the regulations in this part to take depositions, before whom the proposed examination is to be made; (3) the proposed time of the deposition which, unless otherwise agreed, shall be at least 30 days after the date of the mailing of the application; (4) the proposed place of the deposition; (5) the proposed manner in which the deposition is to be conducted (telephone, audio-visual telecommunication, or by personal attendance of the individuals who are expected to participate in the deposition); and (6) the reasons for taking the deposition.
                (b) Examiner's order for taking deposition. (1) If, after examination of the application, the examiner is of the opinion that the deposition should be taken, or if the parties are using depositions in lieu of affidavits pursuant to § 47.20(b)(2), the examiner shall order the taking of the deposition. In no case, except for good cause shown, may the examiner order the taking of a deposition less than 10 days prior to the designated date of deposition. The order shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk upon the parties in accordance with § 47.4.
                (2) The order shall state:
                (i) The time of the deposition (which unless otherwise agreed shall not be less than 20 days after the filing of the order);
                (ii) The place of the deposition;
                (iii) The manner of the deposition (telephone, audio-visual telecommunication, or personal attendance of those who are to participate in the deposition);
                (iv) The name of the officer before whom the deposition is to be made; and
                (v) The name of the deponent.
                (3) The deposition shall be conducted in the manner (telephone, audio-visual telecommunication, or personal attendance of those who are to participate in the deposition) agreed to by the parties.
                (4) If the parties cannot agree on the manner in which the deposition is to be conducted:
                (i) The deposition shall be conducted by telephone unless the examiner determines that conducting the deposition by audio-visual telecommunication:
                (A) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;
                (B) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the deposition; or
                (C) Would cost less than conducting the deposition by telephone.
                (ii) If the deposition is not conducted by telephone, the deposition shall be conducted by audio-visual telecommunication unless the examiner determines that conducting the deposition by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the deposition:
                (A) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;
                (B) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the deposition; or
                (C) Would cost less than conducting the deposition by telephone or audio-visual telecommunication.
                (c) Qualification of officer. The deposition shall be made before the examiner or before an officer authorized by the law of the United States or by the law of the place of the examination to administer oaths, or before an officer authorized by the Secretary to administer oaths.
                (d) Procedure on examination. (1) The deponent shall be examined under oath or affirmation and shall be subject to cross-examination. The testimony of the deponent shall be recorded by the officer or some person under the officer's direction. In lieu of oral examination, parties may transmit written questions to the officer prior to examination and the officer shall propound the written questions to the deponent.
                (2) The applicant shall arrange for the examination of the witness either by oral examination or by written questions. If the place of business of the opposing party is more than 100 miles from the place of the examination, the applicant will be required to conduct the examination by means of written questions, unless the parties otherwise agree or the examiner otherwise orders. If the examination is conducted by means of written questions, copies of the applicant's questions must be received by the other party to the proceeding and the officer at least 10 days prior to the date set for the examination unless otherwise agreed, and any cross questions of a party other than the applicant must be received by the applicant and the officer at any time prior to the time of the examination.
                (e) Certification by officer. The officer shall certify on the deposition that the deponent was duly sworn by the officer and that the deposition is a true record of the deponent's testimony. The officer shall then securely seal the deposition, together with one copy thereof (unless there are more than two parties to a proceeding, in which case there should be another copy for each additional party), in an envelope and mail the same by registered mail to the Hearing Clerk.
                (f) Use of depositions. A deposition taken in accord with this section or in accord with the provisions of the Rules of Civil Procedure of the Courts of the United States, may be used in a proceeding under the act if the examiner finds that the evidence is otherwise admissible. If a deposition has been taken, and the party upon whose application it was taken refuses to offer it in evidence, the other party may offer the deposition, or any part thereof, in evidence.

                (a) Issuance of subpoenas. The attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence from any place in the United States on behalf of any party to the proceeding may, by subpoena, be required at any designated place of hearing or at any designated place for the taking of a deposition. Subpoenas may be issued by the Secretary, or by the examiner, over the facsimile signature of the Secretary upon a reasonable showing by the applicant of the grounds, necessity, and reasonable scope thereof. Except for good cause shown, applications for subpoenas shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk at least 30 days prior to the designated date of hearing or deposition. Except for good cause shown, the examiner shall not issue subpoenas less than 20 days prior to the designated date of hearing or deposition.
                (b) Application for subpoena duces tecum. Subpoenas for the production of documentary evidence shall be issued only upon a verified written application. Such application shall specify, as exactly as possible, the documents desired and shall show their competency, relevancy, materiality, and the necessity for their production.
                (c) Service of subpoenas. Subponeas may be served by any person not less than 18 years of age. The party at whose instance a subponea is issued shall be responsible for service thereof. Subpoenas shall be served as provided in § 47.4.

                Fees and mileage.

                Witnesses who are subpoenaed and who appear in the proceeding, including witnesses whose depositions are taken, shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States, and persons taking depositions shall be entitled to the same fees as are paid for like services in the courts of the United States, to be paid by the party at whose request the deposition is taken. Witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the party at whose instance the witnesses appear, and claims therefor shall be presented to such party.
              
              
                § 47.19
                Post-hearing procedure before the examiner.
                (a) Certification of transcript or recording. As soon as practicable after receipt of the transcript or recording, the examiner shall prepare his or her certificate stating that, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, the transcript or recording is a true, correct, and complete transcript or recording of the testimony given at the hearing, except in such particulars as the examiner shall specify, and that the exhibits transmitted are all the exhibits received in evidence at the hearing, with such exceptions as the examiner shall specify. The original of such certificate shall be attached to the original transcript or recording and a copy of such certificate shall be furnished to each of the parties and to the Hearing Clerk. The examiner shall correct the original copy of the transcript or recording by adding or crossing out (but without obscuring the text) at the appropriate places any words necessary to make the text conform to the correct meaning, as certified by the examiner.
                (b) Proposed findings of fact, conclusions, and order. The examiner shall decide and shall announce at the hearing whether proposed findings of fact, conclusions, and order may be filed by the parties. If allowed by the examiner, he or she shall announce a definite calendar day as the time within which these documents may be filed. Such findings of fact, conclusions, and order shall be based solely upon the evidence of record. They may be accompanied by supporting briefs and by a statement of objections made to the rulings of the examiner at the hearing.
                (c) Briefs. If the examiner does not allow proposed findings of fact, conclusions, and order to be filed, the parties shall be given until a definite calendar day to file briefs.
                (d) Claim for award of fees and expenses—(1) Filing. Prior to the close of the hearing, or within 20 days thereafter, each party may file with the Hearing Clerk a claim for the award of the fees and expenses which he incurred in connection with the oral hearing. No award of fees and expenses to the prevailing party and against the losing party shall be made unless a claim therefor has been filed, and failure to file a claim within the time allowed shall constitute a waiver thereof.
                (2) Fees and expenses which may be awarded to prevailing party. The term “fees and expenses,” as used in section 7(a) of the Act, includes:
                (i) Reasonable fees of an attorney or authorized representative for appearance at the hearing and for the taking of depositions necessary for introduction at the hearing; (ii) fees and mileage for necessary witnesses at the rates provided for witnesses in the courts of the United States; (iii) fees for the notarizing of a deposition and its reduction to writing; (iv) fees for serving subpenas; and (v) other fees and expenses necessarily incurred in connection with the oral hearing. Fees and expenses which are not considered to be reasonable or necessarily incurred in connection with the oral hearing will not be awarded.
                (3) Form of claim. A claim for fees and expenses shall be in the form of a written itemized statement of the fees and expenses claimed, which shall include an explanation of how each item was computed, to which there shall be attached an affidavit, made by the party or the party's authorized attorney or agent having knowledge of the facts, that each such item is correct and has been necessarily incurred in connection with the oral hearing in the proceeding and that the services for which fees are claimed were actually and necessarily performed.
                (4) Service of claim. A copy of each such claim filed shall be served by the Hearing Clerk on the other party or parties to the proceeding.
                (5) Objections to claim. Within 20 days after being served with a copy of a claim for fees and expenses, the party so served may file with the Hearing Clerk written objections to the allowance of any or all of the items claimed. If evidence is offered in support of an objection, it must be in affidavit form. A copy of any such objections shall be served by the Hearing Clerk on the other party or parties.
                (6) Reply to objections to claim. A claimant who is served with a copy of objections to his or her claim may, within 20 days after such service, file with the Hearing Clerk a reply to such objection. If evidence is offered in support of a reply, it must be in affidavit form. A copy of any such reply shall be served by the Hearing Clerk on the other party or parties.
                (7) Further inquiry by examiner. Whenever it is deemed desirable or necessary for the proper disposition of a claim, the examiner may request statements as to specific matters from either or both parties. Any statements so furnished shall be served by the examiner on the other party.
                (8) Number of copies. All documents or papers authorized by this paragraph to be filed with the examiner shall be filed in triplicate: Provided, That, where there are more than two parties to the proceeding an additional copy shall be filed for each additional party.
                (e) The examiner's report. The examiner, with the assistance and collaboration of such employees of the Department as may be assigned for the purpose, and within a reasonable time after the termination of the periods allowed for the filing of the submissions of the parties allowed by this section, shall prepare, upon the basis of the evidence received at the hearing and with due consideration of submissions of the parties filed pursuant to this section, his or her report. Such report shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk and shall be prepared in the form of a final order for the signature of the Secretary, but shall not be served upon the parties, unless and until it shall have been signed by the Secretary, as hereinafter provided.

                § 47.20
                Documentary procedure.
                (a) In general. The documentary procedure described in this section shall, whenever it is applicable as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, take the place and serve in lieu of the oral hearing procedure hereinbefore provided. Under the documentary procedure, the pleadings of the parties, if verified in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section, and any report of investigation filed with the Hearing Clerk pursuant to § 47.7 will be considered as evidence in the proceeding. Under the shortened procedure, the pleadings of the parties, if verified in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section, and any report of investigation filed with the Hearing Clerk pursuant to § 47.7, will be considered as evidence in the proceeding. In addition, the parties may submit written proof in support of the complaint, answer, or reply, as the case may be, in the form of verified statements or depositions. After the close of the evidence, the parties may file briefs.
                (b) When applicable—(1) Where damages claimed do not exceed $30,000. The documentary procedure provided for in this section shall (except as provided in § 47.15(a)) be used in all reparation proceedings in which the amount of damages claimed, either in the complaint or in the counterclaim, does not exceed $30,000 (excluding interest).
                (2) Where damages claimed exceed $30,000. In any proceeding in which the amount of damages claimed, either in the complaint or in the counterclaim, is greater than $30,000 (excluding interest), the examiner, whenever he or she is of the opinion that proof may be fairly and adequately presented by use of the documentary procedure provided for in this section, shall suggest to the parties that they consent to the use of such procedure. Parties are free to consent to such procedure if they choose, and declination of consent will not affect or prejudice the rights or interests of any party. A party, if he or she has not waived oral hearing, may consent to the use of the documentary procedure on the condition that depositions rather than affidavits be used. In such case, if the other party agrees, depositions shall be required to be filed in lieu of verified statements. If any party who has not waived oral hearing does not consent to the use of the documentary procedure, the proceeding will be set for oral hearing. The suggestion that the documentary procedure be used need not originate with the examiner. Any party may address a request to the examiner asking that the documentary procedure be used.
                (c) Complainant's opening statement. Within twenty (20) days after service of respondent's answer, complainant may file a verified opening statement, accompanied by any pertinent documents, which documents must be identified in the statement. If the answer is verified, complainant's evidence concerning the allegations of the answer should be included in the opening statement.
                (d) Respondent's answering statement. Within twenty (20) days after service of complainants' opening statement or service of notice by the examiner that complainant has not filed an opening statement, respondent may file a verified answering statement, accompanied by any pertinent documents, which documents must be identified in the statement.
                (e) Complainant's statement in reply. If respondent files an answering statement, complainant may, within twenty (20) days after service thereof upon complainant, file a verified statement in reply, accompanied by any pertinent documents, which documents must be identified in the statement.
                (f) Use of depositions in lieu of verified statements. Depositions may be used in lieu of verified statements under paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section.
                (g) Briefs. Promptly after the conclusion of the presentation of evidence, the examiner shall notify the parties that they may file briefs within twenty (20) days after the receipt of such notice.
                (h) Verification. Verification shall be made under oath of any facts set forth in the pleading or statement, by the person who signs the pleading or statement. Certification by a notary public is insufficient. The form of verification may be as follows:
                
                
                  __________, being first duly sworn, says that he (or she) has read the foregoing document and knows the contents thereof and that the facts set forth therein are true, except as to matters therein stated on information and belief, and as to such matters he believes them to be true, and that he (or she) is duly authorized to sign the document.

                (i) Stipulations. In addition to or in lieu of the statements referred to in this section, the parties may file with the Hearing Clerk stipulations of fact signed by the parties or their representatives. Such stipulations filed with the Hearing Clerk shall become a part of the record.
                (j) Waiver of right to file. Failure to file, within the time prescribed, any document authorized by this section shall constitute a waiver of the right to file such document.
                (k) The examiner's report. Within a reasonable time after the time allowed for filing briefs, the examiner shall prepare his or her report in the manner prescribed in § 47.19(d).
                (l) Assignment for oral hearing. Whenever it is deemed desirable or necessary for the proper disposition of the proceeding, the examiner, upon his or her own or any party's motion, may order the proceeding set down for oral hearing at any stage of the proceeding.

                Issuance of order.
                As soon as practicable after the receipt of the record from the Hearing Clerk, the Secretary, upon the basis of and after due consideration of the record, shall issue his or her order in the proceeding. Unless the Secretary disagrees with the order as drafted for his or her signature by the examiner, as provided in § 47.19(d), the Secretary shall issue as his or her order the order so prepared by the examiner. If the Secretary deems it advisable to do so, the Secretary may direct that the order be served upon the parties as a tentative order and that the parties be allowed such period of time, not to exceed 20 days, as the Secretary may specify, within which to file exceptions thereto and written argument or briefs in support of such exceptions.

                Rehearing, reargument, reconsideration of orders, reopening of hearings, reopening after default.
                (a) Petitions to rehear, reargue, and reconsider. A petition for rehearing or reargument of the proceeding, or for reconsideration of the order, shall be made by petition to the Secretary filed with the Hearing Clerk within 20 days after the date of service of the order. Every such petition shall state specifically the matters claimed to have been erroneously decided and the alleged errors. If the Secretary concludes that the questions raised by the petition have been sufficiently considered in the issuance of the order, the Secretary shall dismiss the petition without service on the other party. Otherwise, the Secretary shall direct that a copy of the petition be served upon such party by the Hearing Clerk. The filing of a petition to rehear or reargue a proceeding, or to reconsider an order, shall automatically operate to set aside the order pending final action on the petition. Only one petition to rehear, reargue, or reconsider will be accepted from each party, except when a mathematical or typographical error appears in either the original decision and order or in the decision on reconsideration.
                (b) Petition to reopen. A petition to reopen the hearing to take further evidence may be filed with the examiner at any time prior to the issuance of the final order. Every such petition shall state briefly the nature and purpose of the evidence to be adduced, shall show that such evidence is not merely cumulative, and shall set forth a good reason why such evidence was not adduced at the hearing. Every such petition shall be served by the Hearing Clerk on the other party in the proceeding.
                (c) Procedure for disposition of petitions. Within 20 days following the service of any petition provided for in this section, the other party to the proceeding may file with the Hearing Clerk an answer thereto. In the event that any such petition is granted the applicable rules of practice shall be followed.
                (d) Reopening after default. The party in default in the filing of an answer or reply required or authorized under this part may petition to reopen the proceeding at any time prior to the expiration of 20 days from the date of service of the default order. If, in the judgment of the examiner, after notice to and consideration of the views of the other party(ies), there is good reason for granting such relief, the party in default will be allowed 20 days from the date of the order reopening the proceeding to file an answer.

                (c) Effective date of filing. Any document or paper required or authorized under the regulations in this part to be filed shall be deemed to be filed when it reaches the Department in Washington, DC; or, if filed with any officer or employee of the Regulatory Branch of the Fruit and Vegetable Programs at any place outside the District of Columbia, it shall be deemed to be filed at the time when it is received by such officer or employee.
                (d) Computations of time. Saturdays, Sundays and holidays shall be included in computing the time allowed for the filing of any document or paper: Provided, That, when such time expires on a Saturday, Sunday or Federal holiday, such period shall be extended to include the next following business day.
                (e) Official notice.

Such determination shall be made on the basis of license records on file with the PACA Branch, and such other information as may be available.
                (b) Upon determining that a person was responsibly connected at the time in issue with a licensee which is subject to the suspension or revocation of its license, or which is subject to having the facts and circumstances of violations of the Act published, and that the employment status and licensing of such person may be restricted, the PACA Branch shall notify the person in writing of his or her status and of any employment and licensing restrictions resulting therefrom.
                (c) If a person believes he or she was not responsibly connected with a licensee at the time in issue, he or she may submit the reasons for such belief in written form, along with all pertinent documents, within 30 days of the receipt of such notification to the Chief, who will promptly review the matter and advise the person in writing of the Chief's determination and the reasons for reaching such determination.
                (d) Within 30 days of receipt of notification of the Chief's determination, a person who disagrees with such determination may file with the Hearing Clerk, pursuant to § 1.130-1.151 of this title, a petition for review of the determination.

The grading or inspection service withdrawn, after appropriate corrective action is taken, will be restored immediately, or as soon thereafter as a grader or inspector can be made available.
                (b) Written notice of withdrawal of grading or inspection service under this section shall be given to the person from whom grading or inspection services will be withdrawn in advance of withdrawal, whenever it is feasible to provide such an advance written notice. If advance written notice is not given, the withdrawal action and the reasons for the withdrawal shall be confirmed as promptly as circumstances permit, unless the deficiency which is the basis for the withdrawal has already been corrected.

                (a) General. In any situation in which the integrity of grading or inspection service would be jeopardized if the grading or inspection service were continued pending a decision in a proceeding to withdraw grading or inspection service, such service to the respondent may be suspended effective on the third day after mailing of a written notice of the suspension of service to the respondent's last known address or designated address or upon actual receipt of the written notice, whichever is earlier.
                (b) Actual or threatened physical violence. In any case of actual or threatened physical violence to an inspector or grader, grading and inspection services to the respondent may be suspended prior to the transmittal of the written notice of suspension to the respondent. A written notice shall be given as promptly as circumstances permit.

                  If the inspector has reason to believe that, because of latent defects due to climatic or other conditions, he is unable to determine the true quality or condition of the product, he shall postpone examination for such period as may, in his judgment, be reasonably necessary to enable him to determine its true quality or condition. Inspection shall also be postponed by the inspector, unless otherwise directed by the applicant, if in his judgment examination of the product when exposed to low temperatures may result in damage to the product.

                  Charges for fees, rates, and expenses.
                  For each carlot of product inspected, a fee or rate determined in accordance with §§ 51.38 and 51.39, and expenses determined in accordance with § 51.40, shall be paid by the applicant.

                  § 51.38
                  Basis for fees and rates.
                  (a) For each calendar year, AMS will calculate the rate for services, per hour per program employee using the following formulas:
                  (1) Regular rate. The total AMS inspection program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase, plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.
                  (2) Overtime rate. The total AMS inspection program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 1.5 plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.
                  (3) Holiday rate. The total AMS inspection program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 2, plus benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.
                  (b)(1) For each calendar year, based on previous fiscal year/historical actual costs, AMS will calculate the benefits, operating, and allowance for bad debt components of the regular, overtime and holiday rates as follows:
                  (i) Benefits rate. The total AMS inspection program direct benefits costs divided by the total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the next calendar year's percentage cost of living increase. Some examples of direct benefits are health insurance, retirement, life insurance, and Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement basic and matching contributions.
                  (ii) Operating rate. The total AMS inspection program operating costs divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the percentage of inflation.
                  (iii) Allowance for bad debt rate. Total allowance for bad debt divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked.
                  (2) The calendar year cost of living expenses and percentage of inflation factors used in the formulas in this section are based on the most recent Office of Management and Budget's Presidential Economic Assumptions.
                  (c) When an inspection is delayed because product is not available or readily accessible, a charge for waiting time shall be determined using the formulas in this section.

                  U.S. Extra Fancy.

                  “U.S. Extra Fancy” consists of apples of one variety (except when more than one variety is printed on the container) which are mature but not overripe, clean, fairly well formed, free from decay, internal browning, internal breakdown, soft scald, scab, freezing injury, visible water core, and broken skins. The apples are also free from injury caused by bruises, brown surface discoloration, smooth net-like russeting, sunburn or sprayburn, limb rubs, hail, drought spots, scars, disease, insects, or other means. The apples are free from damage caused by bitter pit or Jonathan spot and by smooth solid, slightly rough or rough russeting, or stem or calyx cracks, as well as damage by invisible water core after January 31st of the year following the year of production except for the Fuji variety of apples. Invisible water core shall not be scored against the Fuji variety of apples under any circumstances. For the apple varieties listed in table I of § 51.305, each apple of this grade has the amount of color specified for the variety. (See §§ 51.305 and 51.306.)
                
                
                  § 51.301
                  U.S. Fancy.

                  “U.S. Fancy” consists of apples of one variety (except when more than one variety is printed on the container) which are mature but not overripe, clean, fairly well formed, and free from decay, internal browning, internal breakdown, soft scald, freezing injury, visible water core, and broken skins. The apples are also free from damage caused by bruises, brown surface discoloration, russeting, sunburn or sprayburn, limb rubs, hail, drought spots, scars, stem or calyx cracks, disease, insects, bitter pit, Jonathan spot, or damage by other means, or invisible water core after January 31st of the year following the year of production, except for the Fuji variety of apples. Invisible water core shall not be scored against the Fuji variety of apples under any circumstances. For the apple varieties listed in table I of § 51.305, each apple of this grade has the amount of color specified for the variety. (See §§ 51.305 and 51.306.)
                
                
                  § 51.302
                  U.S. No. 1.

                  “U.S. No. 1” consists of apples which meet the requirements of U.S. Fancy grade except for color, russeting, and invisible water core. In this grade, less color is required for all varieties listed in table I of § 51.305. Apples of this grade are free from excessive damage caused by russeting which means that apples meet the russeting requirements for U.S. Fancy as defined under the definitions of “damage by russeting,” except the aggregate area of an apple which may be covered by smooth net-like russeting shall not exceed 25 percent; and the aggregate area of an apple which may be covered by smooth solid russeting shall not exceed 10 percent: Provided, That, in the case of the Yellow Newtown or similar varieties, the aggregate area of an apple which may be covered with smooth solid russeting shall not exceed 20 percent. Each apple of this grade has the amount of color specified in § 51.305 for the variety. Invisible water core shall not be scored in this grade. (See §§ 51.305 and 51.306.)
                  (a) U.S. No. 1 Hail: “U.S. No. 1 Hail” consists of apples which meet the requirements of U.S. No. 1 grade except that hail marks where the skin has not been broken and well healed hail marks where the skin has been broken, are permitted, provided the apples are fairly well formed. (See §§ 51.305 and 51.306.)

                  § 51.304
                  Combination grades.
                  (a) Combinations of the above grades may be used as follows:
                  (1) Combination U.S. Extra Fancy and U.S. Fancy;
                  (2) Combination U.S. Fancy and U.S. No. 1; and
                  (3) Combination U.S. No. 1 and U.S. Utility.

                  (b) Combinations other than these are not permitted in connection with the U.S. apple grades. When Combination grades are packed, at least 50 percent of the apples in any lot shall meet the requirements of the higher grade in the combination. (See § 51.306.)

                  § 51.305
                  Color requirements.

                  In addition to the requirements specified for the grades set forth in §§ 51.300 to 51.304, apples of these grades shall have the percentage of color specified for the variety in table I appearing in this section. All apple varieties other than those appearing in table I shall have no color requirements pertaining to these grades. For the solid red varieties, the percentage stated refers to the area of the surface which must be covered with a good shade of solid red characteristic of the variety: Provided, That an apple having color of a lighter shade of solid red or striped red than that considered as a good shade of red characteristic of the variety may be admitted to a grade, provided it has sufficient additional area covered so that the apple has as good an appearance as one with the minimum percentage of good red characteristic of the variety required for the grade. For the striped red varieties, the percentage stated refers to the area of the surface in which the stripes of a good shade of red characteristic of the variety shall predominate over stripes of lighter red, green, or yellow. However, an apple having color of a lighter shade than that considered as a good shade of red characteristic of the variety may be admitted to a grade, provided it has sufficient additional area covered so that the apple has as good an appearance as one with the minimum percentage of stripes of a good red characteristic of the variety required for the grade. Faded brown stripes shall not be considered as color. (A) Color standards USDA Visual Aid APL-CC-1 (Plates a—e) consists of a folder containing the color requirements for apples set forth in this section and five plates illustrating minimum good shade of solid red or striped red color, minimum compensating color and shade not considered color, for the following 12 varieties: Red Delicious, Red Rome, Empire, Idared, Winesap, Jonathan, Stayman, McIntosh, Cortland, Rome Beauty, Delicious, and York.
                  These color standards will be available for examination and purchasing information in the Fresh Products Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Programs, AMS, U.S. Department of Agriculture, South Building, Washington, DC 20250; in any field office of the Fresh Products Branch; or upon request of any authorized inspector of the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Inspection Service.

                  § 51.306
                  Tolerances.
                  In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and handling in each of the grades in 51.300, 51.301, 51.302, 51.303, and 51.304 the following tolerances are provided as specified:
                  (a) Defects: (1) U.S. Extra Fancy, U.S. Fancy, U.S. No. 1, and U.S. No. 1 Hail grades: 10 percent of the apples in any lot may fail to meet the requirements of the grade, but not more than one-half of this amount, or 5 percent, shall be allowed for apples which are seriously damaged, including therein not more than 1 percent for apples affected by decay or internal breakdown.
                  (2) U.S. Utility grade: 10 percent of the apples in any lot may fail to meet the requirements of the grade, but not more than one-half of this amount, or 5 percent, shall be allowed for apples which are seriously damaged by insects, and including in the total tolerance not more than 1 percent for apples affected by decay or internal breakdown.
                  (b) When applying the foregoing tolerances to Combination grades, no part of any tolerance shall be allowed to reduce, for the lot as a whole, the 50 percent of apples of the higher grade required in the combination, but individual containers shall have not less than 40 percent of the higher grade.
                  (c) Size: When size is designated by the numerical count for a container, not more than 10 percent of packages in the lot may fail to be fairly uniform. 1
                     When size is designated by minimum or maximum diameter, not more than 5 percent of the apples in any lot may be smaller than the designated minimum, and not more than 10 percent may be larger than the designated maximum. For Red Delicious or Golden Delicious varieties only, a combination of minimum diameter and/or weight may be used. When this designation is used, an individual apple will be considered to have met the minimum size requirement even if the apple is smaller than the minimum diameter, provided it is equal to or greater than the weight provided in table II of this section. However, not more than 5 percent of the apples in any lot may fail to meet either the minimum diameter or minimum weight when so designated. In addition, when Red Delicious or Golden Delicious apples are designated with diameter/weight combinations, they may only be designated according to the following table:
                  
                    
                      1 “Fairly uniform” means the size of the fruit within the container does not vary more than 1/2 inch diameter from the smallest to largest fruit.

                  (a) When the numerical count is marked on the container, containers are packed to weigh ten pounds or less, or in any container where the minimum diameter of the smallest apple does not vary more than 1/2 inch from the minimum diameter of the largest apple, percentages shall be calculated on the basis of count.
                  (b) In all other cases except those listed in paragraph (a) of this section, they shall be calculated on the basis of weight.
                
              
              
                Condition After Storage or Transit
                
                  § 51.309
                  Condition after storage or transit.
                  Decay, scald, or any other deterioration which may have developed on apples after they have been in storage or transit shall be considered as affecting condition and not the grade.
                
              
              
                Packing Requirements
                
                  § 51.310
                  Packing requirements.
                  (a) Apples tray packed or cell packed in cartons shall be arranged according to approved and recognized methods. Packs shall be at least fairly tight 2
                     or fairly well filled. 3
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      2 “Fairly tight” means that apples are of the proper size for molds or cell compartments in which they are packed, and that molds or cells are filled in such a way that no more than slight movement of apples within molds or cells is possible.
                  
                  
                    
                      3 “Fairly well filled” means that the net weight of apples in containers ranging from 2,100 to 2,900 cubic inch capacity is not less than 37 pounds for Cortland, Gravenstein, Jonathan, McIntosh and Golden Delicious varieties and not less than 40 pounds for all other varieties.
                  
                  (b) Closed cartons containing apples not tray or cell packed shall be fairly well filled or the pack shall be sufficiently tight to prevent any appreciable movement of the apples.
                  (c) Packs in wooden boxes or baskets shall be sufficiently tight to prevent any appreciable movement of apples within containers when the packages are closed. Each wrapped apple shall be completely enclosed by its individual wrapper.
                  (d) Apples on the shown face of any container shall be reasonably representative in size, color and quality of the contents.
                  (e) Tolerances: In order to allow for variations incident to proper packing, not more than 10 percent of the containers in any lot may fail to meet these requirements.
                
              
              
                Marking Requirements
                
                  § 51.311
                  Marking requirements.
                  Variety (or varieties if more than one is packed in the container), grade, and the numerical count or minimum diameter of apples packed in a closed container shall be indicated on the container. For apple lots utilizing the combined diameter/weight designations for Red Delicious and Golden Delicious varieties, the minimum diameter and minimum weight of apples packed in a closed container shall be indicated on the container.
                  (a) When the numerical count is not shown, the minimum diameter or, in the case of Red Delicious or Golden Delicious lots where minimum diameter/weight designations have been chosen, the minimum diameter and weight as designated in table II, shall be plainly stamped, stenciled or otherwise marked on the container in terms of whole inches, or whole inches and not less than eighth inch fractions thereof in the following manner: “A” inches or “B” grams, where “A” corresponds to one of the diameter measurements in terms of inches listed in table II and “B” corresponds to the weight measurement in grams as indicated in table II. Both diameter and weight must be shown using the word “or” between the given measurements.

                  (b) The word “minimum,” or its abbreviation, when following a diameter size marking, means that the apples are of the size marked or larger. (See §§ 51.306 and 51.307.)

                  Mature.
                  
                    “Mature” means that the apples have reached the stage of development which will insure the proper completion of the ripening process. Before a mature apple becomes overripe it will show varying degrees of firmness, depending upon the stage of the ripening process. The following terms are used for describing different stages of firmness of apples:
                  (a) “Hard” means apples with a tenacious flesh and starchy flavor.
                  (b) “Firm” means apples with a tenacious flesh but which are becoming crisp with a slightly starchy flavor, except the Delicious variety.
                  (c) “Firm ripe” means apples with crisp flesh except that the flesh of the Gano, Ben Davis, and Rome Beauty varieties may be slightly mealy.
                  (d) “Ripe” means apples with mealy flesh and soon to become soft for the variety.
                
                
                  § 51.313
                  Overripe.
                  
                    “Overripe” means apples which have progressed beyond the stage of ripe, with flesh very mealy or soft, and past commercial utility.
                
                
                  § 51.314
                  Clean.
                  
                    “Clean” means that the apples are free from excessive dirt, dust, spray residue, and other foreign material.
                
                
                  § 51.315
                  Fairly well formed.
                  
                    “Fairly well formed” means that the apple may be slightly abnormal in shape but not to an extent which detracts materially from its appearance.
                
                
                  § 51.316
                  Injury.
                  
                    “Injury” means any specific defect defined in this section or an equally objectionable variation of any one of these defects, any other defect, or any combination of defects, which more than slightly detract from the appearance or the edible or shipping quality of the apple. In addition, specific defect measurements are based on an apple three inches in diameter. Corresponding smaller or larger areas would be allowed on smaller or larger fruit. Any reference to “inch” or “inches in diameter” refers to that of a circle of the specified diameter. Any reference to “aggregate area,” “total area,” or “aggregate affected area” means the gathering together of separate areas into one mass for the purpose of comparison to determine the extent affected. The following specific defects shall be considered as injury:
                  (a) Russeting in the stem cavity or calyx basin which cannot be seen when the apple is placed stem end or calyx end down on a flat surface shall not be considered in determining whether an apple is injured by russeting. Smooth net-like russeting outside of the stem cavity or calyx basin shall be considered as injury when an aggregate area of more than 10 percent of the surface is covered, and the color of the russeting shows no very pronounced contrast with the background color of the apple, or lesser amounts of more conspicuous net-like russeting when the appearance is affected to a greater extent than the amount permitted above.

                  (1) When the skin is broken, whether healed or unhealed;
                  (2) When there is appreciable discoloration of the surface;
                  (3) When any surface indentation exceeds one-sixteenth inch in depth;
                  (4) When any surface indentation exceeds one-eighth inch in diameter; or
                  (5) When the aggregate affected area of such spots exceeds one-half inch in diameter.
                  (e) Bruises which are not slight and incident to proper handling and packing, and which are greater than:
                  (1) 1/8 inch in depth;
                  (2) 5/8 inch in diameter;

                  (3) any combination of lesser bruises which detract from the appearance or edible quality of the apple to an extent greater than any one bruise described in paragraphs (e)(1) or (2) of this section.
                  (f) Brown surface discoloration when caused by delayed sunburn, surface scald, or any other means and affects an area greater than 1/4 inch in diameter.
                  (g) Disease: (1) Cedar rust infection which affects a total area of more than three-sixteenths inch in diameter.

                  Each sample shall consist of 33 grapefruit. When individual packages contain at least 33 grapefruit, the sample is drawn from one package; when individual packages contain less than 33 grapefruit, a sufficient number of adjoining packages are opened to form a 33-count sample. When practicable, at point of packaging, the sample may be obtained from the grading belt or bins after sorting has been completed.

                  (1) 32 size and smaller—not more than six-sixteenths inch in diameter; and
                  (2) 27 size and larger—not more than nine-sixteenths inch in diameter.
                  (d) In order to allow for variations, other than sizing, incident to proper packing, not more than 5 percent of the packages in any lot may fail to meet the requirements of standard pack.

                  U.S. No. 1.
                  “U.S. No. 1” consists of Persian limes which are firm, fairly well formed, of fairly smooth texture, which are free from decay, stylar end breakdown or other internal discoloration, broken skins which are not healed, bruises (except those incident to proper handling and packing), hard or dry skins, and free from damage caused by freezing, dryness or mushy condition, sprayburn, exanthema (ammoniation), scars, thorn scratches, scale, sunburn, scab, blanching, yellow color, discoloration, buckskin, dirt or other foreign material, disease, insects or mechanical or other means.

                  (a) Each fruit in this grade shall have not less than an aggregate area of three-fourths of the surface of the fruit which shows good green color characteristic of the Persian lime: Provided, That lots of limes which fail to meet the U.S. No. 1 grade requirements only because of blanching shall be designated as “U.S. No. 1, Mixed Color”: And provided further, That lots of limes which fail to meet the U.S. No. 1 or U.S. No. 1 Mixed Color grade requirements only because of turning yellow or yellow color, caused by the ripening process, shall be designated as “U.S. No. 1, Turning”.
                  (b) The fruit shall have a juice content of not less than 42 percent, by volume.

                  (c) In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and handling, not more than 10 percent, by count, of the fruit in any lot may fail to meet the color requirements. In addition, not more than 10 percent, by count, of the fruit in any lot may be below the remaining requirements of this grade, but not more than one-half of this amount, or 5 percent, shall be allowed for decay, stylar end breakdown, broken skins which are not healed, or defects causing serious damage including not more than one-half of 1 percent for decay at shipping point: Provided, That an additional tolerance of 21/2 percent, or a total of not more than 3 percent, shall be allowed for decay en route or at destination.
                
                
                  § 51.1001
                  U.S. Combination.

                  “U.S. Combination” consists of a combination of U.S. No. 1 and U.S. No. 2 limes: Provided, That at least 60 percent, by count, of the limes in the lot meet the requirements of U.S. No. 1 grade.

                  (a) In this grade the U.S. No. 1 limes shall meet the color requirements of the U.S. No. 1 grade and the U.S. No. 2 limes shall meet the color requirements of the U.S. No. 2 grade: Provided, That lots of limes which fail to meet the U.S. Combination grade requirements only because of blanching shall be designated as “U.S. Combination, Mixed Color”: And provided further, That lots of limes which fail to meet the U.S. Combination or U.S. Combination Mixed Color grade requirements only because of turning yellow or yellow color, caused by the ripening process, shall be designated as “U.S. Combination, Turning”.

                  (b) In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and handling, not more than 10 percent, by count, of the fruit in any lot may fail to meet the color requirements. In addition, not more than 10 percent, by count, of the fruit in any lot may be below the remaining requirements of the lower grade in the combination, but not more than one-half of this amount, or 5 percent, shall be allowed for limes affected by decay, stylar end breakdown and broken skins which are not healed, including not more than one-half of 1 percent for decay at shipping point: Provided, That an additional tolerance of 21/2 percent, or a total of not more than 3 percent, shall be allowed for decay en route or at destination.
                  (c) No part of the above tolerances shall be allowed to reduce for the lot as a whole, the 60 percent of U.S. No. 1 limes required in the U.S. Combination grade, but individual containers may have not less than 50 percent of the higher grade.
                
                
                  § 51.1002
                  U.S. No. 2.
                  “U.S. No. 2” consists of Persian limes which are fairly firm, which are not badly deformed, and not of excessively rough texture, which are free from decay, stylar end breakdown or other internal discoloration, broken skins which are not healed, bruises (except those incident to proper handling and packing), and hard or dry skins, and free from serious damage caused by freezing, dryness or mushy condition, sprayburn, exanthema (ammoniation), scars, thorn scratches, scale, sunburn, scab, blanching, yellow color, discoloration, buckskin, dirt or other foreign material, disease, insects or mechanical or other means.

                  (a) Each fruit in this grade shall have not less than an aggregate area of one-half of the surface of the fruit which shows good green color characteristic of the Persian lime: Provided, That lots of limes which fail to meet the U.S. No. 2 grade requirements only because of blanching shall be designated as “U.S. No. 2, Mixed Color”; And provided further, That lots of limes which fail to meet the U.S. No. 2 or U.S. No. 2 Mixed Color grade requirements only because of turning yellow or yellow color, caused by the ripening process, shall be designated as “U.S. No. 2, Turning”.
                  (b) The fruit shall have a juice content of not less than 42 percent, by volume.

                  (c) In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and handling, not more than 10 percent, by count, of the fruit in any lot may fail to meet the color requirements. In addition, not more than 10 percent, by count, of the fruit in any lot may be below the remaining requirements of this grade, but not more than one-half of this amount, or 5 percent, shall be allowed for decay, stylar end breakdown, and broken skins which are not healed, including not more than one-half of 1 percent for decay at shipping point: Provided, That an additional tolerance of 21/2 percent, or a total of not more than 3 percent, shall be allowed for decay en route or at destination.

                  § 51.1004
                  Application of tolerances.

                  (a) The contents of individual packages in the lot, based on sample inspection, are subject to the following limitations: Provided, That the averages for the entire lot are within the tolerances specified for the grade:
                  (1) For packages which contain more than 3 pounds and a tolerance of 10 percent or more is provided, individual packages in any lot shall have not more than one and one-half times the tolerance specified. For packages which contain more than 3 pounds and a tolerance of less than 10 percent is provided, individual packages in any lot shall have not more than double the tolerance specified, except that at least one decayed fruit may be permitted in any package; and,

                  (2) For packages which contain 3 pounds or less, individual packages in any lot are not restricted as to the percentage of defects: Provided, That not more than 10 percent of the packages may have more than one decayed fruit.

                  § 51.1005
                  Standard pack.
                  (a) Fruit shall be fairly uniform in size, and when place packed in crates or cartons, the fruit shall be arranged according to the approved and recognized methods.
                  (b) All packages shall be well filled but the contents shall not show excessive or unnecessary bruising because of over-filled packages.
                  (c) “Fairly uniform in size” means that not more than 10 percent, by count of the fruit in any container may vary more than four-sixteenths of an inch in diameter.
                  (d) In order to allow for variations, other than sizing, incident to proper packing, not more than 5 percent of the packages in any lot may fail to meet the requirements of standard pack.

                  § 51.1006
                  Firm.
                  
                    Firm means that the fruit is not soft or flabby.
                
                
                  § 51.1007
                  Fairly well formed.
                  
                    Fairly well formed means that the fruit shows normal characteristic shape for the Persian variety and is not materially flattened on one side.
                
                
                  § 51.1008
                  Fairly smooth texture.
                  
                    Fairly smooth texture means that the fruit is comparatively free from lumpiness and that pebbling is not abnormally coarse. Coarse pebbling is not objectionable as it is indicative of good keeping quality and is characteristic of the fruit, especially that from young trees.
                
                
                  § 51.1009
                  Stylar end breakdown.
                  
                    Stylar end breakdown is a physiological breakdown starting at the base of the nipple as a grayish tan water-soaked spot. A brownish discoloration develops in the rind. As it progresses the color of the affected area becomes darker and usually sinks below the healthy surface, but the area remains firm unless infected with secondary organisms that cause soft decay.
                
                
                  § 51.1010

                    Damage means any defect which materially affects the appearance, or the edible or shipping quality of the fruit. Any one of the following defects, or any combination of defects the seriousness of which exceeds the maximum allowed for any one defect, shall be considered as damage:
                  (a) Dryness or mushy condition which extends into all segments more than one-eighth of an inch at the stem end, or more than the equivalent of this amount, by volume, when occurring in other portions of the fruit;

                  (b) Sprayburn which changes the color to such an extent that the appearance of the fruit is materially affected, or which causes scarring that in the aggregate exceeds the area of a circle one-fourth inch in diameter;
                  (c) Exanthema (ammoniation) which materially detracts from the appearance of the fruit, or which occurs as small, thinly scattered spots over more than 10 percent of the fruit surface, or as solid scarring (not cracked) or depressions which in the aggregate exceed the area of a circle one-half inch in diameter;
                  (d) Scars which are dark, rough, or deep and in the aggregate exceed the area of a circle one-fourth inch in diameter, or scars which are fairly light in color, slightly rough, or of slight depth and in the aggregate exceed the area of a circle one-half inch in diameter, or scars which are light colored, fairly smooth, with no depth and aggregate more than 10 percent of the fruit surface;
                  (e) Thorn scratches when the injury is not well healed, or when dark colored, rough or deep and in the aggregate exceeds the area of a circle one-fourth inch in diameter, or when light colored, fairly smooth and concentrated and in the aggregate exceeds the area of a circle one-half inch in diameter, or light colored and scattered thorn injury which detracts from the appearance of the fruit to a greater extent than the aggregate area of one-half inch permitted for light colored concentrated injury;
                  (f) Scale when the appearance of the fruit is affected to a greater extent than that of a lime which has 10 medium to large California red or purple scale attached;
                  (g) Sunburn which causes appreciable flattening of the fruit, drying of the skin, material change in the color of the skin, appreciable drying of the flesh underneath the affected area, or which affects more than 5 percent of the fruit surface;
                  (h) Scab which materially affects the shape or texture;
                  (i) Blanching when more than 25 percent, in the aggregate, of the fruit surface shows a whitish to yellowish green area or areas because of shading, resting on the surface of the ground, or contact with other fruit on the tree. Such areas are not to be confused with limes which are turning yellow due to the ripening process;
                  (j) Yellow color when plainly visible and caused by the ripening process;
                  (k) Discoloration caused by rust mite, melanose or other means, when fairly smooth and more than 10 percent of the fruit surface is affected, or when slightly rough and in the aggregate exceeds the area of a circle one-half inch in diameter; and,
                  (l) Buckskin when more unsightly than the maximum discoloration allowed, or the fruit texture is materially affected.
                
                
                  § 51.1011

                    Good green color means that the skin of the lime is of a good green color characteristic of the Persian variety.
                
                
                  § 51.1012
                  Fairly firm.
                  
                    Fairly firm means that the fruit is not soft or excessively flabby.
                
                
                  § 51.1013

                    Excessively rough texture means that the skin is badly ridged or very decidedly lumpy.
                
                
                  § 51.1015
                  Serious damage.
                  
                    Serious damage means any defect which seriously affects the appearance, or the edible or shipping quality of the fruit. Any one of the following defects, or any combination of defects the seriousness of which exceeds the maximum allowed for any one defect, shall be considered as serious damage:
                  (a) Dryness or mushy condition which extends into all segments more than one-fourth of an inch at the stem end, or more than the equivalent of this amount, by volume, when occurring in other portions of the fruit;
                  (b) Sprayburn which changes the color to such an extent that the appearance of the fruit is seriously injured or which causes scarring that in the aggregate exceeds the area of a circle one-half inch in diameter;

                  Tolerances.
                  In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and handling in each of the following grades, the following tolerances, by count, based on a minimum 50-count sample, except when packages contain less than 50 fruit, a minimum 25-count sample shall be examined, (when packages contain less than 25 fruit adjoining packages shall be opened to obtain the 25-count minimum sample), are provided as specified:
                  (a) U.S. Fancy, U.S. Extra No. 1, and U.S. No. 1 grades—(1) For defects at shipping point.
                    1

                     10 percent of the peaches in any lot may fail to meet the requirements of the specified grade: Provided, That included in this amount, 5 percent shall be allowed for defects causing serious damage, including in this latter amount not more than 1 percent for peaches which are affected by decay.
                  
                    
                      1 Shipping point, as used in these standards, means the point of origin of the shipment in the producing area or at port of loading for ship stores or overseas shipment, or, in the case of shipments from outside the continental United States, the port of entry into the United States.
                  
                  (2) For defects en route or at destination. 14 percent for peaches in any lot that fail to meet the requirements of the grade: Provided, That included in this amount not more than the following percentages shall be allowed for defects listed:
                  (i) 10 percent for permanent defects;
                  (ii) 7 percent for defects causing serious damage, included therein not more than 5 percent for serious damage by permanent defects and not more than 2 percent for decayed peaches.
                  (3) For color—(i) U.S. Fancy grade. 10 percent for peaches in any lot which fail to meet the requirements of the grade:
                  (ii) U.S. Extra No. 1 grade. Individual packages may contain not less than 40 percent of peaches which meet the requirements of the grade: Provided, That the entire lot averages not less than 50 percent.
                  (b) U.S. No. 2 grade—(1) For defects at shipping point. 10 percent of the peaches in any lot may fail to meet the requirements of this grade: Provided, That included in this amount not more than 1 percent for peaches which are affected by decay.
                  (2) For defects en route or at destination. 14 percent for peaches in any lot that fail to meet the requirements of the grade: Provided, That included in this amount not more than the following percentages shall be allowed for defects listed:
                  (i) 10 percent for permanent defects;

                  § 51.1215
                  Application of tolerances to individual packages.
                  (a) The contents of individual packages in the lot, based on sample inspection, are subject to the following limitations, provided the averages for the entire lot are within the tolerances specified for the grade:
                  (1) For packages which contain more than 10 pounds, and a tolerance of 10 percent or more is provided (as in the case of oversize, where a tolerance of 15 percent is provided), individual packages in any lot shall have not more than one and one-half times the tolerance specified. For packages which contain more than 10 pounds and a tolerance of less than 10 percent is provided, individual packages in any lot shall have not more than double the tolerance specified, except that at least one peach which is seriously damaged by insects or affected by decay may be permitted in any package.

                  (2) For packages which contain 10 pounds or less, individual packages in any lot are not restricted as to the percentage of defects: Provided, That not more than one peach which is seriously damaged by insects or affected by decay may be permitted in any package.

                  (c) Peaches packed in standard western boxes shall be reasonably uniform in size and arranged in the packages according to the approved and recognized methods. Each wrapped peach shall be fairly well enclosed by its individual wrapper. All packages shall be well filled and tightly packed but the contents shall not show excessive or unnecessary bruising because of overfilled packages. The number of peaches in the box shall not vary more than 4 from the number indicated on the box.
                  (d) Peaches packed in other type boxes such as wire-bound boxes and fiber-board boxes may be place packed, or jumble packed faced, and all packs shall be well filled.
                  (e) Peaches packed in boxes equipped with cell compartments or molded trays shall be of the proper size for the cells or the molds in which they are packed.
                  (f) Peaches placed in individual paper cups and packed in boxes shall be in cups of the proper size for the peaches.

                  Sizing.
                  (a) The numerical count, or the minimum size of the pears packed in closed containers shall be indicated on the package. The number of pears in the box shall not vary more than 3 from the number indicated on the box.
                  (b) When the numerical count is marked on western standard pear boxes the pears shall not vary more than three-eighths inch in their transverse diameter for counts 120 or less; one-fourth inch for counts 135 to 180, inclusive; and three-sixteenths inch for counts 193 or more.
                  (c) When the numerical count is marked on western standard half boxes or special half boxes packed three tiers deep, the pears shall not vary more than three-eighths inch for counts 75 or less; one-fourths inch for counts 80 to 110, inclusive; and three-sixteenths inch for counts 115 or more.
                  (d) When the numerical count is marked on western standard half boxes or special half boxes packed two tiers deep, the pears shall not vary more than three-eighths inch for counts 50 or less; one-fourth inch for counts 55 to 70, inclusive; and three-sixteenths inch for counts 80 or more.

                  (e) When the numerical count is not shown, the minimum size shall be plainly stamped, stenciled or otherwise marked on the container in terms of whole inches, whole and half inches, whole and quarter inches, or whole and eighth inches, as 21/2 inches minimum, 21/4 inches minimum, or 25/8 inches minimum, in accordance with the facts. It is suggested that both minimum and maximum sizes be marked on the container, as 21/4 to 23/4 inches, 21/2 to 23/4 inches, as such marking is especially desirable for pears marketed in the export trade.
                  (f) “Size” means the greatest transverse diameter of the pear taken at right angles to a line running from the stem to the blossom end.

                  Mature.
                  (a) Mature means that the pear has reached the stage of maturity which will insure the proper completion of the ripening process.
                  (b) Before a mature pear becomes overripe it will show varying degrees of firmness, depending upon the stage of the ripening process. Therefore, a statement of firmness should be given in order to indicate the stage of the ripening process. A description of the ground color should also be given.

                  (1) The following terms should be used for describing the ground color: Green, Light Green, Yellowish Green, and Yellow.
                  
                  (2) The following terms should be used for describing the firmness of pears:
                  (i) Hard means that the flesh of the pear is solid and does not yield appreciably even to considerable pressure.
                  (ii) Firm means that the flesh of the pear is fairly solid but yields somewhat to moderate pressure.
                  (iii) Firm ripe means that the flesh of the pear yields readily to moderate pressure.
                  (iv) Ripe means that the pear is at the stage where it is in its most desirable condition for eating.

                    Damage means any injury or defect which materially affects the appearance, or the edible or shipping quality.
                  (a) Hard end shall be considered as damage if the pear shows a distinctly constricted protrusion at the blossom end, or an abnormally yellow color at the blossom end, or an abnormally smooth rounded base with little or no depression at the calyx, or if the flesh near the calyx is abnormally dry and tough or woody.
                  (b) Slight handling bruises and package bruises such as are incident to good commercial handling in the preparation of a tight pack shall not be considered damage.
                  (c) Any pear with one skin break larger than three-sixteenths inch in diameter or depth, or with more than one skin break one-eighth inch or larger in diameter or depth shall be considered damaged, and scored against the grade tolerance. 2

                  Application of tolerances.
                  (a) The contents of individual packages in the lot, based on sample inspection, are subject to the following limitations, provided the averages for the entire lot are within the tolerances specified for the grade:

                  (1) For packages which contain more than 10 pounds, and a tolerance of 10 percent or more is provided, individual packages in any lot shall have not more than one and one-half times the tolerance specified. For packages which contain more than 10 pounds and a tolerance of less than 10 percent is provided, individual packages in any lot shall have not more than double the tolerance specified, except that at least one pear which is seriously damaged by insects or affected by decay or internal breakdown may be permitted in any package.

                  (2) For packages which contain 10 pounds or less, individual packages in any lot are not restricted as to the percentage of defects or off-size: Provided, That not more than four times the tolerance specified may be permitted in any package for pears which are seriously damaged by insects or affected by decay or internal breakdown except that at least one defective pear may be permitted in any package.

                  Sizing.
                  (a) The numerical count, or the minimum size of the pears packed in closed containers shall be indicated on the package. The number of pears in the box shall not vary more than 3 from the number indicated on the box.
                  (b) When the numerical count is marked on western standard pear boxes the pears shall not vary more than three-eighths inch in their transverse diameter for counts 120 or less; one-fourth inch for counts 135 to 180, inclusive; and three-sixteenths inch for counts 193 or more.
                  (c) When the numerical count is marked on western standard half boxes or special half boxes packed three tiers deep, the pears shall not vary more than three-eighths inch for coutns 75 or less; one-fourth inch for counts 80 to 110, inclusive; and three-sixteenths inch for counts 115 or more.
                  (d) When the numerical count is marked on western standard half boxes or special half boxes packed two tiers deep, the pears shall not vary more than three-eighths inch for counts 50 or less; one-fourth inch for counts 55 to 70, inclusive; and three-sixteenths inch for counts 80 or more.
                  (e) When the numerical count is not shown, the minimum size shall be plainly stamped, stenciled or otherwise marked on the container in terms of whole inches, whole and half inches, whole and quarter inches, or whole and eighth inches, as 21/2 inches minimum, 21/4 inches minimum, or 25/8 inches minimum, in accordance with the facts. It is suggested that both minimum and maximum sizes be marked on the container, as 21/4 to 23/4 inches, 21/2 to 23/4 inches, as such marking is especially desirable for pears marketed in the export trade.
                  (f) “Size” means the greatest transverse diameter of the pear taken at right angles to a line running from the stem to the blossom end.

                  (a) Each package shall be packed so that the pears in the shown face shall be reasonably representative in size and quality of the contents of the package.
                  (b) Pears packed in any container shall be tightly packed. All packages shall be well filled but the contents shall not show excessive or unnecessary bruising because of overfilled packages.

                  (c) Pears packed in boxes shall be arranged in containers according to the approved and recognized methods with the pears packed lengthwise. A bridge shall not be allowed in any standard pack. When wrapped, each pear shall be fairly well enclosed by its individual wrapper.
                  
                  (d) Pears packed in round stave bushel baskets, tubs, or in barrels shall be ring faced.

                  Mature.
                  (a) Mature means that the pear has reached the stage of maturity which will insure the proper completion of the ripening process.
                  (b) Before a mature pear becomes overripe it will show varying degrees of firmness depending upon the stage of the ripening process. Therefore, a statement of firmness should be given in order to indicate the stage of the ripening process. A description of the ground color should also be given.

                  (1) The following terms should be used for describing the ground color: Green, Light Green, Yellowish Green, and Yellow.
                  
                  (2) The following terms should be used for describing the firmness of pears:
                  (i) Hard means that the flesh of the pear is solid and does not yield appreciably even to considerable pressure.

                  § 51.1403
                  Kernel color classification.
                  (a) The skin color of pecan kernels may be described in terms of the color classifications provided in this section. When the color of kernels in a lot generally conforms to the “light” or “light amber” classification, that color classification may be used to describe the lot in connection with the grade.
                  (1) “Light” means that the outer surface of the kernel is mostly golden color or lighter, with not more than 25 percent of the outer surface darker than golden, none of which is darker than light brown.
                  (2) “Light amber” means that more than 25 percent of the outer surface of the kernel is light brown, with not more than 25 percent of the outer surface darker than light brown, none of which is darker than medium brown.
                  (3) “Amber” means that more than 25 percent of the outer surface of the kernel is medium brown, with not more than 25 percent of the outer surface darker than medium brown, none of which is darker than dark brown (very dark-brown or blackish-brown discoloration).

                  (4) “Dark amber” means that more than 25 percent of the outer surface of the kernel is dark brown, with not more than 25 percent of the outer surface darker than dark brown (very dark-brown or blackish-brown discoloration).
                  (b) U.S. Department of Agriculture kernel color standards, PEC-MC-1, illustrate the color intensities implied by the terms “golden,” “light brown,” “medium brown,” and “dark brown” referred to in paragraph (a) of this section.

                  Tolerances.
                  In order to allow the variations incident to proper grading and handling in each of the foregoing grades, the following tolerances are provided as specified:
                  (a) U.S. No. 1—(1) For shell defects, by count. (i) 5 percent for pecans with damaged shells, including therein not more than 2 percent for shells which are seriously damaged.
                  (2) For kernel defects, by count. (i) 12 percent for pecans with kernels which fail to meet the requirements for the grade or any specified color classification, including therein not more than 7 percent for kernels which are seriously damaged: Provided, That not more than six-sevenths of this amount, or 6 percent, shall be allowed for kernels which are rancid, moldy, decayed or injured by insects: And provided further, That included in this 6 percent tolerance not more than one-half of one percent shall be allowed for pecans with live insects inside the shell.

                  (ii) In addition, 8 percent for kernels which fail to meet the color requirements for the grade or for any specified color classification, but which are not seriously damaged by dark discoloration of the skin: Provided, That these kernels meet the requirements for the grade other than for skin color.
                  (3) For loose extraneous or foreign material, by weight. (i) 0.5 percent (one-half of 1 percent).
                  (b) U.S. No. 2—(1) For shell defects, by count. (i) 10 percent for pecans with damaged shells, including therein not more than 3 percent for shells which are seriously damaged.
                  (2) For kernel defects, by count. (i) 30 percent for pecans with kernels which fail to meet the requirements of the U.S. No. 1 grade, including therein not more than 10 percent for pecans with kernels which are seriously damaged: Provided, That not more than seven-tenths of this amount, or 7 percent, shall be allowed for kernels which are rancid, moldy, decayed or injured by insects: And provided further, That included in this 7 percent tolerance not more than one-half of one percent shall be allowed for pecans with live insects inside the shell.
                  (3) For loose extraneous or foreign material, by weight. (i) 0.5 percent (one-half of 1 percent).

                    Well cured means that the kernel separates freely from the shell, breaks cleanly when bent, without splintering, shattering, or loosening the skin; and the kernel appears to be in good shipping or storage condition as to moisture content.
                
                
                  § 51.1413
                  Damage.
                  
                    Damage means any specific defect described in this section; or an equally objectionable variation of any one of these defects, or any other defect, or any combination of defects, which materially detracts from the appearance or the edible or marketing quality of the individual pecan or the general appearance of the pecans in the lot. The following defects shall be considered as damage:

                  (a) Adhering hull material or dark stains affecting an aggregate of more than 5 percent of the surface of the individual shell;

                    Serious damage means any specific defect described in this section; or an equally objectionable variation of any one of these defects, or any other defect, or any combination of defects, which seriously detracts from the appearance or the edible or marketing quality of the individual pecan. The following defects shall be considered as serious damage:
                  (a) Adhering hull material or dark stains affecting an aggregate of more than 20 percent of the individual shell;
                  (b) Broken shells when the missing portion of shell is greater in area than a circle one-fourth inch (6 mm) in diameter;
                  (c) Worm holes when penetrating the shell;
                  (d) Rancidity when the kernel is distinctly rancid to the taste. Staleness of flavor shall not be classed as rancidity;
                  (e) Mold, on the surface or inside the kernel, which is plainly visible without magnification;
                  (f) Decay affecting any portion of the kernel;
                  (g) Insect injury when the insect, web or frass is present inside the shell, or the kernal shows distinct evidence of insect feeding;
                  (h) Kernel spots when more than three dark spots on either half of the kernel, or when any spot or the aggregate of two or more spots on one of the halves of the kernel affects more than 10 percent of the surface;
                  (i) Dark discoloration of the skin which is darker than dark amber over more than 25 percent of the outer surface of the kernel;
                  (j) Internal flesh discoloration of a dark shade extending more than one-third the length of the kernel beneath the ridge, or an equally objectionable amount of dark discoloration in other portions of the kernel; and,

                  § 51.1415
                  Inedible kernels.
                  
                    Inedible kernels means that the kernel or pieces of kernels are rancid, moldy, decayed, injured by insects or otherwise unsuitable for human consumption.
                
              
              
                Optional Determinations
                
                  § 51.1416
                  Optional determinations.
                  The determinations set forth herein are not requirements of these standards. They may be performed upon request in connection with the grade determination or as a separate determination. Samples of pecans for these determinations shall be taken at random from a composite sample drawn throughout the lot.
                  (a) Edible kernel content. A minimum sample of at least 500 grams of in-shell pecans shall be used for determination of edible kernel content. After the sample is weighed and shelled, edible appearing half kernels and pieces of kernels shall be separated from shells, center wall, and other non-kernel material, and inedible kernels (see § 51.1415) and pieces of kernels, and weighed to determine edible kernel content for the lot.
                  (b) Poorly developed kernel content. A minimum sample of at least 500 grams of in-shell pecans shall be used for determination of poorly developed kernel content. The amount of poorly developed kernels and pieces of kernels shall be weighed to determine poorly developed kernel content of the lot (see § 51.1411 and Figure 1).
                  (c) Edible kernel content color classification. The amount of “Light,” “Light amber,” “Amber,” “Dark amber” and darker shades of skin color shall be determined according to § 51.1403, Kernel Color Classification. The total weight of edible kernels and pieces of kernels shall be the basis for determining color classification content for the lot.
                  (d) Kernel moisture content. The sample of pecans for determination of kernel moisture content shall be shelled immediately before analysis and all shells, center wall and other non-kernel material removed. The air-oven or other methods or devices which give equivalent results shall be used for moisture content determination.

                  Color classifications.
                  (a) The skin color of pecan kernels may be described in terms of the color classifications provided in this section. When the color of kernels in a lot generally conforms to the “light” or “light amber” classification, that color classification may be used to describe the lot in connection with the grade.
                  (1) “Light” means that the kernel is mostly golden color or lighter, with not more than 25 percent of the surface darker than golden, and none of the surface darker than light brown.
                  (2) “Light amber” means that the kernel has more than 25 percent of its surface light brown, but not more than 25 percent of the surface darker than light brown, and none of the surface darker than medium brown.
                  (3) “Amber” means that the kernel has more than 25 percent of the surface medium brown, but not more than 25 percent of the surface darker than medium brown, and none of the surface darker than dark brown (very dark-brown or blackish-brown discoloration).
                  (4) “Dark amber” means that the kernel has more than 25 percent of the surface dark brown, but not more than 25 percent of the surface darker than dark brown (very dark-brown or blackish-brown discoloration).
                  (b) U.S. Department of Agriculture kernel color standards, PEC-MC-1, illustrate the color intensities implied by the terms “golden,” “light brown,” “medium brown,” and “dark brown” referred to in paragraph (a) of this section.

                  (b) In lieu of the size classifications in Table I, the size of pecan halves in a lot may be specified in terms of the number of halves or a range of numbers of halves per pound. For example, “400” or “600-700”.
                  (c) Tolerance for count per pound: In order to allow for variations incident to proper sizing, a tolerance shall be permitted as follows:
                  (1) When an exact number of halves per pound is specified, the actual count per pound may vary not more than 5 percent from the specified number; and,
                  (2) When any size classification shown in Table I or a range in count per pound is specified, no tolerance shall be allowed for counts outside of the specified range.
                  (d) Tolerances for pieces, particles, and dust. In order to allow for variations incident to proper sizing and handling, not more than 15 percent, by weight, of any lot may consist of pieces, particles, and dust: Provided, That not more than one-third of this amount, or 5 percent, shall be allowed for portions less than one-half of a complete half-kernel, including not more than 1 percent for particles and dust.

                  Application of standards.
                  The grade of a lot of shelled pecans shall be determined on the basis of a composite sample drawn at random from containers in various locations in the lot. However, any identifiable container or number of containers in which the pecans are obviously of a quality or size materially different from that in the majority of containers, shall be considered as a separate lot, and shall be sampled and graded separately.

                  (3) “Well filled” means that the plums or prunes packed in loose or volume filled containers are packed within 1 inch of the top of the container.
                  (4) “Tightly packed” means the plums or prunes are the proper size for the mold or cell compartments in which they are packed, and the molds or cells are filled in such a way that movement is not allowed.
                  (b) Marking. (1) The size of plums or prunes shall be marked on each package, and shall be indicated in terms of minimum diameter, or number of fruit per package, or in accordance with the arrangement of the top layer of fruit in the package or subcontainer. Size may also be shown in terms of maximum number of fruit for a specified weight, such as “8 per pound,” “6.4 per pound” or “72/3 per pound” or by a count-size designation based on the number of fruits contained in a 10 pound sample with the designation rounded to an applicable number which is divisible by 5 (example: 40 size, 45 size, 50 size, 55 size, etc.).
                  (i) California peach boxes, lug boxes and small consumer packages. In layer-packed California peach boxes or lug boxes, and in small layer packed consumer packages, the count of the entire contents shall be marked on the package. The number of plums or prunes in California peach boxes or lug boxes shall not vary more than 4 from the number indicated on the package. Loose filled consumer packs not in a master container shall have a count-size marked on the package or on a tag closure. Master containers of loose filled consumer packages shall have a count-size marked on the package describing the size of plums or prunes within the container.
                  (ii) Face and fill packs in cartons and lug boxes. In face and fill packs in cartons and lug boxes the number of rows in the face shall be marked on the packages, as “6 row,” “8 row,” etc.
                  (c) Sizing. (1) Not more than 5 percent, by count, of the plums or prunes in any package may vary more than one-fourth inch in diameter, except that not more than 5 percent, by count, of the plums or prunes 2-1/4 inches or larger in diameter and packed in loose or volume filled containers may vary more than three-eighths inch in diameter.
                  (2) When size is indicated in terms of minimum diameter, not more than 5 percent, by count, of the fruit in any package may be smaller than the size marked.
                  (d) Tolerance for standard pack. In order to allow for variations incident to proper sizing and packing, not more than 10 percent, by count, of the packages in any lot may fail to meet the requirements for standard pack.

                  (3) U.S. No. 2. (i) At Shipping Point: A total of 10 percent for potatoes in any lot which fail to meet the requirements for the grade: Provided, That included in this tolerance not more than the following percentages shall be allowed for the defects listed:
                  (A) 6 percent for external defects;
                  (B) 6 percent for internal defects; and
                  (C) Not more than a total of 1 percent for potatoes which are frozen or affected by soft rot or wet breakdown. See § 51.1547.
                  (ii) En route or at destination: A total of 12 percent for potatoes in any lot which fail to meet the requirements for the grade: Provided, That included in this tolerance not more than a total of 10 percent shall be allowed for permanent defects: And provided further, the following percentages shall be allowed for the defects listed:
                  (A) 8 percent for external defects, including therein not more than 6 percent for permanent external defects;
                  (B) 8 percent for internal defects, including therein not more than 6 percent for permanent internal defects; and

                  § 51.1575
                  U.S. Grade A Small; U.S. Grade A Medium; U.S. Grade A Medium to Large; U.S. Grade A Large.

                  Potatoes of each of these grades shall be of one variety or similar varietal characteristics which are fairly well shaped, fairly clean, free from freezing injury, blackheart, late blight, and soft rot or wet breakdown, and from damage caused by sunburn, second growth, growth cracks, air cracks, hollowheart, internal discoloration, cuts, shriveling, sprouting, scab, dry rot, rhizoctonia, other diseases, wireworm, other insects, or mechanical or other means. Potatoes of these grades shall also be mature: Provided, That potatoes which are not mature and the outer skin loosens or “feathers” readily under the usual handling practices need not meet this requirement if they are firm and are further designated as “Early” in connection with the grade, as for example “U.S. Grade A Medium-Early.” Potatoes on the shown face shall be reasonably representative in size and quality of the contents of the containers. (See § 51.5177.)
                  (a) Tolerances. Incident to proper grading and handling, except for the tolerances for size, not more than a total of 5 percent, by weight, of the potatoes in any lot may fail to meet the requirements of the grade, including not more than 1 percent for potatoes affected by soft rot or wet breakdown. (See § 51.1579.)

                  Potatoes of each of these grades shall meet the requirements for U.S. Grade A Small; U.S. Grade A Medium; U.S. Grade A Medium to Large; and U.S. Grade A Large, except for the increased tolerance for defects specified below. (See § 51.1577.)
                  (a) Tolerances. Incident to proper grading and handling, except for the tolerance for size, not more than a total of 20 percent, by weight, of the potaotes in any lot may fail to meet the requirements of the grade, but not more than 5 percent shall be allowed for potatoes which are seriously damaged by any cause, including not more than 1 percent for potatoes affected by soft rot or wet breakdown. (See § 51.1579.)

                  Size range requirements.

                  In addition to the quality requirements specified for the above grades, potatoes shall also meet the requirements for minimum and maximum diameter or weight, and the tolerances as specified for the various grades in the table appearing in this section. Potatoes specified as meeting one of the grades may be of any size within its size range requirements, except that it is not permissible to specify a lot as “U.S. Grade A Medium to Large,” or “U.S. Grade B Medium to Large,” unless more than 15 percent, by weight, of the potatoes are larger than the maxiumum size required for U.S. Grade A Medium, or U.S. Grade B Medium, respectively. For example, a lot of round or intermediate-shaped potatoes to be specified as “U.S. Grade A Medium to Large” must have more than 15 percent, by weight, of potatoes from 3 to 4 inches in diameter.

                  Application of tolerances to individual containers.

                  (a) Based on sample inspection, the contents of individual containers in the lot are subject to the following limitations: Provided, That the averages for the entire lot are within the tolerances specified for the grade:
                  (1) When a tolerance is 10 percent or more, not more than one-tenth of the individual containers in any lot may contain more than one and one-half times the tolerance specified, except that at least one defective and one off-sized specimen may be permitted in a container.
                  (2) When a tolerance is less than 10 percent, not more than one-tenth of the individual containers in any lot may contain more than double the tolerance specified, but no package may contain more than four times the tolerance for soft rot or wet breakdown, except that at least one defective and one off-sized specimen may be permitted in a container.

                    Damage means any injury or defect which materially injures the edible or shipping quality, or the appearance of the individual potato or the general appearance of the potatoes in the container, or which cannot be removed without a loss of more than 5 percent of the total weight of the potato including peel covering defective area. Loss of outer skin (epidermis) shall not be considered as damage when the potatoes are designated as “Early” unless the skinned surface is materially affected by dark discoloration. Any one of the following defects, or any combination of defects, the seriousness of which exceeds the maximum allowed for any one defect, shall be considered as damage:

                  (a) Second growth or growth cracks which have developed to such an extent as to materially injure the appearance of the individual potato or the general appearance of the potatoes in the container.
                  
                  (b) Air cracks which are deep, or shallow air cracks which materially injure the appearance of the individual potato or the general appearance of the potatoes in the container.
                  (c) Shriveling, when the potato is more than moderately shriveled, spongy, or flabby.
                  (d) Sprouting, when the sprouts are not dried and are more than one-half inch long.
                  (e) Surface scab which covers an area of more than 5 percent of the surface of the potato in the aggregate.
                  (f) Pitted scab which affects the appearance of the potato to a greater extent than the amount of surface scab permitted or causes a loss of more than 5 percent of the total weight of the potato including peel covering defective area.
                  (g) Rhizoctonia, when the general appearance of the potatoes in the container is materially injured or when individual potatoes are badly infected.
                  (h) Wireworm, grass root or similar injury, when any hole on potatoes ranging in size from 6 to 8 ounces is longer than three-fourths inch, or when the aggregate length of all holes is more than one and one-fourth inches; smaller potatoes shall have lesser amounts and larger potatoes may have greater amounts, provided, that the removal of the injury by proper trimming does not cause the appearance of such potatoes to be injured to a greater extent than that caused by the proper trimming of such injury permitted on a 6 to 8 ounce potato.

                    Mature means that the outer skin (epidermis) does not loosen or “feather” readily during the ordinary methods of handling.
                
                
                  § 51.1586
                  Serious damage.
                  
                    Serious damage means any injury or defect which seriously injures the edible or shipping quality, or the appearance of the individual potato or the general appearance of the potatoes in the container, or which cannot be removed without a loss of more than 10 percent of the total weight of the potato including peel covering defective area. Any one of the following defects or any combination of defects the seriousness of which exceeds the maximum allowed for any one defect shall be considered as serious damage:
                  (a) Fairly smooth cuts such as are made by the digger, or by a knife to remove injury when both ends are clipped, or when more than an estimated one-fourth of the potato is cut away, or, in the case of long varieties, when the remaining portion of the clipped potato weighs less than 6 ounces; irregular types of cuts which seriously affect the appearance of the individual potato, or which cannot be removed without a loss of more than 10 percent of the total weight of the potato including peel covering defective area.
                  (b) Shriveling, when the potato is excessively shriveled, spongy, or flabby.
                  (c) Surface scab which covers an area of more than 50 percent of the surface of the potato in the aggregate.
                  (d) Pitted scab which affects the appearance of the potato to a greater extent than the amount of surface scab permitted or causes a loss of more than 10 percent of the total weight of the potato including peel covering defective area.

                  (e) Wireworm, grass root or similar injury, when any hole on potatoes ranging in size from 6 to 8 ounces is longer than one and one-fourth inches, or when the aggregate length of all holes is more than two inches; smaller potatoes shall have lesser amounts and larger potatoes may have greater amounts: Provided, That the removal of the injury by proper trimming, does not cause the appearance of such potatoes to be injured to a greater extent than that caused by the proper trimming of such injury permitted on a 6 to 8 ounce potato.

                  Color classification.
                  (a) The following terms may be used, when specified in connection with the grade statement, in describing the color as an indication of the stage of ripeness of any lot of mature tomatoes of a red fleshed variety:
                  (1) Green. “Green” means that the surface of the tomato is completely green in color. The shade of green color may vary from light to dark;
                  (2) Breakers. “Breakers” means that there is a definite break in color from green to tannish-yellow, pink or red on not more than 10 percent of the surface;

                  (a) The tomatoes may also be classed in terms of combinations of the above sizes, as “Small to Medium,” “Medium to Large,” “Small to Very Large,” etc., in accordance with the facts.
                  (b) Incident to proper sizing, not more than 10 percent, by count, of the tomatoes in any lot may vary from the size specified.
                
                
                  § 51.1904
                  Maturity classification.
                  Tomatoes which are characteristically red when ripe, but are not overripe or soft, may be classified for maturity as follows:
                  (a) Turning, when at least some part of the surface of the tomato, but less than one-half of the surface in the aggregate, is covered with pink color.
                  (b) Pink, when the tomato shows from one-half to three-fourths of the surface in the aggregate covered with pink or red color.
                  (c) Hard ripe, when the tomato shows three-fourths or more of the surface in the aggregate covered with pink or red color.
                  (d) Firm ripe, when the tomato shows three-fourths or more of the surface in the aggregate covered with red color characteristic of reasonably well ripened tomatoes.

                  (e) Incident to proper maturity determination, not more than a total of 10 percent, by count, of the tomatoes in any lot may fail to meet the maturity specified: Provided, That not more than 5 percent shall be allowed for tomatoes which are immature or are overripe or soft.
                
              
              
                Off-Grade

                  § 51.1906
                  Similar varietal characteristics.
                  
                    Similar varietal characteristics means that the tomatoes are alike as to color, i.e., bright red varieties shall not be mixed with varieties which have a purplish tinge.
                
                
                  § 51.1907
                  Mature.
                  
                    Mature means that the tomato has reached the stage of development which will insure a proper completion of the ripening process.
                
                
                  § 51.1908
                  Well developed.
                  
                    Well developed means that the tomato shows normal growth. Tomatoes which are ridged and peaked at the stem end, contain dry tissue and usually open spaces, are not considered well developed.
                
                
                  § 51.1909
                  Fairly well formed.
                  
                    Fairly well formed means that the tomato is not decidedly kidney-shaped, lopsided, elongated, angular, or otherwise deformed.
                
                
                  § 51.1910
                  Fairly smooth.
                  
                    Fairly smooth means that the tomato is not conspicuously ridged or rough.
                
                
                  § 51.1911
                  Damaged.
                  
                    Damaged means any defect which materially affects the appearance, or edible, shipping or keeping quality of the tomatoes. Any one of the following defects or any combination thereof, the seriousness of which exceeds the maximum allowed for any one defect, shall be considered as damage:
                  (a) Cuts which are not shallow, not well healed, or when more than 1/2 inch in length.
                  (b) Puffiness if the open space in one or more locules materially affects the appearance when the tomato is cut through the center at right angles to a line running from the stem to the blossom end.
                  (c) Catfaces. These are irregular, dark, leathery scars at the blossom end of the fruit. Such scars damage the tomato when they are rough or deep, or when channels extend into the locule, or when they are fairly smooth and greater in area than a circle 3/8 inch in diameter on a 21/2 inch tomato. Smaller tomatoes shall have lesser areas of fairly smooth catfaces and larger tomatoes may have greater areas, provided that such catfaces do not affect the appearance of the tomatoes to a greater extent than that caused by fairly smooth catfaces which are permitted on a 21/2 inch tomato.
                  (d) Growth cracks. These are ruptures or cracks radiating from the stem scar, or concentric to the stem scar. They damage the tomato when not well healed, or when more than 1/2 inch in length measured from the margin of the stem scar; except that very narrow, well healed cracks concentric to the stem scar shall not be considered as damage unless they are so numerous as to damage the appearance of the fruit.

                  (e) Scars (except catfaces), when dark colored and shallow and aggregating more than 1/4 inch in diameter on a tomato 21/2 inches in diameter, or lighter colored shallow scars covering a greater area when they detract from the appearance to a greater extent than a dark-colored, shallow scar 1/4 inch in diameter. Smaller tomatoes shall have lesser areas of scars and larger tomatoes may have greater areas: Provided, That such scars do not affect the appearance of the tomatoes to a greater extent than that caused by scars which are permitted on a 21/2-inch tomato. A scar which penetrates the wall of the tomato shall be considered as damage.
                  (f) Dry rot such as dry type Macrosporium or Phoma, when the spot is not adjacent to the stem scar, or when adjacent to the stem scar and more than 3/16 inch in diameter.
                
                
                  § 51.1912
                  Badly misshapen.
                  
                    Badly misshapen means that the tomato is so badly deformed that its appearance is seriously affected.
                
                
                  § 51.1913
                  Serious damage.
                  
                    Serious damage means any defect which seriously affects the appearance, or edible, shipping, or keeping quality of the tomatoes. Any one of the following defects or any combination thereof, the seriousness of which exceeds the maximum allowed for any one defect, shall be considered as serious damage:
                  (a) Soft ripe tomatoes or tomatoes affected by the soft rot.

                  (b) Fresh holes or cuts, or any holes or cuts through the tomato wall, or healed cuts which seriously affect the appearance of the tomato.
                  
                  (c) Tomatoes showing any effects of freezing.
                  (d) Puffiness which causes the tomato to be distinctly light in weight.
                  (e) Growth cracks, when not well healed, or when so extensive, deep or discolored that the appearance of the tomato is seriously affected.

                  (f) Scars (except catfaces), when dark colored and shallow and aggregating more than 1/2 inch in diameter on a tomato 21/2 inches in diameter, or lighter colored, shallow scars covering a greater area when they detract from the appearance to a greater extent than a darkcolored, shallow scar 1/2 inch in diameter. Smaller tomatoes shall have lesser areas of scars and larger tomatoes may have greater areas: Provided, That such scars do not affect the appearance of the tomatoes to a greater extent than that caused by scars which are permitted on a 21/2-inch tomato.
                  (g) Dry rot such as dry type Macrosporium or Phoma, when the spot is not adjacent to the stem scar, or when adjacent to the stem scar and more than 1/4 inch in diameter.
                  (h) Fruit actually infested with worms.

                  § 51.1996
                  Application of standards.
                  (a) The grade of a lot of filberts shall be determined on the basis of a composite sample drawn from containers in various locations in the lot. However, any container or group of cantainers in which the filberts are obviously of a quality, type or size materially different from that in the majority of containers shall be considered a separate lot, and shall be sampled separately.
                  (b) In grading the sample, each filbert shall be examined for defects of the shell before being cracked for kernel examination. A filbert shall be classed as only one defective nut even though it may be defective externally and internally.

                Grades
                
                  § 51.2075
                  U.S. No. 1.
                  “U.S. No. 1” consists of almonds in the shell which are of similar varietal characteristics and free from loose extraneous and foreign material. The shells are clean, fairly bright, fairly uniform color, and free from damage caused by discoloration, adhering hulls, broken shells or other means. The kernels are well dried, free from decay, rancidity, and free from damage caused by insects, mold, gum, skin discoloration, shriveling, brown spot or other means.
                  (a) Unless otherwise specified, the almonds are of a size not less than 28/64 of an inch (11.1 mm) in thickness.
                  (b) In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and handling, the following tolerances are provided as specified:
                  (1) For external (shell) defects. 10 percent, by count, for almonds which fail to meet the requirements of this grade other than for variety and size;
                  (2) For dissimilar varieties. 5 percent, by count, including therein not more than 1 percent for bitter almonds mixed with sweet almonds;
                  (3) For size. 5 percent, by count, for almonds which are smaller than the specified minimum thickness;
                  (4) For loose extraneous and foreign material. 2 percent, by weight, including therein not more than 1 percent which can pass through a round opening 24/64 inch (9.5 mm) in diameter: Provided, that such material is practically free from insect infestation; and,
                  (5) For internal (kernel) defects. 10 percent, by weight, for almonds with kernels failing to meet the requirements of this grade: Provided, that not more than one-half of this tolerance or 5 percent shall be allowed for kernels affected by decay or rancidity, damaged by insects or mold or seriously damaged by shriveling: And provided further, that no part of this tolerance shall be allowed for live insects inside the shell.

                  § 51.2080
                  Determination of grade.

                  In grading the inspection sample, the percentage of loose hulls, pieces of shell, chaff and foreign material is determined on the basis of weight. Next, the percentages of nuts which are of dissimilar varieties, undersize or have adhering hulls or defective shells are determined by count, using an adequate portion of the total sample. Finally, the nuts in that portion of the sample are cracked and the percentage having internal defects is determined on the basis of weight.

                    Damage means any defect which materially detracts from the appearance of the individual kernel, or the edible or shipping quality of the almond. Any one of the following defects or combination thereof, the seriousness of which exceeds the maximum allowed for any one defect shall be considered as damage:
                  (a) Discoloration of the shell which is medium gray to black and affects more than one-eighth of the surface in the aggregate. Normal variations of a reddish or brownish color shall not be considered discoloration;
                  (b) Adhering hulls which cover more than 5 percent of the shell surface in the aggregate;
                  (c) Broken shells when a portion of the shell is missing, or the shell is broken or fractured to the extent that moderate pressure will permit the kernel to become dislodged;
                  (d) Insect injury when the insect, web or frass is present or there is definite evidence of insect feeding;
                  (e) Mold, when visible on the kernel, except when white or gray and easily rubbed off with the fingers;
                  (f) Gum, when a film of shiny, resinous appearing substance affects an area aggregating more than the equivalent of a circle one-quarter inch (6.4 mm) in diameter;
                  (g) Skin discoloration when more than one-half of the surface of the kernel is affected by very dark or black stains contrasting with the natural color of the skin;
                  (h) Shriveling when the kernel is excessively thin for its size, or when materially withered, shrunken, leathery, tough or only partially developed: Provided, that partially developed kernels are not considered damaged if more than three-fourths of the pellicle is filled with meat. An almond containing two kernels shall not be classed as damaged if either kernel has more than three-fourths of the pellicle filled with meat; and,

                  (i) Brown spot which affects an aggregate area on the kernel greater than the area of a circle one-eighth inch (3.2 mm) in diameter.

                  “U.S. No. 1” consists of portions of walnut kernels which are well dried, clean, free from shell, foreign material, insect injury, decay, rancidity, and free from damage caused by shriveling, mold, discoloration of the meat or other means. (See § 51.2280.)
                  (a) Color shall be specified in connection with this grade in terms of “extra light,” “light,” “light amber,” or “amber” from the USDA Walnut Color Chart or in terms of “red” color. The color classifications in the USDA Walnut Color Chart shall not apply to “red” color. Furthermore, “red” color shall not be mixed with “extra light,” “light,” “light amber,” or “amber” colors. (See §§ 51.2281 and 51.2282.)
                  (b) Size shall be specified in connection with this grade in terms of one of the size classifications. (See §§ 51.2284 and 51.2285.)

                  The following classifications are provided to describe the size of any lot: “Halves”, “Pieces and Halves”, “Pieces” or “Small Pieces”. The size of portions of kernels in the lot shall conform to the requirements of the specified classification as defined below:
                  (a) Halves. Lot consists of 85 percent or more, by weight, half kernels, and the remainder three-fourths half kernels. (See § 51.2285.)
                  (b) Pieces and halves. Lot consists of 20 percent or more, by weight, half kernels, and the remainder portions of kernels that cannot pass through a sieve with 24/64 inch round openings. When a lot exceeds this minimum requirement, the actual percentage of halves may be specified. (See § 51.2285.)
                  (c) Pieces. Lot consists of portions of kernels that cannot pass through a sieve with 24/64 inch round openings. (See § 51.2285.)
                  (d) Small pieces. Lot consists of portions of kernels that pass through a sieve with 24/64 inch round openings, but that cannot pass through a sieve with 8/64 inch round openings. When desired, the actual size ranges within such size ranges may be specified. (See § 51.2285.)

                § 51.2545
                Application of tolerances.
                The tolerances for the grades apply to the entire lot and shall be based on a composite sample drawn from containers throughout the lot. Any container or group of containers which have nuts obviously different in quality or size from those in the majority of the containers shall be considered a separate lot and shall be sampled separately.

                § 51.2546
                Size.
                Nuts may be considered as meeting a size designation specified in Table IV or a range in number of nuts per ounce, provided, the weight of 10 percent, by count, of the largest nuts in a sample does not exceed 1.50 times the weight of 10 percent, by count, of the smallest and the average number of nuts per ounce is not more than one-half nut above or below the extremes of the range specified.

                § 51.2547
                Definitions.
                (a) Well dried means the kernel is firm and crisp.
                (b) Very well dried means the kernel is firm and crisp and the average moisture content of the lot does not exceed 7.00 percent or is specified. (See § 51.2548.)
                (c) Loose kernels means edible kernels or kernel portions which are out of the shell and which cannot be considered particles and dust.
                (d) External (shell) defects means any blemish affecting the hard covering around the kernel. Such defects include, but are not limited to, non-split shells, shells not split on suture, adhering hull material, light stained, or dark stained.
                
                (1) Damage by external (shell) defects means any specific defect described in paragraphs (d)(1) (i) through (v) of this section, or an equally objectionable variation of any one of these defects, any other defect, or any combination of defects, which materially detracts from the appearance or the edible or marketing quality of the individual shell or of the lot. (For tolerances see § 51.2544, Table I.)
                (i) Non-split shells means shells are not opened or are partially opened and will not allow an 18/1000 (.018) inch thick by 1/4 (.25) inch wide gauge to slip into the opening.
                (ii) Not split on suture means shells are split other than on the suture and will allow an 18/1000 (.018) inch thick by 1/4 (.25) inch wide gauge to slip into the opening.
                (iii) Adhering hull material means an aggregate amount covers more than one-eighth of the total shell surface, or when readily noticeable on dyed shells.
                (iv) Light stained on raw or roasted nuts, means an aggregate amount of yellow to light brown or light gray discoloration is noticeably contrasting with the predominate color of the shell and affects more than one-fourth of the total shell surface or, on dyed nuts, when readily noticeable.
                (v) Dark stained on raw or roasted nuts, means an aggregate amount of dark brown, dark gray or black discoloration affects more than one-eighth of the total shell surface, or, on dyed nuts, when readily noticeable, provided that speckled appearing stain located within the area of one-fourth of the shell nearest the stem end shall be disregarded.
                (e) Internal (kernel) defects means any blemish affecting the kernel. Such defects include, but are not limited to evidence of insects, immature kernels, rancid kernels, mold, or decay.
                (1) Damage by internal (kernel) defects means any specific defect described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (ii) of this section; or an equally objectionable variation of any one of these defects, any other defect, or any combination of defects, which materially detracts from the appearance or the edible or marketing quality of the individual kernel or of the lot. (For tolerances see § 51.2544, Table II.)
                (i) Immature kernels are excessively thin or when a kernel fills less than three-fourths, but not less than one-half the shell cavity.
                (ii) Kernel spotting refers to dark brown or dark gray spots aggregating more than one-eighth of the surface of the kernel.
                (2) Serious damage by internal (kernel) defects means any specific defect described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (v) of this section; or an equally objectionable variation of any one of these defects, any other defect, or any combination of defects, which seriously detracts from the appearance or the edible or the marketing quality of the individual kernel or of the lot. (For tolerances see § 51.2544, Table II.)
                (i) Minor insect or vertebrate injury means the kernel shows conspicuous evidence of feeding.
                (ii) Insect damage is an insect, insect fragment, web or frass attached to the kernel. No live insects shall be permitted.
                (iii) Mold which is readily visible on the shell or kernel.
                (iv) Rancidity means the kernel is distinctly rancid to taste. Staleness of flavor shall not be classed as rancidity.
                (v) Decay means one-sixteenth or more of the kernel surface is decomposed.
                (f) Other defects means defects which cannot be considered internal defects or external defects. Such defects include, but are not limited to shell pieces, blanks, foreign material or particles and dust. The following shall be considered other defects. (For tolerances see § 51.2544, Table III.)
                (1) Shell pieces means open in-shell nuts not containing a kernel, half shells or pieces of shell which are loose in the sample.
                (2) Blank means a non-split shell not containing a kernel or containing a kernel that fills less than one-half the shell cavity.
                (3) Foreign material means leaves, sticks, loose hulls or hull pieces, dirt, rocks, insects or insect fragments not attached to nuts, or any substance other than pistachio shells or kernels. Glass, metal or live insects shall not be permitted.
                
                (4) Particles and dust means pieces of nut kernels which will pass through a 5/64 inch round opening.
                (5) Undersize means pistachio nuts in the shell which fall through a 30/64 inch round hole screen.

                § 51.2548
                Average moisture content determination.
                (a) Determining average moisture content of the lot is not a requirement of the grades, except when nuts are specified as “very well dried.” It may be carried out upon request in connection with grade analysis or as a separate determination.
                (b) Nuts shall be obtained from a randomly drawn composite sample. Official certification shall be based on the air-oven method or other officially approved methods or devices. Results obtained by methods or devices not officially approved may be reported and shall include a description of the method or device and the owner of any equipment used.

                § 51.2558
                Application of tolerances.
                The tolerances for the grades apply to the entire lot and shall be based on a composite sample representative of the lot. Any container or group of containers which have kernels obviously different in quality or size from those in the majority of containers shall be considered a separate lot and shall be sampled separately.
              
              
                § 51.2559
                Size classifications.
                (a) The size of pistachio kernels may be specified in connection with the grade in accordance with one of the following size classifications.
                (1) Jumbo Whole Kernels: 80 percent or more by weight shall be whole kernels and not more than 5 percent of the total sample shall pass through a 24/64 inch round hole screen with not more than 1 percent passing through a 16/64 inch round hole screen.
                (2) Large Whole Kernels: 80 percent or more, by weight, shall be whole kernels and not more than 2 percent of the total sample shall pass through a 16/64 inch round hole screen.
                (3) Large Split Kernels: 75 percent or more, by weight, shall be half kernels split lengthwise and not more than 5 percent of the total sample shall pass through a 16/64 inch round hole screen.
                (4) Whole and Broken Kernels: means a mixture of any combination of whole kernels or pieces. The percentage of whole kernels and/or pieces may be specified. Not more than 5 percent of the total sample shall pass through a 5/64 inch round hole screen.

                § 51.2560
                Definitions.
                (a) Well dried means the kernel is firm and crisp.
                (b) Very well dried means the kernel is firm and crisp and the average moisture content of the lot does not exceed 7 percent or is specified (See § 51.2561).
                (c) Foreign material means leaves, sticks, in-shell nuts, shells or pieces of shells, dirt, or rocks, or any other substance other than pistachio kernels. No allowable tolerances for metal or glass.
                (d) Whole kernel means 3/4 of a kernel or more.
                (e) Splits means more than 3/4 of a half kernel split lengthwise.
                (f) Damage means any specific defect described in paragraph (f) (1) through (2) of this section or an equally objectionable variation of any one of these defects, any other defect, or any combination of defects, which materially detracts from the appearance or the edible or marketing quality of the individual kernel or of the lot. (For tolerances, see § 51.2557, Table I.)
                (1) Immature kernels are excessively thin kernels and can have black, brown or gray surface with a dark interior color and the immaturity has adversely affected the flavor of the kernel.
                (2) Kernel spotting refers to dark brown or dark gray spots aggregating more than one-eighth of the surface of the kernel.
                (g) Serious damage means any specific defect described in paragraph (g) (1) through (5) of this section, or an equally objectionable variation of any one of these defects, any other defect, or any combination of defects, which seriously detracts from the appearance or the edible or marketing quality of the individual kernel or of the lot. (For tolerances see § 51.2557 Table I.)
                (1) Mold which is readily visible on the kernel.
                (2) Minor insect or vertebrate injury means the kernel shows conspicuous evidence of feeding.
                (3) Insect damage is an insect, insect fragment, web or frass attached to the kernel. No live insects shall be permitted.
                (4) Rancidity means the kernel is distinctly rancid to taste. Staleness of flavor shall not be classed as rancidity.
                (5) Decay means one-sixteenth or more of the kernel is decomposed.

                Average moisture content.
                (a) Determining average moisture content of the lot is not a requirement of the grades, except when kernels are specified as “very well dried.” It may be carried out upon request in connection with grade analysis or as a separate determination.
                (b) Kernels shall be obtained from a randomly drawn composite sample. Official certification shall be based on the air-oven method or other officially approved methods or devices. Results obtained by methods or devices not officially approved may be reported and shall include a description of the method or device and owner of any equipment used.

                  Tolerances.
                  In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and handling in each of the foregoing grades the following tolerances, by weight, are provided as specified:
                  (a) For defects:
                  (1) U.S. No. 1, U.S. Export No. 1, U.S. No. 1 Boilers and U.S. No. 1 Picklers grades. (i) Not more than 10 percent of the onions in a lot may be damaged by peeling; and,
                  (ii) Not more than 5 percent of the onions in a lot may be below the remaining requirements of these grades, but not more than two-fifths of this tolerance, or 2 percent, may be allowed for onions which are affected by decay or wet sunscald (see § 51.2839.)
                  (2) U.S. Commercial and U.S. No. 2 grades. (i) Not more than 5 percent of the onions in a lot may be below the requirements of these grades, but not more than two-fifths of this tolerance, or 2 percent, may be allowed for onions which are affected by decay or wet sunscald. (See § 51.2839.)
                  (ii) [Reserved]
                  (b) For off-size:
                  (1) U.S. No. 1, U.S. No. 1 Boilers, U.S. Commercial, and U.S. No. 2 grades. Not more than 5 percent of the onions in a lot may be below the specified minimum size, and not more than 10 percent may be above any specified maximum size. (See § 51.2839.)
                  (2) U.S. No. 1 Pickler grade. Not more than 10 percent of the onions in a lot may be above the maximum size specified for this grade. (See § 51.2839.)

                  § 51.2838
                  Samples for grade and size determination.
                  Individual samples shall consist of at least 20 pounds for onions packed to meet larger than 21/4 inches maximum diameter. When individual packages contain 20 pounds or more and the onions are packed for Large or Jumbo size or larger the package shall be the sample. When individual packages contain less than 20 pounds, a sufficient number of adjoining packages are opened to provide at least a 20 pound sample, except that for onions packed to meet 21/4 inches maximum diameter or smaller, the sample may consist of either 20 pounds or the individual package.

                  (e) Dry roots when more than 20 percent of the onions in a lot have practically all roots 2 inches or more in length;
                  (f) Dry sunken areas when the affected areas exceed the equivalent to that of a circle 1/2 inch in diameter on an onion 23/4 inches in diameter which does not have the outer papery scale covering the affected areas or when the affected areas exceed the equivalent to that of a circle 3/4 inch in diameter on an onion 23/4 inches in diameter which has the outer papery scale covering the affected areas. Correspondingly lesser or greater areas are allowed on smaller or larger onions;
                  (g) Sunburn when more than 33 percent of the onions in a lot have a medium green color on one-third of the surface;
                  (h) Sprouts when visible, or when concealed within the dry top and more than 3/4 inch in length on an onion 2 inches or larger in diameter, or proportionately shorter on smaller onions;

                  (l) Dirt, staining or other foreign matter when more than 20 percent of the onions in a yellow, brown or red lot, or more than 15 percent of the onions in a white lot are appreciably stained. Onions with adhering dirt or other foreign matter shall be judged on the same basis as stained onions;
                  (m) Mechanical when any cut extends deeper than one fleshy scale, or when any bruise breaks a fleshy scale; and,
                  (n) Translucent scales when more than the equivalent of two entire outer fleshy scales have a watersoaked condition.

                  Method of inspection.
                  In determining the grade of a lot of walnuts, all of the nuts in the sample first should be graded for size and then examined for external defects. The same nuts then should be cracked and examined for internal defects. The nuts must meet the requirements for both external and internal quality in order to meet a designated grade.

                    Injury by discoloration means that the color of the affected portion of the shell objectionably contrasts with the color of the rest of the shell of the individual nut.
                
                
                  § 51.2960
                  Damage.
                  
                    Damage means any specific defect mentioned in this section; or any equally objectionable variation of any one of these defects, any other defect, or any combination of defects which materially detracts from the appearance or the edible or shipping quality of the individual walnut or the lot as a whole. The following specific defects shall be considered as damage:
                  (a) Broken shells when the area from which a portion of the shell is missing is greater than the area of a circle one-fourth inch in diameter; or when the two halves of the shell have become completely broken apart and separated from each other;

                  (b) Perforated shells when the area affected aggregates more than that of a circle one-fourth inch in diameter. The term “perforated shells” means imperfectly developed areas on the shell resembling abrasions and usually including small holes penetrating the shell wall;
                  
                  (c) Adhering hulls when affecting more than 5 percent of the shell surface;
                  (d) Discoloration (or stain) which covers, in the aggregate, one-fifth or more of the surface of the shell of an individual nut, and which is brown, reddish brown, gray, or other color in pronounced contrast with the color of the rest of the shell or the majority of shells in the lot, or darker discoloration covering a smaller area if the appearance is equally objectionable;
                  (e) Mold when attached to the kernel and conspicuous; or when inconspicuous white or gray mold affects an aggregate area larger than one square centimeter or one-eighth of the entire surface of the kernel, whichever is the lesser area;
                  (f) Shriveling when more than 5 percent of the surface of the kernel, including both halves, is severely shriveled, or a greater area is affected by lesser degrees of shriveling producing an equally objectionable appearance. Kernels which are thin in cross section but which are otherwise normally developed shall not be considered as damaged; and,
                  (g) Insects when an insect or insect fragment, web or frass is present inside the shell, or the kernel shows distinct evidence of insect feeding.
                
                
                  § 51.2961
                  Well dried.
                  
                    Well dried means that the kernel is firm and crisp, not pliable or leathery.
                
                
                  § 51.2962
                  Decay.
                  
                    Decay means that any portion of the kernel is decomposed.
                
                
                  § 51.2963
                  Dark discoloration.
                  
                    Dark discoloration means that the color of the skin of the kernel is darker than “amber”. (See color chart.)
                
                
                  § 51.2964
                  Rancidity.
                  
                    Rancidity means the stage of deterioration in which the kernel has developed a rancid flavor. Rancidity should not be confused with a slightly astringent flavor of the pellicle (skin) or with staleness, the stage at which the flavor is flat but not distasteful.
                
                
                  § 51.2965
                  Fairly clean.
                  
                    Fairly clean means that, from the viewpoint of general appearance, the lot is not seriously damaged by adhering dirt or other foreign matter, and that individual walnuts are not coated or caked with dirt or foreign matter. Both the amount of surface affected and the color of the dirt shall be taken into consideration.
                
                
                  § 51.2966
                  Serious damage.
                  
                    Serious damage means any specific defect mentioned in this section; or an equally objectionable variation of any one of these defects, any other defect, or any combination of defects which seriously detracts from the appearance or the edible or shipping quality of the walnut. The following specific defects shall be considered as serious damage:
                  (a) Discoloration (or stain) which covers, in the aggregate, one-third or more of the surface of the shell of an individual nut and which is brown, reddish brown, gray, or other color in pronounced contrast with the color of the rest of the shell or the majority of shells in the lot, or darker discoloration covering a smaller area if the appearance is equally objectionable;
                  (b) Perforated shells when the area affected aggregates more than that of a circle three-eighths of an inch in diameter. The term “perforated shells” means imperfectly developed areas on the shell resembling abrasions and usually including small holes penetrating the shell wall;
                  (c) Adhering hulls when affecting more than one-eighth of the shell surface in the aggregate;

                  (d) Shriveling when both halves of the kernel are affected by severe shriveling over an area totaling more than one-eighth of the surface; or when both halves are affected over a greater area by lesser degrees of shriveling producing an equally objectionable appearance. When one of the halves of the kernel shows no shriveling, the kernel shall not be considered seriously damaged unless the other half shows shriveling to the extent that over 50 percent of its surface is severely shriveled, or a greater area is affected by lesser degrees of shriveling producing an equally objectionable appearance. Kernels which are thin in cross section, but which are otherwise normally developed shall not be considered as damaged;
                  (e) Rancidity or decay; and,
                  (f) Uncured kernels which are wet, rubbery and “green”.

                  § 51.3199
                  Tolerances.
                  In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and handling in each of the foregoing grades the following tolerances, by weight, are provided as specified:
                  (a) For defects:
                  (1) U.S. No. 1 and U.S. No. 2 grades. Not more than 10 percent of the onions in a lot may fail to meet the requirements of these grades, but not more than one-fifth of this tolerance, or 2 percent, may be allowed for onions which are affected by decay or wet sunscald.
                  (2) U.S. Combination grade. When applying the foregoing tolerances to this grade no part of any tolerance shall be allowed to reduce, for the lot as a whole, the 50 percent of onions of the U.S. No. 1 grade, but individual containers shall have not less than 40 percent of the U.S. No. 1 grade.
                  (b) For size:
                  (1) Not more than 5 percent of the onions in a lot may be smaller than the minimum diameter specified. In addition, not more than 10 percent of the onions in a lot may be larger than the maximum diameter specified.

                  (2) When a percentage of the onions is specified to be a certain size and larger, individual packages containing more than 10 pounds may have not less than one-half of the percentage specified: Provided, that the entire lot averages within the percentage specified.
                
              
              
                Samples for Grade and Size Determination
                
                  § 51.3200
                  Samples for grade and size determination.

                  Individual samples shall consist of at least 20 pounds for onions packed to meet larger than 21/4 inches maximum diameter. When individual packages contain 20 pounds or more and the onions are packed for Large or Jumbo size or larger the package shall be the sample. When individual packages contain less than 20 pounds, a sufficient number of adjoining packages are opened to provide at least a 20 pound sample, except that for onions packed to meet 21/4 inches maximum diameter or smaller, the sample may consist of either 20 pounds or the individual package.

                  § 51.3201
                  Application of tolerances.
                  Individual samples are subject to the following limitations:

                  (a) Samples which contain more than 20 pounds shall have not more than one and one half times a specified tolerance of 10 percent or more, and not more than double a specified tolerance of less than 10 percent, except that at least one defective and one off-size onion may be permitted in any sample: Provided, that en-route or at destination when onions in containers of 50 pounds or more are packed to a minimum size of 3 inches or larger not more than three onions or more than 4 percent (whichever is the larger amount) may be affected by decay or wet sunscald: And provided further, that the averages for the entire lot are within the tolerances specified for the grade; and,

                  (b) Samples which contain 20 pounds or less shall have not more than double the tolerance specified, except that at least one defective and one off-size onion may be permitted in any sample: Provided, that the averages for the entire lot are within the tolerances specified for the grade.

                  (h) Tops when more than 30 percent of the onions in a lot have tops 3 inches or more in length;
                  (i) New roots when most roots on an individual onion have grown to a length of 1 inch or more;
                  (j) Dry roots when practically all roots are 2 inches or more in length;
                  (k) Translucent scales when more than the equivalent of two entire outer fleshy scales have a watersoaked condition; and,

                § 51.3414
                Application of standards.
                In the application of these standards to determine the percentages of potatoes in any lot which meet the requirements of the respective grades or size categories, tolerances do not apply. However, for lots which are graded or pre-sorted for size or quality, offered for inspection and required to meet one of the grades, the following tolerances, by weight, are provided:
                (a) For defects:
                (1) U.S. No. 1 Processing. 10 percent for potatoes which fail to meet the requirements of this grade including not more than one-half of this tolerance, or 5 percent, for serious damage by any means, including therein not more than 2 percent for potatoes which are frozen or affected by soft rot or wet breakdown.
                (2) U.S. No. 2 Processing. 10 percent for potatoes which fail to meet the requirements of this grade including not more than one-half of this tolerance, or 5 percent, for potatoes which are seriously damaged by internal defects occurring entirely within the vascular ring, including therein not more than 2 percent for potatoes which are frozen or affected by soft rot or wet breakdown.
                (b) For loose sprouts, dirt and foreign material: 2 percent.
                (c) For off-size:
                (1) Undersize. 3 percent when the minimum size specified is less than 21/4 inches in diameter or less than 5 ounces in weight; and 5 percent when the minimum size specified is 21/4 inches or more in diameter or 5 ounces or more in weight.
                (2) Oversize. 10 percent.

                Optional test for specific gravity.
                Tests to determine specific gravity shall be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section.
                (a) The potatoes used for such determinations shall be:
                (1) Taken at random from a composite sample drawn from containers representative of the lot.
                (2) A comparable sample from a bulk load or storage bin.
                (3) From a portion of the divided sample initially drawn or submitted for determination of grade or contract compliance.
                (4) Representative of the lot with respect to size and quality.
                The specific gravity for any lot of potatoes shall be the average of at least 3 corrected readings on separate tests from the composite sample. Specific gravity may also be determined, if requested, in accordance with size classifications or weighted value in proportion to size and/or grade separations in the lot.
                (b) Specific gravity shall be determined by either;
                (1) Calculation from the weights of the sample in air and in water made with USDA approved equipment. The reading obtained from each test shall be corrected for temperature variations using Table I.
                (2) A hydrometer specifically designed for determining the specific gravity of potatoes. 3

                  When application may be rejected.
                  An application for inspection service may be rejected by the Administrator (a) for non-compliance by the applicant with the regulations in this part, (b) for non-payment for previous inspection services rendered, (c) when the product is not properly identifiable by code or other marks, or (d) when it appears that to perform the inspection service would not be to the best interests of the Government. Such applicant shall be promptly notified of the reason for such rejection.

                  (a) Inspection service shall be performed on the basis of the appropriate United States standards for grades of processed products, Federal, Military, Veterans Administration or other government agency specifications, written contract specifications, or any written specification or instruction which is approved by the Administrator.

                  (b) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, compliance with such grade standards, specifications, or instructions shall be determined by evaluating the product, or sample, in accordance with the requirements of such standards, specifications or instructions: Provided, That when inspection for quality is based on any U.S. grade standard which contains a scoring system, the grade to be assigned to a lot is the grade indicated by the average of the total of the scores of the respective sample units: Provided further, That—
                  (1) Such sample complies with the applicable standards of quality promulgated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act;
                  (2) Such sample complies with the product description;
                  (3) Such sample meets the indicated grade with respect to factors of quality which are not rated by score points; and
                  (4) With respect to those factors of quality which are rated by score points, each of the following requirements is met:
                  (i) None of the sample units falls more than one grade below the indicated grade because of any quality factor to which a limiting rule applies;
                  (ii) None of the sample units falls more than 4 score points below the minimum total score for the indicated grade;
                  (iii) The number of deviants does not exceed the applicable acceptance number indicated in the sampling plans contained in § 52.38 (“deviants”, as used in this paragraph, means sample units that fall into the next grade below the indicated grade but do not score more than 4 points below the minimum total score for the indicated grade);
                  (5) If any of the provisions contained in paragraphs (b) (3) and (4) of this section are not met, the grade is determined by considering such provisions in connection with succeedingly lower grades until the grade of the lot, if assignable, is established; and
                  (6) When it is determined that a portion of a lot bearing a particular identification mark is of lower quality or deficient in other factors, the grade or compliance of the lot shall be no higher than that of the portion bearing the particular identification mark.

                  (3) An inspector designated as the “inspector in charge,” when the certificate represents composite inspection of several persons.

                  In all cases the inspection certificate shall be prepared in accordance with the facts set forth in the official memoranda made by the inspector or inspectors in connection with the inspection. Whenever a certificate is signed by a person under a power of attorney the certificate should so indicate. The signature of the holder of the power shall appear under the name of the inspector who personally inspected the product, and whenever a certificate issued is signed by an inspector in charge that title must appear in connection with the signature.

                  (b) Under the sampling plans with respect to any specified requirement:
                  (1) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the specific requirement) in the sample does not exceed the acceptance number prescribed for the sample size, the lot meets the requirement;
                  (2) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the specific requirement) in the sample exceeds the acceptance number prescribed for the sample size, the lot fails the requirement.

                  (c) If in the conduct of on-line in-plant inspection of a product covered by a grade standard which does not contain sampling plans, the sample is examined before the lot size is known and the number of sample units exceeds the prescribed sample size for such lot, but does not equal any of the prescribed larger sample sizes, the lot may be deemed to meet or fail a specific requirement in accordance with the following procedure:
                  
                  (1) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the specific requirement) in the nonprescribed sample does not exceed the acceptance number of the next smaller sample size, the lot meets the requirement;
                  (2) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the specific requirement) in the nonprescribed sample equals the acceptance number prescribed for the next larger sample size, additional sample units shall be selected to increase the sample to the next larger prescribed sample size;
                  (3) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the specific requirement) in the nonprescribed sample exceeds the acceptance number prescribed for the next larger sample size, the lot fails the requirement.
                  (d) In the conduct of on-line in-plant inspection, sampling may be performed on a time interval basis. The sampling frequency shall be specified in an applicable grade standard or other procedural instruction approved by the Administrator.
                  (e) In the event that the lot compliance determination provisions of a standard or specification are based on the number of specified deviations instead of deviants the procedures set forth in this section may be applied by substituting the word “deviation” for the word “deviant” wherever it appears.
                  (f) Sampling plans referred to in this section are those contained in Tables I, II, III, IV, and V and (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section which follow or any other plans which are applicable. For processed products not included in these tables, the minimum sample size shall be the exact number of sample units prescribed in the table, container group, and lot size that, as determined by the inspector, most closely resembles the product, type, container, size and amount of product to be sampled. The maximum sample size in tables I, II, III, IV, V, (g)(1), (g)(2) and processed products not included in these tables is 29 sample units.
                  (g)(1) Sampling plan for dried figs. For each 10,000 pounds (or fraction of 10,000 pounds) of product—6 sample units of approximately 35 figs each accumulated into 1 composite (at least 200 figs). Each composite will be examined separately, and all must meet the requirement for the U.S. Grade.
                  (2) Sampling plan for dried fruits other than dates and figs. For each 15,000 pounds (or fraction of 15,000 pounds) of product—sample units of approximately 16 ounces each accumulated into 1 composite (at least 100 ounces) Each composite will be examined separately and all must meet the requirements for the U.S. Grade.

                  § 52.38a
                  Definitions of terms applicable to statistical sampling.
                  (a) Terms applicable to both on-line inspection and lot inspection.
                  (1) Acceptable Quality Level (AQL). The maximum percent of defective units of product or the maximum number of defects per hundred units of product which are acceptable as a process average. At the AQL's contained in the statistical sampling plans of this subpart, production has a probability of acceptance (“Pa”) of approximately 95 percent.
                  (2) Acceptance sampling. Sampling inspection in which decisions are made to accept or reject product.
                  (3) Attributes. A method of measurement whereby units of product are examined for the presence or absence of specified characteristics in each unit in the sample.
                  (4) Defect. Any nonconformance of a unit of product from specified requirements of a single quality characteristic. Defects are classed as “minor,” “major,” “severe” or “critical” depending upon the severity and undesirability of the defect.
                  (5) Defective. A unit of product that has one or more defects.
                  (6) Inspection by attributes. Inspection whereby a unit of product is classified as defective or nondefective or the number or defects in the unit of product is counted.
                  (7) Standard sample unit size. A specified amount of product to be used for inspection.

                  (b) Terms applicable to on-line inspection only.
                  
                  (1) Basic inspection period. A specified period of consecutive production designated for on-line inspection.
                  (2) Cumulative Sum Sampling (CuSum) Plan. An on-line sampling plan that accumulates the number of defects (or defectives), which exceed the sample unit tolerance (“T”), in a series of consecutive samples. Terms specific to the CuSum sampling plan are:
                  (i) Acceptance limit (“L”). The maximum accumulation of defects (or defectives) allowed to exceed the sample unit tolerance (“T”) in any sample unit or consecutive group of sample units.
                  (ii) CuSum value. The accumulated number of defects (or defectives) that exceed the sample unit tolerance (“T”).
                  (iii) Sample unit tolerance (“T”). The allowable number of defects (or defectives) in any sample unit.
                  (iv) Starting value (“S”). The initial CuSum value used to begin a CuSum sampling plan.
                  (3) On-line sampling inspection. The random selection and subsequent inspection of sample units from a production line.
                  (4) Probability of acceptance (“Pa”). The probability that a portion of production, with a given level of quality, will be accepted. In on-line sampling inspection, the probability of acceptance of any portion of production depends on the sample results obtained from the preceding portions. The probability of acceptance values associated with these procedures are the values which would be expected if a large number of sample units are to be inspected. For the CuSum plans referenced in these procedures, the probability of acceptance at the Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) is approximately 95 percent. The starting value (“S”) associated with each CuSum plan helps to make the probability of acceptance of the first portions of production of a basic inspection period as close as possible to 95 percent.
                  (c) Terms applicable to lot inspection only.
                  (1) Acceptance number. The largest number of defects (or defectives) in the sample that will permit acceptance of the inspection lot.
                  (2) Inspection lot. Any number of containers of the same size and type which contain a processed product of the same type and style, manufactured or processed under essentially the same conditions, offered for inspection and acceptance at one time.
                  (3) Probability of acceptance (“Pa”). The probability that an inspection lot, with a given level of quality, will be accepted.

                  § 52.38b
                  Statistical sampling procedures for on-line inspection by attributes of processed fruits and vegetables.
                  (a) General. The Cumulative Sum Sampling Plan, hereinafter referred to as “CuSum,” shall be used as the on-line sampling plan for attributes standards under the following conditions.
                  (1) The producer has designated the intended grade for the basic inspection period prior to the start of production.
                  (2) Inspection of the product shall be made during the basic inspection period at a point after which all product characteristics, subject to inspection, are fixed and will not be subject to change during final packaging.
                  (3) A shift to CuSum sampling plans from lot sampling plans during a basic inspection period is not permitted (or vice versa).
                  (b) Sampling rate/frequency. The minimum number of standard sample units to be drawn at random shall be determined by the applicable sampling procedure as approved by the Administrator.
                  (c) Determining CuSum values. At the beginning of the basic inspection period, the CuSum value is set equal to the starting value (“S”) for the specified CuSum plan. The CuSum value is then determined for each consecutive sample unit as follows:
                  (1) Add the number of defects (or defectives) for the present sample unit to the CuSum value of the previous sample unit.
                  (2) Subtract the sample unit tolerance (“T”).

                  (3) The CuSum value is reset in the following situations. However, determine compliance with the designated grade (see paragraph (d) of this section) prior to resetting the CuSum value:
                  (i) Reset the CuSum value to zero (0) if the CuSum value is less than zero (0).
                  (ii) Reset the CuSum value to the acceptance limit (“L”) if the CuSum value exceeds the acceptance limit (“L”).
                  (d) Determining compliance for a designated grade. (1) A portion of production meets the designated grade if the CuSum value, calculated from the sample unit representing that portion, is equal to or less than the acceptance limit (“L”) for all classes of defects.
                  (2) A portion of production fails the designated grade if the CuSum value, calculated from the sample unit representing that portion, exceeds the acceptance limit (“L”) for one or more classes of defects.
                  (e) Evaluation of production failing a designated grade. Production failing a designated grade shall be reevaluated by procedures approved by the USDA.
                  (f) Assigning a grade. (1) All similarly identified (e.g., codes, subcodes, etc.) production will be assigned the same grade.
                  (2) The grade assigned to similarly identified production will be the lowest grade assigned to any portion of that similarly identified production.
                  (g) Redesignation of producer's intended grade. If the intended grade is redesignated during a basic inspection period, a new CuSum sampling plan shall be instituted for each class of defects (or defectives).
                  (h) Cumulative Sum Sampling (CuSum) Plans for processed fruits and vegetables. (1) Tables VI through X contain the CuSum sampling plans for each of five different standard sample unit sizes. The plans within each table are listed according to increasing values of Acceptable Quality Levels (AQL's).
                  (2) AQL values of 10.0 or less may be expressed either in “defects per hundred units” or in “percent defective units.” The same sampling plans are used for both. Separate sampling plans must be used for AQL values greater than 10.0.
                  (3) These tables also provide the quality levels associated with 50 percent and 10 percent probabilities of acceptance for each of the plans. These quality levels are expressed in the same units as the corresponding AQL values.
                  (4) A separate CuSum sampling plan is chosen for each class of defects (or defectives) by first specifying the desired AQL and then selecting the appropriate standard sample unit size. The quality levels associated with 50 percent and 10 percent probabilities of acceptance may be used as guides to help determine a suitable standard sample unit size.

                  Statistical sampling procedures for lot inspection of processed fruits and vegetables by attributes.
                  (a) General. Single sampling plans shall be used as the lot sampling plan for attributes standards under either of the following conditions:
                  (1) Sampling of the product shall be made during the production period. No grade will be assigned to individual sample units. One grade determination only will be made at the end of the production period for the inspection lot.
                  (2) Sampling of the product shall be made when the inspection lot is located in a warehouse, truck, railroad car, or other similar conveyance.
                  (b) Sample size. Samples shall be randomly selected from each inspection lot in the exact number of sample units indicated for the lot size in tables XI through XIV as applicable for canned, frozen, dried, or dehydrated fruits and vegetables.

                  (c) Determining compliance. (1) An inspection lot meets the requirements of a quality grade if the number of defects (or defectives) is equal to or less than the acceptance numbers of all classes of defects.
                  (2) An inspection lot fails the requirements of a quality grade if the number of defects (or defectives) exceeds the acceptance number for one or more classes of defects.
                  (d) Lot single sampling plans for processed fruits and vegetables. (1) Tables XV through XIX contain the lot single sampling plans for each of five different standard sample unit sizes. The plans within each table are listed according to increasing values of Acceptable Quality Levels (AQL's).
                  (2) AQL values of 10.0 or less may be expressed either in “defects per hundred units” or in “percent defective units.” The same sampling plans are used for both. Separate sampling plans must be used for AQL values greater than 10.0.
                  (3) A separate lot single sampling plan is chosen for each class of defects (or defectives) by first specifying the desired AQL, the appropriate standard sample unit size, and the number of sample units as specified in § 52.38c (b) of this subpart. The quality levels associated with the Pa=50% and Pa=10% levels are given in the instructional manual.

                  Schedule of fees.
                  (a) For each calendar year, AMS will calculate the rate for services, per hour per program employee using the following formulas:
                  (1) Regular rate. The total AMS inspection program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase, plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.
                  (2) Overtime rate. The total AMS inspection program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 1.5 plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.
                  (3) Holiday rate. The total AMS inspection program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 2, plus benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.
                  (b) For each calendar year, based on previous fiscal year/historical actual costs, AMS will calculate the benefits, operating, and allowance for bad debt components of the regular, overtime and holiday rates as follows:
                  (1) Benefits rate. The total AMS inspection program direct benefits costs divided by the total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the next calendar year's percentage cost of living increase. Some examples of direct benefits are health insurance, retirement, life insurance, and Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement basic and matching contributions.
                  (2) Operating rate. The total AMS inspection program operating costs divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the percentage of inflation.
                  (3) Allowance for bad debt rate. Total AMS inspection program allowance for bad debt divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked.
                  (c) The calendar year cost of living expenses and percentage of inflation factors used in the formulas in this section are based on the most recent Office of Management and Budget's Presidential Economic Assumptions.

                  (g) Licensing and identification of certain official devices. The Administrator may issue licenses permitting the manufacture, identification, and sale of any official device designated as a USDA color standard, defect guide or other similar aid under such terms and conditions as may be specified by the Administrator. Licenses shall be available to all persons meeting conditions prescribed by the Administrator, shall be nonexclusive, and shall be recoverable for cause. No person shall manufacture, identify, distribute or sell any such official device except at the direction of or under license from the Administrator. Such official devices may be marked, tagged or otherwise designated with the prefix “USDA” together with other identifying words or symbols, as prescribed by the license.
                  (h) Prohibited uses of approved identification. Except as specified in this section, no label or advertising material used upon, or in conjunction, with a processed product, as defined by these Regulations, shall bear a brand name, trademark, product name, company name, or any other descriptive material that incorporates, resembles, simulates, or alludes to, any official U.S. Department of Agriculture certificate of quality or loading, grade mark, grade statement (except honey and maple syrup which may bear such grade mark or statement), continuous inspection mark, continuous inspection statement, sampling mark or sampling statement, or combinations of one or more thereof.
                  (i) Disposition of labels bearing approved grade or inspection marks when a contract is cancelled. Upon cancellation of a contract, labels bearing approved grade or inspection marks shall remain under the control of the inspection service. The inspection service will approve disposition of said labels for destruction, sale or transfer to another approved plant, remove or obliterate the grade or inspection mark, or other action as may be agreed upon by all interested parties.

                Liquid Media and Brix Measurements
                
                  § 52.773
                  Liquid media and Brix measurements.

                  (a) Brix measurement requirements for the liquid media in canned red tart pitted cherries are not incorporated in the grades of the finished product since sirup, or any other liquid medium, as such, is not a factor of quality for the purpose of the grades. The designation of liquid packing media and Brix measurements, where applicable, are as follows:
                  
                    
                      Designations
                      Brix measurements
                    
                    
                      “Extra heavy sirup;” or “Extra heavily sweetened fruit juice(s) and water;” or “Extra heavily sweetened fruit juice(s).”
                      28° or more but not more than 45°.
                    
                    
                      “Heavy sirup;” or “Heavily sweetened fruit juice(s) and water;” or “Heavily sweetened fruit juice(s).”
                      22° or more but less than 28°.
                    
                    
                      “Light sirup;” or “Lightly sweetened fruit juice(s) and water;” or “Lightly sweetened fruit juice(s).”
                      18° or more but less than 22.
                    
                    
                      “Slightly sweetened water;” or “Slightly sweetened fruit juice(s) and water;” or “Slightly sweetened fruit juice(s).”
                      Less than 18°.
                    
                    
                      “In water”
                      Not applicable.
                    
                    
                      “In fruit juice(s) and water.”
                        Do.
                    
                    
                      “In fruit juice(s)”
                        Do.
                    
                  
                  (b) The densities of the packing media, as listed in this section, are measured on the refractometer, expressed as percent by weight sucrose (degrees Brix) with correction for temperature to the equivalent at 20 °C. (68 °F.), but without correction for invert sugars or other substances. The Brix measurement of the packing media may be determined by any other method which gives equivalent results.
                  (c) Brix determination is made on the packing media 15 days or more after the cherries are canned or on the blended homogenized slurry of the comminuted entire contents of the container if canned for less than 15 days.
                  [39 FR 13963, Apr. 18, 1974, as amended at 41 FR 15020, Apr. 9, 1976. Redesignated at 42 FR 32514, June 27, 1977 and further redesignated at 46 FR 63203, Dec. 31, 1981]
                
              
              
                Fill of Container
                
                  § 52.774
                  Fill of container.
                  (a) FDA requirements. Canned red tart pitted cherries shall meet the fill of container requirements as set forth in the regulations of the Food and Drug Administration (21 CFR 145.125(c)).
                  (b) Recommended minimum drained weights—(1) General. The minimum drained weight recommendations for the various container sizes and types of packing media as listed in Table I of this section are not incorporated in the grades of the finished product since drained weight, as such, is not a factor of quality for the purpose of these grades.
                  (2) Definitions.
                    
                  
                  
                    Sample average—Average of all the drained weights of the sample containers representing a lot.
                    Xd—A specified minimum sample average drained weight.
                    LL—Lower limit for individual container drained weight.
                  
                  
                  (3) Method for ascertaining drained weight. The drained weight of canned red tart pitted cherries is determined by emptying the contents of the container upon a U.S. Standard No. 8 circular sieve of proper diameter containing eight meshes to the inch (0.0937 inch (2.3 mm), ±3 percent, square openings) so as to distribute the product evenly over the sieve. Without shifting the product, incline the sieve at an angle of 17° to 20° to facilitate drainage and allow to drain for two minutes. The weight of drained cherries is the weight of the sieve and product less the weight of the dry sieve. A sieve eight inches in diameter is used for No. 3 size containers (404 × 414) and smaller, and a sieve 12 inches in diameter is used for containers larger than No. 3 size containers.
                  (4) Compliance with recommended minimum drained weights. A lot of canned red tart pitted cherries is considered as meeting the minimum drained weight recommendations when the following criteria are met:

                  (i) The sample average meets the specified minimum sample average drained weight (designated as “Xd” in Table I); and
                  (ii) The number of sample containers which fail to meet the minimum drained weight for individual containers (designated as “LL” in Table I) does not exceed the applicable acceptance number specified in Table II.
                  (c) Recommended fill weights—(1) General. The minimum fill weight recommendations for the various container sizes in Table III of this section are not incorporated in the grades of the finished product since fill weight, as such, is not a factor of quality for the purpose of these grades.

                  § 52.776
                  Ascertaining the grade of a sample unit.
                  (a) General. The grade of a sample unit of canned red tart pitted cherries is ascertained by considering the factor of flavor and odor of the product and the requirement for size (in U.S. Grade A and U.S. Grade B) which are not scored; the ratings for the factors of color, freedom from pits, defects, and character, which are scored; and the limiting rules which may be applicable.
                  (b) Factors rated by score points. The relative importance of each factor which is scored is expressed numerically on the scale of 100. The maximum number of points that may be given each factor is:

                  § 52.777
                  Ascertaining the rating for the factors which are scored.
                  The essential variations within each factor which is scored are so described that the value may be ascertained for each factor and expressed numerically. The numerical range within each factor which is scored is inclusive (for example, “18 to 20 points” means 18, 19, or 20 points).
                
                
                  § 52.778
                  Color.
                  (a) (A) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that have a good color may be given a score of 18 to 20 points. “Good color” means a practically uniform color that is bright and typical of canned red tart pitted cherries which have been prepared and processed from properly ripened cherries.
                  (b) (B) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that have a reasonably good color may be given a score of 16 or 17 points. “Reasonably good color” means a reasonably uniform color, typical of canned red tart pitted cherries which have been properly prepared and processed and which color may range from a slight yellowish-red color to a slightly mottled reddish brown.
                  (c) (C) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that have a fairly good color may be given a score of 14 or 15 points. Canned red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade C, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Fairly good color” means a fairly uniform color typical of canned red tart pitted cherries which have been properly processed and which color may range from a brownish cast to mottled shades of brown.
                  (d) (SStd.) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that fail to meet the color requirements for U.S. Grade C may be given a score of 0 to 15 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).
                
                
                  § 52.779
                  Freedom from pits.
                  (a) General. The factor of freedom from pits refers to the incidence of pits and pit fragments.
                  (b) Definitions. (1) A pit, for the purposes of the allowances in this section, is a whole cherry pit or portions of pits computed as follows:
                  (i) A single piece of pit shell, whether or not within or attached to a whole cherry, that is larger than one-half pit shell is considered as one pit;
                  (ii) A single piece of pit shell, whether or not within or attached to a whole cherry, that is not larger than one-half pit shell is considered as one-half pit;
                  (iii) Pieces of pit shell, within or attached to a whole cherry, when their combined size is larger than one-half pit shell are considered as one pit; and
                  (iv) Pieces of pit shell, within or attached to a whole cherry, when their combined size is not larger than one-half pit shell are considered as one-half pit.
                  (2) Drained cherries means pitted cherries that have been drained of packing medium by the method prescribed in this subpart.
                  (c) (A) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that are practically free from pits may be given a score of 18 to 20 points. “Practically free from pits” means that the number of pits that may be present in the drained cherries does not exceed the allowances for this classification as set forth in Table IV.
                  (d) (B) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that are reasonably free from pits may be given a score of 16 or 17 points. Canned red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade B, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Reasonably free from pits” means that the number of pits that may be present does not exceed the allowances for this classification as set forth in Table IV.
                  (e) (C) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that are fairly free from pits may be given a score of 14 or 15 points. Canned red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade C, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Fairly free from pits” means that the number of pits that may be present in the drained cherries does not exceed the allowances for this classification as set forth in Table IV.
                  (f) (SStd.) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that fail to meet the requirements of U.S. Grade C may be given a score of 0 to 13 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).
                
                
                  § 52.780
                  Defects.
                  (a) General. The factor of defects refers to the degree of freedom from harmless extraneous material, mutilated cherries, and cherries blemished by scab, hail injury, discoloration, scar tissue, or by other means.
                  (1) Cherry means a whole cherry, whether or not pitted, or portions of such cherries which in the aggregate approximate the average size of the cherries.
                  (2) Harmless extraneous material means any vegetable substance (including, but not being limited to, a leaf or a stem, and any portions thereof) that is harmless.
                  (3) Mutilated cherry means a cherry that is so pitter-torn or damaged by other means that the entire pit cavity is exposed and the appearance of the cherry is seriously affected.
                  (4) Minor blemished cherry means any cherry blemished with skin discoloration (other than scald) having an aggregate area of a circle 9/32 inch (7 mm) or less in diameter which more than slightly affects the appearance of the cherry but does not extend into the fruit tissue.
                  (5) Blemished cherry means any cherry blemished by skin discoloration (other than scald) which in the aggregate exceeds the area of a circle 9/32 inch (7 mm) in diameter. A cherry affected by skin discoloration extending into the fruit tissue or by scab, hail injury, scar tissue, or other abnormality, regardless of size, is considered a blemished cherry.
                  (b) (A) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that are practically free from defects may be given a score of 27 to 30 points. “Practically free from defects” means that the number of defects that may be present does not exceed the number specified for the type of defects in Table IV.
                  (c) (B) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that are reasonably free from defects may be given a score of 24 to 26 points. Canned red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification may not be graded above U.S. Grade B, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Reasonably free from defects” means that the number of defects that may be present does not exceed the number specified for the type of defects in Table IV.
                  (d) (C) classification. If the canned red tart pitted cherries are fairly free from defects, a score of 21 to 23 points may be given. Canned red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade C, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Fairly free from defects” means that the number of defects that may be present does not exceed the number specified for the type of defects in Table IV.
                  (e) (SStd.) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that fail to meet the requirements for Grade C for any reason may be given a score of 0 to 20 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).
                
                
                  § 52.781
                  Character.
                  (a) General. The factor of character refers to the physical characteristics of the flesh of the cherries.
                  (b) (A) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that have a good character may be given a score of 27 to 30 points. “Good character” means that the cherries are thick-fleshed and have a firm, tender texture.
                  (c) (B) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that have a reasonably good character may be given a score of 24 to 26 points. Canned red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade B, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Reasonably good character” means that the cherries may be reasonably thick-fleshed and may be slightly soft.
                  (d) (C) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that have a fairly good character may be given a score of 21 to 23 points. Canned red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade C, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Fairly good character” means that the cherries may be thin-fleshed, and may be soft but not mushy, or slightly tough but not leathery.
                  (e) (SStd.) classification. Canned red tart pitted cherries that fail to meet the requirements for U.S. Grade C may be given a score of 0 to 20 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).

                  § 52.803
                  Sample unit size.
                  Compliance with requirements for size and the various quality factors is based on the following sample unit sizes for the applicable factor:
                  (a) Pits, character, and harmless extraneous material—20 ounces of drained cherries.
                  (b) Size, color, and defects (other than harmless extraneous material)—100 cherries.

                  Ascertaining the grade of a sample unit.
                  (a) The grade of frozen red tart pitted cherries is determined immediately after thawing to the extent that the cherries may be separated easily and the cherries are free from ice and solidified packing media. The grade is determined by considering in addition to the requirements of the respective grade (including the requirement of the size in U.S. Grade A and U.S. Grade B), the respective ratings of the factors of color, pits, absence of defects, character, the total score, and the limiting rules which may be applicable.
                  (b) The relative importance of each factor is expressed numerically on a scale of 100. The maximum number of points that may be given each factor is:

                  (c) Normal flavor means that the flavor is characteristic of frozen red tart pitted cherries and that the product is free from objectionable flavors of any kind.
                
                
                  § 52.805
                  Ascertaining the rating for each factor.
                  The essential variations within each factor are so described that the value may be ascertained for each factor and expressed numerically. The numerical range for the rating of each factor is inclusive (for example, “27 to 30 points” means 27, 28, 29 or 30 points).
                
                
                  § 52.806
                  Color.
                  (a) (A) classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that possess a good red color may be given a score of 27 to 30 points. “Good red color” means that the frozen cherries possess a color that is bright and typical of properly ripened cherries and that is practically uniform in that the number of cherries that vary markedly from this color due to oxidation, improper processing, or other causes, or that are undercolored, does not exceed the number specified in Table I.
                  (b) (B) classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that possess a reasonably good red color may be given a score of 24 to 26 points. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade B, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Reasonably good red color” means that the cherries possess a color that is reasonably bright and typical of properly ripened cherries and that is reasonably uniform in that the number of cherries that vary markedly from this color due to oxidation, improper processing, or other causes, or that are undercolored, does not exceed the number specified in Table I.
                  (c) (C) classification. If the frozen red tart pitted cherries possess a fairly good red color, a score of 21 to 23 points may be given. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade C, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Fairly good red color” means that the frozen cherries possess a color that is fairly bright and typical of properly ripened cherries and that is fairly uniform in that the number of cherries that vary markedly from this color due to oxidation, improper processing, or other causes, or that are undercolored, does not exceed the number specified in Table I.
                  (d) (SStd.) classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that fail to meet the requirements of U.S. Grade C may be given a score of 0 to 20 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).
                
                
                  § 52.807
                  Freedom from pits.
                  (a) General. The factor of freedom from pits refers to the incidence of pits and pit fragments.
                  (b) Definitions. (1) A “pit” for the purpose of the allowances in this subpart is a whole pit or portions of pits computed as follows:
                  (i) A single piece of pit shell, whether or not within or attached to a whole cherry, that is larger than one-half pit shell is considered as one pit;
                  (ii) A single piece of pit shell, whether or not within or attached to a whole cherry, that is not larger than one-half pit shell is considered as one-half pit;
                  (iii) Pieces of pit shell, within or attached to a whole cherry, when their combined size is larger than one-half pit shell are considered as one pit; and
                  (iv) Pieces of pit shell, within or attached to a whole cherry, when their combined size is not larger than one-half pit shell are considered as one-half pit.
                  (2) Drained cherries means pitted cherries that are substantially free from any adhering sirup, sugar, or other packing medium.
                  (c) (A) classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that are practically free from pits may be given a score of 18 to 20 points. “Practically free from pits” means that the number of pits that may be present does not exceed the allowances for this classification specified in Table I.
                  (d) (B) classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that are reasonably free from pits may be given a score of 16 or 17 points. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade B, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Reasonably free from pits” means that the number of pits that may be present does not exceed the number specified in Table I.
                  (e) (C) classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that are fairly free from pits may be given a score of 14 or 15 points. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade C, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Fairly free from pits” means that the number of pits that may be present does not exceed the number specified in Table I.
                  (f) (SStd.) classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that fail to meet the requirements for U.S. Grade C may be given a score of 0 to 13 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).
                
                
                  § 52.808
                  Freedom from defects.
                  (a) General. The factor of freedom from defects refers to the degree of freedom from harmless extraneous material, mutilated cherries, and cherries blemished by scab, hail injury, discoloration, scar tissue, or by other means.
                  (1) Cherry means a whole cherry, whether or not pitted, or portions of such cherries which in the aggregate approximate the average size of the cherries.
                  (2) Harmless extraneous material means any vegetable substance (including, but not being limited to, a leaf or a stem and any portions thereof) that is harmless.
                  (3) Mutilated cherry means a cherry that is so pitter-torn or damaged by other means that the entire pit cavity is exposed and the appearance of the cherry is seriously affected.
                  (4) Minor blemished cherry means any cherry blemished with discoloration (other than scald) having an aggregate area of a circle 9/32 inch (7 mm) or less in diameter which more than slightly affects the appearance of the cherry but does not extend into the fruit tissue.
                  (5) Blemished cherry means any cherry blemished by skin discoloration (other than scald) which in the aggregate exceeds the area of a circle 9/32 inch (7 mm) in diameter. A cherry affected by skin discoloration extending into the fruit tissue or by scab, hail injury, scar tissue, or other abnormality, regardless of size, is considered a blemished cherry.
                  (b) (A) classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that are practically free from defects may be given a score of 18 to 20 points. “Practically free from defects” means that the number of defects that may be present does not exceed the number specified for the applicable type of defect in Table I.
                  (c) (B) classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that are reasonably free from defects may be given a score of 16 or 17 points. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade B, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Reasonably free from defects” means that the number of defects that may be present does not exceed the number specified for the applicable type of defect in Table I.
                  (d) (C) classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that are fairly free from defects may be given a score of 14 or 15 points. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade C, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Fairly free from defects” means that the number of defects that may be present does not exceed the number specified for the applicable type of defect in Table I.
                  (e) (SStd.) classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that fail to meet the requirements for Grade C may be given a score of 0 to 13 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).
                
                
                  § 52.809
                  Character.
                  (a) General. The factor of character refers to the physical characteristics of the flesh of the cherries.
                  (b) (A) classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that have a good character may be given a score of 27 to 30 points. “Good character” means that the cherries are thick-fleshed and have a firm, tender texture.
                  (c) (B) classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that have a reasonably good character may be given a score of 24 to 26 points. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade B, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Reasonably good character” means that the cherries may be reasonably thick-fleshed and slightly soft.
                  (d) (C) classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that have a fairly good character may be given a score of 21 to 23 points. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade C, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Fairly good character” means that the cherries may be thin-fleshed and may be soft but not mushy, or slightly tough but not leathery.
                  (e) (SStd.) classification. Frozen red tart pitted cherries that fail to meet the requirements for Grade C may be given a score of 0 to 20 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).

                  Product description.
                  Dates are the properly cured fresh fruit of the date tree (Phoenix dactylifera) which may or may not be softened by hydration. For the purposes of the standards in this subpart, dates, when referred to as “dry dates for processing,” means that the dates are dry and have not been softened by hydration.
                
                
                  § 52.1002
                  Styles of dates.
                  (a) Whole or whole dates means whole unpitted dates from which the pits have not been removed and which may be slit longitudinally.
                  (b) Pitted or pitted dates means whole dates from which the pits have been removed.
                  (c) Pieces or date pieces means dates that have been cut or sliced into small pieces and that can be handled as individual units.
                  (d) Macerated or macerated dates means dates that have been ground, chopped, mashed, or broken or that have been cut or sliced into small pieces and that cannot be handled as individual units.
                
                
                  § 52.1003
                  Grades of dates.
                  (a) U.S. Grade A or U.S. Fancy is the quality of whole or pitted dates that are of one variety, that possess a good color, that are practically uniform in size, that are practically free from defects, that possess a good character, and that score not less than 90 points when scored in accordance with the scoring system outlined in this subpart.
                  (b) U.S. Grade B or U.S. Choice is the quality of whole or pitted dates other than whole dry dates for processing that are of one variety, that possess a reasonably good color, that are reasonably uniform in size, that are reasonably free from defects, that possess a reasonably good character, and that score not less than 80 points when scored in accordance with the scoring system outlined in this subpart.
                  (c) U.S. Grade B (Dry) or U.S. Choice (Dry) is the quality of whole dry dates for processing that are of one variety, that possess a reasonably good color, that are reasonably uniform in size, that are reasonably free from defects, that possess a reasonably good character, and that score not less than 80 points when scored in accordance with the scoring system outlined in this subpart.
                  (d) U.S. Grade C or U.S. Stand- ard is the quality of whole or pitted dates other than whole dry dates for processing that are of one variety or of date pieces or macerated dates that possess a fairly good color, that are fairly uniform in size except for date pieces or macerated dates, that are fairly free from defects, that possess a fairly good character, and that score not less than 70 points when scored in accordance with the scoring system outlined in this subpart.
                  (e) U.S. Grade C (Dry) or U.S. Standard (Dry) is the quality of whole dry dates for processing that are of one variety, that possess a fairly good color, that are fairly uniform in size, that are fairly free from defects, that possess a fairly good character, and that score not less than 70 points when scored in accordance with the scoring system outlined in this subpart.
                  (f) Substandard is the quality of dates that fail to meet the requirements of U.S. Grade C or U.S. Stand- ard or U.S. Grade C (Dry) or U.S. Standard (Dry), whichever is applicable.

                  Ascertaining the grade.
                  In addition to considering other requirements outlined in the standards, the following quality factors are evaluated:
                  (a) Factor not related by score points. (1) Varietal requirement.
                  (b) Factors rated by score points. The relative importance of each factor which is scored is expressed numerically on the scale of 100. The maximum number of points that may be given such factors are:

                  Ascertaining the rating for the factors which are scored.
                  The essential variations within each factor which is scored are so described that the value may be ascertained for each factor and expressed numerically. The numerical range within each factor which is scored is inclusive (for example, “18 to 20 points” means 18, 19, or 20 points).
                
                
                  § 52.1006
                  Color.
                  (a) (A) classification. Whole or pitted dates that possess a good color may be given a score of 18 to 20 points. “Good color” means that the color of the dates is practically uniform; and, with respect to dates that are predominantly light amber in color, there may be not more than 5 percent by count of dates that are dark amber in color; and, with respect to dates that are predominantly dark amber in color, there may be not more than 5 percent by count of dates that are light amber in color.
                  (b) (B) classification. If the whole or pitted dates or whole dry dates for processing possess a reasonably good color, a score of 16 or 17 points may be given. Dates that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade B or U.S. Choice or U.S. Grade B (Dry) or U.S. Choice (Dry), whichever is applicable, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Reasonably good color” means that the color of the whole or pitted dates or whole dry dates for processing is reasonably uniform for the type; and, with respect to dates that are predominantly light amber in color, there may be not more than 10 percent by count of dates that are dark amber in color; and, with respect to dates that are predominantly dark amber in color, there may be not more than 10 percent by count of dates that are light amber in color.
                  (c) (C) classification. If the whole or pitted dates, whole dry dates for processing, date pieces, or macerated dates possess a fairly good color, a score of 14 or 15 points may be given. Dates that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade C or U.S. Standard or U.S. Grade C (Dry) or U.S. Standard (Dry), whichever is applicable, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Fairly good color” has the following meanings with respect to the following styles:
                  (1) Whole; pitted. The color of the whole or pitted dates or whole dry dates for processing is fairly uniform for the type; and, with respect to dates that are predominantly light amber in color, there may be not more than 20 percent by count of dates that are dark amber in color; and, with respect to dates that are predominantly dark amber in color, there may be not more than 20 percent by count of dates that are light amber in color.
                  (2) Pieces; macerated. The color may be variable throughout the units or mass, may be slightly dull but not off-color, and is typical of properly prepared dates of these styles.
                  (d) (SStd) classification. Dates that fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section may be given a score of 0 to 13 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).
                
                
                  § 52.1007
                  Uniformity of size.
                  (a) General. The factor of uniformity of size applies only to whole and pitted styles. The factor of uniformity of size in the styles of date pieces and macerated dates is not based on any detailed requirements and is not scored; the other three factors (color, absence of defects, and character is applicable) are scored and the total is multiplied by 100 and divided by 90, dropping any fractions to determine the total score.
                  (b) (A) classification. Whole or pitted dates that are practically uniform in size may be given a score of 9 or 10 points. “Practically uniform in size” means that not more than a total of 10 percent, by weight, of the whole or pitted dates may be conspicuously larger or smaller than the approximate average size of the dates in the container.
                  
                  (c) (B) classification. If the whole or pitted dates or whole dry dates for processing are reasonably uniform in size, a score of 8 points may be given. Dates that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade B or U.S. Choice or U.S. Grade B (Dry) or U.S. Choice (Dry), whichever is applicable, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Reasonably uniform in size” means that not more than a total of 15 percent, by weight, of the whole or pitted dates may be conspicuously larger or smaller than the approximate average size of the dates in the container.
                  (d) (C) classification. If the whole or pitted dates or whole dry dates for processing are fairly uniform in size, a score of 7 points may be given. Dates that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade C or U.S. Standard or U.S. Grade C (Dry) or U.S. Standard (Dry), whichever is applicable, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Fairly uniform in size” means that not more than a total of 20 percent, by weight, of the whole or pitted dates may be conspicuously larger or smaller than the approximate average size of the dates in the container.
                  (e) (SStd) classification. Whole or pitted dates or whole dry dates for processing that fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section may be given a score of 0 to 6 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).
                
                
                  § 52.1008
                  Absence of defects.
                  (a) Definitions of defects. Unless otherwise stated specifically, the following definitions of defects or defective units apply only to whole or pitted dates or whole dry dates for processing, as applicable for the type:
                  (1) Damaged by discoloration is the presence of a dark area in the flesh of the date, which dark area is visible through the skin and is more than one-fourth (1/4) inch in width and extends more than the equivalent of half the length of the date, such darkening being of natural origin and not caused by mold or other organism.
                  (2) Damaged by broken skin is any rupture of the skin in a manner to expose the flesh of the date, the short- est dimension of such exposed area being not less than three-sixteenths (3/16) inch.
                  (3) Damaged by checking is the presence of fine lines, resulting from water injury, affecting the surface of the skin over an area not less than one-fourth of the total surface of the date.
                  (4) Seriously damaged by checking is the presence of heavy lines, resulting from water injury, seriously affecting the surface of the skin over an area not less than one-fourth of the total surface of the date.
                  (5) Damaged by deformity is any abnormal shape sufficient to produce an appearance discernibly at variance with the normal shape that is typical of the variety.
                  (6) Damaged by puffiness is the condition of a date of which the skin is soft and pliable and from which the skin is separated from the flesh in a balloon-like fashion, over an area not less than one-half of the total surface of the date. Soft skins which have returned and adhere to the flesh of the date are not considered “damaged by puffiness.”
                  (7) Seriously damaged by puffiness is the condition of a date of which the skin is dry, hard, and brittle and from which the skin is separated from the flesh over an area not less than one-half of the total surface of the date.
                  (8) Damaged by scars are any blemishes that affect the exterior of the date and which are not less than three-sixteenths (3/16) inch in the shortest dimension.
                  (9) Damaged by sunburn is an area, usually light in color, scarred by the heat of the sun, such area being not less than three-sixteenths (3/16) inch in the shortest dimension.
                  (10) Damaged by insect injury is any blemish, resulting from the activity of insects or mites, distributed over an area of not less than one-fourth of the total surface of the date or any similar blemish that materially affects the appearance or edibility of the unit, regardless of the area affected.
                  (11) Damaged by improper hydrating means that the date has been injured by excessive heat or that the hydrating process is incomplete.
                  (12) Damaged by mashing means any physical injury to the flesh and skin of the date leaving the date partially mangled but otherwise whole.
                  (13) Damaged by mechanical injury means excessive trimming or similar injury that damages the appearance or that damages or affects the eating quality of the whole date.
                  (14) Damaged by lack of pollination means, with respect to whole dates, that pollination of the date was not accomplished, such condition being manifested by the absence of a pit in the whole dates or by thin, immature appearance of the date.
                  (15) Damaged by blacknose is severe checking in which the flesh becomes dark, crusty, and dry and which severe checking affects an area greater than one-eighth of the total surface of the date.
                  (16) Damaged by side spot means a very dark area, which generally is circular in appearance, extending into the flesh of the date, and, when decayed tissue or mold is not present, affecting in the aggregate an area not less than the area of a circle three-sixteenths (3/16) inch in diameter.
                  (17) Damaged by black scald means the collapse, death, and blackening of the flesh along the side of the date, usually accompanied by a bitter taste in the affected area.
                  (18) Damage by improper ripening means pronounced evidence of “green shrivel” of the date or that the date possesses a puffy flesh or a decidedly rubbery texture resulting from failure of the tissue of the date to reach a desirable state of maturity due to climatic or cultural injury, or both.
                  (19) Damaged by other defects means any injury or defect or group of defects not defined in this section (such as, but not limited to, heavy sugaring, and excessive scars not described in the definition “damaged by scars,”) which materially affect the appearance, edibility, or keeping quality of the dates.
                  (20) Affected by scouring is evidenced by the breakdown of the sugars into alcohol and acetic acid by yeasts and bacteria.
                  (21) Affected by mold is the presence of visible mold.
                  (22) Affected by dirt is the presence of any quantity of such substance.
                  (23) Affected by insect infestation is the presence of dead insects, insect parts, or excreta. (No live insects are permitted.)
                  (24) Affected by foreign material is the presence of any quantity of such substance.
                  (25) Affected by decay is a state of decomposition.
                  (b) (A) classification. Whole or pitted dates that are practically free from defects may be given a score of 27 to 30 points. “Practically free from defects” means that in pitted dates there may be present not more than one whole pit or two pit fragments for each 25 ounces of pitted dates; and that the whole or pitted dates do not exceed the total allowances and limitations shown in Chart I of this subpart.
                  (c) (B) classification. If the whole or pitted dates or whole dry dates for processing are reasonably free from defects, a score of 24 to 26 points may be given. Dates that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade B or U.S. Choice or U.S. Grade B (Dry) or U.S. Choice (Dry), whichever is applicable, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Reasonably free from defects” means that in pitted dates there may be present not more than one whole pit or two pit fragments for each 25 ounces of pitted dates; and that the whole or pitted dates or whole dry dates for processing do not exceed the total allowances and limitations shown in Chart II of this subpart.
                  (d) (C) classification. If the whole or pitted dates, whole dry dates for processing, date pieces, or macerated dates are fairly free from defects, a score of 21 to 23 points may be given. Dates that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade C or U.S. Standard or U.S. Grade C (Dry) or U.S. Standard (Dry), whichever is applicable, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Fairly free from defects” has the following meanings with respect to the following styles:
                  (1) Whole. The defects or defective units in whole dates or whole dry dates for processing do not exceed the total allowances and limitations shown in Chart III of this subpart.
                  
                  (2) Pitted. Not more than one whole pit or two pit fragments for each 25 ounces of pitted dates may be present; and the defects or defective units in pitted dates do not exceed the total allowances and limitations shown in Chart III of this subpart.
                  (3) Pieces; macerated. Not more than one whole pit or two pit fragments for each 25 ounces of pitted dates may be present; and the units or mass consists of clean and sound date material, fairly free from defects that seriously affect the appearance, edibility, or keeping quality of the product.
                  (e) (SStd) classification. Dates that fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section may be given a score of 0 to 20 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).

                  Character.
                  (a) (A) classification. Whole or pitted dates that possess a good character may be given a score of 36 to 40 points. “Good character” means that not less than 75 percent, by weight, of the dates are well developed, well fleshed, and soft, or at the time of packing are in a state of ripeness that within 15 days will develop into such character; and the remainder may possess a reasonably good character including not more than a total of 2 percent, by weight, of the dates that may possess semi-dry calyx ends and none may possess dry calyx ends.
                  (b) (B) classification. If the whole or pitted dates or whole dry dates for processing possess a reasonably good character, a score of 32 to 35 points may be given. Dates that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade B or U.S. Choice or U.S. Grade B (Dry) or U.S. Choice (Dry), whichever is applicable, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).
                  

                  (1) “Reasonably good character” with respect to whole or pitted dates other than whole dry dates for processing means that the dates are pliable; that not less than 75 percent, by weight, of the dates are reasonably well developed and reasonably well fleshed, or at time of packing are in a state of ripeness that within 15 days will develop into such character and the remainder may possess a fairly good character including not more than 10 percent, by weight, of the dates that may possess semi-dry calyx ends and dry calyx ends: Provided, That not more than 2 percent, by weight, of the dates may possess dry calyx ends.
                  (2) “Reasonably good character” with respect to whole dry dates for processing means that the dates may be firm and dry; that not less than 75 percent, by weight, of the dates are reasonably well developed and reasonably well fleshed and that the remainder are fairly well developed and fairly well fleshed.
                  (c) (C) classification. If the whole or pitted dates, whole dry dates for processing, date pieces, or macerated dates possess a fairly good character, a score of 28 to 31 points may be given. Dates that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade C or U.S. Standard or U.S. Grade C (Dry) or U.S. Standard (Dry), whichever is applicable, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Fairly good character” has the following meanings with respect to the following styles:
                  (1) Whole; pitted. (i) In whole or pitted dates other than whole dry dates for processing the dates may be firm but are pliable; may possess semi-dry calyx ends; and not less than 80 percent, by weight, of the dates are fairly well developed and are fairly well fleshed, or at time of packing are in a state of ripeness that within 15 days will develop into such character and the remainder may fail to possess such fairly good character or may possess dry calyx ends.
                  (ii) In whole dry dates for processing the dates may be firm and dry but are fairly well developed and fairly well fleshed.
                  (2) Pieces; macerated. The character may be variable throughout the units or mass but not seriously affected by dry calyx end material or inedible portions of dates.
                  (d) (SStd) classification. Dates that fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section may be given a score of 0 to 27 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).

                Definition of terms.
                (a) Capstems means small woody stems exceeding 1/8-inch in length which attach the raisins to the branches of the bunch.
                (b) A piece of stem means a portion of the branch or main stem.
                (c) Seeds refers to whole, fully developed seeds which have not been removed during the processing of seeded raisins with seeds.
                (d) Damaged raisins means raisins affected by sunburn, scars, insect injury, mechanical injury, or other similar means which seriously affect the appearance, edibility, keeping quality, or shipping quality of the raisins. In seeded Raisins with Seeds, mechanical injury resulting from normal seeding operations is not considered damage.
                (e) Sugared means either external or internal sugar crystals are present and the accumulation of such crystallized fruit sugars in the flesh or on the surface of the raisins is readily apparent.
                (f) Grit, sand, or silt means any particle or earthy material.
                (g) Moisture means the percentage by weight of the processed raisins, exclusive of branch and heavy stem material, that is moisture when determined by the “Dried Fruit Moisture Tester Method” or in accordance with other methods that give equivalent results.
                (h) Slightly discolored means a raisin affected by a brown to dark brown discolored area around the capstem end of the raisin that is less than the area of a circle 1/8-inch in diameter.
                (i) Discolored means a raisin affected by a brown to dark brown discolored area around the capstem end of the raisin that equals or exceeds the area of a circle 1/8-inch in diameter; Provided, That the overall appearance, keeping quality, and edibility of the product are not seriously affected.
                (j) Well-matured means raisins that are full-fleshed, may have fine wrinkles and are rounded in appearance.
                (k) Reasonably well-matured means raisins that are reasonably full-fleshed and may have shallow wrinkles with thick edged ridges.
                (l) Fairly well-matured means raisins that are thin-fleshed and angular in appearance.
                (m) Substandard development means raisins that are practically lacking in flesh.
                (n) Undeveloped refers to extremely light berries that are lacking in sugary tissue indicating incomplete development; are reddish in color; are completely shriveled; have fine wrinkles on smaller units and moderately deep wrinkles on slightly larger units; and are commonly referred to as “worthless.”

                  § 52.1847
                  Colors of golden seedless raisins.
                  The color of Golden Seedless Raisins is not a factor of quality for the purpose of these grades. The color requirements applicable to the respective color designations are as follows:
                  (a) “Well colored” means that the raisins are practically uniform in color and may range from yellow or golden to light amber color with a predominating yellow or golden color and that not more than 1/2 of 1 percent, by weight, of all the raisins may be definitely dark berries.
                  (b) “Reasonably well colored” means that the raisins are reasonably uniform in color and may range from yellow or golden or greenish yellow to light amber wherein the predominating color may be greenish yellow or light amber and that not more than 3 percent, by weight, of all the raisins may be definitely dark berries.
                  (c) “Fairly well colored” means that the raisins are fairly uniform in color and may range from yellow or greenish yellow to amber or light greenish amber and that not more than 6 percent, by weight, of all the raisins may be definitely dark berries.
                  (d) “Colored” means that the raisins may be variable in color and may range from yellowish green to dark amber or dark greenish amber; that not more than 20 percent, by weight, of all the raisins may be definitely dark berries.
                  (e) “Definitely dark berries” means raisins which are definitely darker than dark amber and characteristic of naturally “raisined” grapes.

                  The sizes of Raisins with Seeds—except for Layer or Cluster Raisins with Seeds, are not incorporated in the grades of the finished product since size, as such, is not a factor of quality for the purposes of these grades. The common size designations and measurement requirements applicable thereto include, but are not limited to, the following:
                  (a) Seeded. (1) Select size raisins means that not more than 70 percent, by weight, of the raisins will pass through round perforations 34/64-inch in diameter; and not more than 5 percent, by weight, of the raisins will pass through round perforations 22/64-inch in diameter.
                  (2) Small size raisins means that all of the raisins will pass through round perforations 34/64-inch in diameter and not less than 90 percent, by weight, of all the raisins will pass through round perforations 22/64-inch in diameter.
                  (3) Mixed size raisins means a mixture does not meet either the requirements for “select” size or for “small” size.
                  (b) Unseeded. (1) 4 Crown means raisins that will not pass through round perforations 42/64-inch in diameter.
                  (2) 3 Crown means raisins that will pass through round perforations 42/64-inch in diameter but will not pass through round perforations 34/64-inch in diameter.
                  (3) 2 Crown means raisins that will pass through round perforations 34/64-inch in diameter but will not pass through round perforations 24/64-inch in diameter.
                  (4) 1 Crown means raisins that will pass through round perforations 24/64-inch in diameter.

                  The size of Layer or Cluster Raisins with Seeds is incorporated in the grades of the finished product. The size designation and measurement as applicable to layer or cluster raisins with seeds are:
                  (a) 3 Crown size or larger. “3 Crown size or larger” in Layer or Cluster Raisins with Seeds means that the raisins, exclusive of stems and branches, are such a size that they will not pass through round perforations 34/64-inch in diameter.

                  Dried prunes are prepared from sound, properly matured prune plums from which the greater portion of moisture is removed by drying. The dried prunes are cleaned to assure a wholesome product; they may be treated with water or steam; and a safe and suitable preservative may be added.

                  Count-sizes of whole unpitted dried prunes.
                  (a) Count-sizes. Except for U.S. Grade A or U.S. Fancy, the count-sizes of dried prunes are not incorporated in the grades of dried prunes. The count-sizes of dried prunes in this subpart refer to the count (or number) of prunes per pound of dried prunes. The various sizes of dried prunes for the respective varietal types are commonly designated as follows, but may be designated by other numerical expressions:
                  (1) Type I; Type IV. 30/40, 40/50, 50/60, 60/70, 70/80, 80/90, 90/100, 100/120, 120 and over.
                  (2) Type II. 25/35, 35/45, 30/40, 40/50, 50/60, 60/70, 70/80, 80/90, 90/100.
                  (3) Type III. 15/20, 18/24, 20/30, 30/40, 40/50, 50/60, 60/70.

                  Grades of dried prunes.
                  (a) “U.S. Grade A” or “U.S. Fancy” is the quality of dried prunes that, except for mixed types, possess similar varietal characteristics; that are fairly uniform in size and average 85 prunes or less per pound; that meet the applicable moisture limits in Table IV of this subpart but regardless of size and kind of packaging are reasonably uniform in moisture; and that do not exceed the total allowances and limitations for defects shown in Table I of this subpart.
                  (b) “U.S. Grade B” or “U.S. Choice” is the quality of dried prunes that, except for mixed types, possess similar varietal characteristics; that are fairly uniform in size; that meet the applicable moisture limits in Table IV of this subpart but regardless of size and kind of packaging are reasonably uniform in moisture; and that do not exceed the total allowances and limitations for defects shown in Table II of this subpart.
                  (c) “U.S. Grade C” or “U.S. Standard” is the quality of dried prunes that, except for mixed types, possess similar varietal characteristics; that are fairly uniform in size; that meet the applicable moisture limits in Table IV of this subpart but regardless of size and kind of packaging are reasonably uniform in moisture; and that do not exceed the total allowances and limitations for defects shown in Table III of this subpart

                  (d) “Substandard” is the quality of dried prunes that meet the applicable moisture limits in Table IV of this subpart but regardless of size and kind of packaging are reasonably uniform in moisture; and that may fail to meet other requirements for U.S. Grade C or U.S. Standard, but not more than 5 percent, by weight, of the dried prunes may be affected by mold, dirt, foreign material, insect infestation, or decay: Provided, That not more than 1 percent, by weight, of the dried prunes may be affected by decay.

                  § 52.3185
                  Moisture limits.
                  Dried prunes shall not exceed the moisture limits for the applicable grades and kind and size of packaging as designated in Table IV of this subpart except there is no moisture limit when safe and suitable preservatives have been added. “Moisture” means the percentage by weight of the finished dried prunes, exclusive of pits, that is moisture when determined by the Dried Fruit Moisture Tester Method or in accordance with methods that give equivalent results. The moisture limits in Table IV apply only to so-called “bulk packs” of dried prunes packaged in non-hermetically sealed containers holding 10 pounds or more of dried prunes when safe and suitable preservatives have not been added. Such containers include, but are not limited to, wood boxes or fiber boxes.

                  § 52.3186
                  Definitions for uniformity of size.
                  (a) Fairly uniform in size. “Fairly uniform in size” means that in a sample of 100 ounces:
                  (1) For prunes that average 53 prunes or less per pound, the count per pound of 10 ounces of the smallest prunes does not vary from the count per pound of 10 ounces of the largest prunes by more than 25 points; or
                  (2) For prunes that average 54 prunes or more per pound, the count per pound of 10 ounces of the smallest prunes does not vary from the count per pound of 10 ounces of the largest prunes by more than 45 points.
                
                
                  § 52.3187
                  Definitions and explanations of defects.
                  Dried prunes damaged or affected by the following are scorable as defects:
                  (a) Off-color. “Off-color” means a skin color different from characteristic black, blue-black, reddish-purple, or other characteristic skin color for the type.
                  (b) Poor texture. “Poor texture” means porous, woody, or fibrous flesh or immature prunes or prunes possessing flesh interspersed with excessive air pockets in which the texture of the flesh is noticeably different from the flesh of mature prunes which have been properly dried, handled, and processed. “Excessive air pockets” means that the prunes are affected by air pockets to the extent that the appearance and eating quality is seriously affected.
                  (c) End cracks. “End cracks” means callous apex-end cracks which, singly or in the aggregate on a prune, are more than 3/8 inch in length but not more than 1/2 inch in length.
                  (d) Skin or flesh damage. “Skin or flesh damage” in the case of “Whole Unpitted” style means:
                  (1) Callous growth cracks (other than callous apex-end cracks) which, singly or in the aggregate on a prune, exceed 3/8 inch in length; and callous apex-end cracks which, singly or in the aggregate on a prune, exceed 1/2 inch in length.
                  (2) Splits or skin breaks not having callous edges when the flesh is mashed out beyond the protecting skin so as to affect materially the normal appearance of the prune;
                  (3) Any cracks, splits, or skin breaks open to the pit;
                  (4) Any skin damage from multiple short skin breaks giving a very “rough” appearance to the prune such as may result from over-dipping, rain damage, processing, or other causes which in Type I dried prunes affect materially the appearance or edibility of the prune, or which in other types or other mixtures affect markedly the appearance or edibility of the prune.
                  (e) Fermentation. “Fermentation” means that the prune is fermented as evidenced by a distinct sour taste or odor or by darkening in color characteristic of fermentation or souring.
                  (f) Scars. “Scars” mean:
                  (1) Tough or thick scab which, singly or in combination on a prune, exceeds the area of a circle 3/8 inch in diameter such as may result from thrip injury, mildew, leaf chafing, limb rubs, or other means; or
                  (2) Scab which is not tough or thick and which, singly or in combination on a prune, exceeds the area of a circle 3/4 inch in diameter and which is inconsequential but unsightly though practically blending in color with the skin on the portion of the prune not affected.
                  (g) Heat damage. “Heat damage” means burning or scorching from the sun or in dehydration so as to damage materially the skin or flesh, or both, of the prune.
                  (h) Insect injury. “Insect injury” means healed or unhealed surface blemishes and healed or unhealed blemishes extending into the flesh which affect materially the appearance, edibility, or keeping quality of the prune but which do not possess evidence of insect infestation.
                  (i) Other means. “Other means” includes damage by any injury or defect or group of defects not specifically mentioned in this section which materially affects the appearance, edibility, or keeping quality of the fruit, but “other means” does not include defects of a nature such as defined in paragraph (j), (k), (l), (m), or (n) of this section.
                  (j) Mold. “Mold” means a characteristic fungus growth as evidenced by a moldy or smutty condition and which, singly or in the aggregate on a prune, is equal to or exceeds the area of a circle 3/16 inch in diameter.
                  (k) Dirt. “Dirt” means the presence of any quantity of such substance, whether imbedded or adhering to the prune, which gives the prune a dirty, smudgy appearance and which may not be removed readily by washing.
                  (l) Foreign material. “Foreign material” means leaves, twigs, pieces of wood, and similar extraneous materials which are objectionable.
                  (m) Insect infestation. “Insect infestation” means the presence of dead insects, insect fragments, or insect remains. (No live insects are permitted).
                  (n) Decay. “Decay” means a state of decomposition, wholly or in part, of the prune.

                  § 52.3751
                  Product description.
                  Canned ripe olives are prepared from properly matured olives which have first been properly treated to remove the characteristic bitterness; are packed in a solution of sodium chloride, with or without spices, and are sufficiently processed by heat in hermetically sealed containers. Canned olives which are not oxidized in processing and which possess a tan to light bronze color indicative of preparation from olives of advanced maturity and commonly referred to as “tree-ripened” or “home-cured” are not covered by the standards in this subpart.
                
                
                  § 52.3752
                  Types of canned ripe olives.
                  Canned ripe olives are processed as two distinct types. Unless a specific type is stated in this subpart, “canned ripe olives” refers to olives of either “ripe-type” or “green-ripe type.”
                  (a) Ripe type. “Ripe type” olives are those which have been treated and oxidized in processing to produce a typical dark brown to black color.
                  (b) Green-ripe type. “Green-ripe type” olives are those which have not been oxidized in processing; which range in color from yellow-green; green-yellow or other greenish casts; and which may be mottled.
                
                
                  § 52.3753
                  Styles of canned ripe olives.
                  (a) Whole. “Whole” olives are those which have not been pitted.
                  (b) Pitted. “Pitted” olives are those from which pits have been removed.
                  (c) Halved. “Halved” olives are pitted olives in which each olive is cut lengthwise into two approximately equal parts.
                  (d) Segmented. “Segmented” olives are pitted olives in which each olive is cut lengthwise into three or more approximately equal parts.
                  (e) Sliced. “Sliced” olives consist of parallel slices of fairly uniform thickness prepared from pitted olives.
                  (f) Chopped. “Chopped” olives are random-size cut pieces or cut bits prepared from pitted olives.
                  (g) Broken pitted. “Broken pitted” olives consist substantially of large pieces that may have been broken in pitting but have not been sliced or cut.

                  (a) General. (1) “Average count” for canned whole ripe olives is determined from all containers in the sample and is calculated on the basis of the drained weight of the olives.
                  (2) Diameters of canned whole and pitted ripe olives are determined by measuring the smallest diameters at the largest circumferences at right angles to the longitudinal axes of the olives. The longitudinal axis is a line running from the stem to the apex of the olive.
                  (b) Size determination. Size of canned whole or pitted olives shall conform to the applicable count per pound range indicated in Table I in the case of whole olives, or conform closely to the applicable illustration in Table I in the case of pitted olives. When the count per pound of whole olives falls between two count ranges, the size designation shall be the next smaller size.

                  § 52.3755
                  Minimum drained weights.
                  (a) General. (1) The minimum drained weights for the various applicable styles in Table II and III are not incorporated in the grade of the finished product since drained weight, as such, is not a factor of quality for the purposes of these grades.
                  (2) The minimum drained weights are based on equalization of the product 30 days or more after the product has been canned.
                  (b) Method for determining drained weight. The drained weight of canned ripe olives is determined by emptying the contents of the container upon a U.S. Standard No. 8 circular sieve of proper diameter containing eight meshes to the inch (2.3 mm (0.0937 inch), ±3 percent, square openings) so as to distribute the product evenly over the sieve. Without shifting the product, incline the sieve at an angle of 17 degrees to 20 degrees to facilitate drainage and allow to drain for 2 minutes. The weight of drained olives is the weight of the sieve and product less the weight of the dry sieve. A sieve 20 mm (8 inches) in diameter is used for containers with total contents of 1.5 kg (3.3 lbs) and less, and a sieve 30 mm (12 inches) in diameter is used for containers with total contents greater than 1.5 kg (3.3 lbs).
                  (c) Compliance with minimum drained weights. A lot of canned ripe olives is considered as meeting the minimum drained weights if the following criteria are met:

                  (1) The average of the drained weights from all the sample units in the sample is equal to or greater than the acceptance value for drained weights for the size (designated as “X2” in Tables II and III); and
                  (2) There shall be no unreasonable shortage in any individual container.

                  § 52.3756
                  Grades of canned ripe olives.
                  (a) U.S. Grade A is the quality of canned ripe olives of whole, pitted, halved, segmented, sliced, and chopped styles that has a good flavor, that has a good color, that is practically free from defects, that has a good character; and that for those factors which are rated in accordance with the scoring system outlined in this subpart, the total score is not less than 90 points: Provided, That such canned ripe olives may have a reasonably good color if the total score is not less than 90 points; and further Provided, That in the styles of whole and pitted olives, the variation in diameters does not exceed 4 mm, and of the 90 percent, by count, of the most uniform in size, the diameter of the largest does not exceed the diameter of the smallest by more than 3 mm.
                  (b) U.S. Grade B is the quality of canned ripe olives of whole, pitted, halved, segmented, sliced, and chopped styles that has a good flavor, that has a reasonably good color, that is reasonably free from defects, that has a reasonably good character; and that for those factors which are rated in accordance with the scoring system outlined in this subpart, the total score is not less than 80 points: Provided, That for the styles of whole and pitted olives, the variation in diameters does not exceed 8 mm, and of the 80 percent, by count, of the most uniform in size, the diameter of the largest does not exceed the diameter of the smallest by more than 4 mm.
                  (c) U.S. Grade C is the quality of canned ripe olives of whole, pitted, halved, segmented, sliced, chopped, and broken pitted styles that has a reasonably good flavor, that has a fairly good color, that is fairly free from defects, that has a fairly good character; and that for those factors which are rated in accordance with the scoring system outlined in this subpart, the total score is not less than 70 points; Provided, That for the styles of whole and pitted olives, of the 60 percent, by count, of the most uniform in size, the diameter of the largest does not exceed the diameter of the smallest by more that 4 mm.
                  (d) Substandard is the quality of canned ripe olives of any style that fail to meet the applicable requirements for U.S. Grade C.

                  § 52.3757
                  Standard sample unit size.
                  Compliance with requirements for the various quality factors except “size designation” is based on the following standard sample unit size for the applicable style:
                  (a) Whole and pitted—50 olives.
                  (b) Halved—100 units.
                  (c) All other styles—255 g (9 ounces).
                
                
                  § 52.3758
                  Determining the grade of a sample unit.
                  (a) General. In addition to considering other requirements outlined in the standards the following quality factors are evaluated:
                  (1) Factors not rated by score points. (i) Flavor; (ii) Uniformity of size (styles of whole and pitted only).
                  (2) Factors rated by score points. The relative importance of each factor which is scored is expressed numerically on the scale of 100. The maximum number of points that may be given such factors are:

                  (b) Definition of flavor—(1) Good flavor. (i) “Good flavor” in ripe type means a distinctive flavor characteristic of ripe type olives (including that of properly spiced olives) which have been properly prepared and processed and which are free from objectionable flavors of any kind.
                  (ii) “Good Flavor” in green-ripe type means a distinctive mellow flavor characteristic of green-ripe type olives which have been properly prepared and processed and which are free from objectionable flavors of any kind.
                  (2) Reasonably good flavor. “Reasonably good flavor” in either ripe type or green-ripe type (including that of properly spiced olives) means that the flavor may be slightly lacking in distinctly characteristic flavor for the respective type but the olives are free from objectionable flavors of any kind.
                
                
                  § 52.3759
                  Determining the rating for the factors which are scored.
                  The essential variations within each factor which is scored are so described that the value may be determined for each factor and expressed numerically. The numerical range within each factor which is scored is inclusive (for example “27 to 30 points” means 27, 28, 29, and 30 points).
                
                
                  § 52.3760
                  Color.
                  (a) General. The evaluation of color shall be determined within five minutes after the olives are removed from the container and is based upon the uniformity of the exterior color or general appearance as to color of the olives within the container. The evaluation of color in “halved” style is based on the uncut surfaces.
                  (b) Color measurement of ripe type. The color of ripe type is determined by comparison with a spinning disc of variations in percentages of the following Munsell color discs: Red (5R 4/14), Yellow (2.5Y 8/12), and Black (N/1 Glossy).
                  (c) Composite color standards. Composite USDA Color Standards for Canned Ripe Olives are available and are comparable to the colors produced by the spinning discs.
                  (d) Color appearance of green-ripe type. Normal color for green-ripe type olives is yellow-green, green-yellow, or other greenish casts, any of which may have a mottled appearance that is typical of green-ripe type olives. Off-color means dark brown, dark purple or black olives.

                  (e) The USDA spinning color discs and the USDA composite color standards cited in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are available from the USDA licensed supplier:
                  
                  
                    Munsell Color Company, Inc., 2441 North Calvert Street, Baltimore, Md. 21218.
                  
                  
                  (f) Grade A. Canned ripe olives that have a good color may be given a score of 27 to 30 points. “Good color” has the following meanings with respect to the applicable type and style:
                  (1) Ripe type—(i) Whole; pitted; halved. The olives or units have a practically uniform black or dark brown color. Not less than 90 percent, by count, of the olives or units have a color equal to or darker than the appropriate USDA Composite Color Standard or that produced by spinning the Munsell discs specified in paragraph (b) of this section in the following combination: 31/2 percent Red, 31/2 percent Yellow, and 93 percent Black.
                  (ii) Segmented; sliced, chopped. The general color impression of the olive as a mass is normal and typical of these styles prepared from olives with good color.
                  (2) Green-ripe type. The general color appearance of the olives shall be normal. Not less than 90 percent, by count, shall be practically uniform in such normal color for the type, and no off-color olives may be present.
                  (g) Grade B. If the canned ripe olives have a reasonably good color, a score of 24 to 26 points may be given. “Reasonably good color” has the following meanings with respect to the applicable type and style:
                  (1) Ripe type—(i) Whole; pitted; halved. The olives or units have a reasonably uniform black, dark brown or reddish-brown color. Not less than 80 percent, by count, of the olives or units have a color equal to or darker than the appropriate USDA Composite Color Standard or that produced by spinning the Munsell color discs specified in paragraph (b) of this section in the following combination: 6 percent Red, 6 percent Yellow, and 88 percent Black.
                  (ii) Segmented; sliced; chopped. The general color impression of the olives as a mass is normal and typical of these styles prepared from olives with reasonably good color.
                  (2) Green-ripe type. The general color appearance of the olives shall be normal. Not less than 80 percent, by count, shall be reasonably uniform in such normal color for the type, and no off-color olives may be present.
                  (h) Grade C. If the ripe olives have a fairly good color, a score of 21 to 23 points may be given. Canned ripe olives that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade C regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Fairly good color” has the following meanings with respect to the applicable type and style:
                  (1) Ripe type—(i) Whole; pitted; halved. The olives or units have a fairly uniform black, dark brown or reddish-brown color. Not less than 60 percent, by count, of the olives or units have a color equal to or darker than the appropriate USDA Composite Color Standard or that produced by spinning the Munsell color discs specified in paragraph (b) of this section in the following combination: 6 percent Red, 6 percent Yellow, and 88 percent Black.
                  (ii) Segmented; sliced; chopped. The general color impression of the olives as a mass is normal and typical of these styles prepared from olives of fairly good color.
                  (iii) Broken pitted. The general color impression of the olives as a mass is normal and may be variable, but is typical of this style prepared from olives of good, reasonably good, or fairly good color.
                  (2) Green-ripe type. The general color impression of the olives shall be normal but may vary markedly for the type. No more than 10 percent, by count, of off-color olives may be present.
                  (i) Substandard (SStd.). Canned ripe olives that are abnormal in color for any reason or that fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section may be given a score of 0 to 20 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).
                
                
                  § 52.3761
                  Defects.
                  (a) General. The factor of absence of defects refers to the degree of freedom from harmless extraneous vegetable material, stems, and portions thereof, blemishes, wrinkles, mutilated olives, and from any other defects which affect the appearance or edibility of the product.
                  (b) Definition of defects—(1) Blemishes mean dark-colored surface marks in either ripe type or green-ripe olives which may or may not penetrate into the flesh. Olives or pieces of olives affected by blemishes are classified as follows:
                  (i) Minor blemishes mean surface discolorations on olives or pieces of olives which individually or collectively materially affect the appearance of the unit.
                  (ii) Major blemishes mean surface discolorations or black flesh (oxidized) on olives or pieces of olives which may or may not be associated with a soft texture below the skin and which individually or collectively seriously affect the appearance or edibility of the unit.
                  (iii) Severe blemishes mean dark brown, dark purple, or black surface areas on olives or pieces of olives of the green-ripe type; or any other blemishes, whether or not specifically defined, which severely affect the appearance or edibility of the unit.
                  (2) Blowout refers to a soft pitted olive in which the pit has been pushed out instead of cut out leaving an irregular ring of flesh that materially affects its appearance.
                  (3) Broken piece in halved, segmented, and sliced style olives means any piece of olive flesh that appears to be less than three-fourths of a full unit. Also included are poorly cut units and end slices less than one-half the average size slice.
                  
                  (4) Cross pitted refers to olives pitted along an axis other than the stem-flower axis. A defect is a unit where the angle of these two axes exceeds 45 degrees.
                  (5) Harmless extraneous vegetable material. Harmless extraneous vegetable material (HEVM), harmless extraneous material (HEM), and extraneous vegetable material (EVM), are synonymous terms and mean any vegetable substance that is harmless.
                  (6) Mechanically damaged means a unit in whole, pitted, and halved styles that is punctured, cut or damaged by means other than pitting so that its appearance is materially affected.
                  (7) Misshapen refers to an olive that does not have a normal shape for a given variety.
                  (8) Mutilated refers to an olive in whole or pitted styles that is so pitter-torn or damaged by other means that the entire pit cavity is exposed or the appearance of the olive is seriously affected.
                  (9) Obvious split pit means a pit in an olive that can be determined visually as split.
                  (10) Pitter damage means a loss of skin and flesh from a pitted olive caused by the pitter on the cut end exceeding the area of a circle 3 mm in diameter but is not mutilated.
                  (11) Plunger damage means a loss of skin and flesh from a pitted olive equal to or exceeding the area of a circle 5 mm in diameter.
                  (12) Stem means a stem that measures 3 mm or more from the shoulder of the olive. Stems are classified as follows:
                  (i) Minor stem is a stem that measures more than 3 mm but not more than 4 mm from the shoulder of the olive.
                  (ii) Major stem is a stem that measures more than 4 mm from the shoulder of the olive.
                  (iii) Detached stem, when it measures 4 mm or more, is a defect which shall be scored as a minor stem for whole pitted, halved, and broken pitted style olives and a major stem for segmented, sliced, and chopped style olives.
                  (13) Wrinkles are grooves 0.5 mm or more in width. Classification of wrinkles shall be determined immediately after removing surface moisture and any increase in wrinkles due to dehydration after removing from the container shall not be considered. Olives or pieces of olives affected by wrinkles are classified as follows:
                  (i) Minor wrinkles are wrinkles which collectively do not more than materially affect the appearance of the unit.
                  (ii) Major wrinkles are wrinkles which collectively more than materially affect the appearance of the unit.
                  (c) Grade A. Canned ripe olives of whole, pitted, halved, segmented, sliced, and chopped styles that are practically free from defects may be given a score of 36 to 40 points. “Practically free from defects” means that any defects present, but not specifically limited in Table IV, may not more than slightly affect the appearance or edibility of the olives; and, in addition, specified defects may be present in all other styles except “broken pitted” not to exceed the allowances for grade A provided in Table IV.
                  (d) Grade B. If canned ripe olives of whole, pitted, halved, segmented, sliced, and chopped styles are reasonably free from defects, a score of 32 to 35 points may be given. Canned ripe olives that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade B regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Reasonably free from defects” means that any defects present but not specifically limited in Table V may not more than materially affect the appearance or edibility of the olives; and in addition, specified defects may be present in all other styles except “broken pitted” not to exceed the allowances for grade B provided in Table V.
                  (e) Grade C. If canned ripe olives of whole, pitted, halved, segmented, sliced, chopped, and broken pitted styles are fairly free from defects, a score of 28 to 31 points may be given. Canned ripe olives that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade C, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Fairly free from defects” means that any defects present but not specifically limited in Table VI may more than materially affect the appearance and edibility of the olives; and in addition, specified defects may be present in all other styles not to exceed the allowances for grade C provided in Table VI.
                  
                  (f) Substandard (SStd.). Canned ripe olives that fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section may be given a score of 0 to 27 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).

                  Character.
                  (a) General. The factor of character refers to the firmness, tenderness, and texture characteristics for the variety and type.
                  (b) Grade A. Canned ripe olives of whole, pitted, halved, segmented, sliced, and chopped styles that have a good character may be given a score of 27 to 30 points. “Good character” means that, for the type, the olives have a fleshy texture characteristic for the variety and size; that not less than 95 percent, by count, of whole, pitted and halved olives and by weight of other style olives are practically uniform in texture and are tender but not soft. The remaining 5 percent may be soft but not excessively soft.
                  (c) Grade B. If canned ripe olives of whole, pitted, halved, segmented, sliced and chopped styles have a reasonably good character, a score of 24 to 26 points may be given. Canned ripe olives that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade B regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Reasonably good character” means that, for the type, the olives generally have a fleshy texture characteristic for the variety and size; that not less than 90 percent, by count, of whole, pitted and halved olives, and by weight of other style olives are practically uniform in texture and are tender but not soft. The 10 percent may be soft but not more than 1/2, or 5 percent, may be excessively soft.
                  (d) Grade C. If canned ripe olives of whole, pitted, halved, segmented, sliced, chopped and broken pitted styles have a fairly good character, a score of 21 to 23 points may be given. Canned ripe olives that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade C regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Fairly good character” means that the olives generally have a fleshy texture characteristic for the variety and size; that not less than 80 percent, by count, of whole, pitted and halved olives and by weight of other style olives are practically uniform in texture and are tender but not soft. The remaining 20 percent may be soft but not more than 1/2, or 10 percent, may be excessively soft.
                  (e) Substandard (SStd). Canned ripe olives that fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section may be given a score of 0 to 20 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).
                
                
                  § 52.3763
                  Determining the grade of a lot.

                  The grade of a lot of canned ripe olives covered by these standards is determined by the procedures set forth in the Regulations Governing Inspection and Certification of Processed Fruits and Vegetables, Processed Products Thereof, and Certain Other Processed Food Products (§§ 52.1 through 52.83).
