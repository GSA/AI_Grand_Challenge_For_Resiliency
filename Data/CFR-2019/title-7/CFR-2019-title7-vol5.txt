      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
        
        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
        There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

              Purpose and scope.
              (a) Under section 436 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7756), a State or political subdivision of a State may not impose prohibitions or restrictions upon the movement in interstate commerce of articles, means of conveyance, plants, plant products, biological control organisms, plant pests, or noxious weeds if the Secretary has issued a regulation or order to prevent the dissemination of the biological control organism, plant pest, or noxious weed within the United States. The only exceptions to this are:
              (1) If the prohibitions or restrictions issued by the State or political subdivision of a State are consistent with and do not exceed the regulations or orders issued by the Secretary, or
              (2) If the State or political subdivision of a State demonstrates to the Secretary and the Secretary finds that there is a special need for additional prohibitions or restrictions based on sound scientific data or a thorough risk assessment.
              (b) The regulations in this subpart provide for the submission and consideration of special need requests when a State or a political subdivision of a State seeks to impose prohibitions or restrictions on the movement in interstate commerce of articles, means of conveyance, plants, plant products, biological control organisms, plant pests, or noxious weeds that are in addition to the prohibitions or restrictions imposed by this part or by a Federal Order.

              § 301.1-2
              Criteria for special need requests.
              (a) A special need request, as described in § 301.1, may be generated by a State or a political subdivision of a State. If the request is generated by a political subdivision of a State, the request must be submitted to APHIS through the State. States may also collaborate with other States to submit multi-State special need requests. However, if submitted, the multi-State special need request must include information in sufficient detail to allow APHIS to analyze the impacts on each State on an individual basis. All special need requests must be signed by the executive official or officials or by a plant protection official or officials of the State(s) making the request and must contain the following:
              (1) Data drawn from a scientifically sound detection survey, showing that the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest of concern does not exist in the State or political subdivision or, if already present in the State or political subdivision, the distribution of the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest of concern;
              (2) If the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest is not present in the State or political subdivision, a risk analysis or other scientific data showing that the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest could enter the State or political subdivision and become established;
              (3) Specific information showing that, if introduced into or allowed to spread within the State or political subdivision, the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest would harm or injure the environment or agricultural resources in the State or political subdivision. The request should contain detailed information, including quantitative estimates, if available, about what harm or injury would result from the introduction or dissemination of the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest in the State or political subdivision;
              (4) Specific information showing that the State or political subdivision has characteristics that make it particularly vulnerable to the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest, such as unique plants, diversity of flora, historical concerns, or any other special basis for the request for additional restrictions or prohibitions; and
              (5) Information detailing the proposed additional prohibitions or restrictions and scientific data demonstrating that the proposed additional prohibitions or restrictions are necessary and adequate, and that there is no less drastic action that is feasible and that would be adequate, to prevent the introduction or spread of the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest in the State or political subdivision.
              (b) All special need requests must be submitted to the Deputy Administrator for Plant Protection and Quarantine, APHIS, USDA, Jamie L. Whitten Federal Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue, SW., Room 301-E, Washington, DC 20250.
            
            
              § 301.1-3
              Action on special need requests.

              (a) Upon receipt of a complete special need request submitted in accordance with § 301.1-2, APHIS will publish a notice in the Federal Register to inform the public of the special need request and to make the request and its supporting information available for review and comment for at least 60 days.

              (b) Following the close of the comment period, APHIS will publish another notice announcing the Administrator's decision to either grant or deny the special need request. The Administrator's determination will be based upon the evaluation of the information submitted by the State or political subdivision of a State in support of its request and would take into account any comments received.
              
              (1) If the Administrator grants the special need request, the State or political subdivision of a State will be authorized to impose only the specific prohibitions or restrictions identified in the request and approved by APHIS. APHIS will coordinate with the State, or with the State on behalf of the political subdivision of the State, to ensure that the additional prohibitions or restrictions are in accord with the special need exception granted by the Administrator.
              (2) If the Administrator denies the special need request, the State or political subdivision of a State will be notified in writing of the reason for the denial and may submit any additional information the State or political subdivision of a State may have in order to request a reconsideration.
              (c) If granted, a special need exception will be applicable for 2 years, at the end of which the State or political subdivision of a State must submit a request for renewal of the exception. A special need renewal request must address the same criteria as the initial request submitted under § 301.1-2 and must show that a special need still exists that warrants the continuation of the special need exception. The renewal must be submitted no sooner than 6 months and no later than 3 months prior to the end of the 2-year applicability period for the initial exception. Once a special need renewal request has been received, APHIS will follow the same notice and comment process outlined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. If, by the end of the 2-year applicability period, the State or political subdivision of a State does not submit a special need renewal request, the State's or political subdivision's special need exception will lapse and the State or political subdivision of a State will have to reapply for the special need exception.

              (d) If the Administrator determines that there is a need for the withdrawal of a special need exception before the renewal date of the special need exception, the reasons for the withdrawal would be communicated to the State or to the political subdivision of the State and APHIS will publish a notice in the Federal Register to inform the public of the withdrawal of the special need exception and to make the information supporting the withdrawal available for review and comment for at least 60 days. Reasons for withdrawal of approval of a special need exception may include, but are not limited to, the availability of new scientific data or changes in APHIS regulations. Following the close of the comment period, APHIS will publish another notice announcing the Administrator's decision to either withdraw or uphold the special need exception. The Administrator's determination will be based upon the evaluation of the information submitted in support of the withdrawal and would take into account any comments received.

              § 301.32-3
              Quarantined areas.
              (a) Designation of quarantined areas. In accordance with the criteria listed in paragraph (c) of this section, the Administrator will designate as a quarantined area each State, or each portion of a State, in which a fruit fly population subject to the regulations in this subpart has been found by an inspector, or in which the Administrator has reason to believe that a fruit fly population is present, or that the Administrator considers necessary to quarantine because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities in which a fruit fly population has been found. The Administrator will publish the description of the quarantined area on the Plant Protection and Quarantine Web site, http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info/fruit_flies/index.shtml. The description of the quarantined area will include the date the description was last updated and a description of the changes that have been made to the quarantined area. The description of the quarantined area may also be obtained by request from any local office of PPQ; local offices are listed in telephone directories. After a change is made to the quarantined area, we will publish a notice in the Federal Register informing the public that the change has occurred and describing the change to the quarantined area.
              (b) Designation of an area less than an entire State as a quarantined area. Less than an entire State will be designated as a quarantined area only if the Administrator determines that:
              (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated articles; and
              (2) The designation of less than the entire State as a quarantined area will prevent the interstate spread of the fruit fly.
              (c) Criteria for designation of a State, or a portion of a State, as a quarantined area. A State, or a portion of a State, will be designated as a quarantined area when a fruit fly population has been found in that area by an inspector, when the Administrator has reason to believe that the fruit fly is present in that area, or when the Administrator considers it necessary to quarantine that area because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities in which the fruit fly has been found.
              (d) Removal of a State, or a portion of a State, from quarantine. A State, or a portion of a State, will be removed from quarantine when the Administrator determines that sufficient time has passed without finding additional flies or other evidence of infestation in the area to conclude that the fruit fly no longer exists in that area.
            
            
              § 301.32-4
              Conditions governing the interstate movement of regulated articles from quarantined areas.
              Any regulated article may be moved interstate from a quarantined area 2
                 only if moved under the following conditions:
              
                
                  2 Requirements under all other applicable Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations must also be met.
              
              (a) With a certificate or limited permit issued and attached in accordance with §§ 301.32-5 and 301.32-8;
              (b) Without a certificate or limited permit if:

              (1) The regulated article originated outside the quarantined area and is either moved in an enclosed vehicle or is completely enclosed by a covering adequate to prevent access by fruit flies (such as canvas, plastic, or other closely woven cloth) while moving through the quarantined area; and
              (2) The point of origin of the regulated article is indicated on the waybill, and the enclosed vehicle or the enclosure that contains the regulated article is not opened, unpacked, or unloaded in the quarantined area; and
              (3) The regulated article is moved through the quarantined area without stopping except for refueling or for traffic conditions, such as traffic lights or stop signs.
              (c) Without a certificate or limited permit if the regulated article is moved:
              (1) By the United States Department of Agriculture for experimental or scientific purposes;
              (2) Pursuant to a permit issued by the Administrator for the regulated article;
              (3) Under conditions specified on the permit and found by the Administrator to be adequate to prevent the spread of fruit flies; and
              (4) With a tag or label bearing the number of the permit issued for the regulated article attached to the outside of the container of the regulated article or attached to the regulated article itself if not in a container.
              (d) Hass avocados that are grown or packed in an area quarantined for Mediterranean, Mexican, or sapote fruit fly and that are moving interstate from such an area are subject to the following additional requirements:
              (1) Orchard sanitation and safeguarding requirements. (i) Hass avocado fruit that has fallen from the trees may not be included in field boxes of fruit to be packed for shipping.
              (ii) Harvested Hass avocados must be placed in field boxes or containers of field boxes that are marked to show the location of the orchard. The avocados must be moved from the orchard to the packinghouse within 3 hours of harvest or they must be protected from fruit fly infestation until moved.
              (iii) Hass avocados must be protected from fruit fly infestations during their movement from the orchard to the packinghouse and must be accompanied by a field record indicating the location of the orchard where the avocados originated.
              (2) Packinghouse requirements for Hass avocados packed within a quarantined area. (i) All openings to the outside of the packinghouse must be covered by screening with openings of not more than 1.6 mm or by some other barrier that prevents insects from entering the packinghouse.
              (ii) The packinghouse must have double doors at the entrance to the facility and at the interior entrance to the area where the avocados are packed.
              (iii) If the Hass avocados were grown in an orchard within the quarantined area, the identity of the avocados must be maintained from field boxes or containers to the shipping boxes in the packinghouse so that the avocados can be traced back to the orchard in which they were grown. The avocados must be packed in boxes or crates that are clearly marked with the identity of the grower and the packinghouse.
              (iv) Any boxes of Hass avocados packed in the quarantined area must be placed in a refrigerated truck or refrigerated container and remain in that truck or container while in transit through the quarantined area. Prior to leaving the packinghouse, the truck or container must be secured with a seal that will be broken when the truck or container is opened. Once sealed, the refrigerated truck or refrigerated container must remain unopened until it is outside the quarantined area.
              (v) Any avocados that have not been packed or loaded into a refrigerated truck or refrigerated container by the end of the workday must be kept inside the screened packinghouse.
              (3) Packinghouse requirements for Hass avocados packed outside a quarantined area but grown within a quarantined area. Hass avocados grown in an orchard within a quarantined area but packed in a packinghouse outside the quarantined area must meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section.

              Issuance and cancellation of certificates and limited permits.
              (a) A certificate may be issued by an inspector 3
                 for the interstate movement of a regulated article if the inspector determines that:
              
                
                  3 Services of an inspector may be requested by contacting local PPQ offices, which are listed in telephone directories.
              
              (1)(i) The regulated article has been treated under the direction of an inspector in accordance with § 301.32-10; or
              (ii) Based on inspection of the premises of origin, the premises are free from fruit flies; or
              (iii) Based on inspection of the regulated article, the regulated article is free of fruit flies; or
              (iv) The regulated articles are Hass variety avocados that have been harvested, safeguarded, and packed in accordance with the conditions in § 301.32-4(d); and
              (2) The regulated article will be moved through the quarantined area in an enclosed vehicle or will be completely enclosed by a covering adequate to prevent access by fruit flies; and
              (3) The regulated article is to be moved in compliance with any additional emergency conditions the Administrator may impose under section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) to prevent the spread of fruit flies; and
              (4) The regulated article is eligible for unrestricted movement under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated article.
              (b) An inspector 4
                 will issue a limited permit for the interstate movement of a regulated article if the inspector determines that:
              
                
                  4 See footnote 3.
              
              (1) The regulated article is to be moved interstate to a specified destination for specified handling, processing, or utilization (the destination and other conditions to be listed in the limited permit), and this interstate movement will not result in the spread of fruit flies because life stages of the fruit flies will be destroyed by the specified handling, processing, or utilization;
              (2) The regulated article is to be moved in compliance with any additional emergency conditions the Administrator may impose under section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) to prevent the spread of fruit flies; and
              (3) The regulated article is eligible for interstate movement under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated article.
              (c) Certificates and limited permits for the interstate movement of regulated articles may be issued by an inspector or person operating under a compliance agreement. A person operating under a compliance agreement may issue a certificate for the interstate movement of a regulated article if an inspector has determined that the regulated article is eligible for a certificate in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. A person operating under a compliance agreement may issue a limited permit for interstate movement of a regulated article when an inspector has determined that the regulated article is eligible for a limited permit in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

              (d) Any certificate or limited permit that has been issued may be withdrawn, either orally or in writing, by an inspector if he or she determines that the holder of the certificate or limited permit has not complied with all conditions in this subpart for the use of the certificate or limited permit. If the withdrawal is oral, the withdrawal and the reasons for the withdrawal will be confirmed in writing as promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose certificate or limited permit has been withdrawn may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving the written notification of the withdrawal. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the certificate or limited permit was wrongfully withdrawn. As promptly as circumstances allow, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision. A hearing will be held to resolve any conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice concerning a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.

              Regulated articles may be treated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter to neutralize fruit flies. The following treatments also may be used for the regulated articles indicated:
              (a) Soil within the dripline of plants that are producing or have produced regulated articles listed § 301.32(a) or (b). The following soil treatments may be used: Apply diazinon at the rate of 5 pounds active ingredient per acre to the soil within the dripline with sufficient water to wet the soil to at least a depth of 0.5 inch. Both immersion and pour-on treatment procedures are also acceptable.
              (b) Premises. Fields, groves, or areas that are located within a quarantined area but outside the infested core area and that produce regulated articles may receive regular treatments with either malathion or spinosad bait spray as an alternative to treating fruits and vegetables as provided in part 305 of this chapter. These treatments must take place at 6- to 10-day intervals, starting a sufficient time before harvest (but not less than 30 days before harvest) to allow for development of fruit fly egg and larvae. Determination of the time period must be based on the day degrees model for the specific fruit fly. Once treatment has begun, it must continue through the harvest period. The malathion bait spray treatment must be applied by aircraft or ground equipment at a rate of 2.4 oz of technical grade malathion and 9.6 oz of protein hydrolysate per acre. The spinosad bait spray treatment must be applied by aircraft or ground equipment at a rate of 0.01 oz of a USDA-approved spinosad formulation and 48 oz of protein hydrolysate per acre. For ground applications, the mixture may be diluted with water to improve coverage.

Infected wheat stems, a primary host of black stem rust, are placed on top of the screen. The plants are moistened and maintained in 100% humidity, causing the spores to swell and fall on the plants lying under the screen. The plants are then observed for 7 days at 20-80% relative humidity. This test procedure is repeated 12 times. If in all 12 tests, the rust-susceptible plant shows signs of infection after 7 days and the test plants do not, USDA will declare the test plant variety rust-resistant. The tests must be performed on new growth, just as the leaves are unfolding.

              § 301.38-3
              Protected areas.

              (a) The Administrator may designate as a protected area in paragraph (d) of this section any State that has eradicated rust-susceptible plants of the genera Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia under the cooperative Federal-State eradication program. In addition, the State must employ personnel with responsibility for the issuance and withdrawal of certificates in accordance with § 301.38-5, and maintain and enforce an inspection program under which every plant nursery within the State is inspected at least once each year to ensure that they are free of rust-susceptible plants. During the requisite nursery inspections, all nursery stock shall be examined to determine that it consists only of rust-resistant varieties of the genera Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia, and that the plants are true to type. Plants that do not meet this criteria must be destroyed.

              (b) The Administrator may designate as a protected area any county within a State, rather than the entire State, if areas within the State have eradicated rust-susceptible plants of the genera Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia under the cooperative Federal-State program, and;
              (1) The State employs personnel with responsibility for the issuance and withdrawal of certificates in accordance with § 301.38-5;
              (2) The State is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated articles, as determined by the Administrator; and

              (3) The State maintains and enforces an inspection program under which every plant nursery within the county is inspected at least once each year to ensure that plant nurseries within that area are free of rust-susceptible plants of the genera Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia. During the requisite nursery inspections, all nursery stock shall be examined to determine that it consists only of rust-resistant varieties of the genera Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia, and that the plants are true to type. Plants that do not meet this criteria must be destroyed.
              (c) All seed used to propagate plants of the genera Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia in protected areas, and all seed used to propagate plants of the genera Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia that are certified as rust-resistant for interstate movement into protected areas, must be produced at properties where a State inspector has verified that no wild or domesticated rust-susceptible plants are growing at or within one-half mile of the property. 4
                
              
              
                

                  4 Persons performing the inspections must be able to recognize rust-susceptible varieties of Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia. Inspectors must work side by side, 10 to 20 feet apart, and walk outward away from the property a distance of one-half mile measured from the edge of the property, and observe all plants growing in the half-mile band. The distance between the inspectors may vary within this range, depending upon the visibility of the plant growth. In areas with low brush and flat terrain, the inspectors may be the maximum distance of 20 feet apart if they can observe all plants growing within 10 feet of them. In areas of high plant growth or hilly terrain, the inspectors must be closer together due to limited or obstructed visibility. Inspectors must observe all plants growing between themselves and the mid-point of the distance between themselves and the next inspector. This process must be repeated so that the entire band, measured from the border of the property to the circumference of an imaginary circle having the property as its mid-point, is visually inspected in this manner.
              
              (d) The following are designated as protected areas:
              (1) The States of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
              (2) The following counties in the State of Washington: Adams, Asotin, Benton, Chelan, Columbia, Douglas, Ferry, Franklin, Garfield, Grant, Kittitas, Klickitat, Lincoln, Okanogan, Pend Oreille, Spokane, Stevens, Walla Walla, Whitman, Yakima.
              (e) Each State that is a protected area or that encompasses a protected area must submit annually to the Administrator a written statement, signed by an inspector, assuring APHIS that all nursery inspections have been performed in accordance with this section. The statement must be submitted by January 1st of each year, and must include a list of the nurseries inspected and found free of rust-susceptible plants.
              (f) The Administrator may remove a protected area from the list of designated protected areas in paragraph (d) of this section if he or she determines that it no longer meets the criteria of paragraph (a) or (b)(1) through (3) of this section. A hearing will be held to resolve any conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice for the hearing shall be adopted by the Administrator.

              (a) Non-protected areas. Interstate movement of regulated articles into or through any State or area that is not designated as a protected area under § 301.38-3(d) is allowed without restriction under this subpart.
              (b) Protected areas—(1) Prohibited movement. The following regulated articles are prohibited from moving interstate into or through any protected area:
              (i) All rust-susceptible Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia plants, seeds, fruits, and other plant parts capable of propagation, except Mahonia cuttings for decorative purposes.
              (ii) All seed-propagated plants of the Berberis species and varieties designated as rust-resistant in § 301.38-2(a)(1) of this subpart that are of less than 2 years' growth, and any seeds, fruits, and other plant parts capable of propagation from such plants.
              (2) Restricted movement. The following regulated articles may be moved interstate into or through a protected area with a certificate issued and attached in accordance with §§ 301.38-5 and 301.38-7 of this subpart:

              (i) Seed-propagated plants of at least 2 years' growth, clonally propagated plants of any age, seeds, fruits, and other plant parts capable of propagation of the Berberis species and varieties designated as rust-resistant in § 301.38-2(a)(1) of this subpart;

              (ii) Plants, seeds, fruits, and other plant parts capable of propagation of the Mahoberberis and Mahonia species and varieties designated as rust-resistant in § 301.38-2(a)(2) of this subpart.

              (c) An inspector may issue a limited permit to allow a regulated article not eligible for certification under § 301.38-4(b)(2) to move interstate into or through a protected area to a specified destination that is stated in the permit and is outside the protected area, if the requirements of all other applicable Federal domestic plant quarantines are met. A regulated article moved interstate under a limited permit must be placed in a closed sealed container that prevents unauthorized removal of the regulated article, and that remains sealed until the regulated article reaches the final destination stated in the permit. At the final destination, the sealed container must be opened only in the presence of an inspector or with the authorization of an inspector obtained expressly for that shipment.
              (d) The United States Department of Agriculture may move any regulated article interstate into or through a protected area in accordance with the conditions determined necessary to prevent the introduction or spread of black stem rust in protected areas, as specified in a Departmental permit issued for this purpose.

                 to issue a certificate. To expedite the issuance of a certificate, an inspector may direct that the regulated articles be assembled in a manner that facilitates inspection.
              
                
                  5 Services of an inspector may be requested by contacting a local APHIS office (listed in telephone directories under Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine). The addresses and telephone numbers of local offices may also be obtained by writing to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Domestic and Emergency Operations, 4700 River Road Unit 134, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1236.
              
              (b) An inspector may issue a certificate for the interstate movement of a regulated article if he or she:
              (1) Determines, upon examination, that the regulated article may be moved interstate in accordance with this subpart; and
              (2) Determines that the regulated article may be moved interstate in accordance with all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated article.
              (c) Certificates for interstate movement of regulated articles may be issued by an inspector to a person operating under a compliance agreement for use with subsequent shipments of regulated articles to facilitate their movement. A person operating under a compliance agreement must make the determinations set forth in paragraph (b) of this section before shipping any regulated articles.
              (d) Any certificate that has been issued may be withdrawn by an inspector, orally or in writing, if he or she determines that the holder of the certificate has not complied with the conditions of this subpart for the use of the certificate. If the withdrawal is oral, the inspector will confirm the withdrawal and the reasons for the withdrawal, in writing, within 20 days of oral notification of the withdrawal. Any person whose certificate has been withdrawn may appeal the decision, in writing within 10 days after receiving written notification of the withdrawal. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the certificate was wrongfully withdrawn. A hearing will be held to resolve any conflict as to any material fact. An appeal shall be granted or denied, in writing, as promptly as circumstances allow, and the reasons for the decision shall be stated. In a non-protected area, appeal shall be made to the Administrator. The Administrator shall adopt rules of practice for the hearing.

              § 301.45-2
              Authorization to designate and terminate designation of generally infested areas.
              (a) Generally infested areas. The Administrator shall list as generally infested areas in § 301.45-3 each State or each portion thereof in which a gypsy moth general infestation has been found by an inspector, or each portion of a State which the Administrator deems necessary to regulate because of its proximity to infestation or its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested localities; Except that, an area shall not be listed as a generally infested area if the Administrator has determined that:
              (1) The area is subject to a gypsy moth eradication program conducted by the Federal government or a State government in accordance with the Eradication, Suppression, and Slow the Spread alternative of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) on Gypsy Moth Suppression and Eradication Projects that was filed with the United States Environmental Protection Agency on January 16, 1996; and,
              (2) State or Federal delimiting trapping surveys conducted in accordance with Section II, “Survey Procedures—Gypsy Moth” of the Gypsy Moth Treatment Manual show that the average number of gypsy moths caught per trap is less than 10 and that the trapping surveys show that the eradication program is effectively diminishing the gypsy moth population of the area.
              (b) Less than an entire State will be designated as a generally infested area only if the Administrator has determined that:
              (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or regulation which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under this subpart; and,
              (2) The designation of less than the entire State as a generally infested area will be adequate to prevent the artificial interstate spread of infestations of the gypsy moth.
              (c) Temporary designation of areas as generally infested areas. The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any area in any State as a generally infested area in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. An inspector will give written notice of the designation to the owner or person in possession of the area and thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated article from such areas is subject to the applicable provisions of this subpart. As soon as practicable, each generally infested area will be added to the list in § 301.45-3 or the designation will be terminated by the Administrator or an authorized inspector, and notice thereof shall be given to the owner or person in possession of the areas.
              (d) Termination of designation as a generally infested area. The Administrator shall terminate the designation of any area as a generally infested area whenever the Administrator determines that the area no longer requires designation under the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

(1) A regulated article, except for an article moved in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, shall not be moved interstate from any generally infested area into or through any area that is not generally infested unless a certificate or permit has been issued and attached to such regulated article in accordance with §§ 301.45-5 and 301.45-8. 3

              (b) A regulated article originating outside of any generally infested area may be moved interstate directly through any generally infested area without a certificate or permit if the point of origin of the article is clearly indicated by shipping documents, its identity has been maintained, and it has been safeguarded against infestation while in any generally infested area during the months of April through August.
              (c) A regulated article originating in a generally infested area may be moved interstate from a generally infested area without a certificate if it complies with (1) or (2) of this paragraph:

              (iii) Is moved with a tag or label securely attached to the outside of the container containing the article or securely attached to the article itself if not in a container, and with such tag or label bearing a permit number corresponding to the number of the permit issued for such article.
              (2) The article is logs, pulpwood, or bark and bark products, and the person moving the article has attached a signed accurate statement to the waybill or other shipping documents accompanying the article stating that he or she has inspected the article in accordance with the Gypsy Moth Program Manual no more than 5 days prior to the date of movement and has found no life stages of gypsy moth on the article.

              (3) It has been treated under the direction of an inspector to destroy the gypsy moth in accordance with the treatment manual and part 305 of this chapter; or

              (4) It has been grown, produced, manufactured, stored, or handled in such a manner that no infestation would be transmitted thereby as determined by an inspector.
              (b) Limited permits may be issued by an inspector to allow interstate movement of any regulated article under this subpart to specified destinations for specified handling, utilization, processing, or treatment in accordance with the treatment manual, when, upon evaluation of all of the circumstances involved in each case, the Administrator determines that such movement will not result in the spread of the gypsy moth because life stages of the moths will be destroyed by such specified handling, utilization, processing or treatment, or the pest will not survive in areas to which shipped, and the requirements of all other applicable Federal domestic plant quarantines have been met.
              (c) Certificate and limited permit forms may be issued by an inspector to any person for use for subsequent shipments of regulated articles provided the person is operating under a compliance agreement. Any person operating under a compliance agreement may reproduce the forms as needed to attach them to regulated articles moved under a compliance agreement. Any person operating under a compliance agreement may execute and issue the certificate forms or reproduction of such forms, for the interstate movement of regulated articles from the premises of such person identified in the compliance agreement, if the person has treated such regulated articles as specified in the compliance agreement, and if the regulated articles are eligible for certification for movement to any destination under all applicable Federal domestic plant quarantines. Any person operating under a compliance agreement may execute and issue the limited permit forms, or reproductions of such forms, for the interstate movement of regulated articles to specified destinations when an inspector has made the determinations specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (d) A certificate may be issued by a qualified certified applicator for the interstate movement of any outdoor household article or mobile home if such qualified certified applicator determines the following:
              (1) That the article has been inspected by the qualified certified applicator and found to be free of any life stage of the gypsy moth; or
              (2) That the article has been treated by, or treated under the direct supervision of, the qualified certified applicator to destroy any life stage of the gypsy moth in accordance with methods and procedures prescribed in section III of the Gypsy Moth Program Manual.
              (e) An OHA document may be issued by the owner of an outdoor household article for the interstate movement of the article if such person has inspected the outdoor household article and has found it to be free of any life stage of gypsy moth.
              (f) Any certificate or permit which has been issued or authorized may be withdrawn by an inspector if he determines that the holder thereof has not complied with any condition for the use of such document. The reasons for the withdrawal shall be confirmed in writing as promptly as circumstances permit. Any person whose certificate or permit has been withdrawn may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within ten (10) days after receiving the written notification of the withdrawal. The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the certificate or permit was wrongfully withdrawn. The Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for his decision as promptly as circumstances permit. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall be held to resolve such conflict. Rules of practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.

                § 301.48-4
                Conditions governing the interstate movement of regulated articles from quarantined States.
                A regulated article may be moved interstate from a regulated airport to any State 1
                   designated in § 301.48(b) only if:
                
                  
                    1 Requirements under all other applicable Federal domestic plant quarantines must be met.
                
                (a) An inspector, upon visual inspection of the airport and/or the aircraft, determines that the regulated article does not present a threat to spread the Japanese beetle because adult beetle populations are not present; or
                (b) The aircraft is opened and loaded only while it is enclosed inside a hangar that an inspector has determined to be free of and safeguarded against Japanese beetle; or
                (c) The aircraft is loaded during the hours of 8:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. only or lands and departs during those hours and, in either situation, is kept completely closed while on the ground during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.; or
                (d) If opened and loaded between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., the aircraft is inspected, treated, and safeguarded. Inspection, treatment, and safeguarding must be done either under a compliance agreement in accordance with § 301.48-8 or under the direct supervision of an inspector. On a case-by-case basis, inspectors will determine which of the following conditions, and any supplemental conditions deemed necessary by the Administrator to prevent the spread of Japanese beetle, are required:
                (1) All openings of the aircraft must be closed or safeguarded during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. by exclusionary devices or by other means approved by the Administrator.
                (2) All cargo containers that have not been safeguarded in a protected area must be inspected immediately prior to and during the loading process. All personnel must check their clothing immediately prior to entering the aircraft. All Japanese beetles found must be removed and destroyed.
                (3) All areas around doors and hatches or other openings in the aircraft must be inspected prior to removing the exclusionary devices. All Japanese beetles found must be removed and destroyed. All doors and hatches must be closed immediately after the exclusionary devices are moved away from the aircraft.
                (4) Aircraft must be treated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter no more than 1 hour before loading. Particular attention should be paid to the ball mat area and the holes around the main entrance. The aircraft must then be aerated under safeguard conditions as required by part 305 of this chapter.
                (5) Aircraft treatment records must be maintained by the applicator completing or supervising the treatment for a period of 2 years. These records must be provided upon request for review by an inspector. Treatment records shall include the pesticide used, the date of application, the location where the pesticide was applied (airport and aircraft), the amount of pesticide applied, and the name of the applicator.
                (6) When a designated aircraft is replaced with an alternate one just prior to departure (the procedure known as “tail swapping”), the alternate aircraft must be inspected and all Japanese beetles must be removed. The aircraft must be safeguarded by closing all openings and hatches or by equipping the aircraft with exclusionary devices until the aircraft is ready for use. During loading, all treatment and safeguard requirements applicable to regularly scheduled aircraft must be implemented.
                (7) Aircraft may be retreated in the noninfested State if live Japanese beetles are found.

                (8) Notification of unscheduled commercial flights and of all military flights must be given at least 1 hour before departure to the appropriate person in the destination airport of any of the States listed in § 301.48(b). Notification of arriving military flights should also be given to base commanders to facilitate the entrance of Federal and/or State inspectors onto the base if necessary.

              § 301.50-3
              Quarantined areas.

              (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator will list as a quarantined area, in paragraph (c) of this section, each State, or each portion of a State, in which the pine shoot beetle has been found by an inspector, in which the Administrator has reason to believe that the pine shoot beetle is present, or that the Administrator considers necessary to regulate because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities in which the pine shoot beetle has been found. Less than an entire State will be designated as a quarantined area only if the Administrator determines that:
              (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine and regulations that impose restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of these articles; and
              (2) The designation of less than the entire State as a regulated area will otherwise be adequate to prevent the artificial interstate spread of the pine shoot beetle.
              (b) The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any nonquarantined area in a State as a quarantined area in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The Administrator will give a copy of this regulation along with a written notice of this temporary designation to the owner or person in possession of the nonquarantined area; thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated article from an area temporarily designated as a quarantined area is subject to this subpart. As soon as practicable, this area will be added to the list in paragraph (c) of this section, or the designation will be terminated by the Administrator or an inspector. The owner or person in possession of an area for which designation is terminated will be given notice of the termination as soon as practicable.

              § 301.50-4
              Conditions governing the interstate movement of regulated articles from quarantined areas.
              Any regulated article may be moved interstate from a quarantined area 2
                 only if moved under the following conditions:
              
                
                  2 Requirements under all other applicable Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations must also be met.
              
              (a) With a certificate or limited permit issued and attached in accordance with §§ 301.50-5 and 301.50-8 of this subpart;
              (b) Without a certificate or limited permit, if:

              (1)(i) The regulated article originates outside any quarantined area and is moved through the quarantined area without stopping (except for dropoff loads, refueling, or traffic conditions, such as traffic lights or stop signs) during October, November, or December, or when ambient air temperature is below 10 °C (50 °F); or
              (ii) The regulated article originates outside any quarantined area and, during the period of January through September, is moved through the quarantined area at a temperature higher than 10 °C (50 °F), if the article is shipped in an enclosed vehicle or completely covered (such as with plastic, canvas, or other closely woven cloth) so as to prevent access by the pine shoot beetle; and
              (2) The point of origin of the regulated article is indicted on the waybill.
              (c) With a limited permit issued by the Administrator if the regulated article is moved:
              (1) By the United States Department of Agriculture for experimental or scientific purposes;
              (2) Under conditions, specified on the permit, which the Administrator has found to be adequate to prevent the spread of the pine shoot beetle; and
              (3) With a tag or label, bearing the number of the permit issued for the regulated article, attached to the outside of the container of the regulated article or attached to the regulated article itself, if the regulated article is not in a container.

              § 301.50-5
              Issuance and cancellation of certificates and limited permits.
              (a) A certificate will be issued by an inspector 3
                 for the interstate movement of a regulated article if the inspector determines that:
              
                
                  3 Services of an inspector may be requested by contacting the local offices of Plant Protection and Quarantine, which are listed in telephone directories. The addresses and telephone numbers of local offices may also be obtained from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Domestic and Emergency Operations, 4700 River Road Unit 134, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1236.
              
              (1)(i) The regulated article has been treated under the direction of an inspector in accordance with § 301.50-10 of this subpart, or, if pine bark products, produced according to the requirements of the management method in § 301.50-10(b) of this subpart; or
              (ii) Based on inspection of the premises of origin, if the regulated article is a greenhouse-grown pine (such as bonsai), that the greenhouse is free from the pine shoot beetle and is screened to prevent entry of the pine shoot beetle; or
              (iii) Based on inspection of the regulated article, if the regulated article is a pine seedling or a pine transplant and is no greater than 36 inches high with a bole diameter at soil level of 1 inch or less, that it is free from the pine shoot beetle; or
              (iv) Based on inspection by an inspector (branch tip-by-branch tip) of pine nursery stock, that it is free from the pine shoot beetle; or
              (v) If the regulated article is a pine log with bark attached or pine lumber with bark attached or a pine stump, that its source tree has been felled during the period of July 1 through October 31 or if the regulated article is pine bark products produced from a tree felled and debarked during the period of July 1 through October 31; and
              (2)(i) The regulated article will be moved through the quarantined area during October, November, or December, or when the ambient air temperature is below 10 °C (50 °F); or
              (ii) The regulated article will be moved through the quarantined area during the period of January through September, if the ambient air temperature is 10 °C (50 °F) or higher, in an enclosed vehicle or completely enclosed by a covering adequate to prevent access by the pine shoot beetle; or
              (iii) The pine log with pine bark attached, pine lumber with bark attached, or pine stump from a tree felled during the period of July 1 through October 31, or the pine bark products produced from a tree felled and debarked during the period of July 1 through October 31, will be shipped interstate from the quarantined area during the period of July 1 through October 31 of the same year in which the source tree was felled; and

              (3) The regulated article is to be moved in compliance with any additional conditions deemed necessary under section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) 4
                 to prevent the spread of the pine shoot beetle; and
              
                
                  4 An inspector may hold, seize, quarantine, treat, apply other remedial measures to, destroy, or otherwise dispose of plants, plant pests, or other articles in accordance with sections 414, 421, and 434 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714, 7731, and 7754).
              
              (4) The regulated article is eligible for unrestricted movement under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated articles.
              (b) An inspector 5
                 will issue a limited permit for the interstate movement of a regulated article if the inspector determines that:
              
                
                  5 See footnote 3 to § 301.50-5(a).
              
              (1)(i) The regulated article is to be moved interstate to a specified destination for specified handling, processing, or utilization (the destination and other conditions to be listed in the limited permit), and this interstate movement will not result in the spread of the pine shoot beetle. If the regulated article is part of a shipment of pine Christmas trees, the inspector will make a pest-risk determination on the basis of an inspection conducted in accordance with § 301.50-5(c) of this paragraph; or
              (ii) The regulated article is to be moved interstate from a quarantined area to a quarantined area and will transit any non-quarantined area in an enclosed vehicle or completely enclosed by a covering adequate to prevent access by the pine shoot beetle; and
              (2) The regulated article is to be moved in compliance with any additional conditions deemed necessary under section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) to prevent the spread of the pine shoot beetle; and
              (3) The regulated article is eligible for interstate movement under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated article.
              (c) The number of pine Christmas trees randomly selected for inspection is determined by the size and type of shipment, in accordance with the following tables. If a shipment mixes painted and natural trees, the inspection procedure for painted trees will apply.

              (d) Certificates and limited permits for use for interstate movement of regulated articles may be issued by an inspector or person operating under a compliance agreement. A person operating under a compliance agreement may issue a certificate for the interstate movement of a regulated article if an inspector has determined that the regulated article is otherwise eligible for a certificate in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. A person operating under a compliance agreement may issue a limited permit for interstate movement of a regulated article when an inspector has determined that the regulated article is eligible for a limited permit in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

              (e) Any certificate or limited permit that has been issued may be withdrawn by an inspector orally, or in writing, if he or she determines that the holder of the certificate or limited permit has not complied with all conditions under this subpart for the use of the certificate or limited permit. If the withdrawal is oral, the withdrawal and the reasons for the withdrawal shall be confirmed in writing as promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose certificate or limited permit has been withdrawn may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving the written notification of the withdrawal. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the certificate or limited permit was wrongfully withdrawn. As promptly as circumstances allow, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision. A hearing will be held to resolve any conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.

              (a) Regulated articles may be treated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter to neutralize the pine shoot beetle.
              (b) Management method for pine bark products. The following procedures are authorized for use with pine bark products derived from white pine (Pinus strobus), Scotch pine (P. sylvestris), red pine (P. resinosa), and jack pine (P. banksiana) trees. Pine bark products will only be considered to have been produced in accordance with this management method if the following procedures are followed:
              (1) For pine bark products produced from trees felled during the period November 1 through March 31:
              (i) The trees must be harvested at a height of 4 inches or more above the duff line; and
              (ii) The trees must have been mechanically debarked with a ring debarker or a Rosser head debarker; and
              (iii) For Scotch pine, red pine, and jack pine, the bark must either be ground into pieces of 1 inch or less in diameter or composted in accordance with the procedure in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
              (2) For pine bark products produced from trees felled during the period April 1 through June 30:
              (i) The trees must have been mechanically debarked with a ring debarker or a Rosser head debarker; and
              (ii) The bark must either be ground into pieces of 1 inch or less in size or composted in accordance with the procedure in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
              (3) Composting for pine bark products for the management method in this paragraph (d) must be performed as follows:
              (i) The pile of pine bark to be composted must be at least 200 cubic yards in size; and
              (ii) The compost pile must remain undisturbed until the interior temperature of the pile reaches 120 °F (49 °C) and remains at or over that temperature for 4 consecutive days; and
              (iii) After the 4-day period is completed, the outer layer of the compost pile must be removed to a depth of 3 feet; and
              (iv) A second compost pile must be started using the cover material previously removed as a core. Core material must be removed from the first pile and used to cover the second compost pile to a depth of 3 feet; and
              (v) The second compost pile must remain undisturbed until the interior temperature of the pile reaches 120 °F (49 °C) and remains at or over that temperature for 4 consecutive days. After this 4-day period, the composting procedure is complete.
              (vi) Previously composted material generated using this procedure may be used as cover material for subsequent compost piles. A compost pile that uses previously composted material must remain undisturbed until the interior temperature of the pile reaches 120 °F (49 °C) and remains at or over that temperature for 4 consecutive days. After this 4-day period, the composting procedure is complete.

              Quarantined areas.

              (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator will list as a quarantined area in paragraph (c) of this section, each State or each portion of a State in which the Asian longhorned beetle has been found by an inspector, in which the Administrator has reason to believe that the Asian longhorned beetle is present, or that the Administrator considers necessary to regulate because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities where Asian longhorned beetle has been found. Less than an entire State will be designated as a quarantined area only if the Administrator determines that:
              (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated articles; and
              (2) The designation of less than an entire State as a quarantined area will be adequate to prevent the artificial interstate spread of the Asian longhorned beetle.
              (b) The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any nonquarantined area as a quarantined area in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The Administrator will give written notice of this designation to the owner or person in possession of the nonquarantined area, or, in the case of publicly owned land, to the person responsible for the management of the nonquarantined area. Thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated article from an area temporarily designated as a quarantined area is subject to this subpart. As soon as practicable, this area either will be added to the list of designated quarantined areas in paragraph (c) of this section, or the Administrator will terminate the designation. The owner or person in possession of, or, in the case of publicly owned land, the person responsible for the management of, an area for which the designation is terminated will be given written notice of the termination as soon as practicable.
              (c) The following areas are designated as quarantined areas:

              § 301.51-4
              Conditions governing the interstate movement of regulated articles from quarantined areas.
              (a) Any regulated article may be moved interstate from a quarantined area only if moved under the following conditions:
              (1) With a certificate or limited permit issued and attached in accordance with §§ 301.51-5 and 301.51-8;
              (2) Without a certificate or limited permit if:
              (i) The regulated article is moved by the United States Department of Agriculture for experimental or scientific purposes; or
              (ii) The regulated article originates outside the quarantined area and is moved interstate through the quarantined area under the following conditions:
              (A) The points of origin and destination are indicated on a waybill accompanying the regulated article; and
              (B) The regulated article is moved through the quarantined area without stopping, or has been stored, packed, or handled at locations approved by an inspector as not posing a risk of infestation by Asian longhorned beetle; and
              (C) The article has not been combined or commingled with other articles so as to lose its individual identity.
              (b) When an inspector has probable cause to believe a person or means of conveyance is moving a regulated article interstate, the inspector is authorized to stop the person or means of conveyance to determine whether a regulated article is present and to inspect the regulated article. Articles found to be infected by an inspector, and articles not in compliance with the regulations in this subpart, may be seized, quarantined, treated, subjected to other remedial measures, destroyed, or otherwise disposed of.
            
            
              § 301.51-5
              Issuance and cancellation of certificates and limited permits.
              (a) An inspector 1
                 or person operating under a compliance agreement will issue a certificate for the interstate movement of a regulated article if he or she determines that the regulated article:
              
                
                  1 Inspectors are assigned to local offices of APHIS, which are listed in local telephone directories. Information concerning such local offices may also be obtained from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Domestic and Emergency Operations, 4700 River Road Unit 134, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1236.
              
              (1)(i) Is apparently free of Asian longhorned beetle in any stage of development, based on inspection of the regulated article; or
              (ii) Has been grown, produced, manufactured, stored, or handled in such a manner that, in the judgment of the inspector, the regulated article does not present a risk of spreading Asian longhorned beetle; and
              (2) Is to be moved in compliance with any additional conditions deemed necessary under section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) 2
                 to prevent the artificial spread of the Asian longhorned beetle; and
              
                
                  2 An inspector may hold, seize, quarantine, treat, apply other remedial measures to, destory, or otherwise dispose of plants, plant pests, or other articles in accordance with sections 414, 421, and 434 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714, 7731, and 7754).
              
              (3) Is eligible for unrestricted movement under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated articles.
              (b) An inspector or a person operating under a compliance agreement will issue a limited permit for the interstate movement of a regulated article not eligible for a certificate if he or she determines that the regulated article:
              (1) Is to be moved interstate to a specified destination for specific processing, handling, or utilization (the destination and other conditions to be listed on the limited permit), and this interstate movement will not result in the spread of Asian longhorned beetle because Asian longhorned beetle will be destroyed by the specific processing, handling, or utilization; and
              (2) It is to be moved in compliance with any additional conditions that the Administrator may impose under section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) in order to prevent the spread of the Asian longhorned beetle; and

              (3) Is eligible for unrestricted movement under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated article.
              (c) An inspector shall issue blank certificates and limited permits to a person operating under a compliance agreement in accordance with § 301.51-6 or authorize reproduction of the certificates or limited permits on shipping containers, or both, as requested by the person operating under the compliance agreement. These certificates and limited permits may then be completed and used, as needed, for the interstate movement of regulated articles that have met all of the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b), respectively, of this section.
              (d) Any certificate or limited permit may be canceled orally or in writing by an inspector whenever the inspector determines that the holder of the certificate or limited permit has not complied with this subpart or any conditions imposed under this subpart. If the cancellation is oral, the cancellation will become effective immediately, and the cancellation and the reasons for the cancellation will be confirmed in writing as soon as circumstances permit. Any person whose certificate or limited permit has been cancelled may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving the written cancellation notice. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons that the person wants the Administrator to consider in deciding the appeal. A hearing may be held to resolve a conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice for the hearing will be adopted by the Administrator. As soon as practicable, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision.

              (a) The emerald ash borer; firewood of all hardwood (non-coniferous) species; nursery stock, green lumber, and other material living, dead, cut, or fallen, including logs, stumps, roots, branches, and composted and uncomposted chips of the genus Fraxinus.
              
              (b) Any other article, product, or means of conveyance not listed in paragraph (a) of this section may be designated as a regulated article if an inspector determines that it presents a risk of spreading emerald ash borer and notifies the person in possession of the article, product, or means of conveyance that it is subject to the restrictions of the regulations.
              [68 FR 59088, Oct. 8, 2003, as amended at 70 FR 252, Jan. 4, 2005]
            
            
              § 301.53-3
              Quarantined areas.
              (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator will list as a quarantined area in paragraph (c) of this section each State or each portion of a State in which the emerald ash borer has been found by an inspector, in which the Administrator has reason to believe that the emerald ash borer is present, or that the Administrator considers necessary to regulate because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities where emerald ash borer has been found. Less than an entire State will be designated as a quarantined area only if the Administrator determines that:
              (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated articles; and

              (2) The designation of less than an entire State as a quarantined area will be adequate to prevent the artificial interstate spread of the emerald ash borer.
              (b) The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any nonquarantined area as a quarantined area in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The Administrator will give written notice of this designation to the owner or person in possession of the nonquarantined area, or, in the case of publicly owned land, to the person responsible for the management of the nonquarantined area. Thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated article from an area temporarily designated as a quarantined area is subject to this subpart. As soon as practicable, this area either will be added to the list of designated quarantined areas in paragraph (c) of this section, or the Administrator will terminate the designation. The owner or person in possession of, or, in the case of publicly owned land, the person responsible for the management of, an area for which the designation is terminated will be given written notice of the termination as soon as practicable.
              (c) The following areas are designated as quarantined areas:

              Conditions governing the interstate movement of regulated articles from quarantined areas.
              Regulated articles may be moved interstate from a quarantined area only if moved under the following conditions:
              (a) With a certificate or limited permit issued and attached in accordance with §§ 301.53-5 and 301.53-8;
              (b) Without a certificate or limited permit if:
              (1) The regulated article is moved by the United States Department of Agriculture for experimental or scientific purposes; or
              (2) The regulated article originates outside the quarantined area and is moved interstate through the quarantined area under the following conditions:
              (i) The points of origin and destination are indicated on a waybill accompanying the regulated article; and
              (ii) The regulated article, if moved through the quarantined area during the period of May 1 through August 31 or when the ambient air temperature is 40 °F or higher, is moved in an enclosed vehicle or is completely covered to prevent access by the EAB; and
              (iii) The regulated article is moved directly through the quarantined area without stopping (except for refueling or for traffic conditions, such as traffic lights or stop signs), or has been stored, packed, or handled at locations approved by an inspector as not posing a risk of infestation by emerald ash borer; and
              (iv) The article has not been combined or commingled with other articles so as to lose its individual identity.
            
            
              § 301.53-5
              Issuance and cancellation of certificates and limited permits.
              (a) An inspector 1
                 or person operating under a compliance agreement will issue a certificate for the interstate movement of a regulated article if he or she determines that the regulated article:
              
                
                  1 Inspectors are assigned to local offices of APHIS, which are listed in the local telephone directories. Information concerning such local offices may also be obtained from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Domestic and Emergency Operations, 4700 River Road Unit 134, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1236.
              
              (1)(i) Is apparently free of EAB, based on inspection; or the article or
              (ii) Has been grown, produced, manufactured, stored, or handled in a manner that, in the judgment of the inspector, prevents the regulated article from presenting a risk of spreading EAB; and

              (2) Is to be moved in compliance with any additional emergency conditions that the Administrator may impose under section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) 2
                 in order to prevent the artificial spread of emerald ash borer; and
              
                
                  2 An inspector may hold, seize, quarantine, treat, apply other remedial measures to, destroy, or otherwise dispose of plants, plant pests, or other articles in accordance with sections 414, 421, and 423 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714, 7731, and 7754).
              
              (3) Is eligible for unrestricted movement under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated articles.
              (b) An inspector or a person operating under a compliance agreement will issue a limited permit for the interstate movement of a regulated article not eligible for a certificate if he or she determines that the regulated article:
              (1) Is to be moved interstate to a specified destination for specific processing, handling, or utilization (the destination and other conditions to be listed on the limited permit), and this interstate movement will not result in the spread of emerald ash borer because emerald ash borer will be destroyed by the specific processing, handling, or utilization; and
              (2) Is to be moved in compliance with any additional emergency conditions that the Administrator may impose under section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) in order to prevent the spread of emerald ash borer; and
              (3) Is eligible for unrestricted movement under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated article.
              (c) An inspector shall issue blank certificates and limited permits to a person operating under a compliance agreement in accordance with § 301.53-6 or authorize reproduction of the certificates or limited permits on shipping containers, or both, as requested by the person operating under the compliance agreement. These certificates and limited permits may then be completed and used, as needed, for the interstate movement of regulated articles that have met all of the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b), respectively, of this section.
              (d) Any certificate or limited permit may be canceled orally or in writing by an inspector whenever the inspector determines that the holder of the certificate or limited permit has not complied with this subpart or any conditions imposed under this subpart. If the cancellation is oral, the cancellation will become effective immediately, and the cancellation and the reasons for the cancellation will be confirmed in writing as soon as circumstances permit. Any person whose certificate or limited permit has been canceled may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving the written cancellation notice. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons that the person wants the Administrator to consider in deciding the appeal. A hearing may be held to resolve a conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice for the hearing will be adopted by the Administrator. As soon as practicable, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision.

                 may issue a certificate for the interstate movement of a regulated article if the inspector determines that:
              
                
                  4 Services of an inspector may be requested by contacting local offices of Plant Protection and Quarantine, which are listed in telephone directories.
              
              (1) The regulated article to be moved and all other regulated articles on the premises have been grown and maintained indoors in a shadehouse or greenhouse and no other cactus moth host material exists on the premises outside of a shadehouse or greenhouse;
              (2) The regulated article to be moved and all other regulated articles on the premises are maintained on benches that are kept separate from benches containing non-host material;

              (3) The regulated article to be moved and all other regulated articles on the premises have been placed on a 21-day insecticide spray cycle and have been sprayed with Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki, carbaryl, spinosad, or imidaploprid if maintained in the nursery for longer than 21 days;

              (4) The regulated article to be moved has been sprayed with Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki, carbaryl, spinosad, or imidaploprid 3 to 5 days prior to shipment and inspected and found free of cactus moth egg sticks and larval damage; and

              (5) If the regulated article was moved into the premises from another premises in a quarantined area listed in § 301.55-3, it was immediately placed inside the shadehouse or greenhouse and sprayed with Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki, carbaryl, spinosad, or imidaploprid within 24 hours.
              (b) An inspector will issue a limited permit for the interstate movement of a regulated article if the inspector determines that:
              (1) The regulated article is to be moved interstate to a specified destination for specified handling, processing, or utilization (the destination and other conditions to be listed in the limited permit), and this interstate movement will not result in the spread of the South American cactus moth because life stages of the South American cactus moth will be destroyed by the specified handling, processing, or utilization;
              (2) It is to be moved in compliance with any additional conditions that the Administrator may impose under section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) in order to prevent the spread of the South American cactus moth; and
              (3) It is eligible for unrestricted movement under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated article.
              (c) Certificates and limited permits for the interstate movement of regulated articles may be issued by an inspector or person operating under a compliance agreement. A person operating under a compliance agreement may issue a certificate or limited permit for interstate movement of a regulated article after an inspector has determined that the regulated article is eligible for a certificate or limited permit in accordance with paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section.
              (d) Any certificate or limited permit that has been issued may be canceled, either orally or in writing, by an inspector whenever the inspector determines that the holder of the limited permit has not complied with this subpart or any conditions imposed under this subpart. If the cancellation is oral, the cancellation will become effective immediately, and the cancellation and the reasons for the cancellation will be confirmed in writing as soon as circumstances permit. Any person whose certificate or limited permit has been canceled may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving the written cancellation notice. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons that the person wants the Administrator to consider in deciding the appeal. A hearing may be held to resolve a conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice for the hearing will be adopted by the Administrator. As soon as practicable, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision.

                  5 Compliance agreement forms are available without charge from local Plant Protection and Quarantine offices, which are listed in telephone directories.
              
              (b) Any compliance agreement may be canceled, either orally or in writing, by an inspector whenever the inspector finds that the person who has entered into the compliance agreement has failed to comply with this subpart or the terms of the compliance agreement. If the cancellation is oral, the cancellation and the reasons for the cancellation will be confirmed in writing as promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose compliance agreement has been canceled may appeal the decision, in writing, to the Administrator, within 10 days after receiving written notification of the cancellation. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the compliance agreement was wrongfully canceled. As promptly as circumstances allow, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision. A hearing will be held to resolve any conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice concerning a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.

              (ii) All other orchard owners. Owners of commercial stone fruit orchards who meet the eligibility requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section will be compensated according to the following table on a per-acre basis at a rate based on the age of the trees destroyed. If the trees were not destroyed by the date specified on the emergency action notification, the compensation payment will be reduced by 10 percent and by any tree removal costs incurred by the State or the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The maximum USDA compensation rate is 85 percent of the loss in value, adjusted for any State-provided compensation to ensure total compensation from all sources does not exceed 100 percent of the loss in value.

              (2) Owners of fruit tree nurseries. Owners of fruit tree nurseries who meet the eligibility requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section will be compensated for up to 85 percent of the net revenues lost from their first and second year crops as the result of the issuance of an emergency action notification which will be calculated as follows:
              (i) First year crop. The net revenue loss for trees that were expected to be sold in the year during which the emergency action notification was issued (i.e., the first year crop) will be calculated as (expected number of trees to be sold) × (average price per tree) − (digging, grading, and storage costs) = net revenue lost for first year crop, where:
              (A) The expected number of trees to be sold equals the number of trees in the field minus 2 percent culls minus 3 percent unsold trees; and
              (B) The average price per tree is $5.22 for plum and apricot trees and $3.69 for peach and nectarine trees; and
              (C) Digging, grading and storage costs are $0.10 per tree.
              (ii) Second year crop. The net revenue loss for trees that would be expected to be sold in the year following the year during which the emergency action notification was issued (i.e., the second year crop) will be calculated as (expected number of trees to be sold) × (average price per tree) = net revenue lost for second year crop, where:

              (A) The expected number of trees to be sold equals the number of budded trees in the field minus 20 percent death loss minus 2 percent culls; and
              
              (B) The average price per tree is $5.22 for plum and apricot trees and $3.69 for peach and nectarine trees.
              (3) Owners of non-fruit-bearing ornamental tree nurseries. Owners of non-fruit-bearing ornamental tree nurseries who meet the eligibility requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section will be compensated for up to 85 percent of the net revenues lost from their crop as the result of the issuance of an emergency action notification. Net revenues will be calculated using an average price of $10.80 per tree or shrub.
              (c) How to apply. The form necessary to submit a claim for compensation may be obtained from the National Director of the Plum Pox Eradication Program contact listed at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info/plum_pox/index.shtml. Claims for trees or nursery stock destroyed on or before February 3, 2012 must be received within 60 days after February 3, 2012. Claims for trees or nursery stock destroyed after February 3, 2012 must be received within 60 days after the destruction of the trees or nursery stock. Claims must be submitted as follows:

                (b) Kumquat (Fortunella spp.) plants, with or without fruit attached, may be moved interstate from a quarantined area into any area of the United States except commercial citrus-producing areas if all of the following conditions are met:
                (1) The plants are own-root-only and have not been grafted or budded;
                (2) The plants are started, are grown, and have been maintained solely at the nursery from which they will be moved interstate.
                (3) If the plants are not grown from seed, then the cuttings used for propagation of the plants are taken from plants located on the same nursery premises or from another nursery that is eligible to produce kumquat plants for interstate movement under the requirements of this paragraph (b). Cuttings may not be obtained from properties where citrus canker is present.
                (4) All citrus plants at the nursery premises have undergone State inspection and have been found to be free of citrus canker no less than three times. The inspections must be at intervals of 30 to 45 days, with the most recent inspection being within 30 days of the date on which the plants are removed and packed for shipment.
                (5) All vehicles, equipment, and other articles used in providing inspection, maintenance, or related services in the nursery must be treated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter before entering the nursery to prevent the introduction of citrus canker. All personnel who enter the nursery to provide these services must be treated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter before entering the nursery to prevent the introduction of citrus canker.
                (6) If citrus canker is found in the nursery, all regulated plants and plant material must be removed from the nursery and all areas of the nursery's facilities where plants are grown and all associated equipment and tools used at the nursery must be treated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter in order for the nursery to be eligible to produce kumquat plants to be moved interstate under this paragraph (b). Fifteen days after these actions are completed, the nursery may receive new kumquat seed or cuttings from a nursery that is eligible to produce kumquat plants for interstate movement under this paragraph (b).
                (7) The plants, except for plants that are hermetically sealed in plastic bags before leaving the nursery, are completely enclosed in containers or vehicle compartments during movement through the quarantined area.

                (8) The kumquat plants or trees are accompanied by a limited permit issued in accordance with § 301.75-12.

              § 301.76-2
              Regulated articles for Asian citrus psyllid and citrus greening.
              The following are regulated articles for Asian citrus psyllid and citrus greening:

              (a) All plants and plant parts (including leaves), except fruit, of: Aegle marmelos, Aeglopsis chevalieri, Afraegle gabonensis, A.
                paniculata, Amyris madrensis, Atalantia spp. (including Atalantia monophylla), Balsamocitrus dawei, Bergera (=Murraya) koenigii, Calodendrum capense, Choisya ternate, C.

              (b) Propagative seed of the species listed in paragraph (a) of this section is considered a host of citrus greening but not a host of Asian citrus psyllid. Therefore, notwithstanding the other provisions of this subpart, the movement of propagative seed of these species from an area quarantined for citrus greening is prohibited, while the movement of such seed from an area quarantined only for Asian citrus psyllid, but not for citrus greening, is allowed without restriction.
              (c) Any other product, article, or means of conveyance may be designated a regulated article for Asian citrus psyllid or citrus greening, if an inspector determines that it presents a risk of spreading these pests, and after the inspector provides written notification to the person in possession of the product, article, or means of conveyance that it is subject to the restrictions of this subpart.
              (d) Plant parts of the species listed in paragraph (a) of this section may be exempted from the regulations in this subpart, provided that the parts have been processed such that an inspector determines they no longer present a risk of spreading Asian citrus psyllid or citrus greening.
            
            
              § 301.76-3
              Quarantined areas; citrus greening and Asian citrus psyllid.

              (a) The Administrator will designate an area as a quarantined area for citrus greening or as a quarantined area for Asian citrus psyllid in accordance with the criteria listed in paragraph (c) of this section. The Administrator will publish a description of all areas quarantined for citrus greening or Asian citrus psyllid on the Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) Web site: (http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info/citrus_greening/index.shtml). The description of each quarantined area will include the date the description was last updated and a description of any changes that have been made to the quarantined area. Lists of all quarantined areas may also be obtained by request from any local office of PPQ; local offices are listed in telephone directories and on the Internet at (http://www.aphis.usda.gov/services/report_pest_disease/report_pest_disease.shtml). After a change is made to the description of quarantined areas, we will publish a notice in the Federal Register informing the public that the change has occurred and describing the change to the quarantined areas.
              (b) Designation of an area less than an entire State as a quarantined area. Less than an entire State will be designated as a quarantined area for citrus greening or the Asian citrus psyllid only if the Administrator determines that:
              (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated articles; and
              (2) The designation of less than the entire State as a quarantined area will prevent the interstate spread of citrus greening or Asian citrus psyllid.
              (c) Criteria for designation of a State, or a portion of a State, as a quarantined area for citrus greening or Asian citrus psyllid. (1) A State, or portion of a State, will be designated as a quarantined area for citrus greening when the presence of citrus greening is confirmed within the area by an APHIS-administered test.
              (2) A State, or portion of a State, will be designated as a quarantined area for Asian citrus psyllid in which an established population of Asian citrus psyllids has been detected.
              (3) A State, or portion of a State, will be designated as a quarantined area for either citrus greening or Asian citrus psyllid if the Administrator considers it necessary to quarantine the area because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities in which citrus greening or an established population of Asian citrus psyllids has been found.
            
            
              § 301.76-4
              Labeling requirements for regulated nursery stock produced within an area quarantined for citrus greening.
              (a) Effective September 15, 2010, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, all regulated nursery stock offered for commercial sale within an area quarantined for citrus greening must have an APHIS-approved plastic or metal tag on which a statement alerting consumers to Federal prohibitions regarding the interstate movement of the article is prominently and legibly displayed. Alternatively, if the article is destined for commercial sale in a box or container, the statement may be printed on the box or container, or printed on a label permanently affixed to the box or container, provided that, in either case, the statement is prominently and legibly displayed. The operator of the site of propagation of the nursery stock and the person offering the plants for commercial sale are jointly responsible for all such labeling.
              (b) Nursery stock produced within a quarantined area for planting in a commercial citrus grove within that same area and moved directly to that grove, without movement outside of the quarantined area, may be moved without being labeled in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
              (c) Nursery stock that will be moved interstate in accordance with § 301.76-7 may be moved without being labeled in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.

              (a) Certificates. In addition to all other relevant conditions within this subpart, an inspector or person operating under a compliance agreement will issue a certificate only if a regulated article:
              (1) Will be moved in compliance with any additional emergency conditions that the Administrator may impose under section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) 2
                 to prevent the spread of Asian citrus psyllid; and
              
                
                  2 An inspector may hold seize, quarantine, treat, apply other remedial measures to, destroy, or otherwise dispose of plants, plant pests, or other articles in accordance with sections 414, 421, and 423 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714, 7731, and 7754).
              

              (2) Is eligible for unrestricted movement under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the article.
              
              (b) Limited permits. In addition to all other relevant conditions within this subpart, an inspector or person operating under a compliance agreement may issue a limited permit for the interstate movement of a regulated article only if the regulated article:
              (1) Is to be moved interstate to a specified destination for specified handling, processing, or utilization (the destination and other conditions to be listed in the limited permit) and this movement of the regulated article will not result in the spread of citrus greening or the Asian citrus psyllid;
              (2) Is to be moved in compliance with any additional emergency conditions the Administrator may impose under section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) to prevent the spread of citrus greening and the Asian citrus psyllid; and
              (3) Is eligible for interstate movement under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the article.
              (c) Certificates and limited permits for the interstate movement of a regulated article may be issued by an inspector or person operating under a compliance agreement. A person operating under a compliance agreement may issue a certificate for the interstate movement of a regulated article after he or she has determined that the article is eligible for a certificate in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and all other relevant conditions of this subpart. A person operating under a compliance agreement may issue a limited permit for interstate movement of a regulated article after he or she has determined that the article is eligible for a limited permit in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section and all other relevant conditions of this subpart.
              (d) Any certificate or limited permit that has been issued may be withdrawn, either orally or in writing, by an inspector if he or she determines that the holder of the certificate or limited permit has not complied with all of the provisions in this subpart or has not complied with all the conditions contained in the certificate or limited permit. If the withdrawal is oral, the withdrawal and the reasons for the withdrawal will be confirmed in writing as soon as circumstances allow. Any person whose certificate or limited permit has been withdrawn may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving the written notification of the withdrawal. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the certificate or limited permit was wrongfully withdrawn. As promptly as circumstances allow, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision. A hearing will be held to resolve any conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice concerning a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.
              (e) Unless specific provisions exist in § 301.76-6 or § 301.76-7 of this subpart to allow the interstate movement of a certain regulated article, the interstate movement of that article is prohibited.
              (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0579-0363)

              § 301.76-7
              Additional conditions for issuance of certificates and limited permits for regulated articles moved interstate from areas quarantined for citrus greening.
              (a) Additional conditions for the issuance of a certificate; regulated nursery stock produced within a nursery located in the quarantined area. In addition to the general conditions for issuance of a certificate contained in § 301.76-5(a), an inspector or person operating under a compliance agreement may issue a certificate for interstate movement of regulated nursery stock to any State if all of the following conditions are met:

              (1) The nursery in which the nursery stock is produced has entered into a compliance agreement with APHIS in which it agrees to meet the relevant construction standards, sourcing and certification requirements, cleaning, disinfecting, and safeguarding requirements, labeling requirements, and recordkeeping and inspection requirements specified in a PPQ protocol document. The protocol document will be provided to the person at the time he or she enters into the compliance agreement. 6
                 The compliance agreement may also specify additional conditions determined by APHIS to be necessary in order to prevent the dissemination of citrus greening under which the nursery stock must be grown, maintained, and shipped in order to obtain a certificate for its movement. The compliance agreement will also specify that APHIS may amend the agreement.
              
                

                  6 The protocol document is also available on the Internet at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info/citrus/index.shtml and may be obtained from local Plant Protection and Quarantine offices, which are listed in telephone directories.
              
              (2) An inspector has determined that the nursery has adhered to all terms and conditions of the compliance agreement.
              (3) The nursery stock is completely enclosed in a sealed container that is clearly labeled with the certificate and is moved interstate in that container.
              (4) A copy of the certificate is attached to the consignee's copy of the accompanying waybill.
              (b) Additional conditions for issuance of a limited permit; regulated nursery stock grown, produced, or maintained at a nursery or other facility located in the quarantined area. In addition to the general conditions for issuance of a limited permit contained in § 301.76-5(b), an inspector or person operating under a compliance agreement may issue a limited permit for the interstate movement for immediate export of regulated nursery stock grown, produced, or maintained at a nursery or other facility located in the quarantined area if:
              (1) The nursery stock is treated for Asian citrus psyllid with an APHIS-approved soil drench or in-ground granular application, followed by an APHIS-approved foliar spray, in accordance with § 301.76-6(b)(1), or with methyl bromide, in accordance with 7 CFR part 305 of this chapter.
              (2) The nursery stock is inspected by an inspector in accordance with § 301.76-9 and found free of Asian citrus psyllid, if treated in accordance with § 301.76-6(b)(1).
              (3) The nursery stock is affixed prior to movement with a plastic or metal tag on which the statement “Limited permit: USDA-APHIS-PPQ. For immediate export only” is prominently and legibly displayed. If the nursery stock is destined for movement or sale in a box or container, the statement may be printed on the box or container, or printed on a label permanently affixed to the box or container, provided that, in either case, the statement is prominently and legibly displayed.
              (4) The nursery stock is accompanied by a copy of this limited permit attached to the consignee's copy of the waybill.
              (5) The nursery stock is moved in accordance with the conditions specified on the limited permit directly to the port of export specified on the limit permit, in a container sealed with an agricultural seal placed by an inspector.
              (6) A copy of the limited permit is attached to or legibly printed on this container.
              (7) The nursery stock remains in this container, and the container remains sealed, as long as the plants are within the United States.
              (c) Except for nursery stock for which a limited permit has been issued in accordance with the conditions of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, no other regulated article may be moved interstate from an area quarantined for citrus greening.

              (b) Any compliance agreement may be canceled, either orally or in writing, by an inspector whenever the inspector finds that the person who has entered into the compliance agreement has failed to comply with this subpart, or any term or condition of the compliance agreement itself. If the cancellation is oral, the cancellation and the reasons for the cancellation will be confirmed in writing as promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose compliance agreement has been canceled may appeal the decision, in writing, within 10 days after receiving written notification of the cancellation. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the compliance agreement was wrongly canceled. As promptly as circumstances allow, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision. A hearing will be held to resolve any conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice concerning a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.

                 no more than 72 hours prior to movement. The person who desires to move the articles interstate must notify the inspector as far in advance of the desired interstate movement as possible. The articles must be inspected at the place and in the manner the inspector designates as necessary to comply with this subpart. If the inspector has reason to believe that the interstate movement of the articles may lead to the artificial spread of citrus greening or Asian citrus psyllid, he or she may deny issuance of a limited permit for interstate movement of the article or take other remedial measures to prohibit such spread.

                § 301.80-2
                Authorization to designate, and terminate designation of, regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas; and to exempt articles from certification, permit, or other requirements.
                (a) Regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas. The Deputy Administrator shall designate as regulated areas, in a supplemental regulation designated as § 301.80-2a, each quarantined State, or each portion thereof in which witchweed has been found or in which there is reason to believe that witchweed is present or which it is deemed necessary to regulate because of its proximity to infestation or its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested localities. The Deputy Administrator, in the supplemental regulation, may designate any regulated area or portion thereof, as a suppressive area or a generally infested area in accordance with the definitions thereof in § 301.80-1. Less than an entire quarantined State will be designated as a regulated area only if the Deputy Administrator is of the opinion that:
                (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or regulation which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under this subpart; and
                (2) The designation of less than the entire State as a regulated area will otherwise be adequate to prevent the interstate spread of witchweed.
                (b) Temporary designation of regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas. The Deputy Administrator or an authorized inspector may temporarily designate any other premises in a quarantined State as a regulated area and may designate the regulated area or portions thereof as a suppressive or generally infested area, in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section for designating such area, by serving written notice thereof on the owner or person in possession of such premises, and thereafter the interstate movement of regulated articles from such premises by any person having notice of the designation shall be subject to the applicable provisions of this subpart. As soon as practicable, such premises shall be added to the list in § 301.80-2a if a basis then exists for their designation.
                (c) Termination of designation as a regulated area and a suppressive or generally infested area. The Deputy Administrator shall terminate the designation provided for under paragraph (a) of this section of any area designated as a regulated area or a suppressive or a generally infested area when he determines that such designation is no longer required under the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The Deputy Administrator or an inspector shall terminate the designation provided for under paragraph (b) of this section of any premises designated as a regulated area or a suppressive or a generally infested area when he determines that such designation is no longer required under the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section, and notice thereof shall be given to the owner or person in possession of the premises.
                (d) Exemption of articles from certification, permit, or other requirements. The Deputy Administrator may, in a supplemental regulation designated as § 301.80-2b, list regulated articles or movements of regulated articles which shall be exempt from the certification, permit, or other requirements of this subpart under such conditions as he may prescribe, if he finds that facts exist as to the pest risk involved in the movement of such regulated articles which make it safe to so relieve such requirements.

                Issuance and cancellation of certificates and permits.
                (a) Certificates may be issued for any regulated articles (except soil samples for processing, testing, or analysis) by an inspector if he determines that they are eligible for certification for movement to any destination under all Federal domestic plant quarantines applicable to such articles and:
                (1) Have originated in noninfested premises in a regulated area and have not been exposed to infestation while within the regulated areas; or
                (2) Have been treated to destroy infestation in accordance with the treatment manual; or
                (3) Have been grown, produced, manufactured, stored, or handled in such a manner that no infestation would be transmitted thereby.
                (b) Limited permits may be issued by an inspector to allow interstate movement of regulated articles (except soil samples for processing, testing, or analysis) not eligible for certification under this subpart, to specified destinations for limited handling, utilization, or processing, or for treatment in accordance with the treatment manual, when upon evaluation of the circumstances involved in each specific case he determines that such movement will not result in the spread of witchweed and requirements of other applicable Federal domestic plant quarantines have been met.
                (c) Restricted destination permits may be issued by an inspector to allow the interstate movement (for other than scientific purposes) of regulated articles (except soil samples for processing, testing, or analysis) to any destination permitted under all applicable Federal domestic plant quarantines if such articles are not eligible for certification under all such quarantines but would otherwise qualify for certification under this subpart.
                (d) Scientific permits to allow the interstate movement of regulated articles, and certificates or permits to allow the movement of soil samples for processing, testing, or analysis in emergency situations, may be issued by the Deputy Administrator under such conditions as may be prescribed in each specific case by the Deputy Administrator to prevent the spread of witchweed.

                (e) Certificate, limited permit, and restricted destination permit forms may be issued by an inspector to any person for use by the latter for subsequent shipments of regulated articles (except soil samples for processing, testing, or analysis) provided such person is operating under a compliance agreement; and any such person may be authorized by an inspector to reproduce such forms on shipping containers or otherwise. Any such person may execute and issue the certificate forms, or reproductions of such forms, for the interstate movement of regulated articles from the premises of such person identified in the compliance agreement if such person has treated such regulated articles to destroy infestation in accordance with the treatment manual, and if such regulated articles are eligible for certification for movement to any destination under all Federal domestic plant quarantines applicable to such articles. Any such person may execute and issue the limited permit forms, or reproductions of such forms, for interstate movement of regulated articles to specified destinations when the inspector has made the determinations specified in paragraph (b) of this section. Any such person may execute and issue the restricted destination permit forms, or reproductions of such forms, for the interstate movement of regulated articles not eligible for certification under all Federal domestic plant quarantines applicable to such articles, under the conditions specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
                (f) Any certificate or permit which has been issued or authorized may be withdrawn by the inspector or the Deputy Administrator if he determines that the holder thereof has not complied with any condition for the use of such document imposed by this subpart. As soon as possible after such withdrawal, the holder of the certificate or permit shall be notified in writing by the Deputy Administrator or an inspector of the reason therefor and afforded reasonable opportunity to present his views thereon, and if there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall be held to resolve such conflict.

                (b) Less than an entire State will be listed as a quarantined area only if the Administrator determines that:
                (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles listed in § 301.81-2 that are equivalent to the interstate movement restrictions imposed by this subpart; and

                (d) The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any nonquarantined area as a quarantined area in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. The Administrator will give written notice of this designation to the owner or person in possession of the nonquarantined area, or, in the case of publicly owned land, to the person responsible for the management of the nonquarantined area; thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated article from an area temporarily designated as a quarantined area is subject to this subpart. As soon as practicable, this area either will be added to the list of designated quarantined areas in paragraph (e) of this section, or the Administrator will terminate the designation. The owner or person in possession of, or, in the case of publicly owned land, the person responsible for the management of, an area for which the designation is terminated will be given written notice of the termination as soon as practicable.

                (ii) Has been grown, produced, manufactured, stored, or handled in a manner that would prevent infestation or destroy all life stages of the imported fire ant;
                (iii) Has been treated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter; or.
                (iv) If the article is containerized nursery stock, it has been produced in accordance with § 301.81-11.
                (b) An inspector will issue a limited permit for the interstate movement of a regulated article not eligible for a certificate if the inspector determines that the regulated article:
                (1) Is to be moved interstate to a specified destination for specified handling, utilization, or processing (the destination and other conditions to be listed in the limited permit), and this interstate movement will not result in the spread of the imported fire ant because the imported fire ant will be destroyed by the specified handling, utilization, or processing;
                (2) Is to be moved interstate in compliance with any conditions that the Administrator may impose under section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) to prevent the spread of the imported fire ant; and
                (3) Is eligible for interstate movement under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated article.
                (c) An inspector shall issue blank certificates to a person operating under a compliance agreement (in accordance with § 301.81-6 of this subpart) or authorize reproduction of the certificates on shipping containers, or both, as requested by the person operating under the compliance agreement. These certificates may then be completed and used, as needed, for the interstate movement of regulated articles that have met all of the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

                § 301.81-11
                Imported fire ant detection, control, exclusion, and enforcement program for nurseries producing containerized plants.

                This detection, control, exclusion, and enforcement program is designed to keep nurseries free of the imported fire ant and provides a basis to certify containerized nursery stock for interstate movement. Participating regulated establishments must be operating under a compliance agreement in accordance with § 301.81-6. Such compliance agreements shall state the specific requirements that a shipper agrees to follow to move plants in accordance with the requirements of the program. Certificates and a nursery identification number may be issued to the nursery for use on shipments of regulated articles.
                (a) Detection. (1) Nursery owners are required to visually survey their entire premises twice monthly for the presence of imported fire ants.
                (2) Nurseries participating in this program will be inspected by Federal or State inspectors at least twice per year. More frequent inspections may be necessary depending upon imported fire ant infestation levels immediately surrounding the nursery, the thoroughness of nursery management in maintaining imported-fire-ant-free premises, and the number of previous detections of imported fire ants in or near containerized plants. Inspections by Federal and State inspectors should be more frequent just before and during the peak shipping season. Any nurseries determined during nursery inspections to have imported fire ant colonies must be immediately treated to the extent necessary to eliminate the colonies.
                (b) Control. Nursery plants that are shipped under this program must originate in a nursery that meets the requirements of this section. Nursery owners must implement a treatment program with registered bait and contact insecticides. The premises, including growing and holding areas, must be maintained free of the imported fire ant. As part of this treatment program, all exposed soil surfaces (including sod and mulched areas) on property where plants are grown, potted, stored, handled, loaded, unloaded, or sold must be treated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter at least once every 6 months. The first application must be performed early in the spring. Followup treatments with a contact insecticide in accordance with part 305 of this chapter must be applied to eliminate all remaining colonies.
                (c) Exclusion. (1) For plants grown on the premises, treatment of soil or potting media in accordance with part 305 of this chapter prior to planting is required.
                (2) For plants received from outside sources, to prevent the spread into a nursery free of the imported fire ant by newly introduced, infested nursery plants, all plants must be:
                (i) Obtained from nurseries that comply with the requirements of this section and that operate under a compliance agreement in accordance with § 301.81-6; or
                (ii) Treated upon delivery in accordance with part 305 of this chapter, and within the specified number of days be either:
                (A) Repotted in treated potting soil media;
                (B) Retreated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter at the specified interval; or
                (C) Shipped.
                (d) Enforcement. (1) The nursery owner must maintain records of the nursery's surveys and treatments for the imported fire ant. These records must be made available to State and Federal inspectors upon request.
                (2) If imported fire ants are detected in nursery stock during an inspection by a Federal or State inspector, issuance of certificates for movement will be suspended until necessary treatments are applied and the plants and nursery premises are determined to be free of the imported fire ant. A Federal or State inspector may declare a nursery to be free of the imported fire ant upon reinspection of the premises. This inspection must be conducted no sooner than 30 days after treatment. During this period, certification may be based upon treatments for plants in accordance with part 305 of this chapter.

                (3) Upon notification by the department of agriculture in any State of destination that a confirmed imported fire ant infestation was found on a shipment from a nursery considered free of the imported fire ant, the department of agriculture in the State of origin must cease its certification of shipments from that nursery. An investigation by Federal or State inspectors will commence immediately to determine the probable source of the problem and to ensure that the problem is resolved. If the problem is an infestation, issuance of certification for movement on the basis of imported-fire-ant-free premises will be suspended until treatment and elimination of the infestation is completed. Reinstatement into the program will be granted upon determination that the nursery premises are free of the imported fire ant, and that all other provisions of this subpart are being followed.
                (4) In cases where the issuance of certificates is suspended through oral notification, the suspension and the reasons for the suspension will be confirmed in writing within 20 days of the oral notification of the suspension. Any person whose issuance of certificates has been suspended may appeal the decision, in writing, within 10 days after receiving the written suspension notice. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons that the person wants the Administrator to consider in deciding the appeal. A hearing may be held to resolve any conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice for the hearing will be adopted by the Administrator. As soon as practicable, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision.

                Authorization to designate, and terminate designation of, regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas; and to exempt articles from certification, permit, or other requirements.
                (a) Regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas. The Deputy Administrator shall list as regulated areas, in a supplemental regulation designated as § 301.85-2a, each quarantined State; or each portion thereof in which golden nematode has been found or in which there is reason to believe that golden nematode is present, or which it is deemed necessary to regulate because of their proximity to infestation or their inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested localities. The Deputy Administrator, in the supplemental regulation, may divide any regulated area into a suppressive area or a generally infested area in accordance with the definitions thereof in § 301.85-1. Less than an entire quarantined State will be designated as a regulated area only if the Deputy Administrator is of the opinion that:
                (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or regulation which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under this subpart; and
                (2) The designation of less than the entire State as a regulated area will otherwise be adequate to prevent the interstate spread of the golden nematode.
                (b) Temporary designation of regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas. The Deputy Administrator or an authorized inspector may temporarily designate any other premises in a quarantined State as a regulated area and a suppressive or generally infested area, in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section for listing such area, by serving written notice thereof on the owner or person in possession of such premises, and thereafter the interstate movement of regulated articles from such premises by any person having notice of the designation shall be subject to the applicable provisions of this subpart. As soon as practicable, such premises shall be added to the list in § 301.85-2a if a basis then exists for their designation; otherwise the designation shall be terminated by the Deputy Administrator or an authorized inspector and notice thereof shall be given to the owner or person in possession of the premises.
                (c) Termination of designation as a regulated area and a suppressive or generally infested area. The Deputy Administrator shall terminate the designation provided for under paragraph (a) of this section of any area listed as a regulated area and suppressive or generally infested area when he determines that such designation is no longer required under the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
                (d) Exemption of articles from certification, permit, or other requirements. The Deputy Administrator may, in a supplemental regulation designated as § 301.85-2b, list regulated articles or movements of regulated articles which shall be exempt from the certification, permit, or other requirements of this subpart under such conditions as he or she may prescribe, if he or she finds that facts exist as to the pest risk involved in the movement of such regulated articles which make it safe to so relieve such requirements.

                § 301.85-4
                Issuance and cancellation of certificates and permits.
                (a) Certificates may be issued for any regulated articles (except soil samples for processing, testing, or analysis) by an inspector if the inspector determines that they are eligible for certification for movement to any destination under all Federal domestic plant quarantines applicable to such articles and:
                (1) Have originated in noninfested premises in a regulated area and have not been exposed to infestation while within the regulated areas; or
                (2) Have been treated to destroy infestation in accordance with part 305 of this chapter; or
                (3) Have been grown, produced, manufactured, stored, or handled in such a manner that no infestation would be transmitted thereby.
                (b) Limited permits may be issued by an inspector to allow interstate movement of regulated articles (except soil samples for processing, testing or analysis) not eligible for certification under this subpart, to specified destinations for limited handling, utilization, or processing, or for treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter, when, upon evaluation of the circumstances involved in each specific case he determines that such movement will not result in the spread of the golden nematode and requirements of other applicable Federal domestic plant quarantines have been met.
                (c) Restricted destination permits may be issued by an inspector to allow the interstate movement (for other than scientific purposes) of regulated articles (except soil samples for processing, testing, or analysis) to any destination permitted under all applicable Federal domestic plant quarantines if such articles are not eligible for certification under all such quarantines but would otherwise qualify for certification under this subpart.
                (d) Scientific permits to allow the interstate movement of regulated articles and certificates or permits to allow the movement of soil samples for processing, testing, or analysis in emergency situations may be issued by the Deputy Administrator under such conditions as may be prescribed in each specific case by the Deputy Administrator to prevent the spread of the golden nematode.

                (e) Certificate, limited permit, and restricted destination permit forms may be issued by an inspector to any person for use for subsequent shipments of regulated articles (except for soil samples for processing, testing, or analysis) provided such person is operating under a compliance agreement; and any such person may be authorized by an inspector to reproduce such forms on shipping containers or otherwise. Any such person may execute and issue the certificate forms, or reproductions of such forms, for the interstate movement of regulated articles from the premises of such person identified in the compliance agreement if such person has treated such regulated articles to destroy infestation in accordance with part 305 of this chapter, and if such regulated articles are eligible for certification for movement to any destination under all Federal domestic plant quarantines applicable to such articles. Any such person may execute and issue the limited permit forms, or reproductions of such forms, for interstate movement of regulated articles to specified destinations when the inspector has made the determinations specified in paragraph (b) of this section. Any such person may execute and issue the restricted destination permit forms, or reproductions of such forms, for the interstate movement of regulated articles not eligible for certification under all Federal domestic plant quarantines applicable to such articles, under the conditions specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
                (f) Any certificate or permit which has been issued or authorized may be withdrawn by the inspector or the Deputy Administrator if he or she determines that the holder thereof has not complied with any condition for the use of such document imposed by this subpart. Prior to such withdrawal, the holder of the certificate of permit shall be notified of the proposed action and the reason therefor and afforded reasonable opportunity to present his or her views thereon.

              § 301.86-3
              Quarantined areas.
              (a) Designation of quarantined areas. In accordance with the criteria listed in paragraph (c) of this section, the Administrator will designate as a quarantined area each field that has been found to be infested with pale cyst nematode, each field that has been found to be associated with an infested field, and any area that the Administrator considers necessary to quarantine because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested or associated fields. The Administrator will publish the description of the quarantined area on the Plant Protection and Quarantine Web site, http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info/potato/pcn.shtml. The description of the quarantined area will include the date the description was last updated and a description of the changes that have been made to the quarantined area. The description of the quarantined area may also be obtained by request from any local office of PPQ; local offices are listed in telephone directories. After a change is made to the quarantined area, we will publish a notice in the Federal Register informing the public that the change has occurred and describing the change to the quarantined area.
              (b) Designation of an area less than an entire State as a quarantined area. Less than an entire State will be designated as a quarantined area only if the Administrator determines that:
              (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated articles; and
              (2) The designation of less than the entire State as a quarantined area will prevent the interstate spread of the pale cyst nematode.
              (c) Criteria for designation of fields as infested fields and associated fields. (1) 
                Infested fields. The Administrator will designate a field as an infested field when a pale cyst nematode is found in the field.
              (2) Associated fields. The Administrator will designate a field as an associated field when pale cyst nematode host crops, as listed in § 301.86-2(b), have been grown in the field in the last 10 years and
              (i) The field shares a border with an infested field; or
              (ii) The field came into contact with a regulated article listed in § 301.86-2 from an infested field within the last 10 years; or
              (iii) Within the last 10 years, the field shared ownership, tenancy, seed, drainage or runoff, farm machinery, or other elements of shared cultural practices with an infested field that could allow spread of the pale cyst nematode, as determined by the Administrator.
              (d) Removal of fields from quarantine—(1) Infested fields. An infested field will be removed from quarantine when a protocol approved by the Administrator as sufficient to support removal of infested fields from quarantine has been completed and the field has been found to be free of pale cyst nematode.
              (2) Associated fields. An associated field will be removed from quarantine when the field has been found to be free of pale cyst nematode according to a protocol approved by the Administrator as sufficient to support removal of associated fields from quarantine.
              (3) Removal of other areas from quarantine. If the Administrator has quarantined any area other than infested or associated fields because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested or associated fields, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, that area will be removed from quarantine when the relevant infested or associated fields are removed from quarantine.

              (a) Any regulated article may be moved interstate from a quarantined area only if moved under the following conditions:
              (1) With a certificate or limited permit issued and attached in accordance with §§ 301.86-5 and 301.86-8;
              (2) Without a certificate or limited permit if:
              (i) The regulated article is moved by the United States Department of Agriculture for experimental or scientific purposes; or
              (ii) The regulated article originates outside the quarantined area and is moved interstate through the quarantined area under the following conditions:
              (A) The points of origin and destination are indicated on a waybill accompanying the regulated article; and
              (B) The regulated article is moved through the quarantined area without stopping (except for refueling and for traffic conditions such as traffic lights and stop signs); and
              (C) The regulated article is not unpacked or unloaded in the quarantined area; and
              (D) The article has not been combined or commingled with other articles so as to lose its individual identity.
              (b) When an inspector has probable cause to believe a person or means of conveyance is moving a regulated article interstate, the inspector is authorized to stop the person or means of conveyance to determine whether a regulated article is present and to inspect the regulated article. Articles found to be infested by an inspector, and articles not in compliance with the regulations in this subpart, may be seized, quarantined, treated, subjected to other remedial measures, destroyed, or otherwise disposed of.

              (a) Certificates. An inspector 3

                 or person operating under a compliance agreement may issue a certificate for the interstate movement of a regulated article if the inspector determines that the regulated article satisfies the general requirements for a certificate in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and any requirements that may apply to the regulated article under paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(7) of this section.
              
                
                  3 Inspectors are assigned to local offices of APHIS, which are listed in local telephone directories. Information concerning such local offices may also be obtained from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Domestic and Emergency Operations, 4700 River Road Unit 134, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1236.
              
              (1) Certification requirements for all regulated articles. The regulated article must be moved in compliance with any additional emergency conditions the Administrator may impose under section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) 4
                 to prevent the spread of the pale cyst nematode. In addition, the regulated article must be eligible for unrestricted movement under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated article.
              
                
                  4 Section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) provides that the Secretary of Agriculture may, under certain conditions, hold, seize, quarantine, treat, apply other remedial measures to destroy or otherwise dispose of any plant, plant pest, plant product, article, or means of conveyance that is moving, or has moved into or through the United States or interstate if the Secretary has reason to believe the article is a plant pest or is infested with a plant pest at the time of movement.
              
              (2) Certification requirements for nursery stock—(i) Potatoes. Potatoes intended for use as nursery stock (i.e., seed potatoes) are prohibited from being moved interstate from the quarantined area.
              (ii) Nursery stock of other host crops. An inspector may issue a certificate for the interstate movement of nursery stock of pale cyst nematode host crops other than potatoes, as listed in § 301.86-2(b), if the nursery stock was grown in a field that meets the following requirements:

              (B) The pale cyst nematode has not been found in the field; and
              (C) No more than one pale cyst nematode host crop, as listed in § 301.86-2(b), has been grown in the last 3 years.
              (iii) Nursery stock of non-host crops—(A) With soil. An inspector may issue a certificate for the interstate movement of nursery stock of non-host crops moved with soil if the nursery stock was grown in a field that meets the following requirements:
              (1) The field has been surveyed by an inspector for pale cyst nematode at least once in the last 3 years;
              (2) The pale cyst nematode has not been found in the field; and
              (3) No more than one pale cyst nematode host crop, as listed in § 301.86-2(b), has been grown in the field in the last 3 years.
              (B) Without soil (bare-rooted). An inspector may issue a certificate for the interstate movement of nursery stock of non-host crops moved without soil if the inspector finds the nursery stock to be free of soil on its roots and on all other parts of the plant.
              (3) Certification requirements for potatoes for consumption, root crops for consumption, garden or dry beans, and peas. An inspector may issue a certificate for the movement of potatoes intended for consumption, root crops intended for consumption, garden or dry beans, or peas from the quarantined area only if the field in which the potatoes, root crops, garden or dry beans, or peas were grown meets the following requirements:
              (i) The field has been surveyed by an inspector for pale cyst nematode at least once in the last 3 years and prior to the planting of the potatoes or root crops;
              (ii) Pale cyst nematode has not been found in the field; and
              (iii) No more than one pale cyst nematode host crop, as listed in § 301.86-2(b), has been grown in the field in the last 3 years.
              (4) Certification requirements for soil and associated products. An inspector may issue a certificate for the interstate movement of a regulated article listed in § 301.86-2(e) only if the article originated in a field that meets the following requirements:
              (i) The field has been surveyed by an inspector for pale cyst nematode at least once in the last 3 years;
              (ii) The pale cyst nematode has not been found in the field; and
              (iii) No more than one pale cyst nematode host crop, as listed in § 301.86-2(b), has been grown in the last 3 years.
              (5) Certification requirements for hay, straw, and fodder. An inspector may issue a certificate for the movement of hay, straw, or fodder from the quarantined area only if:
              (i) The field where the hay, straw, or fodder was produced meets the following requirements:
              (A) The field has been surveyed by an inspector for pale cyst nematode at least once in the last 3 years;
              (B) The pale cyst nematode has not been found in the field; and
              (C) No more than one pale cyst nematode host crop, as listed in § 301.86-2(b), has been grown in the field in the last 3 years; or
              (ii) The hay, straw, or fodder is produced according to procedures judged by an inspector to be sufficient to isolate it from soil throughout its production.
              (6) Certification requirements for equipment used in infested or associated fields. An inspector may issue a certificate for the interstate movement of equipment that has been used in an infested or associated field and that can carry soil if moved out of the field only after the equipment has been pressure-washed under the supervision of an inspector to remove all soil or steam-treated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter.
              (b) Limited permits—(1) General conditions. An inspector 5
                 may issue a limited permit for the interstate movement of a regulated article if the inspector determines that:
              
                
                  5 See footnote 3 to § 301.86-5(a).
              
              (i) The regulated article is to be moved interstate to a specified destination for specified handling, processing, or utilization (the destination and other conditions to be listed in the limited permit), and this interstate movement will not result in the spread of the pale cyst nematode because life stages of the pale cyst nematode will be destroyed by the specified handling, processing, or utilization;
              (ii) The regulated article is to be moved in compliance with any additional emergency conditions the Administrator may impose under section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) to prevent the spread of the pale cyst nematode; and
              (iii) The regulated article is eligible for interstate movement under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated article.
              (2) Specific conditions for potatoes for consumption. An inspector may issue a limited permit to allow the interstate movement of potatoes from the quarantined area for processing or packing only if:
              (i) The potatoes are transported in a manner that prevents the potatoes and soil attached to the potatoes from coming into contact with agricultural premises outside the quarantined area; and
              (ii) The potatoes are processed or packed at facilities that handle potatoes, waste, and waste water in a manner approved by APHIS to prevent the spread of pale cyst nematode.
              (c) Certificates and limited permits for the interstate movement of regulated articles may be issued by an inspector or person operating under a compliance agreement. A person operating under a compliance agreement may issue a certificate for the interstate movement of a regulated article after an inspector has determined that the regulated article is eligible for a certificate in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. A person operating under a compliance agreement may issue a limited permit for interstate movement of a regulated article after an inspector has determined that the regulated article is eligible for a limited permit in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

              (d) Any certificate or limited permit that has been issued may be withdrawn, either orally or in writing, by an inspector if he or she determines that the holder of the certificate or limited permit has not complied with all provisions in this subpart for the use of the certificate or limited permit or has not complied with all the conditions contained in the certificate or limited permit. If the withdrawal is oral, the withdrawal and the reasons for the withdrawal will be confirmed in writing as promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose certificate or limited permit has been withdrawn may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving the written notification of the withdrawal. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the certificate or limited permit was wrongfully withdrawn. As promptly as circumstances allow, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision. A hearing will be held to resolve any conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice concerning a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.

                (b) A limited permit shall be issued by an inspector for the movement of a regulated article if the inspector:
                (1) Determines, in consultation with the Deputy Administrator, that it is to be moved:
                (i) For a specified purpose (such as for consumption or manufacturing) stated on the limited permit, other than for processing or harvesting sugarcane; and
                (ii) To a specified destination stated on the limited permit, which is not in a county or parish where sugarcane is produced, and which is not within 10 miles of a sugarcane field;
                (2) Determines that it is to be moved in compliance with any additional conditions deemed necessary under section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) 6 to prevent the spread of sugarcane diseases; and
                (3) Determines that it is eligible for such movement under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines applicable to the article.

                (c) Certificates and limited permits for shipments of regulated articles may be issued by an inspector or by any person engaged in the business of growing, handling, or moving regulated articles provided such person is operating under a compliance agreement. Any such person may execute and issue a certificate for the interstate movement of a regulated article if the person has treated the regulated article to destroy infection in accordance with the provisions of § 301.87-10 of this subpart and the inspector has made the determination that the article is otherwise eligible for a certificate in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section; or if the inspector has made the determination that the article is eligible for a certificate in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section without such treatment. Any such person may execute and issue a limited permit for interstate movement of a regulated article when the inspector has made the determination that the article is eligible for a limited permit in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
                (d) Any certificate or limited permit which has been issued or authorized may be withdrawn by an inspector if the inspector determines that its holder has not complied with any condition under the regulations for its use. The reasons for the withdrawal shall be confirmed in writing as promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose certificate or limited permit has been withdrawn may appeal the decision in writing to the Deputy Administrator within ten days after receiving the written notification of the withdrawal. The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the certificate or limited permit was wrongfully withdrawn. The Deputy Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal in writing, stating the reasons for the decision as promptly as circumstances allow. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall be held to resolve the conflict under rules of practice which shall be adopted by the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA, for the proceeding.

              § 301.89-3
              Regulated areas.
              (a) The Administrator will regulate each State or each portion of a State that is infected.
              (b) Less than an entire State will be listed as a regulated area only if the Administrator:
              (1)(i) Determines that the State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles listed in § 301.89-2 that are equivalent to the movement restrictions imposed by this subpart; and
              (ii) Determines that designating less than the entire State as a regulated area will prevent the spread of Karnal bunt; or
              (2) Exercises his or her extraordinary emergency authority under 7 U.S.C. 150dd.
              (c) The Administrator may include noninfected acreage within a regulated area due to its proximity to an infestation or inseparability from the infected locality for regulatory purposes, as determined by:
              (1) Projections of the spread of Karnal bunt along the periphery of the infestation;
              (2) The availability of natural habitats and host materials within the noninfected acreage that are suitable for establishment and survival of Karnal bunt; and
              (3) The necessity of including uninfected acreage within the regulated area in order to establish readily identifiable boundaries.
              (d) The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any nonregulated area as a regulated area in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. The Administrator will give written notice of this designation to the owner or person in possession of the nonregulated area, or, in the case of publicly owned land, to the person responsible for the management of the nonregulated area. Thereafter, the movement of any regulated article from an area temporarily designated as a regulated area is subject to this subpart. As soon as practicable, this area either will be added to the list of designated regulated areas in paragraph (g) of this section, or the Administrator will terminate the designation. The owner or person in possession of, or, in the case of publicly owned land, the person responsible for the management of, an area for which the designation is terminated will be given written notice of the termination as soon as practicable.
              (e) The Administrator will classify a field or area as a regulated area when:
              (1) It is a field planted with seed from a lot found to contain a bunted wheat kernel; or
              (2) It is a distinct definable area that contains at least one field that was found during survey to contain a bunted wheat kernel (the distinct definable area may include an area where Karnal bunt is not known to exist but where intensive surveys are required because of the area's proximity to a field found during survey to contain a bunted kernel); or
              (3) It is a distinct definable area that contains at least one field that has been determined to be associated with grain at a handling facility containing a bunted kernel of a host crop (the distinct definable area may include an area where Karnal bunt is not known to exist but where intensive surveys are required because of the area's proximity to the field associated with the bunted kernel at the handling facility).

              (f) A field known to have been infected with Karnal bunt, as well as any non-infected acreage surrounding the field, will be released from regulation if:
              (1) The field has been permanently removed from crop production; or
              (2) The field is tilled at least once per year for a total of 5 years (the years need not be consecutive). After tilling, the field may be planted with a crop or left fallow. If the field is planted with a host crop, the crop must test negative, through the absence of bunted kernels, for Karnal bunt.
              (g) The following areas or fields are designated as regulated areas (maps of the regulated areas may be obtained by contacting the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, 4700 River Road Unit 98, Riverdale, MD 20737-1236):

              § 301.89-15
              Compensation for growers, handlers, and seed companies in the 1999-2000 and subsequent crop seasons.
              Growers, handlers, and seed companies are eligible to receive compensation from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the 1999-2000 and subsequent crop seasons to mitigate losses or expenses incurred because of the Karnal bunt regulations and emergency actions, as follows:
              (a) Growers, handlers, and seed companies in areas under first regulated crop season. Growers, handlers, and seed companies are eligible to receive compensation for the loss in value of their wheat in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section if: The wheat was grown in a State where the Secretary has declared an extraordinary emergency; and the wheat was grown in an area of that State that became regulated for Karnal bunt after the crop was planted, or for which an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) was issued after the crop was planted; and the wheat was grown in an area that remained regulated or under Emergency Action Notification at the time the wheat was sold. Growers and handlers of wheat grown in Oklahoma during the 2000-2001 growing season are eligible to receive compensation if the wheat was commingled in storage with wheat that meets the above requirements of this paragraph. Growers, handlers, and seed companies in areas under the first regulated crop season are eligible for compensation for 1999-2000 or subsequent crop season wheat and for wheat inventories in their possession that were unsold at the time the area became regulated. The compensation provided in this paragraph is for wheat grain, certified wheat seed, wheat held back from harvest by a grower in the 2000-2001 growing season for use as seed in the next growing season, and wheat grown with the intention of producing certified wheat seed.
              (1) Growers. Growers of wheat in an area under the first regulated crop season, who sell wheat that was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt prior to sale, or that was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt after sale and the price received by the grower is contingent on the test results, are eligible to receive compensation as described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this section. However, compensation for positive-testing wheat will not exceed $1.80 per bushel under any circumstances.
              (i) If the wheat was grown under contract and a price was determined in the contract before the area where the wheat was grown became regulated, compensation will equal the contract price minus the actual price received by the grower.

              (ii) If the wheat was not grown under contract or a price was determined in the contract after the area where the wheat was grown became regulated, compensation will equal the estimated market price for the relevant class of wheat (meaning type of wheat, such as durum or hard red winter) minus the actual price received by the grower. The estimated market price will be calculated by APHIS for each class of wheat, taking into account the prices offered by relevant terminal markets (animal feed, milling, or export) during the harvest months for the area, with adjustments for transportation and other handling costs. Separate estimated market prices will be calculated for certified wheat seed and wheat grown with the intention of producing certified wheat seed, and wheat grain.
              (2) Handlers and seed companies. Handlers and seed companies who sell wheat grown in an area under the first regulated crop season are eligible to receive compensation only if the wheat was not tested by APHIS prior to purchase by the handler or seed company, but was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt after purchase by the handler or seed company, as long as the price to be paid is not contingent on the test results. Compensation will equal the estimated market price for the relevant class of wheat (meaning type of wheat, such as durum or hard red winter) minus the actual price received by the handler or seed company. The estimated market price will be calculated by APHIS for each class of wheat, taking into account the prices offered by relevant terminal markets (animal feed, milling, or export) during the harvest months for the area, with adjustments for transportation and other handling costs. Separate estimated market prices will be calculated for certified wheat seed and wheat grown with the intention of producing certified wheat seed, and wheat grain. However, compensation will not exceed $1.80 per bushel under any circumstances.
              (b) Growers, handlers, and seed companies in previously regulated areas. For the 1999-2000 crop season and the 2000-2001 crop season only, growers, handlers, and seed companies are eligible to receive compensation for the loss in value of their wheat in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section if: The wheat was grown in a State where the Secretary has declared an extraordinary emergency; and the wheat was grown in an area of that State that became regulated for Karnal bunt before the crop was planted, or for which an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) was issued before the crop was planted; and the wheat was grown in an area that remained regulated or under Emergency Action Notification at the time the wheat was sold. Growers, handlers, and seed companies in previously regulated areas will not be eligible for compensation for wheat from the 2001-2002 and subsequent crop seasons; except that, for growers or handlers of wheat harvested in any field in the Texas counties of Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, and Young during the 2000-2001 crop season that has not been found to contain a bunted wheat kernel, this requirement applies to compensation for wheat from the 2002-2003 and subsequent crop seasons. The compensation provided in this paragraph is for wheat grain, certified wheat seed, and wheat grown with the intention of producing certified wheat seed.
              (1) Growers. Growers of wheat in a previously regulated area who sell wheat that was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt prior to sale, or that was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt after sale and the price received by the grower is contingent on the test results, are eligible to receive compensation at the rate of $.60 per bushel of positive testing wheat.
              (2) Handlers and seed companies. Handlers and seed companies who sell wheat grown in a previously regulated area are eligible to receive compensation only if the wheat was not tested by APHIS prior to purchase by the handler, but was tested by APHIS and found positive for Karnal bunt after purchase by the handler or seed company, as long as the price to be paid by the handler or seed company is not contingent on the test results. Compensation will be at the rate of $.60 per bushel of positive testing wheat.
              (c) To claim compensation. Compensation payments to growers, handlers, and seed companies under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will be issued by the Farm Service Agency (FSA). Claims for compensation for the 1999-2000 crop season must be received by FSA on or before December 4, 2001. Claims for compensation for subsequent crop seasons must be received by FSA on or before March 1 of the year following that crop season. The Administrator may extend the deadline, upon request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before these dates. To claim compensation, a grower, handler, or seed company must complete and submit to the local FSA county office the following documents:
              (1) Growers, handlers, and seed companies. A grower, handler, or seed company must submit a Karnal Bunt Compensation Claim form, provided by FSA. If the wheat was grown in an area that is not a regulated area, but for which an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) (EAN) has been issued, the grower, handler, or seed company must submit a copy of the EAN. Growers, handlers, and seed companies must also submit a copy of the Karnal bunt certificate issued by APHIS that shows the Karnal bunt test results, and verification as to the actual (not estimated) weight of the wheat that tested positive (such as a copy of a facility weigh ticket, or other verification). For compensation claims for wheat seed, a grower or seed company must submit documentation showing that the wheat is either certified seed or was grown with the intention of producing certified seed (this documentation may include one or more of the following types of documents: an application to the State seed certification agency for field inspection; a bulk sale certificate; certification tags or labels issued by the State seed certification agency; or a document issued by the State seed certification agency verifying that the wheat is certified seed);
              (2) Growers. In addition to the documents required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, growers must submit a copy of the receipt for the final sale of the wheat, showing the total bushels sold and the total price received by the grower. Growers compensated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section (previously regulated areas) whose wheat was not tested prior to sale must submit documentation showing that the price paid to the grower was contingent on test results (such as a copy of the receipt for the final sale of the wheat or a copy of the contract the grower has for the wheat, if this information appears on those documents).
              (3) Handlers and seed companies. In addition to the documents required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, handlers and seed companies must submit a copy of the receipt for the final sale of the wheat, showing the total bushels sold and the total price received by the handler or seed company. The handler or seed company must also submit documentation showing that the price paid or to be paid to the grower is not contingent on the test results (such as a copy of the receipt for the purchase of the wheat or a copy of the contract the handler or seed company has with the grower, if this information appears on those documents).
              (d) Special allowance for negative wheat grown in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, and Young Counties, TX, in the 2000-2001 growing season. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, wheat that was harvested from fields in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young Counties, TX, in the 2000-2001 growing season, and that tested negative for Karnal bunt after harvest, is eligible for compensation in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
              (e) Special allowance for disposal costs for treated uncertified wheat seed in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, and Young Counties, TX, in the 2000-2001 growing season. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, growers in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young Counties, TX, who own treated uncertified wheat seed that tested positive for Karnal bunt spores during the 2000-2001 growing season are eligible for compensation in accordance with this paragraph. The grower is eligible for compensation for the costs of disposing of such wheat seed, by burial on the grower's premises, by burial at a landfill, or through another means approved by APHIS. The compensation for disposing of wheat seed by burial on the grower's premises is $1.00 per bushel. The compensation for disposing of wheat seed by burial at a landfill, or through another means approved by APHIS, is the actual cost of disposal, up to $1.20 per bushel, as verified by receipts for disposal costs. To apply for this compensation, the grower must submit a Karnal Bunt Compensation Claim form, provided by FSA, and must also submit a copy of the Karnal bunt certificate issued by APHIS that shows the Karnal bunt test results, and verification as to the actual (not estimated) weight of the uncertified wheat seed that tested positive for spores (such as a copy of a facility weigh ticket, or other verification). For seed disposed of by burial at a landfill the grower must also submit one or more receipts for the disposal costs of the uncertified wheat seed, showing the total bushels destroyed and the total disposal costs (landfill fees, transportation costs, etc.).

              § 301.89-16
              Compensation for grain storage facilities, flour millers, National Survey participants, and certain custom harvesters and equipment owners or lessees for the 1999-2000 and subsequent crop seasons.
              Owners of grain storage facilities, flour millers, and participants in the National Karnal Bunt Survey are eligible to receive compensation from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the 1999-2000and subsequent crop seasons to mitigate losses or expenses incurred because of the Karnal bunt regulations and emergency actions, as follows:
              (a) Decontamination of grain storage facilities. Owners of grain storage facilities that are in States where the Secretary has declared an extraordinary emergency, and who have decontaminated their grain storage facilities pursuant to either an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) issued by an inspector or a letter issued by an inspector ordering decontamination of the facilities, are eligible to be compensated, on a one time only basis for each facility for each covered crop year wheat, for up to 50 percent of the direct cost of decontamination. However, compensation will not exceed $20,000 per grain storage facility (as defined in § 301.89-1). General clean-up, repair, and refurbishment costs are excluded from compensation. Compensation payments will be issued by APHIS. To claim compensation, the owner of the grain storage facility must submit to an inspector records demonstrating that decontamination was performed on all structures, conveyances, or materials ordered by APHIS to be decontaminated. The records must include a copy of the Emergency Action Notification or the letter from an inspector ordering decontamination, contracts with individuals or companies hired to perform the decontamination, receipts for equipment and materials purchased to perform the decontamination, time sheets for employees of the grain storage facility who performed activities connected to the decontamination, and any other documentation that helps show the cost to the owner and that decontamination has been completed. Claims for compensation for the 1999-2000 crop season must be received by APHIS on or before December 4, 2001. Claims for compensation for the 2000-2001 crop season and beyond must be received by March 1 of the year following that crop season. The Administrator may extend these deadlines upon written request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before these dates.
              (b) Flour millers. Flour millers who, in accordance with a compliance agreement with APHIS, heat treat millfeed that is required by APHIS to be heat treated are eligible to be compensated at the rate of $35.00 per short ton of millfeed. The amount of millfeed compensated will be calculated by multiplying the weight of wheat from the regulated area received by the miller by 25 percent (the average percent of millfeed derived from a short ton of grain). Compensation payments will be issued by APHIS. To claim compensation, the miller must submit to an inspector verification as to the actual (not estimated) weight of the wheat (such as a copy of a facility weigh ticket or a copy of the bill of lading for the wheat, if the actual weight appears on those documents, or other verification). Flour millers must also submit verification that the millfeed was heat treated (such as a copy of the limited permit under which the wheat was moved to a treatment facility and a copy of the bill of lading accompanying that movement; or a copy of PPQ Form 700 (which includes certification of processing) signed by the inspector who monitors the mill). Claims for compensation for the 1999-2000 crop season must be received by APHIS on or before December 4, 2001. Claims for compensation for the 2000-2001 crop season and beyond must be received by March 1 of the year following that crop season. The Administrator may extend these deadlines upon written request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before these dates.
              (c) National Karnal Bunt Survey participants. If a grain storage facility participating in the National Karnal Bunt Survey tests positive for Karnal bunt, the facility will be regulated, and may be ordered decontaminated, pursuant to either an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ Form 523) issued by an inspector or a letter issued by an inspector ordering decontamination of the facility. If the Secretary has declared an extraordinary emergency in the State in which the grain storage facility is located, the owner will be eligible for compensation as follows:
              (1) Loss in value of positive wheat. The owner of the grain storage facility will be compensated for the loss in value of positive wheat. Compensation will equal the estimated market price for the relevant class of wheat minus the actual price received for the wheat. The estimated market price will be calculated by APHIS for each class of wheat, taking into account the prices offered by relevant terminal markets (animal feed, milling, or export) during the relevant time period for that facility, with adjustments for transportation and other handling costs. However, compensation will not exceed $1.80 per bushel under any circumstances. Compensation payments for loss in value of wheat will be issued by the Farm Service Agency (FSA). To claim compensation, the owner of the facility must submit to the local FSA office a Karnal Bunt Compensation Claim form, provided by FSA. The owner of the facility must also submit to FSA a copy of the Emergency Action Notification or letter from an inspector under which the facility is or was quarantined; verification as to the actual (not estimated) weight of the wheat (such as a copy of a facility weigh ticket or a copy of the bill of lading for the wheat, if the actual weight appears on those documents, or other verification); and a copy of the receipt for the final sale of the wheat, showing the total bushels sold and the total price received by the owner of the grain storage facility. Claims for compensation for the 1999-2000 crop season must be received by APHIS on or before December 4, 2001. Claims for compensation for the 2000-2001 crop season and beyond must be received by March 1 of the year following that crop season. The Administrator may extend these deadlines upon written request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before these dates.
              (2) Decontamination of grain storage facilities. The owner of the facility will be compensated on a one time only basis for each grain storage facility for each covered crop year wheat for the direct costs of decontamination of the facility at the same rate described under paragraph (a) of this section (up to 50 per cent of the direct costs of decontamination, not to exceed $20,000 per grain storage facility). Compensation payments for decontamination of grain storage facilities will be issued by APHIS, and claims for compensation must be submitted in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (a) of this section. Claims for compensation for the 1999-2000 crop season must be received by APHIS on or before December 4, 2001. Claims for compensation for the 2000-2001 crop season and beyond must be received by March 1 of the year following that crop season. The Administrator may extend these deadlines upon written request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before these dates.
              (d) Special allowances for custom harvesters and equipment owners or lessees for costs related to cleaning and disinfection of mechanized harvesting and other equipment in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, and Young Counties, TX, in the 2000-2001 crop season. All claims for compensation under this paragraph § 301.89-16(d) must be received by APHIS on or before September 6, 2005. The Administrator may extend this deadline upon written request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before this date. All compensation payments made under this paragraph § 301.89-16(d) will be issued by APHIS. Claims for compensation should be sent to Plant Protection and Quarantine, APHIS, USDA, 304 West Main Street, Olney, TX 76374.
              (1) Custom harvesters. (i) Cleaning and disinfection of mechanized harvesting equipment. Custom harvesters who harvested host crops that an inspector determined to be infected with Karnal bunt and that were grown in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young Counties, TX, during the 2000-2001 crop season are eligible to receive compensation for the cost of cleaning and disinfecting their mechanized harvesting equipment as required by § 301.89-12(a). Compensation for the cost of cleaning and disinfection mechanized harvesting equipment used to harvest Karnal bunt-infected host crops will be either the actual cost or $750 per cleaned machine, whichever is less. To claim compensation, a custom harvester must provide copies of a contract or other signed agreement for harvesting in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young County during the 2000-2001 crop season, signed on a date prior to the designation of the county as a regulated area for Karnal bunt, or an affidavit stating that the custom harvester entered into an agreement to harvest in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young County during the 2000-2001 crop season prior to the designation of the county as a regulated area for Karnal bunt, signed by the customer with whom the custom harvester entered into the agreement; a copy of the PPQ-540 certificate issued to allow the movement of mechanized harvesting equipment from a regulated area after it had been used to harvest host crops that an inspector determined to be infected with Karnal bunt and had been subsequently cleaned and disinfected; and a receipt showing the cost of the cleaning and disinfection.
              (ii) Contracts lost due to cleaning and disinfection. Custom harvesters who harvested host crops that an inspector determined to be infected with Karnal bunt and that were grown in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young Counties, TX, during the 2000-2001 crop season are also eligible to be compensated for the revenue lost if they lost one contract due to downtime necessitated by cleaning and disinfection, if the contract to harvest Karnal bunt-infected host crops in a previously nonregulated area was signed before the area was declared a regulated area for Karnal bunt. Compensation will only be provided for one contract lost due to cleaning and disinfection. Compensation for any contract that was lost due to cleaning and disinfection will be either the full value of the contract or $23.48 for each acre that was to have been harvested under the contract, whichever is less. To claim compensation, a custom harvester must provide copies of a contract or other signed agreement for harvesting in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young County during the 2000-2001 crop season, signed on a date prior to the designation of the county as a regulated area for Karnal bunt, or an affidavit stating that the custom harvester entered into an agreement to harvest in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young County during the 2000-2001 crop season prior to the designation of the county as a regulated area for Karnal bunt, signed by the customer with whom the custom harvester entered into the agreement; a copy of the PPQ-540 certificate issued to allow the movement of mechanized harvesting equipment from a regulated area after it has been used to harvest host crops that an inspector determined to be infected with Karnal bunt and had been subsequently cleaned and disinfected; and the contract for harvesting in an area not regulated for Karnal bunt that had been lost due to time lost to cleaning and disinfecting harvesting equipment, signed on a date prior to the designation of the relevant county as a regulated area for Karnal bunt, for which the custom harvester will receive compensation, or an affidavit stating that the custom harvester entered into an agreement to harvest in an area not regulated for Karnal bunt prior to the designation of the county as a regulated area for Karnal bunt and stating the number of acres that were to have been harvested and the amount the custom harvester was to have been paid under the agreement, signed by the customer with whom the custom harvester entered into the agreement.
              (iii) Fixed costs incurred during cleaning and disinfection. Custom harvesters who harvested host crops that an inspector determined to be infected with Karnal bunt and that were grown in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young Counties, TX, during the 2000-2001 crop season who do not apply for compensation for a contract lost due to cleaning and disinfection as described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section are eligible for compensation for fixed costs incurred during cleaning and disinfection. Compensation for fixed costs incurred during cleaning and disinfection will be $2,000. To claim compensation, a custom harvester must provide copies of a contract or other signed agreement for harvesting in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young County during the 2000-2001 crop season, signed on a date prior to the designation of the county as a regulated area for Karnal bunt, or an affidavit stating that the custom harvester entered into an agreement to harvest in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young County during the 2000-2001 crop season prior to the designation of the county as a regulated area for Karnal bunt, signed by the customer with whom the custom harvester entered into the agreement; and a copy of the PPQ-540 certificate issued to allow the movement of mechanized harvesting equipment from a regulated area after it has been used to harvest host crops that an inspector determined to be infected with Karnal bunt and has been subsequently cleaned and disinfected.
              (2) Other equipment; cleaning and disinfection. Owners or lessees of equipment other than mechanized harvesting equipment and seed conditioning equipment that came into contact with host crops that an inspector determined to be infected with Karnal bunt in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young Counties, TX, during the 2000-2001 crop season and that was required by an inspector to be cleaned and disinfected are eligible for compensation for the cost of cleaning and disinfection. Compensation for the cleaning and disinfection of such equipment will be $100. To receive this compensation, owners or lessees must submit a copy of the PPQ-540 certificate issued to allow the movement of the equipment from a regulated area after it had been in contact with host crops that an inspector determined to be infected with Karnal bunt and had been subsequently cleaned and disinfected.

                (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the Deputy Administrator shall list as a regulated area in paragraph (c) of this section, the State, or any portion thereof, in which European larch canker has been found by an inspector or in which the Deputy Administrator has reason to believe that European larch canker is present, or any portion of a quarantined State which the Deputy Administrator deems necessary to regulate because of its proximity to a European larch canker infestation or its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purpose from localities in which European larch canker occurs. Less than an entire quarantined State will be designated as a regulated area only if the Deputy Administrator determines that:
                (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or regulation which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under this subpart; and
                (2) The designation of less than the entire State as a regulated area will otherwise be adequate to prevent the artifical interstate spread of European larch canker.
                (b) The Deputy Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any nonregulated area in a quarantined State as a regulated area in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section for listing such area. Written notice of such designation shall be given to the owner or person in possession of such nonregulated area, and, thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated article from such area shall be subject to the applicable provisions of this subpart. As soon as practicable, such area shall be added to the list in paragraph (c) of this section or such designation shall be terminated by the Deputy Administrator or an inspector, and notice thereof shall be given to the owner or person in possession of the area.

              Quarantined and regulated areas.
              (a) Quarantined areas. (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the Administrator will list as a quarantined area in paragraph (a)(3) of this section each State, or each portion of a State, in which Phytophthora ramorum has been confirmed by an inspector to be established in the natural environment, in which the Administrator has reason to believe that Phytophthora ramorum is present in the natural environment, or that the Administrator considers necessary to quarantine because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities in which Phytophthora ramorum has been found in the natural environment. Less than an entire State will be designated as a quarantined area only if the Administrator determines that:
              (i) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated, restricted, and associated articles that are substantially the same as those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated, restricted, and associated articles; and

              (ii) The designation of less than the entire State as a quarantined area will prevent the interstate spread of Phytophthora ramorum.
              
              (2) The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any nonquarantined area in a State as a quarantined area in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The Administrator will give a copy of this regulation along with a written notice for the temporary designation to the owner or person in possession of the nonquarantined area. Thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated, restricted, or associated article from an area temporarily designated as a quarantined area will be subject to this subpart. As soon as practicable, this area will be added to the list in paragraph (a)(3) of this section or the designation will be terminated by the Administrator or an inspector. The owner or person in possession of an area for which designation is terminated will be given notice of the termination as soon as practicable.

To meet the requirements of § 301.92-5(a)(1)(iv), nurseries located in quarantined areas and that move regulated articles of nursery stock, decorative trees without roots, wreaths, garlands, or greenery, associated articles, or non-host nursery stock interstate must meet the requirements in this section. Nurseries in quarantined areas that do not meet the requirements of this section are prohibited from moving regulated articles and associated articles interstate. Nurseries in quarantined areas that do not meet the requirements of this section or paragraph (b) of this section are prohibited from moving non-host nursery stock interstate.
              (1) Annual inspection, sampling, and testing—(i) Inspection. The nursery must be inspected annually for symptoms of Phytophthora ramorum by an inspector. 17
                 Inspectors will visually inspect for symptomatic plants throughout the nursery, and inspection will focus on, but not be limited to, regulated articles and associated articles.
              
                
                  17 Persons operating under compliance agreements are eligible to issue certificates for the interstate movement of regulated and associated articles, but only inspectors are authorized to conduct nursery inspections required under the regulations.
              
              
              (ii) Sampling. A minimum of 40 plant samples must be tested per nursery location. Samples must be taken from all symptomatic plants if symptomatic plants are present. If fewer than 40 symptomatic plants are present, each symptomatic plant must be sampled and the remainder of the 40 sample minimum must be taken from asymptomatic plants. If no symptomatic plants are present, 40 asymptomatic plants must be sampled; biased toward proven hosts. Each sample may contain more than one leaf, and may come from more than one plant, but all plants in the sample must be from the same lot. Asymptomatic samples, if collected, must be taken from regulated and associated articles and nearby plants. Inspectors must conduct inspections at times when the best expression of symptoms is anticipated and must take nursery fungicide programs into consideration. Nursery owners must keep records of fungicide applications for 2 years and must make them available to inspectors upon request.
              (iii) Testing. Samples must be labeled and sent for testing to a laboratory approved by APHIS and must be tested using a test method approved by APHIS, in accordance with § 301.92-12.
              (iv) Annual certification. If all plant samples tested in accordance with this section and § 301.92-12 return negative results for Phytophthora ramorum, an inspector may certify that the nursery is free of evidence of Phytophthora ramorum infestation at the time of inspection, and the nursery will be eligible to enter into a compliance agreement in accordance with § 301.92-6. 18
                
              
              
                
                  18 See footnote 14 of this subpart.
              
              (2) Pre-shipment inspection, sampling, and testing—(i) Inspection. During the 30 days prior to interstate movement from a nursery in a quarantined area, regulated articles or associated articles intended for interstate movement must be inspected for symptoms of Phytophthora ramorum by an inspector. 19
                 Inspection will focus on, but not be limited to, regulated articles and associated articles. No inspections of shipments will be conducted unless the nursery from which the shipment originates has a current and valid annual certification in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section.
              
                
                  19 See footnote 7 of this subpart.
              

              (A) If no symptomatic plants are found upon inspection, the shipment may be considered free of evidence of Phytophthora ramorum infection and is eligible for interstate movement, provided that the nursery is operating under a compliance agreement with APHIS in accordance with § 301.92-6.
              (B) If symptomatic plants are found upon inspection, the inspector will collect at least one sample per symptomatic plant, and one sample per regulated article or associated article that is in close proximity to, or that has had physical contact with, a symptomatic plant.
              (ii) Testing and withholding from interstate movement. Samples taken in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section must be labeled and sent for testing to a laboratory approved by APHIS and must be tested using a test method approved by APHIS, in accordance with § 301.92-12. The interstate movement of plants in the shipment is prohibited until the plants in the shipment are determined to be free of evidence of Phytophthora ramorum infection in accordance with § 301.92-12.
              (b) Nurseries in quarantined areas shipping non-host nursery stock interstate. Nurseries located in quarantined areas and that move non-host nursery stock interstate must meet the requirements of this paragraph or the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. 20
                 If such nurseries contain any regulated or associated articles, the nursery must meet the requirements of paragraph (a). This paragraph (b) only applies if there are no regulated or associated articles of nursery stock in the nursery. Nurseries that do not meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section are prohibited from moving non-host nursery stock interstate.
              
                
                  20 In addition, to be eligible for interstate movement, non-host nursery stock that is rooted in soil or growing media requires certification that the soil or growing media meets the requirements of § 301.92-5(a)(1)(iii).
              
              (1) Annual visual inspection. The nursery must be visually inspected annually for symptoms of Phytophthora ramorum. Inspections and determinations of freedom from evidence of Phytophthora ramorum infestation must occur at the time when the best expression of symptoms is anticipated.
              (2) Sampling. All plants showing symptoms of infection with Phytophthora ramorum upon inspection will be sampled and tested in accordance with § 301.92-12. If symptomatic plants are found upon inspection, the following plants must be withheld from interstate shipment until testing is completed and the nursery is found free of evidence of Phytophthora ramorum in accordance with this paragraph (b)(3) of this section and § 301.92-12: All symptomatic plants, any plants located in the same lot as the suspect plant, and any plants located within 2 meters of this lot of plants.
              (3) Certification. If all plant samples tested in accordance with this section and § 301.92-12 return negative results for Phytophthora ramorum, or if an inspector determines that plants in a nursery exhibit no signs of infection with Phytophthora ramorum, the inspector may certify that the nursery is free of evidence of Phytophthora ramorum infestation at the time of inspection. Certification is valid for 1 year and must be renewed each year to continue shipping plants interstate.
              (c) Nurseries in regulated areas shipping regulated articles of nursery stock or associated articles interstate. To meet the conditions of § 301.92-5(b), any nursery that is located in a regulated area and contains regulated articles of nursery stock or associated articles, and ships any nursery stock interstate must meet the following requirements:
              (1) Annual inspection. The nursery must be inspected annually for symptoms of Phytophthora ramorum by an inspector. 21
                 Inspection will focus on, but not be limited to, regulated articles of nursery stock and associated articles.
              
                
                  21 See footnote 7 of this subpart.
              
              (2) Sampling. Samples must be taken from all symptomatic plants. If fewer than 40 symptomatic plants are present, each symptomatic plant must be sampled and additional samples must be taken from asymptomatic plants so that the minimum number of plants sampled is 40. If no symptomatic plants are present, 40 asymptomatic plants must be sampled. Each sample may contain more than one leaf, and may come from more than one plant, but all plants in the sample must be from the same lot. If samples are collected from asymptomatic plants, the samples must be taken from regulated and associated articles and nearby plants. Inspectors must conduct inspections at times when the best expression of symptoms is anticipated and must take nursery fungicide programs into consideration. Nursery owners must keep records of fungicide applications for 2 years and must make them available to inspectors upon request.
              (3) Annual certification. If all plant samples tested in accordance with this section and § 301.92-12 return negative results for Phytophthora ramorum, the inspector may certify that the nursery is free of evidence of Phytophthora ramorum infestation at the time of inspection. Nurseries in a regulated area must have current and valid certification to ship regulated articles of nursery stock and associated articles interstate. If annual certification expires prior to reinspection, all plants in the nursery are prohibited interstate movement until the nursery is inspected, tested, and re-certified in accordance with this section and § 301.92-12.
              (d) Nurseries in regulated areas shipping non-host nursery stock interstate. Nurseries located in regulated areas and that move non-host nursery stock interstate must meet the requirements in this paragraph or the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. If such nurseries contain any regulated or associated articles, the nursery must meet the requirements of paragraph (c). This paragraph (d) only applies if there are no regulated or associated articles in the nursery. Nurseries that do not meet the requirements of paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section are prohibited from moving non-host nursery stock interstate.
              (1) Annual visual inspection. The nursery must be visually inspected annually for symptoms of Phytophthora ramorum. Inspections and determinations of apparent pest freedom for such nurseries must occur at the time when the best expression of symptoms is anticipated.
              (2) Sampling. All plants showing symptoms infection with Phytophthora ramorum upon inspection will be sampled and tested in accordance with § 301.92-12. If symptomatic plants are found upon inspection, the following plants must be withheld from interstate shipment until testing is completed and the nursery is found free of evidence of Phytophthora ramorum in accordance with § 301.92-12: All symptomatic plants, any plants located in the same lot as the symptomatic plant, and any plants located within 2 meters of that lot of plants.
              (3) Certification. If all plant samples tested in accordance with this section and § 301.92-12 return negative results for Phytophthora ramorum, or if an inspector determines that plants in the nursery exhibit no signs of infection with Phytophthora ramorum, the inspector may certify that the nursery is free of evidence of Phytophthora ramorum infestation at the time of inspection. Certification is valid for 1 year and must be renewed each year to continue shipping plants interstate.
              (e) Additions to the lists of proven hosts and associated plants. In the event that APHIS informs a nursery owner that additional proven hosts or associated plants exist, but those taxa are not yet listed in this subpart, the following provisions apply:
              (1) Nurseries operating under a compliance agreement in accordance with § 301.92-6 may continue to ship plants interstate in accordance with this subpart.

              (2) Nurseries that had not previously contained any regulated or associated articles, and that had been inspected in accordance with § 301.92-11(b)(3) and allowed to ship plants interstate without certificate, but that contain a newly identified proven host or associated plant must cease interstate shipments of regulated articles and associated hosts until the nursery is reinspected and found free of evidence of Phytophthora ramorum in accordance with § 301.92-11. Nurseries that come under regulation during winter dormancy periods and that are not able to be inspected in accordance with § 301.92-11 prior to desired shipments of non-host nursery stock may be allowed to ship non-host nursery stock interstate at the discretion of an inspector.
              (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0579-0310)
            
            
              § 301.92-12
              Testing protocols.
              Samples must be analyzed using a methodology approved by APHIS at a laboratory approved by APHIS. The following methodology is approved by APHIS.
              (a) Optional ELISA Prescreening. An APHIS-approved ELISA may be used to prescreen plant samples to determine the presence of Phytophthora spp.
              (1) Negative prescreening results. If all samples from a single nursery are found to be negative through APHIS-approved ELISA prescreening, no further testing is required. The nursery may be considered free of evidence of Phytophthora ramorum, and plants in the nursery are eligible for interstate movement under certificate in accordance with § 301.92-5.
              (2) Positive prescreening results. If ELISA prescreening reveals the presence of Phytophthora spp. in any plants, each sample that returns positive ELISA results must be tested as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (b) Mandatory testing procedures. If ELISA prescreening is not performed, or if results of ELISA prescreening are positive for Phytophthora spp. in any sample, the sample must be analyzed using an APHIS-approved test. Samples will be considered positive for Phytophthora ramorum based on positive results of any approved test. Positive PCR or other molecular tests do not require confirmatory culture tests, nor do positive culture tests require confirmatory PCR or other molecular tests; however, if culture tests return other than positive results, an APHIS-approved PCR or other molecular test must be conducted, as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
              (1) PCR or other molecular tests—(i) Negative results. If the results of PCR or other molecular tests are negative for all samples in a nursery, no further testing is required. The nursery may be considered free of evidence of Phytophthora ramorum and plants in the nursery are eligible for interstate movement under certificate in accordance with § 301.92-5.
              (ii) Positive results. If any samples tested using PCR or other molecular tests return positive results for Phytophthora ramorum, the nursery from which they originate is prohibited from moving plants interstate. The nursery will be eligible to ship certain plants interstate when an inspector determines that those plants are free of evidence of Phytophthora ramorum.
              
              (2) Culture Test—(i) Negative results. If the results of culture tests are other than positive for any samples taken from a single nursery, plants in the nursery must continue to be withheld from shipment in accordance with § 301.92-11 and each plant sample must be tested again using a PCR or other molecular test, as described in this section.
              (ii) Positive results. If any culture tests return positive results for Phytophthora ramorum, the nursery from which they originate is prohibited from moving plants interstate as directed by an inspector. The nursery will be eligible to ship certain plants interstate when an inspector determines that those plants are free of evidence of Phytophthora ramorum.
              
              (c) Other test methods. Other test methods may be acceptable if approved by APHIS.

Unless there is a need to immediately add, revise, or remove a treatment schedule, as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a treatment schedule may be added to the PPQ Treatment Manual, revised, or removed from the PPQ Treatment Manual as follows:
            (1) Notice of change to treatment schedule. APHIS will publish in the Federal Register a notice describing the reasons we have determined that it is necessary to add, revise, or remove a treatment schedule and, if necessary, making available the new or revised treatment schedule as it would be added to the PPQ Treatment Manual. In our notice, we will provide for a public comment period on the new or revised treatment schedule or on the removal of the treatment schedule from the PPQ Treatment Manual.
            (2) Response to comments. (i) APHIS will issue a notice after the close of the public comment period indicating that the treatment schedule specified in the initial notice will be added to the PPQ Treatment Manual, revised as described in the notice, or removed from the PPQ Treatment Manual if:
            (A) No comments were received on the notice;
            (B) The comments on the notice supported our action; or
            (C) The comments on the notice were evaluated but did not change our determination that it is necessary to add, revise, or remove the treatment schedule, as described in the notice.
            (ii) If the notice issued after the close of the public comment period indicates that a change will be made to the PPQ Treatment Manual, APHIS will make available a new version of the PPQ Treatment Manual that reflects the addition, revision, or removal of the particular treatment schedule.
            (iii) If comments present information that causes us to determine that the change described in the notice is not appropriate, APHIS will issue a notice informing the public of this determination after the close of the comment period.
            (b) Process for immediately adding, revising, or removing treatment schedules. Treatment schedules may be immediately added to the PPQ Treatment Manual, revised, or removed from the PPQ Treatment Manual under the circumstances described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and in accordance with the process described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.
            (1) Circumstances in which the immediate process may be used. Treatment schedules may be immediately added to the PPQ Treatment Manual, revised, or removed from the PPQ Treatment Manual if any of the following circumstances apply:
            (i) PPQ has determined that an approved treatment schedule is ineffective at neutralizing the targeted plant pest(s);
            (ii) PPQ has determined that, in order to neutralize the targeted plant pest(s), the treatment schedule must be administered using a different process than was previously used;
            (iii) PPQ has determined that a new treatment schedule is effective, based on efficacy data, and that ongoing trade in an article or articles may be adversely impacted unless the new treatment schedule is approved for use; or

            (iv) The use of a treatment schedule is no longer authorized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or by any other Federal entity.
            
            (2) Process for immediate change to treatment schedules. If PPQ determines that one or more of the circumstances in paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies and that it is necessary to take immediate action, APHIS will publish in the Federal Register a notice describing the reasons we have determined that it is necessary to immediately add, revise, or remove a treatment schedule and, if necessary, making available the new or revised treatment schedule as it has been added to the PPQ Treatment Manual. Treatment schedules that have been added to the PPQ Treatment Manual or revised under this process will be identified in the PPQ Treatment Manual as having been added or revised through the immediate process described in this paragraph (b). The PPQ Treatment Manual will indicate that these treatment schedules are subject to change or removal based on public comment. In our notice, we will provide for a public comment period on the new or revised treatment schedule or on the removal of the treatment schedule from the PPQ Treatment Manual.
            (3) Response to comments. (i) APHIS will issue a notice after the close of the public comment period affirming the action described in the initial notice if:
            (A) No comments were received on the notice;
            (B) The comments on the notice supported our action; or
            (C) The comments on the notice were evaluated but did not change our determination that it was necessary to add, revise, or remove the treatment schedule, as described in the notice.
            (ii) If the notice issued after the close of the public comment period indicates that the initial change to the PPQ Treatment Manual is affirmed, APHIS will make available a new version of the PPQ Treatment Manual that will reflect the addition, revision, or removal of the particular treatment schedule in the main body of the PPQ Treatment Manual.

            (iii) If comments present information that causes us to determine that it is necessary to change a treatment schedule added to the PPQ Treatment Manual under this process or to further revise a treatment schedule that was revised under this process, APHIS will publish a notice in the Federal Register informing the public of this determination after the close of the comment period and will revise the treatment schedule accordingly.

            (iv) If comments present information that causes us to determine that the change described in the initial notice was not appropriate, APHIS will publish a notice in the Federal Register informing the public of this determination after the close of the comment period and will, if necessary, remove the new or revised treatment schedule from the separate section of the PPQ Treatment Manual.

            [75 FR 4241, Jan. 26, 2010, as amended at 76 FR 60361, Sept. 29, 2011; 83 FR 5876, Feb. 12, 2018]
          
          
            § 305.6
            Cold treatment requirements.
            (a) Certification of treatment facilities. All facilities or locations used for refrigerating fruits or vegetables in accordance with the cold treatment schedules in the PPQ Treatment Manual or in another treatment schedule approved in accordance with § 305.2 must be certified by APHIS. Recertification of the facility or carrier is required every 3 years, or as often as APHIS directs, depending on treatments performed, commodities handled, and operations conducted at the facility. A facility will only be certified or recertified if the Administrator determines that the location of the facility is such that those Federal agencies involved in its operation and oversight have adequate resources to conduct the necessary operations at the facility, that the pest risks can be managed at that location, and that the facility meets all criteria for approval. Other agencies that have regulatory oversight and requirements must concur in writing with the establishment of the facility prior to APHIS approval. In order to be certified, facilities and carriers must:
            (1) Be capable of keeping treated and untreated fruits, vegetables, or other articles separate so as to prevent reinfestation of articles and spread of pests;
            (2) Be capable of preventing the escape and spread of pests while regulated articles are at the facility; and
            (3) Have equipment that is adequate to effectively perform cold treatment.
            (b)(1) Location of facilities. Where certified cold treatment facilities are available, an approved cold treatment may be conducted for any imported regulated article either prior to shipment to the United States or in the United States. For any regulated article moved interstate from Hawaii or U.S. territories, cold treatment may be conducted either prior to movement to the mainland United States or in the mainland United States. Cold treatment facilities may be located in any State on the mainland United States. For cold treatment facilities located in the area south of 39° latitude and west of 104° longitude, the following additional conditions must be met:
            (i) Prospective facility operators must submit a detailed layout of the facility site and its location to APHIS. APHIS will evaluate plant health risks based on the proposed location and layout of the facility site. APHIS will only approve a proposed facility if the Administrator determines that regulated articles can be safely transported to the facility from the port of entry or points of origin in the United States.
            (ii) The government of the State in which the facility is to be located must concur in writing with the location of the facility or, if it does not concur, must provide a written explanation of concern based on pest risks. In instances where the State government does not concur with the proposed facility location, and provides a written explanation of concern based on pest risks, APHIS and the State must agree on a strategy to resolve the pest risk concerns prior to APHIS approval. If the State does not provide a written explanation of concern based on pest risks, then State concurrence will not be required before APHIS approves the facility location.
            (iii) Untreated articles may not be removed from their packaging prior to treatment under any circumstances.
            (iv) The facility must have contingency plans, approved by APHIS, for safely destroying or disposing of regulated articles if the facility is unable to properly treat a shipment.
            (v) The facility may only treat articles approved by APHIS for treatment at the facility. Approved articles will be listed in the compliance agreement required in paragraph (f) of this section.

            (vi) Arrangements for treatment must be made before the departure of a consignment from its port of entry or points of origin in the United States. APHIS and the facility must agree on all parameters, such as time, routing, and conveyance, by which the consignment will move from the port of entry or points of origin in the United States to the treatment facility. If APHIS and the facility cannot reach agreement in advance on these parameters then no consignments may be moved to that facility until an agreement has been reached.
            (vii) Regulated articles must be conveyed to the facility in a refrigerated (via motorized refrigeration equipment) conveyance at a temperature that minimizes the mobility of the pests of concern for the article.
            (viii) The facility must apply all post-treatment safeguards required for certification under paragraph (a) of this section before releasing the articles.
            (ix) The facility must remain locked when not in operation.
            (x) The facility must maintain and provide APHIS with an updated map identifying places where horticultural or other crops are grown within 4 square miles of the facility. Proximity of host material to the facility will necessitate trapping or other pest monitoring activities, funded by the facility, to help prevent establishment of any escaped pests of concern, as approved by APHIS; these activities will be listed in the compliance agreement required in paragraph (f) of this section. The treatment facility must have a pest management plan within the facility.
            (xi) The facility must comply with any additional requirements including, but not limited to, the use of pest-proof packaging and container seals, that APHIS may require to prevent the escape of plant pests during transport to and from the cold treatment facility itself, for a particular facility based on local conditions, and for any other risk factors of concern. These activities will be listed in the compliance agreement required in paragraph (f) of this section.
            (2) For articles that are moved interstate from areas quarantined for fruit flies, cold treatment facilities may be located either within or outside of the quarantined area. If the articles are treated outside the quarantined area, they must be accompanied to the facility by a limited permit issued in accordance with § 301.32-5(b) of this chapter and must be moved in accordance with any safeguards determined to be appropriate by APHIS.
            (c) Cold treatment enclosures. All enclosures, in which cold treatment is performed, including refrigerated containers, must:
            (1) Be capable of maintaining the highest temperature of the treatment schedule under which the fruit will be treated specified in the PPQ Treatment Manual or in another approved treatment schedule before the treatment begins and holding fruit at or below the treatment temperature during the treatment.
            (2) Maintain fruit pulp temperatures according to treatment schedules with no more than a 0.39 °C (0.7 °F) variation in temperature between two consecutive hourly readings.
            (3) Be structurally sound and adequate to maintain required temperatures.
            (d) Treatment procedures. (1) All material, labor, and equipment for cold treatment performed on a vessel must be provided by the vessel or vessel agent. An official authorized by APHIS monitors, manages, and advises in order to ensure that the treatment procedures are followed.
            (2) Refrigeration must be completed in the container, compartment, or room in which it is begun.
            (3) Fruit that may be cold treated must be safeguarded to prevent cross-contamination or mixing with other infested fruit.

            (4) Fruit intended for in-transit cold treatment must be precooled to no more than the highest temperature of the treatment schedule under which the fruit will be treated prior to beginning treatment. The in-transit treatment enclosure may not be used for precooling unless an official authorized by APHIS approves the loading of the fruit in the treatment enclosure as adequate to allow for fruit pulp temperatures to be taken prior to beginning treatment. If the fruit is precooled outside the treatment enclosure, an official authorized by APHIS will take pulp temperatures manually from a sample of the fruit as the fruit is loaded for in-transit cold treatment to verify that precooling was completed. If the pulp temperatures for the sample are 0.28 °C (0.5 °F) or more above the highest temperature of the treatment schedule under which the fruit will be treated, the pallet from which the sample was taken will be rejected and returned for additional precooling until the fruit reaches the highest temperature of the treatment schedule under which the fruit will be treated. If fruit is precooled in the treatment enclosure, or if treatment is conducted at a cold treatment facility in the United States, the fruit must be precooled to the highest temperature of the treatment schedule under which the fruit will be treated, as verified by an official authorized by APHIS, prior to beginning treatment.
            (5) Breaks, damage, etc., in the treatment enclosure that preclude maintaining correct temperatures must be repaired before the enclosure is used. An official authorized by APHIS must approve loading of compartment, number and placement of temperature probes or sensors, and initial fruit temperature readings before beginning the treatment. Hanging decks and hatch coamings within vessels may not be used as enclosures for in-transit cold treatment without prior written approval from APHIS. Double-stacking of pallets is not allowed.
            (6) Only the same type of fruit in the same type of package may be treated together in a container; no mixture of fruits in containers may be treated. A numbered seal must be placed on the doors of the loaded container and may be removed only at the port of destination by an official authorized by APHIS.
            (7) Temperature recording devices used during treatment must be secured using measures approved by APHIS as adequate to ensure the security and integrity of cold treatment data. The devices must be able to record the date, time, and sensor number and automatic and continuous records of the temperature during all calibrations and during treatment. Recording devices must be capable of generating temperature charts for verification by an inspector. If records of calibrations or treatments are found to have been manipulated, the vessel or container in which the treatment is performed may be suspended from conducting cold treatments until proper equipment is installed and an official authorized by APHIS has recertified it. APHIS' decision to recertify a vessel or container will take into account the severity of the infraction that led to suspension.
            (8) A minimum of four temperature probes or sensors is required for vessel holds used as treatment enclosures. A minimum of three temperature probes or sensors is required for other treatment enclosures. An official authorized by APHIS will have the option to require that additional temperature probes or sensors be used, depending on the size of the treatment enclosure.
            (9) Fruit pulp temperatures must be maintained at the temperature specified in the treatment schedule with no more than a 0.39 °C (0.7 °F) variation in temperature between two consecutive hourly readings. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in invalidation of the treatment unless an official authorized by APHIS can verify that the pulp temperature was maintained at or below the treatment temperature for the duration of the treatment.
            (10) The time required to complete the treatment begins when all temperature probes reach the prescribed cold treatment schedule temperature. Refrigeration continues until the vessel arrives at the port of destination and the fruit is released for unloading by an inspector even though this may prolong the period required for the cold treatment.
            (11) Temperatures must be recorded at intervals no longer than 1 hour apart. Gaps of longer than 1 hour will invalidate the treatment or indicate treatment failure unless an official authorized by APHIS can verify that the pulp temperature was maintained at or below the treatment temperature for the duration of the treatment.

            (12) Cold treatment is not completed until so declared by an official authorized by APHIS or the certifying official of the foreign country; consignments of treated commodities may not be discharged until APHIS clearance has been fully completed, including review and approval of treatment record charts.
            
            (13) Cold treatment of fruits in break bulk vessels or containers must be initiated by an official authorized by APHIS if there is not a treatment technician who has been trained to initiate cold treatments for either break bulk vessels or containers.
            (14) An official authorized by APHIS may perform audits to ensure that the treatment procedures comply with the regulations in this section and that the treatment is administered in accordance with the treatment schedules in the PPQ Treatment Manual or in accordance with another approved treatment schedule. The official authorized by APHIS must be given the appropriate materials and access to the facility, container, or vessel necessary to perform the audits.
            (15) An inspector will sample and cut fruit from each consignment after it has been cold treated to monitor treatment effectiveness. If a single live pest of concern in any stage of development is found, the consignment will be held until an investigation is completed and appropriate remedial actions have been implemented. If APHIS determines at any time that the safeguards contained in this section do not appear to be effective against the pests of concern, APHIS may suspend the importation of fruits from the originating country and conduct an investigation into the cause of the deficiency. APHIS may waive the sampling and cutting requirement of paragraph (d)(15) of this section, provided that the national plant protection organization (NPPO) of the exporting country has conducted such sampling and cutting in the exporting country as part of a biometric sampling protocol approved by APHIS.
            (16) The cold treatments required for the entry of fruit are considered necessary for the elimination of plant pests, and no liability shall attach to the U.S. Department of Agriculture or to any officer or representative of that Department in the event injury results to fruit offered for entry in accordance with these instructions. In prescribing cold treatments of certain fruits, it should be emphasized that inexactness and carelessness in applying the treatments may result in injury to the fruit or its rejection for entry.
            (e) Monitoring. Treatment must be monitored by an inspector to ensure proper administration of the treatment. An inspector must also approve the recording devices and sensors used to monitor temperatures and conduct an operational check of the equipment before each use and ensure sensors are calibrated. An inspector may approve, adjust, or reject the treatment. Facilities must be located within the local commuting area for APHIS employees for inspection purposes. Facilities treating imported articles must also be located within an area over which the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is assigned authority to accept entries of merchandise, to collect duties, and to enforce the provisions of the customs and navigation laws in force.
            (f) Compliance agreements. Any person who operates a facility where cold treatment is conducted for phytosanitary purposes must sign a compliance agreement with APHIS.
            (1) Compliance agreements with importers and facility operators for cold treatment in the United States. If cold treatment of imported articles is conducted in the United States, both the importer and the operator of the cold treatment facility or the person who conducts the cold treatment must sign compliance agreements with APHIS. In the importer compliance agreement, the importer must agree to comply with any additional requirements found necessary by APHIS to ensure the shipment is not diverted to a destination other than an approved treatment facility and to prevent escape of plant pests from the articles to be treated during their transit from the port of first arrival to the cold treatment facility in the United States. In the facility compliance agreement, the facility operator or person conducting the cold treatment must agree to comply with the requirements of this section and any additional requirements found necessary by APHIS to prevent the escape of any pests of concern that may be associated with the articles to be treated.
            (2) Compliance agreements with cold treatment facilities outside the United States. If cold treatment of imported articles is conducted outside the United States, the operator of the cold treatment facility must sign a compliance agreement or an equivalent agreement with APHIS and the NPPO of the country in which the facility is located. In this agreement, the facility operator must agree to comply with the requirements of this section, and the NPPO of the country in which the facility is located must agree to monitor that compliance and inform the Administrator of any noncompliance.
            (3) Cold treatment facilities treating articles moved interstate from Hawaii and U.S. territories. Cold treatment facilities treating articles moved interstate from Hawaii and the U.S. territories must complete a compliance agreement with APHIS as provided in § 318.13-3(d) of this chapter.

            § 305.9
            Irradiation treatment requirements.
            Irradiation, carried out in accordance with the provisions of this section, is approved as a treatment for any imported regulated article (i.e., fruits, vegetables, cut flowers, and foliage); for any regulated article moved interstate from Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands (referred to collectively, in this section, as Hawaii and U.S. territories); for any berry, fruit, nut, or vegetable listed as a regulated article in § 301.32-2(a) of this chapter; and for any regulated article listed in 301.76-2 of this chapter and intended for consumption, as apparel or as a similar personal accessory, or for decorative use.
            (a) Location of facilities. (1) Where certified irradiation facilities are available, an approved irradiation treatment may be conducted for any imported regulated article either prior to shipment to the United States or in the United States. For any regulated article moved interstate from Hawaii or U.S. territories, irradiation treatment may be conducted either prior to movement to the mainland United States or in the mainland United States. Irradiation facilities may be located in any State on the mainland United States. For irradiation facilities located in the States of Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia, the following additional conditions must be met:
            (i) Prospective facility operators must submit a detailed layout of the facility site and its location to APHIS. APHIS will evaluate plant health risks based on the proposed location and layout of the facility site. APHIS will only approve a proposed facility if the Administrator determines that regulated articles can be safely transported to the facility from port of entry or points of origin in the United States.
            (ii) The government of the State in which the facility is to be located must concur in writing with the location of the facility or, if it does not concur, must provide a written explanation of concern based on pest risks. In instances where the State government does not concur with the proposed facility location, and provides a written explanation of concern based on pest risks, APHIS and the State must agree on a strategy to resolve the pest risk concerns prior to APHIS approval. If the State does not provide a written explanation of concern based on pest risks, then State concurrence will not be required before APHIS approves the facility location.
            (iii) Untreated articles may not be removed from their packaging prior to treatment under any circumstances.
            (iv) The facility must have contingency plans, approved by APHIS, for safely destroying or disposing of regulated articles if the facility is unable to properly treat a shipment.
            (v) The facility may only treat articles approved by APHIS for treatment at the facility. Approved articles will be listed in the compliance agreement required in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.

            (vi) Arrangements for treatment must be made before the departure of a consignment from its port of entry or points of origin in the United States. APHIS and the facility must agree on all parameters, such as time, routing, and conveyance, by which the consignment will move from the port of entry or points of origin in the United States to the treatment facility. If APHIS and the facility cannot reach agreement in advance on these parameters then no consignments may be moved to that facility until an agreement has been reached.
            (vii) Regulated articles must be conveyed to the facility in a refrigerated (via motorized refrigeration equipment or other methods including ice or insulation) or air-conditioned conveyance at a temperature that minimizes the mobility of the pests of concern for the article.
            (viii) The facility must maintain and provide APHIS with an updated map identifying places where horticultural or other crops are grown within 4 square miles of the facility. Proximity of host material to the facility will necessitate trapping or other pest monitoring activities to help prevent establishment of any escaped pests of concern, as approved by APHIS; these activities will be listed in the compliance agreement required in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. The treatment facility must have a pest management plan within the facility.
            (ix) The facility must comply with any additional requirements that APHIS may require to prevent the escape of plant pests during transport to and from the irradiation facility itself, for a particular facility based on local conditions, and for any other risk factors of concern. These activities will be listed in the compliance agreement required in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
            (2) For articles that are moved interstate from areas quarantined for fruit flies, irradiation facilities may be located either within or outside of the quarantined area. If the articles are treated outside the quarantined area, they must be accompanied to the facility by a limited permit issued in accordance with § 301.32-5(b) of this chapter and must be moved in accordance with any safeguards determined to be appropriate by APHIS.
            (3) For articles that are moved interstate from areas quarantined only for Asian citrus psyllid, and not for citrus greening, irradiation facilities must be located within an area that is not quarantined for citrus greening.
            (b) Approved facilities. The irradiation treatment facility must be approved by APHIS. Other agencies that have regulatory oversight and requirements must concur in writing with the establishment of the facility prior to APHIS approval. In order to be approved, a facility must fulfill the requirements in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
            (c) Compliance agreements. Compliance agreements for facilities located in States listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may also contain additional provisions as described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(ix) of this section. (1) Irradiation facilities treating imported articles. (i) Compliance agreements with importers and facility operators for irradiation in the United States. If irradiation of imported articles is conducted in the United States, both the importer and the operator of the irradiation facility must sign compliance agreements with APHIS. In the facility compliance agreement, the facility operator must agree to comply with any additional requirements found necessary by APHIS to prevent the escape, prior to irradiation, of any pests of concern that may be associated with the articles to be irradiated. In the importer compliance agreement, the importer must agree to comply with any additional requirements found necessary by APHIS to ensure the shipment is not diverted to a destination other than an approved treatment facility and to prevent escape of plant pests from the articles to be irradiated during their transit from the port of first arrival to the irradiation facility in the United States.
            (ii) Compliance agreement with irradiation facilities outside the United States. If irradiation of imported articles is conducted outside the United States, the operator of the irradiation facility must sign a compliance agreement with APHIS and the national plant protection organization (NPPO) of the country in which the facility is located. In this agreement, the facility operator must agree to comply with the requirements of this section, and the NPPO of the country in which the facility is located must agree to monitor that compliance and to inform the Administrator of any noncompliance.
            (2) Irradiation facilities treating articles moved interstate from Hawaii and U.S. territories. Irradiation facilities treating articles moved interstate from Hawaii and U.S. territories must complete a compliance agreement with APHIS as provided in § 318.13-3(d) of this chapter.
            (3) Irradiation facilities treating articles moved interstate from areas quarantined for fruit flies. Irradiation facilities treating articles moved interstate from areas quarantined for fruit flies must complete a compliance agreement with APHIS as provided in § 301.32-6 of this chapter.
            (4) Irradiation facilities treating articles moved interstate from areas quarantined only for Asian citrus psyllid, and not for citrus greening, must complete a compliance agreement with APHIS as provided in § 301.76-8 of this chapter.
            (d) Certified facility. The irradiation treatment facility must be certified by APHIS. Recertification is required in the event of an increase in the amount of radioisotope, a decrease in the amount of radioisotope for a reason other than natural decay, a major modification to equipment that affects the delivered dose, or a change in the owner or managing entity of the facility. Recertification also may be required in cases where a significant variance in dose delivery has been measured by the dosimetry system. In order to be certified, a facility must:
            (1) Be capable of administering the minimum absorbed ionizing radiation doses specified in the PPQ Treatment Manual or in another treatment schedule approved in accordance with § 305.2 to the regulated articles;1
              
            
            
              
                1 The maximum absorbed ionizing radiation dose and the irradiation of food is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration under 21 CFR part 179.
            
            (2) Be constructed so as to provide physically separate locations for treated and untreated articles, except that articles traveling by conveyor directly into the irradiation chamber may pass through an area that would otherwise be separated. The locations must be separated by a permanent physical barrier such as a wall or chain link fence 6 or more feet high to prevent transfer of cartons, or some other means approved during certification to prevent reinfestation of articles and spread of pests.
            (3) If the facility is to be used to treat imported articles and is located in the United States, the facility will only be certified if APHIS determines that regulated articles will be safely transported to the facility from the port of arrival without significant risk that plant pests will escape in transit or while the regulated articles are at the facility.
            (e) Monitoring and interagency agreements. Treatment must be monitored by an inspector. This monitoring will include inspection of treatment records and unannounced inspections of the facility by an inspector, and may include inspection of articles prior to or after irradiation. Facilities must be located within the local commuting area for APHIS employees for inspection purposes.
            (1) Irradiation facilities treating imported articles; irradiation treatment framework equivalency workplan. Facilities shall be located within an area over which the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is assigned authority to accept entries of merchandise, to collect duties, and to enforce the provisions of the customs and navigation laws in force. The NPPO of a country from which articles are to be imported into the United States in accordance with this section must sign a framework equivalency workplan with APHIS. In this plan, both the NPPO and APHIS will specify the following items for their respective countries:
            (A) Citations for any requirements that apply to the importation of irradiated fruits and vegetables;
            (B) The type and amount of inspection, monitoring, or other activities that will be required in connection with allowing the importation of irradiated fruits and vegetables into that country; and

            (C) Any other conditions that must be met to allow the importation of irradiated fruits and vegetables into that country.
            
            (2) Irradiation facilities located in foreign countries. Facilities in foreign countries that carry out irradiation operations must notify the Director of Preclearance, PPQ, APHIS, 4700 River Road Unit 140, Riverdale, MD 20737-1236, of scheduled operations at least 30 days before operations commence, except where otherwise provided in the facility preclearance workplan. To ensure the appropriate level of monitoring, before articles may be imported in accordance with this section, the following agreements must be signed, in addition to the irradiation treatment framework equivalency workplan required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section:
            (i) Facility preclearance workplan. Prior to commencing importation into the United States of articles treated at a foreign irradiation facility, APHIS and the NPPO of the country from which articles are to be imported must jointly develop a preclearance workplan that details the activities that APHIS and the foreign NPPO will carry out in connection with each irradiation facility to verify the facility's compliance with the requirements of this section. Typical activities to be described in this workplan may include frequency of visits to the facility by APHIS and foreign plant protection inspectors, methods for reviewing facility records, and methods for verifying that facilities are in compliance with the requirements for separation of articles, packaging, labeling, and other requirements of this section. This facility preclearance workplan will be reviewed and renewed by APHIS and the foreign NPPO on an annual basis.
            (ii) Trust fund agreement. Irradiated articles may be imported into the United States in accordance with this section only if the NPPO of the country in which the irradiation facility is located or a private export group has entered into a trust fund agreement with APHIS. That agreement requires the NPPO or the private export group to pay, in advance of each shipping season, all costs that APHIS estimates it will incur in providing inspection and treatment monitoring services at the irradiation facility during that shipping season. Those costs include administrative expenses and all salaries (including overtime and the Federal share of employee benefits), travel expenses (including per diem expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred by APHIS in performing these services. The agreement will describe the general nature and scope of APHIS services provided at irradiation facilities covered by the agreement, such as whether APHIS inspectors will monitor operations continuously or intermittently, and will generally describe the extent of inspections APHIS will perform on articles prior to and after irradiation. The agreement requires the NPPO or private export group to deposit a certified or cashier's check with APHIS for the amount of those costs, as estimated by APHIS. If the deposit is not sufficient to meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the agreement further requires the NPPO or the private export group to deposit with APHIS a certified or cashier's check for the amount of the remaining costs, as determined by APHIS, before any more articles irradiated in that country may be imported into the United States. After a final audit at the conclusion of each shipping season, any overpayment of funds would be returned to the NPPO or the private export group or held on account until needed, at the option of the NPPO or the private export group.
            (3) Irradiation facilities located within the United States. Facilities located within the United States must notify an inspector at least 24 hours (excluding Saturday, Sunday, and Federal holidays) before scheduled operations. 2
               If the facility will be used to treat imported articles, the NPPO of the country from which the articles are to be imported into the United States in accordance with this section must also sign the irradiation treatment framework equivalency workplan required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
            
              
                2 Inspectors are assigned to local offices of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which are listed in telephone directories.
            
            (f) Packaging. Articles that are irradiated in accordance with this section must be packaged in cartons in the following manner:
            
            (1) Irradiated articles may not be packaged for shipment in a carton with nonirradiated articles.
            (2) For all imported articles irradiated prior to arrival in the United States, all articles moved interstate from Hawaii or U.S. territories and irradiated prior to arrival in the mainland United States, and all regulated articles to be moved interstate from an area quarantined for fruit flies or Asian citrus psyllid that are treated within the quarantined area:
            (i) The fruits and vegetables must be packaged either:
            (A) In insect-proof cartons that have no openings that will allow the entry of the pests of concern. The cartons must be sealed with seals that will visually indicate if the cartons have been opened. The cartons may be constructed of any material that prevents entry or oviposition (if applicable) by the pests of concern into the articles in the carton;3
               or
            
              
                3 If there is a question as to the adequacy of a carton, send a request for approval of the carton, together with a sample carton, to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Center for Plant Health Inspection and Technology, 1730 Varsity Drive, Suite 400, Raleigh, NC 27606-5202.
            
            (B) In noninsect-proof cartons that are stored immediately after irradiation in a room completely enclosed by walls or screening that completely precludes access by the pests of concern. If stored in noninsect-proof cartons in a room that precludes access by the pests of concern, prior to leaving the room, each pallet of cartons must be completely enclosed in polyethylene shrink wrap, or another solid or netting covering that completely precludes access to the cartons by the pests of concern.
            (ii) To preserve the integrity of treated lots, each pallet-load of cartons containing the fruits and vegetables must be secured before leaving the irradiation facility in one of the following ways:
            (A) With polyethylene shrink wrap;
            (B) With net wrapping; or
            (C) With strapping.
            (iii) Packaging must be labeled in a manner that allows an inspector to determine treatment lot numbers, packing and treatment facility identification and location, and dates of packing and treatment.
            (A) For imported articles that are treated prior to arrival in the United States, pallets that remain intact as one unit until entry into the United States may have one such label per pallet. Pallets that are broken apart into smaller units prior to or during entry into the United States, or that will be broken apart into smaller units after entry into the United States, must have the required label information on each individual carton.
            (B) For articles moved interstate from Hawaii or U.S. territories that are treated prior to arrival in the mainland United States, pallets that remain intact as one unit until entry into the mainland United States may have one such label per pallet. Pallets that are broken apart into smaller units prior to or during entry into the mainland United States, or that will be broken apart into smaller units after entry into the mainland United States, must have the required label information on each individual carton.
            (3) For all articles imported to be irradiated upon arrival in the United States, moved interstate from Hawaii or U.S. territories to be irradiated upon arrival in the mainland United States, or moved interstate from areas quarantined for fruit flies or Asian citrus psyllid to be irradiated outside the quarantined area, the articles must be packed in cartons that have no openings that will allow the exit of the pests of concern and that are sealed with seals that will visually indicate if the cartons have been opened. They may be constructed of any material that prevents the pests of concern from exiting the carton. Cartons of untreated articles must be shipped in shipping containers sealed prior to their shipment with seals that will visually indicate if the shipping containers have been opened.
            (g) Containers or vans. Containers or vans that will transport treated articles must be free of pests of concern prior to loading the treated articles.
            (h) Certification of treatment for articles treated outside the United States. For each consignment treated in an irradiation facility outside the United States, a phytosanitary certificate, with the treatment section completed and issued by the NPPO, must accompany the consignment.
            (i) Dosage. The regulated articles must receive the minimum absorbed ionizing radiation dose specified in the PPQ Treatment Manual or in another approved treatment schedule.
            (j) Dosimetry systems at the irradiation facility. (1) Dosimetry must indicate the doses needed to ensure that all the articles will receive the minimum dose prescribed.
            (2) The absorbed dose, as measured using an accurate dosimetry system, must meet or exceed the absorbed dose for the pest(s) of concern required by the PPQ Treatment Manual or by another approved treatment schedule.
            (3) When designing the facility's dosimetry system and procedures for its operation, the facility operator must address guidance and principles from the International Standards Organization/American Society for Testing and Materials standard 4
               or an equivalent standard recognized by APHIS.

            (k) Records. An irradiation processor must maintain records of each treated lot for 1 year following the treatment date, and must make these records available for inspection by an inspector during normal business hours (8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays). These records must include the lot identification, scheduled process, evidence of compliance with the scheduled process, ionizing energy source, source calibration, dosimetry, dose distribution in the product, and the date of irradiation.
            (l) Request for initial certification and inspection of facility. Persons requesting initial certification of an irradiation treatment facility must submit the request for approval in writing to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Center for Plant Health Inspection and Technology, 1730 Varsity Drive, Suite 400, Raleigh, NC 27606-5202. The initial request must identify the owner, location, and radiation source of the facility, and the applicant must supply additional information about the facility construction, treatment protocols, and operations upon request by APHIS if APHIS requires additional information to evaluate the request. Before the Administrator determines whether an irradiation facility is eligible for certification, an inspector will make a personal inspection of the facility to determine whether it complies with the standards of this section.
            (m) Denial and withdrawal of certification. (1) The Administrator will withdraw the certification of any irradiation treatment facility upon written request from the irradiation processor.
            (2) The Administrator will deny or withdraw certification of an irradiation treatment facility when any provision of this section is not met. Before withdrawing or denying certification, the Administrator will inform the irradiation processor in writing of the reasons for the proposed action and provide the irradiation processor with an opportunity to respond. The Administrator will give the irradiation processor an opportunity for a hearing regarding any dispute of a material fact, in accordance with rules of practice that will be adopted for the proceeding. However, the Administrator will suspend certification pending final determination in the proceeding if he or she determines that suspension is necessary to prevent the spread of any dangerous insect. The suspension will be effective upon oral or written notification, whichever is earlier, to the irradiation processor. In the event of oral notification, written confirmation will be given to the irradiation processor within 10 days of the oral notification. The suspension will continue in effect pending completion of the proceeding and any judicial review of the proceeding.
            (n) Department not responsible for damage. This treatment is approved to assure quarantine security against the plant pests listed in the PPQ Treatment Manual or the plant pests for which another treatment schedule is approved in accordance with § 305.2. From the literature available, the articles authorized for treatment under this section are believed tolerant to the treatment; however, the facility operator and shipper are responsible for determination of tolerance. The Department of Agriculture and its inspectors assume no responsibility for any loss or damage resulting from any treatment prescribed or monitored. Additionally, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is responsible for ensuring that irradiation facilities are constructed and operated in a safe manner. Further, the Food and Drug Administration is responsible for ensuring that irradiated foods are safe and wholesome for human consumption.
            (o) Substitution of irradiation for other treatments. Treatment of fruits and vegetables that are from foreign localities, from Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, or from domestic areas under quarantine with irradiation in accordance with this section may be substituted for other approved treatments if the target pests of the other approved treatments are approved for treatment with irradiation in the PPQ Treatment Manual or approved for treatment with irradiation in accordance with § 305.2.

              § 318.13-3
              General requirements for all regulated articles.
              All regulated articles that are allowed movement under this subpart must be moved in accordance with the following requirements, except as specifically provided otherwise in this subpart.
              (a) Freedom from plant debris. All regulated articles moved under this subpart must be free from plant debris.
              (b) Certification. Certification may be issued for the movement of regulated articles under the following conditions:
              
              (1) Certification on basis of inspection or nature of lot involved. Regulated articles may be certified when they have been inspected by an inspector and found apparently free from infestation and infection, or without such inspection when the inspector determines that the lot for consignment is of such a nature that no danger of infestation or infection is involved.
              (i) Persons intending to move any articles that may be certified must contact the local Plant Protection and Quarantine office as far as possible in advance of the contemplated date of shipment in order to request an inspection.
              (ii) Persons intending to move any articles that may be certified must prepare, handle, and safeguard such articles from infestation or reinfestation, and assemble them at such points as the inspector may designate, placing them so that inspection may be readily made.
              (2) Certification on basis of treatment. (i) Regulated articles for which treatments are approved underpart 305 of this chapter may be certified if such treatments have been applied in accordance with part 305 of this chapter and if the articles were handled after such treatment in accordance with a compliance agreement executed by the applicant for certification or under the supervision of an inspector.
              (ii) Regulated articles certified after treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter that are taken aboard any ship, vessel, other surface craft, or aircraft must be segregated and protected in a manner as required by the inspector.
              (c) Limited permits. (1) Limited permits 1
                 may be issued by an inspector for the movement of certain noncertified regulated articles to restricted destinations.
              
                
                  1 Limited permits can be obtained from each State or territory's local Plant Protection and Quarantine office.
              
              (2) Limited permits may be issued by an inspector for the movement of regulated articles that would otherwise be prohibited movement under this subpart, if the articles are to be moved in accordance with § 318.13-6.
              (3) Except when the regulations specify that an inspector must issue the limited permit, limited permits may be issued by a person operating under a compliance agreement.
              (d) Compliance agreements. As a condition for the movement of regulated articles for which a compliance agreement is required, the person entering the compliance agreement must agree to the following:
              (1) That he or she will use any permit or certification issued to him or her in accordance with the provisions in the permit, the requirements in this subpart, and the compliance agreement;
              (2) That he or she will maintain at his or her establishment such safeguards against the establishment and spread of infestation and infection and comply with such conditions as to the maintenance of identity, handling (including post-treatment handling), and interstate movement of regulated articles and the cleaning and treatment of means of conveyance and containers used in such movement of the articles, as may be required by the inspector in each specific case to prevent the spread of infestation or infection; and
              (3) That he or she will allow inspectors to inspect the establishment and its operations.
              (e) Attachment of limited permit or verification of certification. Except as otherwise provided for certain air cargo and containerized cargo on ships moved in accordance with § 318.13-10, each box, bale, crate, or other container of regulated articles moved under certification or limited permit shall have the limited permit attached to the outside of the container or bear a U.S. Department of Agriculture stamp or inspection sticker verifying that the consignment has been certified in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section: Provided, That if a limited permit or certification is issued for a consignment of more than one container or for bulk products, certification shall be stamped on or the limited permit shall be attached to the accompanying waybill, manifest, or bill of lading.
              (f) Withdrawal of certification, transit permits, limited permits, or compliance agreements. Any certification, transit permit, limited permit, or compliance agreement which has been issued or authorized may be withdrawn by an inspector orally or in writing, if such inspector determines that the holder thereof has not complied with all conditions under the regulations for the use of such document. If the cancellation is oral, the decision and the reasons for the withdrawal shall be confirmed in writing as promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose certification, transit permit, limited permit, or compliance agreement has been withdrawn may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving the written notification of the withdrawal. The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the certification, transit permit, limited permit, or compliance agreement was wrongfully withdrawn. The Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for such decision, as promptly as circumstances allow. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall be held to resolve such conflict. Rules of practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.
              (g) Container marking and identity. Except as provided in § 318.13-6(c), consignments of regulated articles moved in accordance with this subpart must have the following information clearly marked on each container or on the waybill, manifest, or bill of lading accompanying the articles: Nature and quantity of contents; name and address of shipper, owner, or person shipping or forwarding the articles; name and address of consignee; shipper's identifying mark and number; and the certification stamp or number of the limited permit authorizing movement, if one was issued.
              (h) Refusal of movement. An inspector may refuse to allow the interstate movement of a regulated article if the inspector finds that the regulated article is prohibited, is not accompanied by required documentation, is so infested with a plant pest or noxious weed that, in the judgment of the inspector, it cannot be cleaned or treated, or contains soil or other prohibited contaminants.
              (i) Costs and charges. Services of the inspector during regularly assigned hours of duty at the usual places of duty shall be furnished without cost to the one requesting such services. APHIS will not assume responsibility for any costs or charges, other than those indicated in this section, in connection with the inspection, treatment, conditioning, storage, forwarding, or any other operation of any character incidental to the physical movement of regulated articles or plant pests.
              (j) APHIS not responsible for damage. APHIS assumes no responsibility for any damage to regulated articles that results from the application of treatment or other measures required under this subpart (or under part 305 of this chapter) to protect against the dissemination of plant pests within the United States.

              § 318.13-4
              Authorization of certain fruits and vegetables for interstate movement.
              (a) Determination by the Administrator. No fruit or vegetable is authorized for interstate movement from Hawaii or the territories unless the Administrator has determined that the risk posed by each quarantine pest associated with the fruit or vegetable can be reasonably mitigated by the application of one or more phytosanitary measures designated by the Administrator.
              (b) Designated phytosanitary measures. (1) The fruits and vegetables are subject to phytosanitary treatments, which could include, but are not limited to, pest control treatments in the field or growing site, and post-harvest treatments.
              (2) The fruits and vegetables are subject to growing area pest mitigations, which could include, but are not limited to, detection surveys, trapping requirements, pest exclusionary structures, and field inspections.

              (3) The fruits and vegetables are subject to safeguarding and movement mitigations, which could include, but are not limited to, safeguarded transport, box labeling, limited distribution, insect-proof boxes, and importation as commercial consignments only.
              (4) The fruits and vegetables are subject to administrative mitigations, which could include, but are not limited to, registered fields or orchards, registered growing sites, registered packinghouses, inspection in the State of origin by an inspector, and operational workplan monitoring.
              (5) The fruits and vegetables are subject to any other measures deemed appropriate by the Administrator.
              (c) Authorized fruits and vegetables—(1) Comprehensive list. The name and origin of all fruits and vegetables authorized for interstate movement under this section, as well as the applicable requirements for their movement, may be found on the internet at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/complete-list-of-electronic-manuals.
              
              (2) Fruits and vegetables authorized for interstate movement prior to October 15, 2018. Fruits and vegetables that were authorized for interstate movement under this subpart as of October 15, 2018 may continue to be moved interstate under the same requirements that applied before October 15, 2018, except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
              (3) Other fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables not already authorized for interstate movement as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be authorized for interstate movement only after:
              (i) APHIS has analyzed the pest risk posed by the interstate movement of a fruit or vegetable and has determined that the risk posed by each quarantine pest associated with the fruit or vegetable can be reasonably mitigated by the application of one or more phytosanitary measures;

              (ii) APHIS has made its pest risk analysis and determination available for public comment for at least 60 days through a notice published in the Federal Register; and

              (iii) The Administrator has announced his or her decision in a subsequent Federal Register notice to begin allowing interstate movement of the fruit or vegetable subject to the phytosanitary measures specified in the notice.
              (4) Changes to phytosanitary measures. (i) If the Administrator determines that the phytosanitary measures required for a fruit or vegetable that has been authorized interstate movement under this subpart are no longer sufficient to reasonably mitigate the pest risk posed by the fruit or vegetable, APHIS will prohibit or further restrict interstate movement of the fruit or vegetable. APHIS will also publish a notice in the Federal Register advising the public of its finding. The notice will specify the amended interstate movement requirements, provide an effective date for the change, and invite public comment on the subject.
              (ii) If the Administrator determines that any of the phytosanitary measures required for a fruit or vegetable that has been authorized interstate movement under this subpart are no longer necessary to reasonably mitigate the pest risk posed by the fruit or vegetable, APHIS will make new pest risk documentation available for public comment, in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section, prior to allowing interstate movement of the fruit or vegetable subject to the phytosanitary measures specified in the notice.

              § 318.13-5
              Pest-free areas.
              Certain fruits or vegetables may be moved interstate provided that the fruits or vegetables originate from an area that is free of a specific pest or pests. In some cases, fruits or vegetables may only be moved interstate if the area of origin is free of all plant pests that attack the fruits or vegetables. In other cases, fruits or vegetables may be moved interstate if the area of origin is free of one or more plant pests that attack the fruit or vegetable and the risk posed by the remaining plant pests that attack the fruit or vegetable is mitigated by other specific phytosanitary measures contained in the regulations in this subpart.
              (a) Application of standards for pest-free areas. APHIS will make a determination of an area's pest-free status based on information provided by the State. The information used to make this determination will include trapping and surveillance data, survey protocols, and protocols for actions to be performed upon detection of a pest.
              (b) Survey protocols. APHIS must approve the survey protocol used to determine and maintain pest-free status, as well as protocols for actions to be performed upon detection of a pest. Pest-free areas are subject to audit by APHIS to verify their status.
              (c) Determination of pest freedom. (1) For an area to be considered free of a specified pest for the purposes of this subpart, the Administrator must determine, and announce in a notice published in the Federal Register for a public comment period of 60 days, that the area meets the criteria of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

              (2) The Administrator will announce his or her decision in a subsequent Federal Register notice. If appropriate, APHIS will allow movement of the regulated article from a pest-free area because:
              (i) No comments were received on the notice or
              (ii) The comments on the notice did not affect the overall conclusions of the notice and the Administrator's determination of risk.
              (d) Decertification of pest-free areas; reinstatement. If a pest is detected in an area that is designated as free of that pest, APHIS will publish in the Federal Register a notice announcing that the pest-free status of the area in question has been withdrawn and that interstate movement of host crops for the pest in question is subject to application of an approved treatment for the pest. If a treatment for the pest is not available, interstate movement of the host crops would be prohibited. In order for a decertified pest-free area to be reinstated, it would have to meet the criteria of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.
              (e) General requirements for the interstate movement of regulated articles from pest-free areas—(1) Labeling. Each box of fruits or vegetables that is moved interstate from a pest-free area under this subpart must be clearly labeled with:
              (i) The name of the orchard or grove of origin, or the name of the grower; and
              (ii) The name of the municipality and State or territory in which the fruits or vegetables were produced; and
              (iii) The type and amount of fruits or vegetables the box contains.
              (2) Compliance agreement. Persons wishing to move fruits or vegetables from a pest-free area in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the U.S. Virgin Islands must enter into a compliance agreement with APHIS in accordance with § 318.13-3(d).
              (3) Safeguarding. If fruits or vegetables are moved from a pest-free area into or through an area that is not free of that pest, the fruits or vegetables must be safeguarded during the time they are present in a non-pest-free area by being covered with insect-proof mesh screens or plastic tarpaulins, including while in transit to the packinghouse and while awaiting packaging. If fruits or vegetables are moved through an area that is not free of that pest during transit to a port, they must be packed in insect-proof cartons or containers or be covered by insect-proof mesh or plastic tarpaulins during transit to the port and subsequent movement into or through the United States. These safeguards described in this section must remain intact until the fruits or vegetables reach their final destination.

              (vii) The estimated time necessary to accomplish exportation, from arrival at the port of arrival in the continental United States to exit at the port of export;
              (viii) The port of export; and
              (ix) The name and address of the applicant and, if the applicant's address is not within the territorial limits of the continental United States, the name and address in the continental United States of an agent whom the applicant names for acceptance of service of process.
              (2) A transit permit will be issued only if the following conditions are met:
              (i) APHIS inspectors are available at the port of arrival, port of export, and any locations at which transloading of cargo will take place and, in the case of air consignments, at any interim stop in the continental United States, as indicated on the application for the transit permit;
              (ii) The application indicates that the proposed movement would comply with the provisions in this section applicable to the transit permit; and
              (iii) During the 12 months prior to receipt of the application by APHIS, the applicant has not had a transit permit withdrawn under § 318.13-3(f), unless the transit permit has been reinstated upon appeal.
              (b) Limited permit. Fruits or vegetables shipped from Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the U.S. Virgin Islands through the continental United States under this section must be accompanied by a limited permit, a copy of which must be presented to an inspector at the port of arrival and the port of export in the continental United States, and at any other location in the continental United States where an air consignment is authorized to stop or where overland consignments change means of conveyance. An inspector will issue a limited permit if the following conditions are met:
              (1) The inspector determines that the specific type and quantity of the fruits or vegetables being shipped are accurately described by accompanying documentation, such as the accompanying manifest, waybill, and bill of lading. (Only scientific or English common names are acceptable.) The fruits or vegetables shall be assembled at whatever point and in whatever manner the inspector designates as necessary to comply with the requirements of this section; and
              (2) The inspector establishes that the consignment of fruits or vegetables has been prepared in compliance with the provisions of this section.
              (c) Marking requirements. Each of the smallest units, including each of the smallest bags, crates, or cartons, containing regulated articles for transit through the continental United States under this section must be conspicuously marked, prior to the locking and sealing of the container in the State of origin, with a printed label that includes a description of the specific type and quantity of the fruits or vegetables (only scientific or English common names are acceptable), the transit permit number under which the regulated articles are to be shipped, and, in English, the State in which they were grown and the statement “Distribution in the United States is Prohibited.”
              (d) Handling of fruits and vegetables. Fruits or vegetables shipped through the United States from Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the U.S. Virgin Islands in accordance with this section may not be commingled in the same sealed container with fruits or vegetables that are intended for entry and distribution in the United States. The fruits or vegetables must be kept in sealed containers from the time the limited permit required by paragraph (b) of this section is issued, until the fruits or vegetables exit the United States, except as otherwise provided in the regulations in this section. Transloading must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (a), (h), and (i) of this section.
              (e) Area of movement. The port of arrival, the port of export, ports for air stops, and overland movement within the continental United States of fruits or vegetables shipped under this section is limited to a corridor that includes all States of the continental United States except Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia, except that movement is allowed through Dallas/Fort Worth, TX, as an authorized stop for air cargo, or as a transloading location for consignments that arrive by air but that are subsequently transloaded into trucks for overland movement from Dallas/Fort Worth, TX, into the designated corridor by the shortest route. Movement through the United States must begin and end at locations staffed by APHIS inspectors.
              (f) Movement of regulated articles. Transportation through the continental United States shall be by the most direct route to the final destination of the consignment in the country to which it is exported, as determined by APHIS based on commercial shipping routes and timetables and set forth in the transit permit. No change in the quantity of the original consignment from that described in the limited permit is allowed. No remarking is allowed. No diversion or delay of the consignment from the itinerary described in the transit permit and limited permit is allowed unless authorized by an APHIS inspector upon determination by the inspector that the change will not significantly increase the risk of plant pests or diseases in the United States, and unless each port to which the consignment is diverted is staffed by APHIS inspectors.
              (g) Notification in case of emergency. In the case of an emergency such as an accident, a mechanical breakdown of the means of conveyance, or an unavoidable deviation from the prescribed route, the person in charge of the means of conveyance must, as soon as practicable, notify the APHIS office at the port where the cargo arrived in the United States.
              (h) Consignments by sea. Except as authorized by this paragraph, consignments arriving in the United States by sea from Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the U.S. Virgin Islands may be transloaded once from a ship to another ship or, alternatively, once to a truck or railcar at the port of arrival and once from a truck or railcar to a ship at the port of export, and must remain in the original sealed container, except under extenuating circumstances and when authorized by an inspector upon determination by the inspector that the transloading would not significantly increase the risk of the introduction of plant pests or diseases into the United States, and provided that APHIS inspectors are available to provide supervision. No other transloading of the consignment is allowed, except under extenuating circumstances (e.g. , equipment breakdown) and when authorized by an inspector upon determination by the inspector that the transloading would not significantly increase the risk of the introduction of plant pests or diseases into the continental United States, and provided that APHIS inspectors are available to provide supervision.
              (i) Consignments by air. (1) Consignments arriving in the United States by air from Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the U.S. Virgin Islands may be transloaded only once in the United States. Transloading of air consignments must be carried out in the presence of an APHIS inspector. Consignments arriving by air that are transloaded may be transloaded either into another aircraft or into a truck trailer for export by the most direct route to the final destination of the consignment through the designated corridor set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. This may be done at either the port of arrival in the United States or at the second air stop within the designated corridor, as authorized in the transit permit and as provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section. No other transloading of the consignment is allowed, except under extenuating circumstances (e.g., equipment breakdown) and when authorized by an APHIS inspector upon determination by the inspector that the transloading would not significantly increase the risk of the introduction of plant pests or diseases into the United States, and provided that APHIS inspectors are available to provide supervision. Transloading of air consignments will be authorized only if the following conditions are met:
              (i) The transloading is done into sealable containers;

              (ii) The transloading is carried out within the secure area of the airport (i.e., that area of the airport that is open only to personnel authorized by the airport security authorities);
              (iii) The area used for any storage is within the secure area of the airport; and
              (iv) APHIS inspectors are available to provide the supervision required by paragraph (i)(1) of this section.

              (2) Except as authorized by paragraph (f) of this section, consignments that continue by air from the port of arrival in the continental United States may be authorized by APHIS for only one additional stop in the continental United States, provided the second stop is within the designated corridor set forth in paragraph (e) of this section and is staffed by APHIS inspectors. As an alternative to transloading a consignment arriving in the United States into another aircraft, consignments that arrive by air may be transloaded into a truck trailer for export by the most direct route to the final destination of the consignment through the designated corridor set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. This may be done at either the port of arrival in the United States or at the second authorized air stop within the designated corridor. No other transloading of the consignment is allowed, except under extenuating circumstances (e.g., equipment breakdown) and when authorized by an APHIS inspector upon determination by the inspector that the transloading would not significantly increase the risk of the introduction of plant pests or diseases into the United States, and provided that APHIS inspectors are available to provide supervision.
              (j) Duration and location of storage. Any storage in the United States of fruits or vegetables shipped under this section must be for a duration and in a location authorized in the transit permit required by paragraph (a) of this section. Areas where such fruits or vegetables are stored must be either locked or guarded at all times the fruits and vegetables are present. Cargo shipped under this section must be kept in a sealed container while stored in the continental United States.
              (k) Temperature requirement. Except for time spent on aircraft and except during storage and transloading of air consignments, the temperature in the sealed containers containing fruits and vegetables moved under this section must be 60 °F or lower from the time the regulated articles leave Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or any other territory or possession of the United States until they exit the United States.
              (l) Prohibited materials. (1) The person in charge of or in possession of a sealed container used for movement into or through the United States under this section must ensure that the sealed container is carrying only those fruits or vegetables authorized by the transit permit required under paragraph (a) of this section; and
              (2) The person in charge of or in possession of any means of conveyance or container returned to the United States without being reloaded after being used to export fruits or vegetables from the United States under this section must ensure that the means of conveyance or container is free of materials prohibited importation into the United States under this chapter.
              (m) Authorization by APHIS of the movement of fruits or vegetables through the United States under this section does not imply that such fruits or vegetables are enterable into the destination country. Consignments returned to the United States from the destination country shall be subject to all applicable regulations, including “Subpart—Fruits and Vegetables” of part 319 and “Plant Quarantine Safeguard Regulations” of part 352 of this chapter.
              (n) Any restrictions and requirements with respect to the arrival, temporary stay, unloading, transloading, transiting, exportation, or other movement or possession in the United States of any fruits or vegetables under this section shall apply to any person who brings into, maintains, unloads, transloads, transports, exports, or otherwise moves or possesses in the United States such fruits or vegetables, whether or not that person is the one who was required to have a transit permit or limited permit for the fruits or vegetables or is a subsequent custodian of the fruits or vegetables. Failure to comply with all applicable restrictions and requirements under this section by such a person shall be deemed to be a violation of this section.

              § 318.13-17
              Cut flowers from Hawaii.
              (a) Except for cut blooms and leis of mauna loa and jade vine and except for cut blooms of gardenia not grown in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, cut flowers may be moved interstate from Hawaii under limited permit, to a destination specified in the permit, directly from an establishment operated in accordance with the terms of a compliance agreement executed by the operator of the establishment, if the articles have not been exposed to infestation and they are not accompanied by any articles prohibited interstate movement under this subpart.
              (b) Cut blooms of gardenia may be moved interstate from Hawaii if grown and inspected in accordance with the provisions of this section. 4
                
              
              
                
                  4 Cut blooms of gardenia are also eligible for interstate movement with treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter.
              
              (1) The grower's production area must be inspected annually by an inspector and found free of green scale. If green scale is found during an inspection, a 2-month ban will be placed on the interstate movement of cut blooms of gardenia from that production area. Near the end of the 2 months, an inspector will reinspect the grower's production area to determine whether green scale is present. If reinspection determines that the production area is free of green scale, shipping may resume. If reinspection determines that green scale is still present in the production area, another 2-month ban on shipping will be placed on the interstate movement of gardenia from that production area. Each ban will be followed by reinspection in the manner specified, and the production area must be found free of green scale prior to interstate movement.

              (2) The grower must establish a buffer area surrounding gardenia production areas. The buffer area must extend 20 feet from the edge of the production area. Within the buffer area, the growing of gardenias and the following green scale host plants is prohibited: Ixora, ginger (Alpinia purpurata), plumeria, coffee, rambutan, litchi, guava, citrus, anthurium, avocado, banana, cocoa, macadamia, celery, Pluchea indica, mango, orchids, and annona.
              (3) An inspector must visually inspect the cut blooms of gardenias in each consignment prior to interstate movement from Hawaii to the mainland United States. If the inspector does not detect green scale in the consignment, the inspector will certify the consignment in accordance with § 318.13-3(b). If the inspector finds green scale in a consignment, that consignment will be ineligible for interstate movement from Hawaii.

                § 318.47
                Notice of quarantine.
                (a) The Secretary of Agriculture having previously quarantined Hawaii and Puerto Rico on account of the pink bollworm of cotton (Pectinophora gossypiella Saunders) and the cotton blister mite (Eriophyes gossypii Banks), insect pests new to and not widely prevalent or distributed within and throughout the United States, now determines that it is necessary to extend the quarantine to prevent the spread of these insects from the Virgin Islands of the United States, where they are known to occur.
                (b) Under the authority of sections 411, 412, 414, and 434 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7711, 7712, 7714, and 7754), Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States are quarantined to prevent the spread of the aforementioned insect pests.

                (c) All parts and products of plants of the genus Gossypium, such as seeds including seed cotton; cottonseed; cotton lint, linters, and other forms of cotton fiber; cottonseed hulls, cake, meal, and other cottonseed products, except oil; cotton waste; and all other unmanufactured parts of cotton plants; and all second-hand burlap and other fabric which have been used, or are of the kinds ordinarily used, for wrapping or containing cotton, are hereby prohibited movement from the Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States into or through any other State, Territory or District of the United States, in manner or method or under conditions other than those prescribed in the regulations hereinafter made or amendments thereto: Provided, That whenever the Deputy Administrator of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs shall find that existing conditions as to the pest risk involved in the movement of the articles to which the regulations supplemental hereto apply, make it safe to modify, by making less stringent, the restrictions contained in any such regulations, he shall set forth and publish such findings in administrative instructions, specifying the manner in which the regulations should be made less stringent, whereupon such modification shall become effective.

                (d) As used in this subpart, unless the context otherwise requires, the term State, Territory, or District of the United States means State, the District of Columbia, Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands of the United States.

              Requirements for submitting requests to change the regulations in 7 CFR part 319.
              (a) Definitions.
              
              
                Commodity. A plant, plant product, or other agricultural product being moved for trade or other purpose.
              (b) Procedures for submitting requests and supporting information. Persons who request changes to the import regulations contained in this part and who wish to import plants, plant parts, or plant products that are not allowed importation under the conditions of this part must file a request with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in order for APHIS to consider whether the new commodity can be safely imported into the United States. The initial request can be formal (e.g., a letter) or informal (e.g., made during a bilateral discussion between the United States and another country), and can be made by any person. Upon APHIS confirmation that granting a person's request would require amendments to the regulations in this part, the national plant protection organization of the country from which the commodity would be exported must provide APHIS with the information listed in paragraph (d) of this section before APHIS can proceed with its consideration of the request; requests that are not supported with this information in a timely manner will be considered incomplete and APHIS may not take further action on such requests until all required information is submitted.
              (c) Addresses. The national plant protection organization of the country from which commodities would be exported must submit the information listed in paragraph (d) of this section to: Commodity Import Analysis and Operations, PPQ, APHIS, 4700 River Road Unit 140, Riverdale, MD 20737.
              (d) Information. The following information must be provided to APHIS in order for APHIS to consider a request to change the regulations in part 319:
              (1) Information about the party submitting the request. The address, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses of the national plant protection organization of the country from which commodities would be exported; or, for requests that address a multi-country region, the address, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses of the exporting countries' national and regional plant protection plant protection organizations.
              (2) Information about the commodity proposed for importation into the United States. (i) A description and/or map of the specific location(s) of the areas in the exporting country where the plants, plant parts, or plant products are produced;
              (ii) The scientific name (including genus, species, and author names), synonyms, and taxonomic classification of the commodity;

              (iii) Identification of the particular plant or plant part (i.e., fruit, leaf, root, entire plant, etc.) and any associated plant part proposed for importation into the United States;
              (iv) The proposed end use of the imported commodity (e.g., propagation, consumption, milling, decorative, processing, etc.); and
              (v) The months of the year when the commodity would be produced, harvested, and exported.
              (3) Shipping information: (i) Detailed information as to the projected quantity and weight/Volume of the proposed importation, broken down according to varieties, where applicable, and;
              (ii) Method of shipping in international commerce and under what conditions, including type of conveyance, and type, size, and capacity of packing boxes and/or shipping containers.
              (4) Description of pests and diseases associated with the commodity 1
                 (i) Scientific name (including genus, species, and author names) and taxonomic classification of arthropods, fungi, bacteria, nematodes, virus, viroids, mollusks, phytoplasmas, spiroplasmas, etc., attacking the crop;
              
                
                  1 When a change is being sought to the conditions governing the importation of a commodity that is already authorized for importation into the United States, an update to or confirmation of previously submitted pest and disease information, rather than a new, complete submission of that information, may be appropriate. Persons seeking such a change may contact APHIS for a determination as to whether an update will be appropriate in a particular case.
              
              (ii) Plant part attacked by each pest, pest life stages associated with each plant part attacked, and location of pest (in, on, or with commodity); and
              (iii) References.
              (5) Current strategies for risk mitigation or management. (i) Overview of agronomic or horticultural management practices used in production of the commodity, including methods of pest risk mitigation or control programs; and
              (ii) Identification of parties responsible for pest management and control.
              (e) Additional information. None of the additional information listed in this paragraph need be provided at the same time as information required under paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section; it is required only upon request by APHIS. If APHIS determines that additional information is required in order to complete a pest risk analysis in accordance with international standards for pest risk analysis, we will notify the party submitting the request in writing what specific additional information is required. If this information is not provided, and is not available to APHIS from other sources, a request may be considered incomplete and APHIS may be unable to take further action on the request until the necessary additional information is submitted. The additional information may include one or more of the following types of information:

              § 319.6
              Controlled import permits.
              (a) Definitions.
              
              
                Administrator. The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, United States Department of Agriculture, or any employee of the United States Department of Agriculture delegated to act in his or her stead.
              
                Developmental purposes. The evaluation, monitoring, or verification of plant material for plant health risks and/or the adaptability of the material for certain uses or environments.
              
                Experimental purposes. Scientific testing which utilizes collected data and employs analytical processes under controlled conditions to create qualitative or quantitative results.
              
              
                Therapeutic purposes. The application of specific scientific processes designed to eliminate, isolate, or remove potential plant pests or diseases.
              (b) Purpose and scope. The regulations in this part prohibit or restrict the importation into the United States of certain plants, plant products, and other articles to prevent the introduction and dissemination of plant pests and noxious weeds within and throughout the United States. The regulations in this subpart provide a process under which a controlled import permit (CIP) may be issued to authorize the importation, for experimental, therapeutic, or developmental purposes, of an article whose importation is prohibited under this part. A CIP may also be issued to authorize, for those same purposes, the importation of an article under conditions that differ from those prescribed in the relevant regulations in this part.
              (c) Application process. Applications for a CIP are available without charge from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), Permit Unit, 4700 River Road Unit 136, Riverdale, MD 20737-1236, or from local PPQ offices. Applications may be submitted by mail, by fax, or electronically and must be submitted at least 60 days prior to arrival of the article at the port of entry. Mailed applications must be submitted to the address above, faxed applications may be submitted to 301-734-4300, and electronic applications may be submitted through the ePermits Web site at https://epermits.aphis.usda.gov/epermits.
              
              (1) The completed application for a CIP must provide the following information:
              (i) Name, address in the United States, and contact information of the applicant;
              (ii) Identity (common and botanical [genus and species] names) of the plant material to be imported, quantity of importation, country of origin, and country shipped from;
              (iii) Intended experimental, therapeutic, or developmental purpose for the importation; and
              (iv) Intended ports of export and entry, means of conveyance, and estimated date of arrival.
              (2) APHIS may issue a CIP if the Administrator determines that the plant pest risks associated with the plant material and its intended experimental, therapeutic, or developmental use can be effectively mitigated. The CIP will contain the applicable conditions for importation and subsequent handling of the plant material if it is deemed eligible to be imported into the United States, including the specifications for the facility where the plant will be held. The plant material may be imported only if all applicable requirements are met.
              (d) Shipping conditions. Consignments of plant material to be offered for importation under a CIP must meet the following requirements, unless otherwise specified under the conditions of the CIP:
              (1) The plant material must be selected from apparently disease-free and pest-free sources.
              (2) The plant material must be free of soil, other foreign matter or debris, other prohibited plants, noxious weed seeds, and living organisms such as parasitic plants, pathogens, insects, snails, and mites.
              (3) Fungicides, insecticides, and other treatments such as coatings, dips, or sprayings must not be applied before shipment, unless otherwise specified. Plant materials may be refused entry if they are difficult or hazardous to inspect because of the presence of such treatments. Plant materials must not be wrapped or otherwise packaged in a manner that impedes or prevents adequate inspection or treatment.
              (4) The plant material must be moved in an enclosed container or one completely enclosed by a covering adequate to prevent the possible escape or introduction of plant pests during shipment. Any packing material used in the consignment of the plant material must meet the requirements of § 319.37-11, and wood packing material used in the consignment must meet the requirements of § 319.40-3(b) and (c).
              (5) Consignments may be shipped as cargo, by mail or air freight, or hand-carried, as specified in the conditions of the CIP.

              (6) The plant material must be offered for importation at the port of entry or plant inspection station as specified in the conditions of the CIP.
              (7) A copy of the CIP must accompany each consignment, and all consignments must be labeled in accordance with instructions in the CIP.
              (8) Each consignment must be accompanied by an invoice or packing list indicating its contents.
              (e) Post-importation conditions. (1) At the approved facility where the plant material will be maintained following its importation, plant material imported under a CIP must be identified and labeled as quarantined material to be used only in accordance with a valid CIP.
              (2) Plant material must be stored in a secure place or in the manner indicated in the CIP and be under the supervision and control of the permit holder. During regular business hours, properly identified officials, either Federal or State, must be allowed to inspect the plant material and the facilities in which the plant material is maintained.
              (3) The permit holder must keep the permit valid for the duration of the authorized experimental, therapeutic, or developmental purpose. The PPQ Permit Unit must be informed of a change in contact information for the permit holder within 10 business days of such change.
              (4) Plant material imported under a CIP must not be moved or distributed to another person without prior authorization from the PPQ Permit Unit.
              (5) Should the permit holder leave the institution in which the plant material imported under a CIP is kept, the plant material must be destroyed unless, prior to the departure of the original permit holder, another person assumes responsibility for the continued maintenance of the plant material and such person obtains a new CIP for the plant material. Should the permit holder be otherwise unavailable to maintain the plant material for which the CIP was issued, the plant material must be destroyed unless another person assumes responsibility for the continued maintenance of the plant material and such person obtains a new CIP for the plant material. Permission to move or distribute plant material that was authorized for importation under a CIP to another person must be obtained by contacting the PPQ Permit Unit.
              (6) CIPs issued by APHIS are valid for a period of 1 year. The permittee may request the existing permit be renewed for up to an additional 2 years prior to the expiration of the CIP and if no adverse indications exist from the previous year.
              (f) Failure to comply with all of the conditions specified in the CIP or any applicable regulations or administrative instructions, or forging, counterfeiting, or defacing permits or shipping labels, may result in immediate revocation of the permit, denial of future permits, and civil or criminal penalties for the permit holder.
              (g) Denial, withdrawal, cancellation, or revocation of permit. The Administrator may deny a permit application in accordance with § 319.7-3, and a permit may be withdrawn, canceled, or revoked in accordance with § 319.7-4.
              (1) Action upon cancellation or revocation of permit. Upon cancellation or revocation of a permit, the permittee must surrender, destroy, or remove all regulated plant material covered by the permit in accordance with § 319.7-4(e).
              (2) Appeal of denial or revocation. Any person whose application for a permit has been denied or whose permit has been revoked may appeal the denial or revocation in accordance with § 319.7-5.

              (i) The applicant, or a partnership, firm, corporation, or other legal entity in which the applicant has a substantial interest, financial or otherwise, has not complied with any permit that was previously issued by APHIS;
              (ii) APHIS determines that issuing the permit would circumvent any order revoking or denying a permit under the Plant Protection Act;
              (iii) APHIS determines that the applicant has previously failed to comply with any APHIS regulation;
              (iv) APHIS determines that the applicant has previously failed to comply with any Federal, State, or local law, regulation, or instruction concerning the importation of prohibited or restricted foreign agricultural products;
              (v) APHIS determines that the applicant has failed to comply with the laws or regulations of a national plant protection organization or equivalent body, as these pertain to plant health;
              (vi) APHIS determines that the applicant has made false or fraudulent statements or provided false or fraudulent records to APHIS; or
              (vii) The applicant has been convicted or has pled nolo contendere to any crime involving fraud, bribery, extortion, or any other crime involving a lack of integrity.
              (2) If the application for a permit contains information that is found to be materially false, fraudulent, deceptive, or misrepresentative;

              (3) If APHIS concludes that the actions proposed under the permit would present an unacceptable risk to plants and plant products because of the potential for introduction or dissemination of a plant pest or noxious weed within the United States;
              
              (4) If the importation is adverse to the conduct of an eradication, suppression, control, or phytosanitary program of APHIS or a program recognized by APHIS;
              (5) If the importation is not in compliance with any applicable import regulations or any administrative instructions or measures, including, but not limited to, all the requirements of this part; or
              (6) If a State executive official, or a State plant protection official authorized to do so, objects to the movement in writing and provides specific, detailed information that there is a risk the movement will result in the dissemination of a plant pest or noxious weed into the State, and APHIS determines that such plant pest risk cannot be adequately addressed or mitigated.

              (a) Withdrawal of an application. If the applicant wishes to withdraw a permit application before issuance of a permit, he or she must provide the request in writing to APHIS. APHIS will provide written notification to the applicant as promptly as circumstances allow regarding reception of the request and withdrawal of the application.
              (b) Cancellation of permit by permittee. If a permittee wishes to cancel a permit after its issuance, he or she must provide the request in writing to APHIS. APHIS will provide written notification to the applicant as promptly as circumstances allow regarding reception of the request and cancellation of the permit.
              (c) Revocation of permit by APHIS. APHIS may revoke any outstanding permit to import regulated articles into the United States. A revocation, including the reason for the revocation, will be provided in writing, including by electronic methods, to the permittee as promptly as circumstances permit. The revocation of a permit may be appealed in accordance with § 319.7-5.
              (d) APHIS may revoke a permit to import a regulated article if:
              (1) Information is received subsequent to the issuance of the permit of circumstances that APHIS determines would constitute cause for the denial of an application under § 319.7-3; or
              (2) APHIS determines that the permittee has failed to maintain the safeguards or otherwise observe the conditions specified in the permit or in any applicable regulations or administrative instructions, including, but not limited to, all of the requirements of this part.
              (e) Upon revocation of a permit, the permittee must, without cost to the Federal Government and in the manner and method APHIS considers appropriate, either:
              (1) Surrender all regulated articles covered by the revoked permit and any other affected plant material to an inspector;
              (2) Destroy, under the supervision of an inspector, all regulated articles covered by the revoked permit and any other affected plant material; or
              (3) Remove all regulated articles covered by the revoked permit and any other affected plant material from the United States.

                § 319.8
                Notice of quarantine.

                (a) Pursuant to sections 411-414 and 434 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7711-7714 and 7754), the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that the unrestricted importation into the United States from all foreign countries and localities of any parts or products of plants of the genus Gossypium, including seed cotton; cottonseed; cotton lint, linters, and other forms of cotton fiber (not including yarn, thread, and cloth); cottonseed hulls, cake, meal, and other cottonseed products, except oil; cotton waste, including gin waste and thread waste; any other unmanufactured parts of cotton plants; second-hand burlap and other fabrics, shredded or otherwise, that have been used or are of the kinds ordinarily used, for containing cotton, grains (including grain products), field seeds, agricultural roots, rhizomes, tubers, or other underground crops, may result in the entry into the United States of the pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella (Saund.)), the golden nematode of potatoes (Heterodera rostochiensis Wr.), the flag smut disease (Urocystis tritici Koern.), and other injurious plant diseases and insect pests. Accordingly, to prevent the introduction into the United States of plant pests, the importation of those articles into the United States is prohibited unless they are imported in accordance with the regulations in this subpart or their importation has been authorized for experimental, therapeutic, or developmental purposes by a controlled import permit issued in accordance with § 319.6.
                (b) The importation of cotton plants (including any plant parts) that are for planting or capable of being planted is restricted in Subpart—Plants for Planting of this part.

                The plants and products specified in § 319.8(a) may be imported into Guam without further permit, other than the authorization contained in this paragraph. Sections 319.8-2 and 319.8-3 shall not be applicable to such importations. In addition, such importations need not comply with the requirements of § 319.8-4 relating to notice of arrival inasmuch as there is available to the inspector the essential information normally supplied by the importer at the time of importation. Sections 319.8-5 through 319.8-27 shall not be applicable to importations into Guam. Inspection of such importations may be made under the general authority of § 330.105(a) of this chapter. If an importation is found infected, infested, or contaminated with any plant pest and is not subject to disposal under this part, disposition may be made in accordance with § 330.106 of this chapter.

                (a) Except as otherwise provided for in §§ 319.8-10 and 319.8-18, permits shall be obtained for importations into the United States of all cotton and covers. Permits will be issued only for cotton and covers authorized entry under §§ 319.8-6 through 319.8-20. Persons desiring to import cotton or covers under §§ 319.8-6 through 319.8-20 shall, in advance of departure of such material from a foreign port, submit to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs an application for a permit in accordance with §§ 319.7 through 319.7-5 . Applications to import cottonseed shall state the approximate quantity and the proposed United States port of entry. Applications to import lint, linters, or waste shall state whether such materials are compressed.
                (b) Applications to import lint, linters, or waste at a port 1
                   other than one in the North, in California, or on the Mexican Border shall also specify whether the commodity is compressed to high density.

                (c) Upon receipt of an application to import lint, linters, waste, or covers, without treatment, for utilization under agreement as defined in § 319.8-8(a)(2), an investigation will be made by an inspector to determine that the receiving mill or plant is satisfactorily located geographically, is equipped with all necessary safeguards, and is apparently in a position to fulfill all precautionary conditions to which it may agree. Upon determination by the inspector that these qualifications are fulfilled, the owner or operator of the mill or plant may sign an agreement specifying that the required precautionary conditions will be maintained. Such signed agreement will be a necessary requisite to the release at the port of entry of any imported lint, linters, waste, or covers for forwarding to and utilization at such mill or plant in lieu of vacuum fumigation or other treatment otherwise required by this subpart. Permits for the importation of such materials will be issued in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
                (d) Permits for importation of any cotton or covers are conditioned upon compliance with all of the conditions specified in the permit and any applicable regulations or administrative instructions of this part.

                (e) Pending development of adequate treating facilities in Guam, any cotton or covers that are subject to treatment as a condition of entry therein must first be entered and treated in accordance with the requirements of this subpart at a U.S. port of arrival where such treating facilities are available.

                § 319.8-10
                Covers.
                (a) Entry of covers (including bags, slit bags, and parts of bags) which have been used as containers for cotton grown or processed in countries other than the United States may be authorized either (1) through a Mexican border port named in the permit for vacuum fumigation by an approved method in that part of the United States within the generally infested pink bollworm regulated area; or (2) through a northern port or a port in the State of California subject to vacuum fumigation by an approved method or without vacuum fumigation when the covers are to be moved to an approved mill or plant for utilization. When such covers are forwarded from a northern port to a mill or plant in California for utilization, or from a California port to another California or northern port for vacuum fumigation thereat or for movement to a mill or plant for utilization such movement shall be made by an all-water route unless the bales are compressed to a density of 20 pounds or more per cubic foot in which case the bales may be moved overland in van-type trucks or box cars if all-water transportation is not available. Such overland movement may be made only after approved surface treatment or under such other conditions as may be deemed necessary and are prescribed by the inspector. When such covers arrive at a port other than a northern, California, or Mexican border port they will be required to be transported therefrom immediately in bond by an all-water route to a northern or California port where approved vacuum fumigation facilities are available for vacuum fumigation thereat by an approved method or for forwarding therefrom to an approved mill or plant for utilization.

                (b) American cotton bagging, commonly known as coarse gunny, which has been used to cover only cotton grown or processed in the United States, may be authorized entry at any port under permit and upon compliance with §§ 319.8-4 and 319.8-5, without fumigation or other treatment. Marking patches of the finer burlaps or other fabrics when attached to bales of such bagging may be disregarded if, in the judgment of the inspector, they do not present a risk of carrying live pink bollworms, golden nematode cysts or flag smut spores.

                (c) Bags, slit bags, parts of bags, and other covers which have been used as containers for root crops or are of a kind ordinarily used as containers for root crops may be authorized entry subject to immediate treatment in such manner and according to such method as the inspector may select from administratively authorized procedures known to be effective under the conditions under which the treatment is applied, and subject to any additional safeguard measures that may be prescribed by the inspector pursuant to § 319.8-24, or that he may prescribe in regard to the manner of discharge from the carrier and conveyance to the place of treatment: Provided, That such covers may be authorized entry from Canada without treatment as prescribed in this paragraph unless the covers are found to be contaminated.
                (d) Bags, slit bags, parts of bags, and other covers that have been used as containers for wheat or wheat products that have not been so processed as to have destroyed all flag smut disease spores, or that have been used as containers for field seeds separated from wheat during the process of screening, and which arrive from a country named in § 319.59-2(a)(2) of this part, if intended for reuse in this country as grain containers may be authorized entry, subject to immediate treatment at the port of arrival. If such covers are not intended to be reused in this country as grain containers their entry may be authorized subject to movement for utilization to an approved mill or plant the owner or operator of which has executed an appropriate agreement with the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs similar to that described in § 319.8-8(a)(2). Covers coming within this paragraph only, may be entered without permit other than the authorization provided in this paragraph and without other restriction under this subpart upon presentation to an inspector of satisfactory evidence that they have been used only for grains exported from the United States and are being returned empty without use abroad and that while abroad they have been handled in a manner to prevent their contamination.
                (e) When upon arrival at a port of entry any shipment of bags, slit bags, parts of bags, or other covers, is found to include one or more bales containing material the importation of which is regulated by paragraph (a), (c), or (d) of this section, the entire shipment, or any portion thereof, may be required by the inspector to be treated as specified in the applicable paragraph.
                (f) If upon their arrival at a port of entry covers are classified by the inspector as coming within more than one paragraph of this section, they will be authorized entry only upon compliance with such requirements of the applicable paragraphs as the inspector may deem necessary to prevent the introduction of plant diseases and insect pests.
                (g) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other paragraph of this section the entry from any country of bags, slit bags, parts of bags, and other covers will be authorized without treatment but upon compliance with other applicable sections of this subpart if the inspector finds that they have obviously not been used in a manner that would contaminate them or when in the inspector's opinion there is otherwise no plant pest risk associated with their entry.

              § 319.37-1
              Notice of quarantine.
              (a) Under section 412(a) of the Plant Protection Act, the Secretary of Agriculture may prohibit or restrict the importation and entry of any plant or plant product if the Secretary determines that the prohibition or restriction is necessary to prevent the introduction into the United States or the dissemination within the United States of a plant pest or noxious weed.
              (b) The Secretary has determined that it is necessary to designate the importation of certain taxa of plants for planting as not authorized pending pest risk analysis, as provided in § 319.37-4. The Secretary has determined that it is necessary to restrict the importation into the United States of all other plants for planting and to impose additional restrictions on the importation of specific types of plants for planting, in accordance with this subpart and as described in the Plants for Planting Manual.
              (c) The importation of plants that are imported for processing or consumption, as determined by an inspector based on documentation accompanying the articles, is not subject to this subpart but may be subject to restrictions elsewhere in this part.
              (d) The importation of taxa of plants for planting that are listed in parts 360 and 361 of this chapter is subject to the restrictions in those parts.
              (e) The Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs also enforces regulations promulgated under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531-1544) which contain additional prohibitions and restrictions on importation into the United States of plants for planting subject to this subpart (see 50 CFR parts 17 and 23).

              (f) Within the Plants for Planting Manual, one or more common names of plants for planting may be given in parentheses after most scientific names (when common names are known) for the purpose of helping to identify the plants for planting represented by such scientific names; however, unless otherwise specified, a reference to a scientific name includes all plants for planting within the taxon represented by the scientific name regardless of whether the common name or names are as comprehensive in scope as the scientific name. When restrictions apply to the importation of a taxon of plants for planting for which there are taxonomic synonyms, those restrictions apply to the importation of all the synonyms of that taxon as well.

Therefore, the importation of these taxa is not authorized pending the completion of a pest risk analysis, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section. These taxa are listed in the Plants for Planting Manual. There are two categories of taxa whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis: Taxa of plants for planting that are quarantine pests, and taxa of plants for planting that are hosts of quarantine pests. For taxa of plants for planting that have been determined to be quarantine pests, the list includes the names of the taxa. For taxa of plants for planting that are hosts of quarantine pests, the list includes the names of the taxa, the foreign places from which the taxa's importation is not authorized, and the quarantine pests of concern.
              (b) Addition of taxa. A taxon of plants for planting may be added to one of the lists of taxa not authorized for importation pending pest risk analysis under this section as follows:
              (1) Data sheet. APHIS will publish in the Federal Register a document that announces our determination that a taxon of plants for planting is either a quarantine pest or a host of a quarantine pest. This notice will make available a data sheet that details the scientific evidence APHIS evaluated in making the determination that the taxon is a quarantine pest or a host of a quarantine pest. The data sheet will include references to the scientific evidence that APHIS used in making the determination. In our notice, we will provide for a public comment period of a minimum of 60 days on our additions to the list.
              (2) Response to comments. (i) APHIS will issue a notice after the close of the public comment period indicating that the taxon will be added to the list of taxa not authorized for importation pending pest risk analysis if:
              (A) No comments were received on the data sheet;
              (B) The comments on the data sheet revealed that no changes to the data sheet were necessary; or
              (C) Changes to the data sheet were made in response to public comments, but the changes did not affect APHIS' determination that the taxon poses a risk of introducing a quarantine pest into the United States.
              (ii) If comments present information that leads us to determine that the importation of the taxon does not pose a risk of introducing a quarantine pest into the United States, APHIS will not add the taxon to the list of plants for planting whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis. APHIS will issue a notice giving public notice of this determination after the close of the comment period.
              (c) Criterion for listing a taxon of plants for planting as a quarantine pest. A taxon will be added to the list of taxa whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis if scientific evidence causes APHIS to determine that the taxon is a quarantine pest.
              (d) Criteria for listing a taxon of plants for planting as a host of a quarantine pest. A taxon will be added to the list of taxa whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis if scientific evidence causes APHIS to determine that the taxon is a host of a quarantine pest. The following criteria must be fulfilled in order to make this determination:
              (1) The plant pest in question must be determined to be a quarantine pest; and
              (2) The taxon of plants for planting must be determined to be a host of that quarantine pest.
              (e) Removing a taxon from the list of taxa not authorized pending pest risk analysis. (1) Requests to remove a taxon from the list of taxa whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis (NAPPRA) must be made in accordance with § 319.5. APHIS will conduct a pest risk analysis in response to such a request. The pest risk analysis will examine the risk associated with the importation of that taxon as well as measures available to mitigate that risk. The pest risk analysis may analyze importation of the taxon from a specific area, country, or countries, or from all areas of the world. The conclusions of the pest risk analysis will apply accordingly.
              (2) If the pest risk analysis indicates that the taxon is a quarantine pest or a host of a quarantine pest and the Administrator determines that there are no measures available that adequately mitigate the risk of introducing a quarantine pest into the United States through the taxon's importation, we will continue to list the taxon as not authorized for importation pending pest risk analysis. We will publish a notice making the pest risk analysis available for comment. If comments cause us to change our determination, we will publish another notice in accordance with either paragraph (e)(3) or (4) of this section, as appropriate. If comments do not cause us to change our determination, we will publish a second notice responding to the comments and affirming our determination that the taxon should continue to be listed as NAPPRA.

              (3) If the pest risk analysis supports a determination that importation of the taxon be allowed subject to taxon-specific restrictions, APHIS will publish a notice making the pest risk analysis available to the public for comment in accordance with the process in § 319.37-20(c).
              (4) If the pest risk analysis supports a determination that importation of the taxon be allowed subject to the general restrictions of this subpart, APHIS will publish a notice announcing our intent to remove the taxon from the list of taxa whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis and making the pest risk analysis supporting the taxon's removal available for public comment.
              (i) APHIS will issue a notice after the close of the public comment period indicating that the importation of the taxon will be subject only to the general restrictions of this subpart if:
              (A) No comments were received on the pest risk analysis;
              (B) The comments on the pest risk analysis revealed that no changes to the pest risk analysis were necessary; or
              (C) Changes to the pest risk analysis were made in response to public comments, but the changes did not affect the overall conclusions of the analysis and the Administrator's determination that the importation of the taxon does not pose a risk of introducing a quarantine pest into the United States.
              (ii) If information presented by commenters indicates that the pest risk analysis needs to be revised, APHIS will issue a notice after the close of the public comment period indicating that the importation of the taxon will continue to be listed as not authorized pending pest risk analysis while the information presented by commenters is analyzed and incorporated into the pest risk analysis. APHIS will subsequently publish a new notice announcing the availability of the revised pest risk analysis.
              (5) APHIS may also remove a taxon from the list of taxa whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis when APHIS determines that the evidence used to add the taxon to the list was erroneous (for example, involving a taxonomic misidentification).
              (f) Controlled import permits. Any plants for planting whose importation is not authorized pending pest risk analysis in accordance with this section may be imported or offered for entry into the United States if:
              (1) Imported for experimental, therapeutic, or developmental purposes under the conditions specified in a controlled import permit issued in accordance with § 319.6;
              (2) Imported at the National Plant Germplasm Inspection Station, Building 580, Beltsville Agricultural Research Center East, Beltsville, MD 20705 or through any USDA plant inspection station listed in the Plants for Planting Manual;
              (3) Imported pursuant to a controlled import permit issued for such plants for planting and kept on file at the port of entry;

              (4) Imported under conditions specified on the controlled import permit and found by the Administrator to be adequate to prevent the introduction into the United States of quarantine pests, i.e., conditions of treatment, processing, growing, shipment, disposal; and
              (5) Imported with a controlled import tag or label securely attached to the outside of the container containing the plants for planting or securely attached to the plant itself if not in a container, and with such tag or label bearing a controlled import permit number corresponding to the number of the controlled import permit issued for such plants for planting.

              § 319.37-5
              Permits.
              (a)(1) Plants for planting may be imported or offered for importation into the United States only after issuance of a written permit by the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, except as provided in the Plants for Planting Manual. Exceptions from the requirement for a written permit will be added, changed, or removed in accordance with § 319.37-20.

              (2) Plants for planting whose importation is subject to postentry quarantine, as listed in the Plants for Planting Manual, must also be imported under an importer postentry quarantine growing agreement in accordance with § 319.37-23(c).
              

              (b) An application for a written permit should be submitted to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Permits, Permit Unit, 4700 River Road, Unit 133, Riverdale, MD 20737-1236) at least 30 days prior to arrival of the plants for planting at the port of entry. Application forms are available without charge from that address or on the internet at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/permits/ppq_epermits.shtml. The completed application shall include the following information:
              (1) Name, address, and telephone number of the importer;
              (2) The taxon or taxa and the approximate quantity of plants for planting intended to be imported;
              (3) Country(ies) or locality(ies) where grown;
              (4) Intended United States port of entry;
              (5) Means of transportation, e.g., mail, airmail, express, air express, freight, airfreight, or baggage; and
              (6) Expected date of arrival.
              (c) A permit indicating the applicable conditions for importation under this subpart will be issued by Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs if, after review of the application, the plants for planting are deemed eligible to be imported into the United States under the conditions specified in the permit. However, even if such a permit is issued, the plants for planting may be imported only if all applicable requirements of this subpart are met and only if an inspector at the port of entry determines that no remedial measures pursuant to the Plant Protection Act are necessary with respect to the plants for planting.1
                
              
              
                
                  1 An inspector may hold, seize, quarantine, treat, apply other remedial measures to, destroy, or otherwise dispose of plants, plant pests, or other articles in accordance with sections 414, 421, and 434 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714, 7731, and 7754).
              
              (d) Any permit that has been issued may be revoked by an inspector or APHIS in accordance with § 319.7-4.
              (e) Any plants for planting not required to be imported with a permit in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section may be imported or offered for importation into the United States only after issuance of an oral authorization for importation issued by an inspector at the port of entry.
              (f) An oral authorization for importation of plants for planting shall be issued at a port of entry by an inspector only if all applicable requirements of this subpart are met, such plants for planting are eligible to be imported under an oral authorization, and an inspector at the port of entry determines that no measures pursuant to section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) are necessary with respect to such plants for planting.
              (g) Persons wishing to import plants for planting into the United States for experimental, therapeutic, or developmental purposes must apply for a controlled import permit in accordance with §§ 319.6 and 319.37-3.

              § 319.37-6
              Phytosanitary certificates.
              (a) Phytosanitary certificates. Any plants for planting offered for importation into the United States must be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate, except as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The phytosanitary certificate must identify the genus of the plants for planting it accompanies. When the importation of individual species or cultivars within a genus is restricted in accordance with § 319.37-20, the phytosanitary certificate must also identify the species or cultivar of the plants for planting it accompanies. Otherwise, identification of the species is strongly preferred, but not required. Intergeneric and interspecific hybrids must be designated by placing the multiplication sign “×” between the names of the parent taxa. If the hybrid is named, the multiplication sign may instead be placed before the name of an intergeneric hybrid or before the epithet in the name of an interspecific hybrid.
              (b) Small lots of seed. Lots of seed may be imported without a phytosanitary certificate required by paragraph (a) of this section under the following conditions:
              
              (1) The importation of the seed is authorized by a written permit issued in accordance with § 319.37-5.
              (2) The seed is not listed as not authorized pending pest risk analysis, as provided in § 319.37-4; is not of any noxious weed species listed in part 360 of this chapter; is not subject to restrictions on specific types of plants for planting as provided in § 319.37-20; is not restricted under the regulations in parts 330 and 340 of this chapter; and meets the requirements of part 361 of this chapter.
              (3) The seed meets the following packaging and shipping requirements:
              (i) Each seed packet is clearly labeled with the name of the collector/shipper, the country of origin, and the scientific name at least to the genus, and preferably to the species, level;
              (ii) There are a maximum of 50 seeds of 1 taxon (taxonomic category such as genus, species, cultivar, etc.) per packet; or a maximum weight not to exceed 10 grams of seed of 1 taxon per packet;
              (iii) There are a maximum of 50 seed packets per shipment;
              (iv) The seeds are free from pesticides;
              (v) The seeds are securely packaged in packets or envelopes and sealed to prevent spillage;
              (vi) The shipment is free from soil, plant material other than seed, other foreign matter or debris, seeds in the fruit or seed pod, and living organisms such as parasitic plants, pathogens, insects, snails, mites; and
              (vii) At the time of importation, the shipment is sent to either the Plant Germplasm Quarantine Center in Beltsville, MD, or a USDA plant inspection station.
              (c) Importation of other plants for planting without phytosanitary certificates. (1) The Administrator may authorize the importation of types of plants for planting without a phytosanitary certificate if the plants for planting are accompanied by equivalent documentation agreed upon by the Administrator and the NPPO of the exporting country as sufficient to establish the eligibility of the plants for importation into the United States. The documentation must be provided by the NPPO or refer to documentation provided by the NPPO. The documentation must be agreed upon before the plants for planting are exported from the exporting country to the United States.
              (2) The Administrator may impose additional restrictions on the importation of plants for planting that are not accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate to ensure that the plants are appropriately identified and free of quarantine pests.
              (3) The Plants for Planting Manual lists types of plants for planting that are not required to be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate; the countries from which their importation without a phytosanitary certificate is authorized; the approved documentation of eligibility for importation; and any additional conditions on their importation.
              (4) Types of plants for planting may be added to or removed from the list of plants for planting that are not required to be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate in accordance with § 319.37-20. The requirements for importing types of plants for planting without a phytosanitary certificate may also be changed by a notice issued in accordance with § 319.37-20. The notice published for comment will describe the documentation agreed upon by the Administrator and the NPPO of the exporting country and any additional restrictions to be imposed on the importation of the type of plants for planting.

              § 319.37-8
              Ports of entry: Approved ports, notification of arrival, inspection, and refusal of entry.
              (a) Approved ports of entry. Any plants for planting required to be imported under a written permit in accordance with § 319.37-5(a), if not precleared, must be imported or offered for importation only at a USDA plant inspection station, unless the Plants for Planting Manual indicates otherwise. Ports of entry through which plants for planting must pass through before arriving at these USDA plant inspection stations are listed in the Plants for Planting Manual. All other plants for planting may be imported or offered for importation at any Customs designated port of entry indicated in 19 CFR 101.3(b)(1). Exceptions may be listed in § 330.104 of this chapter. Plants for planting that are required to be imported under a written permit that are also precleared in the country of export are not required to enter at an inspection station and may enter through any Customs port of entry. Exceptions may be listed in § 330.104 of this chapter.
              (b) Notification upon arrival at the port of entry. Promptly upon arrival of any plants for planting at a port of entry, the importer shall notify the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs of the arrival by such means as a manifest, Customs entry document, commercial invoice, waybill, a broker's document, or a notice form provided for that purpose.
              (c) Inspection and treatment. Any plants for planting may be sampled and inspected by an inspector at the port of first arrival and/or under preclearance inspection arrangements in the country in which the plants for planting were grown, and must undergo treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter if treatment is ordered by the inspector. Any plants for planting found upon inspection to contain or be contaminated with quarantine pests that cannot be eliminated by treatment will be denied entry at the first United States port of arrival and must be destroyed or shipped to a point outside the United States.
              (d) Disposition of plants for planting not in compliance with this subpart. The importer of any plants for planting denied entry for noncompliance with this subpart must, at the importer's expense and within the time specified in an emergency action notification (PPQ Form 523), destroy, ship to a point outside the United States, treat in accordance with part 305 of this chapter, or apply other safeguards to the plants for planting, as prescribed by an inspector, to prevent the introduction into the United States of quarantine pests. In choosing which action to order and in setting the time limit for the action, the inspector shall consider the degree of pest risk presented by the plant pest associated with the plants for planting, whether the plants for planting are a host of the pest, the types of other host materials for the pest in or near the port, the climate and season at the port in relation to the pest's survival range, and the availability of treatment facilities for the plants for planting.
              (e) Removal of plants for planting from port of first arrival. No person shall remove any plants for planting from the port of first arrival unless and until notice is given to the collector of customs by the inspector that the plants for planting has satisfied all requirements under this subpart.

              Treatment of plants for planting; costs and charges for inspection and treatment; treatments applied outside the United States.
              (a) The services of a Plant Protection and Quarantine inspector during regularly assigned hours of duty and at the usual places of duty shall be furnished without cost to the importer.2
                 No charge will be made to the importer for Government-owned or -controlled special inspection facilities and equipment used in treatment, but the inspector may require the importer to furnish any special labor, chemicals, packing materials, or other supplies required in handling an importation under the regulations in this subpart. The Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs will not be responsible for any costs or charges, other than those indicated in this section.
              
                
                  2 Provisions relating to costs for other services of an inspector are contained in part 354 of this chapter.
              
              (b) Any treatment performed in the United States on plants for planting must be performed at the time of importation into the United States. Treatment shall be performed by an inspector or under an inspector's supervision at a Government-operated special inspection facility, except that an importer may have such treatment performed at a nongovernmental facility if the treatment is performed at nongovernment expense under the supervision of an inspector and in accordance with part 305 of this chapter and in accordance with any treatment required by an inspector as an emergency measure in order to prevent the dissemination of any quarantine pests. However, treatment may be performed at a nongovernmental facility only in cases of unavailability of government facilities and only if, in the judgment of an inspector, the plants for planting can be transported to such nongovernmental facility without the risk of introduction into the United States of quarantine pests.
              (c) Any treatment performed outside the United States must be monitored and certified by an APHIS inspector or an official from the NPPO of the exporting country. If monitored and certified by an official of the NPPO of the exporting country, then a phytosanitary certificate must be issued with the following declaration: “The consignment of (fill in taxon) has been treated in accordance with 7 CFR part 305.” During the entire interval between treatment and export, the consignment must be stored and handled in a manner that prevents any infestation by quarantine pests.

              Growing media.
              (a) Any plants for planting at the time of importation or offer for importation into the United States shall be free of sand, soil, earth, and other growing media, except as provided in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section.
              (b) Plants for planting from Canada may be imported in any growing medium, except as restricted in the Plants for Planting Manual. Restrictions on growing media for specific types of plants for planting imported from Canada will be added, changed, or removed in accordance with § 319.37-20.

              (c) Certain types of plants for planting growing solely in certain growing media listed in the Plants for Planting Manual may be imported established in such growing media. The Administrator has determined that the importation of the specified types of plants for planting in these growing media does not pose a risk of introducing quarantine pests into the United States. If the Administrator determines that a new growing medium may be added to the list of growing media in which imported plants for planting may be established, or that a growing medium currently listed for such purposes is no longer suitable for establishment of imported plants for planting, APHIS will publish in the Federal Register a notice that announces our proposed determination and requests comment on the change. After the close of the comment period, APHIS will publish another notice informing the public of the Administrator's decision on the change to the list of growing media in which imported types of plants for planting may be established.
              (d) Certain types of plants for planting, as listed in the Plants for Planting Manual, may be imported when they are established in a growing medium approved by the Administrator and they are produced in accordance with additional requirements specified in the Plants for Planting Manual. Changes to the list of plants for planting that may be imported in growing media, and to the requirements for the importation of those types of plants for planting, will be made in accordance with § 319.37-20.

              (b) Any plants for planting at the time of importation or offer for importation into the United States shall not be packed in a packing material unless the plants were packed in the packing material immediately prior to shipment; such packing material is free from sand, soil, or earth (except as designated in the Plants for Planting Manual); has not been used previously as packing material or otherwise; and is approved by the Administrator as not posing a risk of introducing quarantine pests. Approved packing materials are listed in the Plants for Planting Manual.

              (c) If the Administrator determines that a new packing material may be added to the list of packing materials, or that a packing material currently listed should no longer be approved, APHIS will publish in the Federal Register a notice that announces our proposed determination and requests comment on the change. After the close of the comment period, APHIS will publish another notice informing the public of the Administrator's decision on the change to the list of approved packing materials.

              § 319.37-20
              Restrictions on the importation of specific types of plants for planting.
              (a) Plant type-specific restrictions. In addition to the general restrictions in this subpart, the Administrator may impose additional restrictions on the importation of specific types of plants for planting necessary to effectively mitigate the risk of introducing quarantine pests into the United States through the importation of specific plants for planting. Additional restrictions may be placed on the importation of the entire plant or on certain plant parts. A list of the types of plants for planting whose importation is subject to additional restrictions, and the specific restrictions that apply to the importation of each type of plants for planting, may be found in the Plants for Planting Manual.
              (b) Basis for changing restrictions. The Administrator may determine that it is necessary to add, change, or remove restrictions on the importation of a specific type of plants for planting, based on the risk of introducing a quarantine pest through the importation of that type of plants for planting. The Administrator will make this determination based on the findings of a pest risk analysis or on other scientific evidence.
              (c) Process for adding, changing, or removing restrictions. Restrictions on the importation of a specific type of plants for planting beyond the general restrictions in §§ 319.37-5 through 319.37-11 will be changed through the following process:
              (1) Document describing restrictions. APHIS will publish in the Federal Register a notice that announces our proposed determination that it is necessary to add, change, or remove restrictions on the importation of a specific type of plants for planting. This notice will make available for public comment a document describing the restrictions that the Administrator has determined are necessary and how these restrictions will mitigate the risk of introducing quarantine pests into the United States.
              (2) Response to comments. APHIS will issue a second notice after the close of the public comment period on the notice described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. This notice will inform the public of the specific restrictions, if any, that the Administrator has determined to be necessary in order to mitigate the risk of introducing quarantine pests into the United States through the importation of the type of plants for planting. In response to the public comments submitted, the Administrator may implement the restrictions described in the document made available by the initial notice, amend the restrictions in response to public comment, or determine that changes to the restrictions on the importation of the type of plants for planting are unnecessary.
              (d) Previously imposed restrictions on specific types of plants for planting. Types of plants for planting whose importation was subject to specific restrictions by specific regulation as of April 18, 2018, will continue to be subject to those restrictions, except as changed in accordance with the process specified in paragraph (c) of this section. The restrictions are found in the Plants for Planting Manual.
            
            
              § 319.37-21
              Integrated pest risk management measures.
              If a type of plants for planting is a host of a quarantine pest or pests, APHIS may require the type of plants for planting to be produced in accordance with integrated pest risk management measures as a condition of importation. This section sets out a general framework for integrated pest risk management measures. When APHIS determines that integrated measures are necessary to mitigate risk, APHIS will use this framework to develop integrated pest risk management measures that mitigate the quarantine pest risks associated with that type of plants for planting through the process described in § 319.37-20.
              (a) Responsibilities of the place of production. The place of production is responsible for identifying, developing, and implementing procedures that meet the requirements of both the NPPO of the exporting country and APHIS. Participants in the export program must be approved by the NPPO or its designee and APHIS. Approval will be conferred by the NPPO or its designee and APHIS after the participant meets the conditions required for integrated pest risk management. Approval will be withdrawn if the participant fails to meet the conditions at any time. All documentation required under paragraphs (a)(5) and (6) of this section will be maintained by the exporting place of production and made available to official representatives of the NPPO of the exporting country and APHIS upon request. The place of production must be open to necessary and reasonable audit, monitoring, and evaluation of compliance by the NPPO of the exporting country and APHIS. The management of the place of production will be responsible for complying with the integrated pest risk management measures. Management must specify the roles and responsibilities of its personnel to perform program activities. The place of production must notify the NPPO of the exporting country of deficiencies detected during internal audits. The NPPO of the exporting country will be responsible for ensuring that the place of production is in compliance with the integrated pest risk management measures.
              (1) Pest management program. The place of production must develop and implement an approved pest management program that contains ongoing pest monitoring and procedures for the exclusion and control of plant pests. The place of production must obtain material used to produce plants for planting from sources that are free of quarantine pests and that are approved by the NPPO of the exporting country and APHIS. All sources of plants for planting and the phytosanitary status of those plants must be well-documented and the program for producing plants for planting carefully monitored.
              (2) Training. A training program approved by the NPPO of the exporting country and APHIS must be established, documented, and regularly conducted at the place of production. The training program must ensure that all those involved in the export program possess specific knowledge related to the relevant components of the program and a general understanding of its requirements.
              (3) Internal audits. The place of production must perform, or designate parties to perform internal audits that ensure that a plan approved and documented by APHIS and the NPPO of the exporting country is being followed and is achieving the appropriate level of pest management.
              (4) Traceability. The place of production must implement a procedure approved by APHIS and the NPPO of the exporting country or its designee that documents and identifies plants from propagation through harvest and sale to ensure that plants can be traced forward and back from the place of production. Depending on the nature of the quarantine pests, the system may need to account for:
              (i) The origin and pest status of mother stock;
              (ii) The year of propagation and the place of production of all plant parts that make up the plants for planting intended for export;
              (iii) Geographic location of the place of production;
              (iv) Location of plants for planting within the place of production;
              (v) The plant taxon; and
              (vi) The purchaser's identity.
              (5) Documentation of program procedures. The place of production must develop a manual approved by the NPPO of the exporting country and APHIS that guides the place of production's operation and that includes the following components:
              (i) Administrative procedures (including roles and responsibilities and training procedures);
              (ii) Pest management plan;
              (iii) Place of production internal audit procedures;
              (iv) Management of noncompliant product or procedures;
              (v) Traceability procedures; and
              (vi) Recordkeeping systems.
              (6) Records. A place of production must maintain records on its premises as specified by APHIS and the NPPO of the exporting country. These records must be made available to APHIS and the NPPO of the exporting country upon request. These documents include all the elements described in this paragraph (a) and copies of all internal and external audit documents and reports.
              (b) Responsibilities of APHIS and the NPPO of the exporting country. APHIS and the NPPO of the exporting country are responsible for collaborating to establish program requirements, including workplans and compliance agreements as necessary, for recognizing and implementing particular import programs. Technically justified modifications to the program may be negotiated. The administration of program requirements must include such elements as clarification of terminology, testing and retesting requirements, eligibility, the nomenclature of certification levels, horticultural management, isolation and sanitation requirements, inspection, documentation, identification and labeling, quality assurance, noncompliance and remedial measures, and postentry quarantine requirements. The criteria for approving, suspending, removing, and reinstating approval for a particular program should be jointly developed and agreed upon by APHIS and the NPPO of the exporting country. Information should be exchanged between APHIS and the NPPO of the exporting country through officially designated points of contact.
              (c) Responsibilities of the NPPO of the exporting country. (1) The NPPO of the exporting country must provide sufficient information to APHIS to support the evaluation and acceptance of export programs. This may include:

              (i) Specific identification of the commodity, place of production, and expected volume and frequency of consignments;
              
              (ii) Relevant production, harvest, packing, handling, and transport details;
              (iii) Pests associated with the plant including prevalence, distribution, and damage potential;
              (iv) Risk management measures proposed for a pest management program; and
              (v) Relevant efficacy data.
              (2) A phytosanitary certificate should be issued by the NPPO of the exporting country unless APHIS and the NPPO of the exporting country agree to use other documentation in accordance with § 319.37-6(c).
              (3) Other responsibilities of the NPPO of the exporting country include:
              (i) Establishing and maintaining compliance agreements as necessary;
              (ii) Oversight and enforcement of program provisions;
              (iii) Arrangements for monitoring and audit; and
              (iv) Maintaining appropriate records.
              (d) Responsibilities of plant brokers trading in plants for planting produced in accordance with integrated pest risk management measures. Plant brokers trading in plants for planting produced in accordance with integrated pest risk management measures must be approved by the NPPO of the exporting country or its designee. The list of plant brokers must be provided to APHIS upon request. Approval may only be conferred by the NPPO or its designee after the participant demonstrates that it can meet the requirements of this paragraph (d). Approval must be withdrawn if the participant fails to meet the conditions at any time. Plant brokers must ensure the traceability of export consignments to an approved place of production or production site. Brokers must maintain the phytosanitary status of the plants equivalent to an approved place of production from purchase, storage, and transportation to the export destination. Plant brokers must document these processes for verifying status and maintaining traceability.
              (e) External audits. APHIS and the NPPO of the exporting country will agree to the requirements for external audits.
              (1) APHIS audits. APHIS will evaluate the integrated pest risk management measures of the NPPO of the exporting country before acceptance. This could consist of documentation review, site visits, and inspection and testing of plants produced under the system. Following approval, APHIS or its designee will monitor and periodically audit the system to ensure that it continues to meet the stated objectives. Audits will include inspection of imported plants for planting, site visits, and review of the integrated pest risk management measures and internal audit processes of the place of production and the NPPO of the exporting country.
              (2) Audits by the NPPO of the exporting country. The NPPO must arrange for audits of the exporting system. Audits may be conducted by the NPPO or its designee and may consist of inspection and testing of plants for planting and the documentation and management practices as they relate to the program. Audits should verify that:
              (i) The places of production in the program are free of quarantine pests;
              (ii) Program participants are complying with the specified standards;
              (iii) The integrated pest management measures continue to meet APHIS requirements; and
              (iv) Arrangements with designees are complied with.
              (f) Noncompliance. (1) The exporting NPPO must notify APHIS of noncompliance within the integrity of the system or noncompliance by a place of production that affects the phytosanitary integrity of the commodity. The requirements for notification will be determined between the NPPO of the exporting country and APHIS.

              (2) Regulatory responses to program failures will be based on existing bilateral agreements. Contingency plans may be established in advance to ensure that alternative measures are available in the event that all or part of a program fails. APHIS will specify the consequences of noncompliance to the NPPO of the exporting country. The NPPO must specify the consequences of noncompliance to the participants in the program. These may vary depending on the nature and severity of the infraction. In addition, remedial measures should be specified to enable a suspended or decertified place of production or plant broker to become eligible for reinstatement or recertification.
              (3) Places of production or plant brokers that do not meet the conditions of the program must be suspended. Plants for planting must not be exported from a place of production or a plant broker that has failed to meet the program requirements.
              (4) The effectiveness of remedial measures taken must be verified before reinstatement to the program by the exporting NPPO and, where appropriate, by APHIS.

              § 319.37-22
              Trust fund agreements.
              If APHIS personnel need to be physically present in an exporting country or region to facilitate the exportation of plants for planting and APHIS services are to be funded by the NPPO of the exporting country or a private export group, then the NPPO or the private export group must enter into a trust fund agreement with APHIS that is in effect at the time APHIS' services are needed. Under the agreement, the NPPO of the exporting country or the private export group must pay in advance all estimated costs that APHIS expects to incur in providing inspection services in the exporting country. These costs will include administrative expenses incurred in conducting the services and all salaries (including overtime and the Federal share of employee benefits), travel expenses (including per diem expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred by the inspectors in performing services. The agreement must require the NPPO of the exporting country or region or a private export group to deposit a certified or cashier's check with APHIS for the amount of those costs, as estimated by APHIS. The agreement must further specify that, if the deposit is not sufficient to meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the NPPO of the exporting country or a private export group must deposit with APHIS, before the services will be completed, a certified or cashier's check for the amount of the remaining costs, as determined by APHIS. After a final audit at the conclusion of each shipping season, any overpayment of funds would be returned to the NPPO of the exporting country or region or a private export group, or held on account.

              Postentry quarantine.
              (a) Postentry quarantine. One specific restriction that may be placed upon the importation of a type of plants for planting in accordance with § 319.37-20 is that it be grown in postentry quarantine. The Plants for Planting Manual lists the taxa required to be imported into postentry quarantine. Plants for planting grown in postentry quarantine must be grown under postentry quarantine conditions specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, and may be imported or offered for importation into the United States only:
              (1) If destined for a State that has completed a State postentry quarantine agreement with APHIS in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section;
              (2) If an importer postentry quarantine growing agreement has been completed and submitted to Plant Protection and Quarantine in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The agreement must be signed by the person (the importer) applying for the importation of the plants for planting in accordance with § 319.6; and,
              (3) If Plant Protection and Quarantine has determined that the completed postentry quarantine growing agreement fulfills the applicable requirements of this section and that services by State inspectors are available to monitor and enforce the postentry quarantine.
              (b) State postentry quarantine agreement. Plants for planting required to undergo postentry quarantine in accordance with § 319.37-20 may only be imported if destined for postentry quarantine growing in a State which has entered into a written agreement with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, signed by the Administrator or his or her designee and by the State Plant Regulatory Official. In accordance with the laws of individual States, inspection and other postentry quarantine services provided by a State may be subject to charges imposed by the State. A list of States that have entered into a postentry quarantine agreement in accordance with this paragraph can be found in the Plants for Planting Manual.
              (c) Importer postentry quarantine growing agreements. Any plants for planting required to be grown under postentry quarantine conditions, as well as any increase therefrom, shall be grown in accordance with an importer postentry quarantine growing agreement signed by the person (the importer) applying for a written permit in accordance with § 319.37-5 for importation of the plants for planting and submitted to Plant Protection and Quarantine. On each importer postentry quarantine growing agreement, the person shall also obtain the signature of the State Plant Regulatory Official for the State in which plants for planting covered by the agreement will be grown. The importer postentry quarantine growing agreement shall specify the kind, number, and origin of plants to be imported; the conditions specified in the Plants for Planting Manual under which the plants for planting will be grown, maintained, and labeled; and the reporting requirements in the case of abnormal or dead plants for planting. The agreement shall certify to APHIS and to the State in which the plants for planting are grown that the signer of the agreement will comply with the conditions of the agreement for the postentry quarantine growing period prescribed for the type of plants for planting in the Plants for Planting Manual.
              (d) Applications for permits. A completed importer postentry quarantine agreement shall accompany the application for a written permit for plants for planting required to be grown under postentry quarantine conditions. Importer postentry quarantine agreement forms are available without charge from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Permit Unit, 4700 River Road, Unit 136, Riverdale, MD 20737-1236 or on the internet at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/permits/ppq_epermits.shtml.
              
              (e) Inspector-ordered disposal, movement, or safeguarding of plants for planting; costs and charges, civil and criminal liabilities—(1) Growing at unauthorized sites. If an inspector determines that any plants for planting subject to the postentry quarantine growing requirements of this section, or any increase therefrom, is being grown at an unauthorized site, the inspector may file an emergency action notification (PPQ Form 523) with the owner of the plants for planting or the person who owns or is in possession of the site on which the plants for planting is being grown. The person named in the PPQ Form 523 must, within the time specified in PPQ Form 523, sign a postentry quarantine growing agreement, destroy, ship to a point outside the United States, move to an authorized postentry quarantine site, and/or apply treatments or other safeguards to the plants for planting, the increase therefrom, or any portion of the plants for planting or the increase therefrom, as prescribed by an inspector to prevent the introduction of quarantine pests into the United States. In choosing which action to order and in setting the time limit for the action, the inspector shall consider the degree of pest risk presented by the quarantine pests associated with the type of plants for planting (including increase therefrom), the types of other host materials for the pest in or near the growing site, the climate and season at the site in relation to the pest's survival, and the availability of treatment facilities.
              (2) Growing at authorized sites. If an inspector determines that any plants for planting, or any increase therefrom, grown at a site specified in an authorized postentry quarantine growing agreement is being grown contrary to the provisions of this section, including in numbers greater than the number approved by the postentry quarantine growing agreement, or in a manner that otherwise presents a risk of introducing quarantine pests into the United States, the inspector shall issue an emergency action notification (PPQ Form 523) to the person who signed the postentry quarantine growing agreement. That person shall be responsible for carrying out all actions specified in the emergency action notification. The emergency action notification may extend the time for which the plants for planting and the increase therefrom must be grown under the postentry quarantine conditions specified in the authorized postentry quarantine growing agreement, or may require that the person named in the notification must destroy, ship to a point outside the United States, or apply treatments or other safeguards to the plants for planting, the increase therefrom, or any portion of the plants for planting or the increase therefrom, within the time specified in the emergency action notification. In choosing which action to order and in setting the time limit for the action, the inspector shall consider the degree of pest risk presented by the quarantine pests associated with the type of plants for planting (including increase therefrom), the types of other host materials for the pest in or near the growing site, the climate and season at the site in relation to the pest's survival, and the availability of treatment facilities.
              (3) Costs and charges. All costs pursuant to any action ordered by an inspector in accordance with this section shall be borne by the person who signed the postentry quarantine growing agreement covering the site where the plants for planting were grown, or if no such agreement was signed, by the owner of the plants for planting at the growing site.

              (a) Application procedure. An application for a permit must be obtained and submitted in accordance with §§ 319.7 through 319.7-5.
              (b) Review of application and issuance of permit. After receipt and review of the application, APHIS shall determine whether it appears that the regulated article at the time of importation will meet either the specific importation requirements in § 319.40-5 or the universal importation requirements in § 319.40-6.
              (1) If it appears that the regulated article proposed for importation will meet the requirements of either § 319.40-5 or § 319.40-6, a permit stating the applicable conditions for importation under this subpart shall be issued for the importation of the regulated article identified in the application.
              (2) If it appears that the regulated article proposed for importation will not meet the requirements of either § 319.40-5 or § 319.40-6 because these sections do not address the particular regulated article identified in the application, APHIS shall review the application by applying the plant pest risk assessment standards specified in § 319.40-11.
              (i) If this review reveals that importation of the regulated article under a permit and subject to the inspection and other requirements in § 319.40-9, but without any further conditions, will not result in the introduction of plant pests into the United States, a permit for importation of the regulated article shall be issued. The permit may only be issued in unique and unforeseen circumstances when the importation of the regulated article is not expected to recur.
              (ii) If this review reveals that the regulated article may be imported under conditions that would reduce the plant pest risk to an insignificant level, APHIS may implement rulemaking to add the additional conditions to this subpart, and after the regulations are effective, may issue a permit for importation of the regulated article.

              Processing at facilities operating under compliance agreements.
              (a) Any person who operates a facility in which imported regulated articles are processed may enter into a compliance agreement to facilitate the importation of regulated articles under this subpart. The compliance agreement shall specify the requirements necessary to prevent spread of plant pests from the facility, requirements to ensure the processing method effectively destroys plant pests, and the requirements for the application of chemical materials in accordance with part 305 of this chapter. The compliance agreement shall also state that inspectors must be allowed access to the facility to monitor compliance with the requirements of the compliance agreement and of this subpart. Compliance agreement forms may be obtained from the Administrator or an inspector.

              (b) Any compliance agreement may be canceled by the inspector who is supervising its enforcement, orally or in writing, whenever the inspector finds that the person who entered into the compliance agreement has failed to comply with the conditions of the compliance agreement. If the cancellation is oral, the decision to cancel the compliance agreement and the reasons for cancellation of the compliance agreement shall be confirmed in writing, as promptly as circumstances permit. Any person whose compliance agreement has been canceled may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving written notification of the cancellation. The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the compliance agreement was wrongfully canceled. The Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for granting or denying the appeal, as promptly as circumstances permit. If there is a conflict as to any material fact and the person whose compliance agreement has been canceled requests a hearing, a hearing shall be held to resolve the conflict. Rules of practice concerning the hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.

              Inspection and other requirements at port of first arrival.
              (a) Procedures for all regulated articles. (1) All imported regulated articles shall be inspected at the port of first arrival. If the inspector finds signs of plant pests on or in the regulated article, or finds that the regulated article may have been associated with other articles infested with plant pests, the regulated article shall be cleaned or treated as required by an inspector, and the regulated article and any products of the regulated article shall also be subject to reinspection, cleaning, and treatment at the option of an inspector at any time and place before all applicable requirements of this subpart have been accomplished.
              (2) Regulated articles shall be assembled for inspection at the port of first arrival, or at any other place prescribed by an inspector, at a place and time and in a manner designated by an inspector.
              (3) If an inspector finds that an imported regulated article is so infested with a plant pest that, in the judgment of the inspector, the regulated article cannot be cleaned or treated, or contains soil or other prohibited contaminants, the entire lot may be refused entry into the United States.
              (4) No person shall move any imported regulated article from the port of first arrival unless and until an inspector notifies the person, in writing or through an electronic database, that the regulated article:
              (i) Is in compliance with all applicable regulations and has been inspected and found to be apparently free of plant pests; 2
                 or,
              
                
                  2 Certain regulated articles may also be subject to “Subpart—Fruits and Vegetables,” or to the noxious weed regulations under part 360 of this chapter, or to Endangered Species Act regulations under parts 355 and 356 of this chapter and 50 CFR parts 17 and 23.

              (b) Notice of arrival; visual examination of regulated articles at port of first arrival. (1) At least 7 days prior to the expected date of arrival in the United States of a shipment of regulated articles imported in accordance with this subpart, the permittee or his or her agent must notify the APHIS Officer in Charge at the port of arrival of the date of expected arrival. The address and telephone number of the APHIS Officer in Charge will be specified in any specific permit issued by APHIS 3
                . This notice may be by any authorized method. The notice must include the number of any specific permit issued for the regulated articles; the name, if any, of the means of conveyance carrying the regulated articles; the type and quantity of the regulated articles; the expected date of arrival; the country of origin of the regulated articles; the name and the number, if any, of the dock or area where the regulated articles are to be unloaded; and the name of the importer or broker at the port of arrival.
              
                
                  3 A list of APHIS Officers in Charge may be obtained from the Administrator, c/o Port Operations, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, 4700 River Road, Riverdale, MD 20737.
              

              (2) Imported regulated articles which have been debarked in accordance with § 319.40-7(b) and can be safely and practically inspected will be visually examined for plant pests by an inspector at the port of first arrival. If plant pests are found on or in the regulated articles or if the regulated article cannot be safely and practically inspected, the regulated articles must be treated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter.
              
              (c) Marking and identity of regulated articles. Any regulated article, at the time of importation shall bear on the outer container (if in a container), on the regulated article (if not in a container), or on a document accompanying the regulated article the following information:
              (1) General nature and quantity of the regulated articles;
              (2) Country and locality, if known, where the tree from which the regulated article was derived was harvested;
              (3) Name and address of the person importing the regulated article;
              (4) Name and address of consignee of the regulated article;
              (5) Identifying shipper's mark and number; and
              (6) Number of the permit (if one was issued) authorizing the importation of the regulated article into the United States.
              (d) Sampling for plant pests at port of first arrival. Any imported regulated article may be sampled for plant pests at the port of first arrival. If an inspector finds it necessary to order treatment of a regulated article at the port of first arrival, any sampling will be done prior to treatment.

              § 319.40-11
              Plant pest risk assessment standards.
              When evaluating a request to import a regulated article not allowed importation under this subpart, or a request to import a regulated article under conditions other than those prescribed by this subpart, APHIS will conduct the following analysis to determine the plant pest risks associated with each requested importation in order to determine whether or not to issue a permit under this subpart or to propose regulations establishing conditions for the importation into the United States of the regulated article.
              (a) Collecting commodity information. (1) APHIS will evaluate the application for information describing the regulated article and the origin, processing, treatment, and handling of the regulated article; and
              (2) APHIS will evaluate history of past plant pest interceptions or introductions (including data from foreign countries) associated with the regulated article.
              (b) Cataloging quarantine pests. For the regulated article specified in an application, APHIS will determine what plant pests or potential plant pests are associated with the type of tree from which the regulated article was derived, in the country and locality from which the regulated article is to be exported. A plant pest that meets one of the following criteria is a quarantine pest and will be further evaluated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section:
              (1) Non-indigenous plant pest not present in the United States;
              (2) Non-indigenous plant pest, present in the United States and capable of further dissemination in the United States;

              (3) Non-indigenous plant pest that is present in the United States and has reached probable limits of its ecological range, but differs genetically from the plant pest in the United States in a way that demonstrates a potential for greater damage potential in the United States;
              (4) Native species of the United States that has reached probable limits of its ecological range, but differs genetically from the plant pest in the United States in a way that demonstrates a potential for greater damage potential in the United States; or
              (5) Non-indigenous or native plant pest that may be able to vector another plant pest that meets one of the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.
              (c) Determining which quarantine pests to assess. (1) APHIS will divide quarantine pests identified in paragraph (b) of this section into groups depending upon where the plant pest is most likely to be found. The plant pests would be grouped as follows:
              (i) Plant pests found on the bark;
              (ii) Plant pests found under the bark; and
              (iii) Plant pests found in the wood.
              (2) APHIS will subdivide each of the groups in paragraph (c)(1) of this section into associated taxa.
              (3) APHIS will rank the plant pests in each group in paragraph (c)(2) of this section according to plant pest risk, based on the available biological information and demonstrated plant pest importance.
              (4) APHIS will identify any plant pests ranked in paragraph (c)(3) of this section for which plant pest risk assessments have previously been performed in accordance with this section. APHIS will conduct individual plant pest risk assessments for the remaining plant pests, starting with the highest ranked plant pest(s) in each group.
              (5) The number of plant pests in each group to be evaluated through individual plant pest risk assessment will be based on biological similarities of members of the group as they relate to measures taken in connection with the importation of the regulated article to mitigate the plant pest risk associated with the regulated article. For example, if the plant pest risk assessment for the highest ranked plant pest indicates a need for a mitigation measure that would result in the same reduction of risk for other plant pests ranked in the group, the other members need not be subjected to individual plant pest risk assessment.
              (d) Conducting individual plant pest risk assessments. APHIS will evaluate each of the plant pests identified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section by:
              (1) Estimation of the probability of the plant pest being on, with, or in the regulated article at the time of importation;
              (2) Estimation of the probability of the plant pest surviving in transit on the regulated article and entering the United States undetected;
              (3) Estimation of the probability of the plant pest colonizing once it has entered into the United States;
              (4) Estimation of the probability of the plant pest spreading beyond any colonized area; and
              (5) Estimation of the damage to plants that could be expected upon introduction and dissemination within the United States of the plant pest.
              (e) Estimating unmitigated overall plant pest risk. APHIS will develop an estimation of the overall plant pest risk associated with importing the regulated article based on compilation of individual plant pest risk assessments performed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
              (f) Evaluating available requirements to determine whether they would allow safe importation of the regulated article. The requirements of this subpart, and any other requirements relevant to the regulated article and plant pests involved, will be compared with the individual plant pest risk assessments in order to determine whether particular conditions on the importation of the regulated article would reduce the plant pest risk to an insignificant level. If APHIS determines that the imposition of particular conditions on the importation of the regulated article could reduce the plant pest risk to an insignificant level, and determines that sufficient APHIS resources are available to implement or ensure implementation of the conditions, APHIS will implement rulemaking to allow importation of the requested regulated article under the conditions identified by the plant pest risk assessment process.

                Notice of quarantine.
                (a) The fact has been determined by the Secretary of Agriculture, and notice given, that dangerous plant pests, including the so-called European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hubn.), and also other dangerous insects, as well as plant diseases not heretofore widely prevalent or distributed within and throughout the United States, exist, as to one or more of such pests, in Europe, Asia, Africa, Dominion of Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, and other foreign countries and localities, and may be introduced into this country through importations of the stalks or other parts of Indian corn or maize, broomcorn, and related plants.

                (b) To prevent the introduction of these plant pests, the following articles may not be imported into the United States except in accordance with this subpart: The raw or unmanufactured stalk and all other parts of Indian corn or maize (Zea mays L.), broomcorn (Andropogon sorghum var. technicus), sweet sorghums (Andropogon sorghum), grain sorghums (Andropogon sorghum), Sudan grass (Andropogon sorghum sudanensis), Johnson grass (Andropogon halepensis), sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum), including Japanese varieties, pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum), teosinte (Euchlaena luxurians), and jobs-tears (Coix lachryma-Jobi).
                (c) The Administrator may authorize the importation of articles otherwise prohibited under paragraph (b) of this section under conditions specified in a controlled import permit issued in accordance with § 319.6.
                (d) The importation of plants (including any plant parts) of any of the taxa listed in paragraph (b) of this section that are for planting or capable of being planted is restricted under Subpart—Plants for Planting of this part.
                (e) As used in this subpart, unless the context otherwise requires, the term “United States” means the States, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States.

                § 319.41-5
                Condition of entry.
                (a) The entry of the articles covered by § 319.41-1 is conditioned on their freedom from the European corn borer and other injurious insects and plant diseases, and upon their freedom from contamination with plant materials prohibited entry under other quarantines. All shipments of these articles shall be subject to inspection at the port of arrival by an inspector of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, in order to determine their freedom from such insects and diseases and from contaminating materials, and to such sterilization, grinding, or treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter, as the inspector may prescribe. Should an importation be found on inspection to be so infested or infected or contaminated that, in the judgment of the inspector, it can not be made safe by sterilization or other treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter, the entire shipment may be refused entry.

                (b) When entry under sterilization or other treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter is permitted, the importation will be released to the permittee for such treatment, upon the filing with the appropriate customs official of a bond in the amount of $5,000, or in an amount equal to the invoice value, if such value be less than $5,000, with approved sureties, and conditioned that the importation shall be sterilized or otherwise treated under the supervision of the inspector; that no bale or container shall be broken, opened, or removed from the port of arrival unless and until a written notice is given to said customs official by an inspector that the importation has been properly sterilized or treated; and that the importation shall be redelivered to said customs official within 30 days after its arrival.
                (c) Should a shipment requiring sterilization or other treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter under the provisions of the regulation in this subpart arrive at a port where facilities for such sterilization or other treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter are not maintained, such shipment shall either be promptly shipped under safeguards and by routing prescribed by the inspector to an approved port where facilities for sterilization or other treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter are available, or it shall be refused entry.
                (d) Other conditions of entry as applying to the certain classes of articles enumerated in § 319.41-1 are:
                (1) Broomcorn. All importations of broomcorn shall be so baled as to prevent breakage and scattering in connection with the necessary handling and sterilization; if in the judgment of the inspector they are not so baled, entry may be refused. All importations of broomcorn shall be subject to such sterilization or other treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter as the inspector may require.
                (2) Articles made of broomcorn. Brooms or similar articles made of broomcorn shall be subject to sterilization unless their manufacture involves the substantial elimination of stems or such treatment of the included stems as in the judgment of the inspector shall preclude such articles from being the means of carriage of the European corn borer and of other injurious insects and plant diseases.
                (3) Shelled corn and other seeds. If shipments of shelled corn and seeds of the other plants from countries other than those named in § 319.41-1 (b)(2) are found upon inspection at the port of arrival to be appreciably fouled with cobs or other portions of the plants the inspector may require sterilization or other treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter or may refuse entry.

                (2) That the unrestricted importation of rice straw and rice hulls may result in the entry into the United States of the injurious plant diseases heretofore enumerated, as well as insect pests.
                
                (b) To prevent the introduction into the United States of the plant pests and diseases indicated above, the Secretary has determined that it is necessary to restrict the importation of rice straw and rice hulls from all foreign locations, except as otherwise provided in this subpart.
                (c) The Administrator may authorize the importation of articles otherwise prohibited by this subpart under conditions specified in a controlled import permit issued in accordance with § 319.6.

              (c) Ports of entry. (1) Fruits and vegetables must be imported into specific ports if so required by this subpart or by part 305 of this chapter, or if so required by a permit issued in accordance with this section and with §§ 319.7 through 319.7-5 for the importation of the particular fruit or vegetable. If a permit issued for the importation of fruits or vegetables names specific port(s) where the fruits or vegetables must be imported, the fruits and vegetables may only be imported into the port(s) named in the permit. If a permit issued for the importation of fruits or vegetables does not name specific port(s) where the fruits or vegetables must be imported, the fruits and vegetables may be imported into any port referenced in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
              (2) Fruits and vegetables imported under this subpart may be imported into any port listed in 19 CFR 101.3(b)(1), except as otherwise provided by part 319 or by a permit issued in accordance with part 319, and except as provided in § 330.104 of this chapter. Fruits and vegetables that are to be cold treated at ports in the United States may only be imported into specific ports as provided in part 305 of this chapter.
              (d) Inspection, treatment, and other requirements. All imported fruits or vegetables are subject to inspection, are subject to such disinfection at the port of first arrival as may be required by an inspector, and are subject to reinspection at other locations at the option of an inspector. If an inspector finds plants or portions of plants, or a plant pest or noxious weed, or evidence of a plant pest or noxious weed on or in any fruit or vegetable or its container, or finds that the fruit or vegetable may have been associated with other articles infested with plant pests or noxious weeds, the owner or agent of the owner of the fruit or vegetable must clean or treat the fruit or vegetable and its container as required by an inspector, and the fruit or vegetable is also subject to reinspection, cleaning, and treatment at the option of an inspector at any time and place until all applicable requirements of this subpart have been accomplished.
              (1) Notice of arrival; assembly for inspection. Any person importing fruits and vegetables into the United States must offer those agricultural products for inspection and entry at the port of first arrival. The owner or agent must assemble the fruits and vegetables for inspection at the port of first arrival, or at any other place designated by an inspector, and in a manner designated by the inspector. All fruits and vegetables must be accurately disclosed and made available to an inspector for examination. The owner or the agent must provide an inspector with the name and address of the consignee and must make full disclosure of the type, quantity, and country and locality of origin of all fruits and vegetables in the consignment, either orally for noncommercial consignments or on an invoice or similar document for commercial consignments.
              (2) Refusal of entry. If an inspector finds that an imported fruit or vegetable is prohibited, or is not accompanied by required documentation, or is so infested with a plant pest or noxious weed that, in the judgment of the inspector, it cannot be cleaned or treated, or contains soil or other prohibited contaminants, the entire lot or consignment may be refused entry into the United States.
              (3) Release for movement. No person may move a fruit or vegetable from the port of first arrival unless an inspector has either:
              (i) Released it;
              (ii) Ordered treatment at the port of first arrival and, after treatment, released the fruit or vegetable;
              (iii) Authorized movement of the fruit or vegetable to another location for treatment, further inspection, or destruction; or
              (iv) Ordered the fruit or vegetable to be reexported.
              (4) Notice to owner of actions ordered by inspector. If an inspector orders any disinfection, cleaning, treatment, reexportation, recall, destruction, or other action with regard to imported fruits or vegetables while the consignment is in foreign commerce, the inspector will issue an emergency action notification (PPQ Form 523) to the owner of the fruits or vegetables or to the owner's agent. The owner must, within the time and in the manner specified in the PPQ Form 523, destroy the fruits and vegetables, ship them to a point outside the United States, move them to an authorized site, and/or apply treatments or other safeguards to the fruits and vegetables as prescribed to prevent the introduction of plant pests or noxious weeds into the United States.
              (e) Costs and charges. APHIS will be responsible only for the costs of providing the services of an inspector during regularly assigned hours of duty and at the usual places of duty. 1
                 The owner of imported fruits or vegetables is responsible for all additional costs of inspection, treatment, movement, storage, destruction, or other measures ordered by an inspector under this subpart, including any labor, chemicals, packing materials, or other supplies required. APHIS will not be responsible for any costs or charges, other than those identified in this section.
              
                
                  1 Provisions relating to costs for other services of an inspector are contained in part 354 of this chapter.
              
              (f) APHIS not responsible for damage. APHIS assumes no responsibility for any damage to fruits or vegetables that results from the application of treatments or other measures required under this subpart (or under part 305 of this chapter) to protect against the introduction of plant pests into the United States.

              § 319.56-4
              Authorization of certain fruits and vegetables for importation.
              (a) Determination by the Administrator. No fruit or vegetable is authorized importation into the United States unless the Administrator has determined that the risk posed by each quarantine pest associated with the fruit or vegetable can be reasonably mitigated by the application of one or more phytosanitary measures designated by the Administrator and the fruit or vegetable is imported into the United States in accordance with, and as stipulated in, the permit issued by the Administrator.
              (b) Designated phytosanitary measures. (1) The fruits and vegetables are subject to phytosanitary treatments, which could include, but are not limited to, pest control treatments in the field or growing site, and post-harvest treatments.
              (2) The fruits and vegetables are subject to growing area pest mitigations, which could include, but are not limited to detection surveys, trapping requirements, pest exclusionary structures, and field inspections.
              (3) The fruits and vegetables are subject to safeguarding and movement mitigations, which could include, but are not limited to, safeguarded transport, box labeling, limited distribution, insect-proof boxes, and importation as commercial consignments only.
              (4) The fruits and vegetables are subject to administrative mitigations, which could include, but are not limited to, registered fields or orchards, registered growing sites, registered packinghouses, inspection in the country of origin by an inspector or an official of the national plant protection organization of the exporting country, and operational workplan monitoring.
              (5) The fruits and vegetables are subject to any other measures deemed appropriate by the Administrator.
              (c) Authorized fruits and vegetables—(1) Comprehensive list. The name and origin of all fruits and vegetables authorized importation under this section, as well as the applicable requirements for their importation, may be found on the internet at https://epermits.aphis.usda.gov/manual.
              
              (2) Fruits and vegetables authorized importation prior to October 15, 2018. Fruits and vegetables that were authorized importation under this subpart either directly by permit or by specific regulation as of October 15, 2018 may continue to be imported into the United States under the same requirements that applied before October 15, 2018, except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
              (3) Other fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables not already authorized for importation as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be authorized importation only after:
              (i) APHIS has analyzed the pest risk posed by the importation of a fruit or vegetable from a specified foreign region and has determined that the risk posed by each quarantine pest associated with the fruit or vegetable can be reasonably mitigated by the application of one or more phytosanitary measures;

              (ii) APHIS has made its pest risk analysis and determination available for public comment for at least 60 days through a notice published in the Federal Register; and

              (iii) The Administrator has announced his or her decision in a subsequent Federal Register notice to authorize the importation of the fruit or vegetable subject to the phytosanitary measures specified in the notice.
              (4) Changes to phytosanitary measures. (i) If the Administrator determines that the phytosanitary measures required for a fruit or vegetable that has been authorized importation under this subpart are no longer sufficient to reasonably mitigate the pest risk posed by the fruit or vegetable, APHIS will prohibit or further restrict importation of the fruit or vegetable. APHIS will also publish a notice in the Federal Register advising the public of its finding. The notice will specify the amended importation requirements, provide an effective date for the change, and will invite public comment on the subject.
              (ii) If the Administrator determines that any of the phytosanitary measures required for a fruit or vegetable that has been authorized importation under this subpart are no longer necessary to reasonably mitigate the pest risk posed by the fruit or vegetable, APHIS will make new pest risk documentation available for public comment, in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section, prior to allowing importation of the fruit or vegetable subject to the phytosanitary measures specified in the notice.

              [83 FR 46638, Sept. 14, 2018]
            
            
              § 319.56-5
              Pest-free areas.
              As provided elsewhere in this subpart, certain fruits and vegetables may be imported into the United States provided that the fruits or vegetables originate from an area that is free of a specific pest or pests. In some cases, fruits or vegetables may only be imported if the area of export is free of all quarantine pests that attack the fruit or vegetable. In other cases, fruits and vegetables may be imported if the area of export is free of one or more quarantine pests that attack the fruit or vegetable, and provided that the risk posed by the remaining quarantine pests that attack the fruit or vegetable is mitigated by other specific phytosanitary measures contained in the regulations in this subpart.
              (a) Application of international standard for pest free areas. APHIS requires that determinations of pest-free areas be made in accordance with the criteria for establishing freedom from pests found in International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures No. 4, “Requirements for the establishment of pest free areas.” The international standard was established by the International Plant Protection Convention of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization and is incorporated by reference in § 300.5 of this chapter.
              (b) Survey protocols. APHIS must approve the survey protocol used to determine and maintain pest-free status, as well as protocols for actions to be performed upon detection of a pest. Pest-free areas are subject to audit by APHIS to verify their status.
              (c) Determination of pest freedom. (1) For an area to be considered free of a specified pest for the purposes of this subpart, the Administrator must determine, and announce in a notice or rule published in the Federal Register for 60 days public comment, that the area meets the criteria of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

              (2) The Administrator will announce his or her decision in a subsequent Federal Register notice. If appropriate, APHIS would begin issuing permits for importation of the fruit or vegetable from a pest-free area because:
              (i) No comments were received on the notice or
              (ii) The comments on the notice did not affect the overall conclusions of the notice and the Administrator's determination of risk.
              (d) Decertification of pest-free areas; reinstatement. If a pest is detected in an area that is designated as free of that pest, APHIS would publish in the Federal Register a notice announcing that the pest-free status of the area in question has been withdrawn, and that imports of host crops for the pest in question are subject to application of an approved treatment for the pest. If a treatment for the pest is not available, importation of the host crops would be prohibited. In order for a decertified pest-free area to be reinstated, it would have to meet the criteria of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
              (e) General requirements for fruits and vegetables imported from pest-free areas. (1) Labeling. Each box of fruits or vegetables that is imported into the United States from a pest-free area under this subpart must be clearly labeled with:
              (i) The name of the orchard or grove of origin, or the name of the grower; and
              (ii) The name of the municipality and State in which the fruits or vegetables were produced; and

              (iii) The type and amount of fruit the box contains.
              
              (2) Phytosanitary certificate. A phytosanitary certificate must accompany the imported fruits or vegetables, and must contain an additional declaration that the fruits originate from a pest-free area that meets the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
              (3) Safeguarding. If fruits or vegetables are moved from a pest-free area into or through an area that is not free of that pest, the fruits or vegetables must be safeguarded during the time they are present in a non-pest-free area by being covered with insect-proof mesh screens or plastic tarpaulins, including while in transit to the packinghouse and while awaiting packaging. If fruits or vegetables are moved through an area that is not free of that pest during transit to a port, they must be packed in insect-proof cartons or containers or be covered by insect-proof mesh or plastic tarpaulins during transit to the port and subsequent export to the United States. These safeguards described in this section must be intact upon arrival in the United States.

              § 319.56-6
              Trust fund agreements.
              If APHIS personnel need to be physically present in an exporting country or region to facilitate the exportation of fruits or vegetables and APHIS services are to be funded by the national plant protection organization (NPPO) of the exporting country or a private export group, then the NPPO or the private export group must enter into a trust fund agreement with APHIS that is in effect at the time the fruits or vegetables are exported. Under the agreement, the NPPO of the exporting country or the private export group must pay in advance all estimated costs that APHIS expects to incur in providing inspection services in the exporting country. These costs will include administrative expenses incurred in conducting the services and all salaries (including overtime and the Federal share of employee benefits), travel expenses (including per diem expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred by the inspectors in performing services. The agreement must require the NPPO of the exporting country or region or a private export group to deposit a certified or cashier's check with APHIS for the amount of those costs, as estimated by APHIS. The agreement must further specify that, if the deposit is not sufficient to meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the NPPO of the exporting country or a private export group must deposit with APHIS, before the services will be completed, a certified or cashier's check for the amount of the remaining costs, as determined by APHIS. After a final audit at the conclusion of each shipping season, any overpayment of funds would be returned to the NPPO of the exporting country or region or a private export group, or held on account.
            
            
              § 319.56-7

              (a) Mail. Samples of unroasted coffee that are transiting Hawaii or Puerto Rico en route to other destinations and that are packaged to prevent the escape of any plant pests may proceed without action by an inspector. Packaging that would prevent the escape of plant pests includes, but is not limited to, sealed cartons, airtight containers, or vacuum packaging. Samples of unroasted coffee received by mail but not packaged in this manner are subject to inspection and safeguard by an inspector. These samples must be returned to origin or forwarded to a destination outside Hawaii or Puerto Rico in a time specified by an inspector and in packaging that will prevent the escape of any plant pests. If this action is not possible, the samples must be destroyed.
              (b) Cargo. Samples of unroasted coffee that are transiting Hawaii or Puerto Rico as cargo and that remain on the carrier may proceed to a destination outside Hawaii or Puerto Rico without action by an inspector. Samples may be transshipped in Puerto Rico or Hawaii only after an inspector determines that they are packaged to prevent the escape of any plant pests. Samples that are not packaged in this manner must be rewrapped or packaged in a manner prescribed by an inspector to prevent the escape of plant pests before the transshipment will be allowed.
              (c) Other mail, cargo, and baggage shipments of articles covered by § 319.73-2 arriving in Puerto Rico or Hawaii may not be unloaded or transshipped in Puerto Rico or Hawaii and are subject to inspection and other applicable requirements of the Plant Safeguard Regulations (part 352 of this chapter).

              § 319.74-2
              Conditions governing the entry of cut flowers.
              (a) Inspection. All cut flowers imported into the United States must be made available to an inspector for examination at the port of first arrival and must remain at the port of first arrival until released, or authorized further movement, by an inspector.
              (b) Actions to prevent the introduction of plant pests; notice by an inspector. If an inspector orders any disinfection, cleaning, treatment, reexportation, or other action with regard to imported cut flowers that are found to be infested with injurious plant pests or infected with diseases, the inspector will provide an emergency action notification (PPQ Form 523) to the importer, owner, or agent or representative of the importer or owner of the cut flowers. The importer, owner, or agent or representative of the importer or owner must, within the time specified in the PPQ Form 523 and at his or her own expense, destroy the cut flowers, ship them to a point outside the United States, move them to an authorized site, and/or apply treatments, clean, or apply other safeguards to the cut flowers as prescribed by the inspector on the PPQ Form 523. Further, if the importer, owner, or agent or representative of the importer or owner fails to follow the conditions on PPQ Form 523 by the time specified on the form, APHIS will arrange for destruction of the cut flowers, and the importer, owner, or agent or representative of the importer or owner will be responsible for all costs incurred. Cut flowers that have been cleaned or treated must be made available for further inspection, cleaning, and treatment at the option of the inspector at any time and place indicated by the inspector before the requirements of this subpart will have been met. Neither the Department of Agriculture nor the inspector may be held responsible for any adverse effects of treatment on imported cut flowers.
              (c) Fumigation for agromyzids. Cut flowers imported from any country or locality and found upon inspection to be infested with agromyzids (insects of the family Agromyzidae) must be fumigated at the time of importation with methyl bromide in accordance with part 305 of this chapter, with the following exceptions:

              (1) Fumigation will not be required for cut flowers imported from Canada (including Labrador and Newfoundland) or Mexico because of the finding of agromyzids.

              (2) Fumigation will not be required for cut flowers of Chrysanthemum spp. imported from Colombia or the Dominican Republic because of the finding of agromyzids, when such agromyzids are identified by an inspector to be only agromyzids of the species Liriomyza trifolii (Burgess).
              (d) Chrysanthemum white rust hosts. (1) The following Chrysanthemum, Leucanthemella, and Nipponanthemum spp. are considered to be hosts of chrysanthemum white rust:

              (2) Chrysanthemum white rust is considered to exist in the following regions: Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Brunei, Canary Islands, Chile, China, Colombia, Croatia, Ecuador, Iceland, Japan, Korea, Liechtenstein, Macedonia, Malaysia, Mexico, Moldova, Monaco, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Republic of South Africa, Russia, San Marino, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, Ukraine, Uruguay, Venezuela, Yugoslavia; the European Union (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom); and all countries, territories, and possessions of countries located in part or entirely between 90° and 180° East longitude.
              (3) Cut flowers of any species listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section may be imported into the United States from any region listed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section only under the following conditions:

              (i) The flowers must be grown in a production site that is registered with the national plant protection organization (NPPO) of the country in which the production site is located or with the NPPO's designee, and the NPPO or its designee must provide a list of registered sites to APHIS.

              (ii) Each shipment of cut flowers must be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate or equivalent documentation, issued by the NPPO of the country of origin or its designee, that contains an additional declaration stating that the place of production as well as the consignment have been inspected and found free of Puccinia horiana.
              
              (iii) Box labels and other documents accompanying shipments of cut flowers must be marked with the identity of the registered production site.
              (iv) APHIS-authorized inspectors must also be allowed access to production sites and other areas necessary to monitor the chrysanthemum white rust-free status of the production sites.
              (4) Cut flowers not meeting these conditions will be refused entry into the United States. The detection of chrysanthemum white rust in a shipment of cut flowers from a registered production site upon arrival in the United States will result in the prohibition of imports originating from the production site until such time when APHIS and the NPPO of the exporting country, can agree that the eradication measures taken have been effective and that the pest risk within the production site has been eliminated.
              (e) Irradiation. Cut flowers and foliage that are required under this part to be treated or subjected to inspection to control one or more of the plant pests for which irradiation is an approved treatment under part 305 of this chapter may instead be treated with irradiation. Irradiation treatment must be conducted in accordance with the requirements of part 305 of this chapter. There is a possibility that some cut flowers could be damaged by such irradiation.
              (f) Refusal of entry. If an inspector finds that imported cut flowers are so infested with a plant pest or infected with disease that, in the judgment of the inspector, they cannot be cleaned or treated, or if they contain soil or other prohibited contaminants, the entire lot may be refused entry into the United States.

              § 322.12
              Risk assessment procedures for approving countries.
              (a) The national government of the region wishing to export must request that we perform a risk assessment for the importation into the United States of honeybees, honeybee germ plasm, or bees other than honeybees from that region.
              (b) When we receive a request, we will evaluate the science-based risks associated with such importation. Our risk assessment will be based on information provided by the exporting region, information from topical scientific literature, and, if applicable, information we gain from a site visit to the exporting region. The risk assessment will include:
              (1) Identification of all bee diseases, including fungi, bacteria, viruses, mycoplasmas, and protozoa, that occur in the exporting region but not in the United States or that are listed as significant for international trade by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE);
              (2) Identification of all bee parasites, including mites, that occur in the exporting region but not in the United States or that are listed as significant for international trade by the OIE;

              (3) Identification of all species and subspecies of honeybees that occur in the exporting region but not in the United States or that are listed as significant for international trade by the OIE, if applicable;
              
              (4) Identification of all pests of bee culture, such as the small hive beetle, that occur in the exporting region but not in the United States or that are listed as significant for international trade by the OIE;
              (5) Evaluation of the probability of establishment, including pathway, entry, colonization, and spread potentials, of any diseases, parasites, undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees, or pests identified in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section;
              (6) Evaluation of the potential consequences of establishment, including economic, environmental, and perceived social and political effects, of each disease, parasite, undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees, or pest identified in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section; and
              (7) Consideration of the effectiveness of the regulatory system of the exporting region to control bee diseases, parasites, undesirable species and subspecies of honeybees, and pests that occur there and to prevent occurrences of new bee diseases, parasites, undesirable species and subspecies of honeybees, and pests.
              (c) Based on the conclusions of the risk assessment, we will either:
              (1) Publish in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking to allow honeybees, honeybee germ plasm, or bees other than honeybees to be imported into the United States from that region; or
              (2) Deny the request in writing, stating the specific reasons for that action.
              (d) We will publish a notice of availability of all completed risk assessments for public comment.

              § 322.15
              APHIS review of permit applications; denial or revocation of permits.
              (a) Review of permit applications to import restricted organisms—(1) Consultation. During our review of your permit application, we may consult with any Federal officials; appropriate officials of any State, Territory, or other jurisdiction in the United States in charge of research or regulatory programs relative to bees; and any other qualified governmental or private research laboratory, institution, or individual. We will conduct these consultations to gain information on the risks associated with the importation of the restricted organisms.
              (2) Review by destination State. We will transmit a copy of your permit application, along with our anticipated decision on the application, to the appropriate regulatory official in the destination State for review and recommendation. A State's response, which we will consider before taking final action on the permit application, may take one of the following forms:
              (i) The State recommends that we issue the permit;
              (ii) The State recommends that we issue the permit with specified additional conditions;

              (iii) The State recommends that we deny the permit application and provides scientific, risk-based reasons supporting that recommendation; or
              
              (iv) The State makes no recommendation, thereby concurring with our decision regarding the issuance of the permit. 4
                
              
              
                
                  4 If a State regulatory official does not respond within 20 business days, we will conclude that the State has chosen to make no recommendation regarding the issuance of the permit.
              
              (b) Results of review. After a complete review of your application, we will either:
              (1) Issue you a written permit with, if applicable, certain specific conditions listed for the importation of the restricted organisms you applied to import. You must initial each condition on the proposed permit and return the proposed permit conditions to the Permit Unit before we will issue you a signed valid permit; or
              (2) Notify you that your application has been denied and provide reasons for the denial.
              (c) Denial of permit applications. APHIS will deny an application for a permit to import a restricted organism regulated under this subpart when, in its opinion, such movement would involve a danger of dissemination of an exotic bee disease or parasite, or an undesirable species or subspecies of honeybee. Danger of such dissemination may be deemed to exist when:
              (1) Existing safeguards against dissemination are inadequate and no adequate safeguards can be arranged; or
              (2) The potential for disseminating an exotic bee disease or parasite, or an undesirable species or subspecies of honeybee, with the restricted organism outweighs the probable benefits that could be derived from the proposed movement and use of the restricted organism; or
              (3) When you, as a previous permittee, failed to maintain the safeguards or otherwise observe the conditions prescribed in a previous permit and have failed to demonstrate your ability or intent to observe them in the future; or
              (4) The proposed movement of the restricted organism is adverse to the conduct of an eradication, suppression, control, or regulatory program of APHIS.
              (5) APHIS may also deny a permit to import restricted organisms:
              (i) To a person who has previously failed to comply with any APHIS regulation, except:
              (A) A permit revoked in an investigation concerning that failure has been reinstated on appeal, at the discretion of APHIS; or
              (B) All measures ordered by APHIS to correct the failure, including but not limited to, payment of penalties or restitution, have been complied with to the satisfaction of APHIS.
              (ii) To a person who has previously failed to comply with any international or Federal regulation or instruction concerning the importation of prohibited or restricted foreign agricultural products; or
              (iii) If the application for a permit contains information that is found to be materially false, fraudulent, deceptive, or misrepresentative.
              (d) Cancellation of permits. (1) APHIS may cancel any outstanding permit whenever:
              (i) We receive information subsequent to the issuance of the permit of circumstances that would constitute cause for the denial of an application for permit under paragraph (c) of this section; or
              (ii) You, as the permittee, fail to maintain the safeguards or otherwise observe the conditions specified in the permit or in any applicable regulations.
              (2) Upon cancellation of a permit, you must either:
              (i) Surrender all restricted organisms to an APHIS inspector; or
              (ii) Destroy all restricted organisms under the supervision of an APHIS inspector.
              (e) Appealing the denial of permit applications or revocation of permits. If your permit application has been denied or your permit has been revoked, APHIS will inform you in writing, including by electronic methods, as promptly as circumstances permit and will include the reasons for the denial or revocation. You may appeal the decision by writing to APHIS within 10 business days from the date you received the communication notifying you of the denial or revocation of the permit. Your appeal must state all facts and reasons upon which you are relying to show that your permit application was wrongfully denied or your permit was wrongfully revoked. APHIS will grant or deny the appeal in writing and will state in writing the reason for the decision. The denial or revocation will remain in effect during the resolution of the appeal.

              (a) If you import a restricted organism through the mail or through commercial express delivery, you must attach a special mailing label (APHIS Form 599), which APHIS will provide with your permit, to the package or container. The mailing label indicates that APHIS has authorized the shipment.
              (b) You must address the package containing the restricted organism to the containment facility or apiary identified on the permit (post office boxes are not allowed).
              (c) If the restricted organism arrives in the mail without the mailing label described in paragraph (a) of this section or addressed to a containment facility or apiary other than the one listed on the permit, an inspector will refuse to allow the organism to enter the United States.

              (b) Inspection of premises. Prior to issuing a permit to import restricted organisms, we will inspect the apiary or containment facility where you intend to contain the restricted organisms. In order to approve the apiary or containment facility, an inspector must determine that adequate safeguards are in place to prevent the release of diseases or parasites of bees, or of undesirable species or strains of honeybees. We will use the following criteria to determine whether adequate safeguards are in place:
              (1) Enclosed containment facilities. (i) Will the facility's entryways, windows, and other structures, including water, air, and waste handling systems, contain the restricted organisms, parasites and pathogens, and prevent the entry of other organisms and unauthorized visitors?
              (ii) Does the facility have operational and procedural safeguards in place to prevent the escape of the restricted organisms, parasites, and pathogens, and to prevent the entry of other organisms and unauthorized visitors?
              (iii) Does the facility have a means of inactivating or sterilizing restricted organisms and any breeding materials, pathogens, parasites, containers, or other material?
              (2) Containment apiaries. (i) Is the apiary located in an area devoid of indigenous bees and sufficiently isolated to prevent contact between indigenous bees and imported restricted organisms? Is the area extending from the apiary to the nearest indigenous bees constantly unsuitable for foraging individuals of the imported restricted organisms?
              (ii) Does the apiary have sufficient physical barriers to prevent the entry of unauthorized visitors?
              (iii) Does the apiary have operational and procedural safeguards in place to prevent the escape of the restricted organisms, parasites, and pathogens, and to prevent the entry of other organisms and unauthorized visitors?
              (iv) Does the apiary have a means of inactivating or sterilizing restricted organisms, and any hives, wax, pathogens, parasites, containers, or other materials?
              (3) Containment apiaries for honeybees resulting from germ plasm imported from nonapproved regions.
              (i) Does the apiary have sufficient physical barriers to prevent the entry of unauthorized visitors?
              (ii) Are there sufficient physical barriers (e.g., excluders) in hives in the apiary to prevent the escape of all adult queen and drone honeybees resulting from the germ plasm?
              (iii) Does the apiary have operational and procedural safeguards in place to prevent the escape of all queen and drone honeybees resulting from the germ plasm?

              (iv) Does the apiary have a means of destroying colonies of honeybees with undesirable characteristics that may result from imported germ plasm?
              
              (c) Holding in containment. (1) If we issue a permit for importing restricted organisms into an approved containment facility or apiary, you may not remove or release the restricted organisms, or the progeny or germ plasm resulting from the restricted organisms, from the apiary or facility without our prior approval.
              (2) You must allow us to inspect the apiary or facility and all documents associated with the importation or holding of restricted organisms at any time to determine whether safeguards are being maintained to prevent the release of the restricted organisms, their progeny and germ plasm, parasites, and pathogens.
              (3) You must inform us immediately, but no later than 24 hours after detection, if restricted organisms escape from the facility
              (d) Release from containment apiary or facility. (1) After rearing the restricted organisms in an approved containment facility or apiary through at least 4 months of active reproduction with no evidence of nonindigenous parasites or pathogens or of undesirable characteristics, you may submit a request to us for the release of the bees. The request must include:
              (i) Inspection protocols;
              (ii) Inspection frequencies;
              (iii) Names and titles of inspectors;
              (iv) Complete information, including laboratory reports, on detection of diseases and parasites in the population;
              (v) Complete notes and observations on behavior, such as aggressiveness and swarming; and
              (vi) Any other information or data relating to bee diseases, parasites, or adverse species or subspecies.
              (2) Mail your request for release to the Permit Unit, PPQ, APHIS, 4700 River Road Unit 133, Riverdale, MD 20737-1236, or fax to (301) 734-8700.
              (3) When we receive a complete request for release from containment, we will evaluate the request and determine whether the bees may be released. Our evaluation may include an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. We may conduct an additional inspection of the bees during our evaluation of the request. You will receive a written statement as soon as circumstances allow that approves or denies your request for release of the bees.

              Inspection.
              (a) Inspection of foreign arrivals. In order to prevent the dissemination into the United States of plant pests and for the purpose of carrying out the regulations in this part, all plant pests; means of conveyance and their stores; baggage; mail; plants; plant products; soil; stone and quarry products under § 330.300; garbage; and any other product or article of any character whatsoever which an inspector considers may be infested or infected by or contain a plant pest, arriving in the United States from any place outside thereof for entry into or movement through the United States shall be subject to inspection by an inspector at the port of first arrival, except that mail will be handled in accordance with the joint customs and postal regulations for inspecting and handling mail. No such plant pests; means of conveyance or their stores; baggage; mail; plants; plant products; soil; stone or quarry products under § 330.300; garbage; or other products or articles which an inspector notifies the Customs authorities should be held for inspection shall be released by Customs officers for entry or onward movement until released by an inspector. The release of all means of conveyance, products and articles regulated under parts 319, 321, and 352 of this chapter shall be in accordance with the requirements of those parts and the applicable provisions in this part. Whenever it shall be deemed safe to modify the requirements of this section by exempting any class of means of conveyance, products or articles from the requirement that they be held for inspection and release of the inspector, the exemptions shall be specified in administrative instructions. Inspectors shall make local arrangements, in accordance with policies of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, with the Collector of Customs for the release by Customs officers on behalf of the inspector of any class of means of conveyance, their stores, baggage, mail, or other products or articles when such arrangements do not increase unduly the danger of plant pest dissemination and will facilitate clearance of means of conveyance, baggage, mail, or other products or articles.
              (b) Inspection of domestic movements. For the purpose of preventing the interstate movement of plant pests, provisions requiring inspection of means of conveyance and products or articles moving interstate may be issued as regulations in association with quarantines in part 301 or part 318 of this chapter or in this part.

              § 330.106
              Emergency measures.
              (a) Procedures to prevent pest dissemination. Whenever inspection of any means of conveyance, stores, baggage, mail, plants, plant products, earth, stone and quarry products, garbage, or other products or articles of any character whatsoever, arriving in the United States from a place outside thereof, or moving interstate, discloses a plant pest, or provides a reason to believe such a pest is present (other than one moving under permit in accordance with any conditions in the permit and the provisions in this part) which is new to, or not theretofore known to be widely prevalent or distributed within and throughout the United States, the inspector shall employ procedures necessary to prevent the dissemination of the plant pest. Such procedures shall also be employed with respect to means of conveyance or products or articles of any character whatsoever which have moved into the United States or interstate and which the inspector has reason to believe were infested or infected by or contained any such plant pest at the time of such movement. The inspector may follow administrative instructions containing procedures prescribed for certain situations, or he may follow a procedure selected by him from administratively approved methods known to be effective. The procedure may involve seizure, quarantine, treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter, application of other remedial measures, exportation, return to shipping point of origin, destruction, or other disposal, but no means of conveyance, product, article, or plant pest owned by any person shall be destroyed, exported, or returned to shipping point of origin or ordered to be so handled, unless there is, in the opinion of the inspector, no less drastic action adequate to prevent the dissemination of the plant pest. In forming such an opinion that no less drastic action is adequate, the inspector shall be guided by applicable specific and general instructions received from officers of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs. In taking action with respect to any means of conveyance, product, article, plant pest, the inspector shall take cognizance of applicable requirements of the customs and postal laws and regulations.
              (b) Orders for remedial measures. The inspector may order the owner of any means of conveyance, product, article, or plant pest, subject to disposal under paragraph (a) of this section, to treat, apply other remedial measures, destroy, or make other disposal thereof without cost to the Federal Government and in a manner specified in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
              (c) Failure to apply remedial measures. If the measures required by the inspector are not applied promptly by the owner within the time limits specified by the inspector, the inspector shall apply measures necessary to prevent the dissemination of the plant pests.
              (d) Khapra beetle infestations of means of conveyance, or cargo or stores thereof; other infestations. As a means of preventing the dissemination into the United States, or interstate, of the khapra beetle (Trogoderma granarium Everts), the following procedures will be applicable when that insect is found, or there is reason to believe it is present, in a means of conveyance within paragraph (a) of this section, or in any cargo or stores in such a means of conveyance, or in any cargo or stores unloaded or landed, or being unloaded or landed, in the United States therefrom. These procedures will also apply with respect to other plant pests when the inspector finds they are necessary and sufficient to prevent the spread of such pests.
              (1) Infestation in storerooms and similar compartments of means of conveyance (except aircraft). (i) When infestation is found only in stores or storerooms, galleys, pantries, or similar noncargo compartments of a means of conveyance, except aircraft, the inspector shall prescribe and supervise the application of such remedial measures as, in his opinion, will be effective under conditions that will not spread the infestation to other parts of the means of conveyance, or to adjacent piers or other installations. If, in the opinion of the inspector, fumigation is the only available safeguard to eliminate the infestation, he shall order the owner to arrange for immediate fumigation of the infested stores and portions of the means of conveyance.

              (ii) If the means of conveyance is to leave the territorial limits of the United States directly for a port in another country within 24 hours of such order, the inspector may suspend compliance with the fumigation requirement pending departure from the United States. Pending fumigation or departure, the inspector may seal the openings of infested compartments, packages, or articles, if in his opinion the action is necessary to prevent plant pest dissemination while the means of conveyance remains in the teritorial limits of the United States, as authorized in § 330.110. The inspector may extend the 24-hour period to 48 hours, if, in his judgment, such extension is warranted by plans of the owner to remove the means of conveyance from the territorial limits of the United States within the extended period, the inability of the contractor to begin fumigation within the 24-hour period, or other reason deemed valid by the inspector. Further extension shall be given only under authority of the Deputy Administrator. Pending compliance with the requirement of fumigation, or the departure from the territorial limits of the United States directly for a port in another country, no stores, laundry, furnishings or equipment, or other articles or products whether in cargo or stores, shall be unloaded from the means of conveyance except as authorized by the inspector and under conditions prescribed by him. The owner of an infested means of conveyance under notice for fumigation which leaves the territorial limits of the United States without fumigation should arrange for the eradication of the infestation before returning to the same or another port in the United States. Upon return to a port in the United States and unless the infestation has been eliminated to the satisfaction of the inspector, the means of conveyance shall be subject to fumigation immediately upon arrival in the United States. Unloading or landing of any product or article shall not be permitted pending compliance with the fumigation requirement, except as authorized by the inspector and under conditions prescribed by him.
              (iii) If the means of conveyance is to remain at the port where the infestation was found or is to be moved to another port in the United States, the inspector shall prescribe and supervise the application of the remedial measures at the port where the infestation is found, as provided in this paragraph, or he may authorize the means of conveyance to be moved to another port for fumigation or the application of other remedial measures under safeguards prescribed by him.

              (iv) In all instances where the inspector prescribed procedures concerned with the application of remedial measures which involve (a) withholding permission to discharge articles or products; (b) permission to discharge after such permission has been withheld; (c) discontinuance of discharging; or (d) resumption of discharging after it has been discontinued, the appropriate Customs officer shall be immediately notified in writing. The inspector shall also inform the Customs officers at the port where the infestation is found and at such other ports as may be necessary of the requirement for fumigation and/or permission to move coastwise to another U.S. port for fumigation or other remedial measures.
              (2) Infestation in cargo compartments of means of conveyance (except aircraft). When infestation is found in cargo compartments or in cargo of a means of conveyance, except aircraft, the inspector shall prescribe and supervise the application of such remedial measures as, in his opinion are necessary, with respect to the cargo and the portions of the means of conveyance which contain or contained or were contaminated by the infested cargo. If in the opinion of the inspector fumigation is the only available safeguard to eliminate the infestation, he shall order the owner to arrange for immediate fumigation of the infested portions of such means of conveyance and cargo. However, if such cargo compartments cannot be fumigated without fumigating the entire means of conveyance, the inspector may order the entire means of conveyance and cargo to be fumigated. The inspector shall notify the owner of the means of conveyance of such requirement and the owner shall arrange for immediate fumigation. Discharge of cargo shall be discontinued unless the inspector allows it to continue under safeguards to be prescribed by him. The provisions applicable to stores and storerooms in paragraph (d)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section shall apply to cargo and cargo areas of such means of conveyance. Customs officers shall be informed as required in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.
              (3) Infestation in an aircraft. If infestation is found in an aircraft, the inspector may apply seals as provided in § 330.110, and he may require such temporary safeguards as he deems necessary, including the discontinuance of further unloading or landing of any products or articles except as authorized by him. Upon finding such infestation in an aircraft the inspector shall promptly notify the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs of all circumstances and the temporary safeguards employed, and the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs will specify the measures for eliminating the infestation which will not be deleterious to the aircraft or its operating components. Any insecticidal application required shall be approved by the Deputy Administrator for use in aircraft. If the aircraft is to depart from the territorial limits of the United States within 24 hours after the infestation is found, the inspector shall permit such departure in lieu of the application of other measures and shall prior to departure break any seals that would prevent access to the aircraft or safe operation thereof. Other seals shall remain intact at time of departure and shall be broken by the aircraft commander or a crew member upon his order only after the aircraft is beyond the territorial limits of the United States. Extension of the 24-hour period shall be given only under authority of the Deputy Administrator. The owner of the aircraft under notice of khapra beetle infestation which leaves the territorial limits of the United States before the infestation has been eradicated should arrange for eradication before returning the aircraft to the United States. Upon return to the United States, if the infestation is not eliminated to the satisfaction of the inspector, the aircraft shall be subject to the same disinfestation requirements and other safeguards immediately upon arrival in the United States. Customs officers shall be notified as required in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.
              (4) Precautions. The owner of a means of conveyance required to be fumigated pursuant to this section shall arrange with a competent operator to apply the fumigant under the supervision of the inspector. The owner shall understand that if certain fumigants are used they may result in residues in or on foodstuffs which may render them unsafe for use as food items. He is hereby warned against such use unless as ascertains that the fumigated foodstuffs are fit for human consumption. It should also be understood by the owner that emergency measures prescribed by the inspector to safeguard against dissemination of infestation may have adverse effects on certain products and articles, and that the acceptance of fumigation as a requirement is an alternative to the immediate removal of the infested means of conveyance and any products and articles thereon, from the territorial limits of the United States. Products or articles in a means of conveyance, or compartments thereof, which may be exposed to methyl bromide or other remedial measures and may be adversely affected thereby, may be removed from the means of conveyance or compartments thereof prior to the application of the remedial measures if in the opinion of the inspector this can be done without danger of plant pest dissemination and under conditions authorized by him, for additional inspection and/or application of effective remedial measures.

              Seals.
              (a) Use authorized; form. Whenever, in the opinion of the inspector, it is necessary, as a safeguard in order to prevent the dissemination of plant pests into the United States, or interstate, seals may be applied to openings, packages, or articles requiring the security provided by such seals. The words “openings, packages, or articles” shall include any form of container, shelf, bin, compartment, or other opening, package, or article which the inspector may have occasion to seal in lieu of more drastic action or otherwise, as a safeguard against plant pest dissemination. The seals may be automatic metal seals or labels or tags and will be provided by the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs. When they consist of a label or tag, they will be printed in black ink on yellow paper and read substantially as follows: “Warning! The opening, package, or article to which this seal is affixed is sealed under authority of law. This seal is not to be broken while within the territorial limits of the United States except by, or under instructions of, an inspector.”
              (b) Breaking of seals. Seals may be broken: (1) By an inspector; (2) by a Customs officer for Customs purposes, in which case the opening, package, or article will be resealed with Customs seals; (3) by the owner or his agent when the means of conveyance, product, or article has left the territorial limits of the United States; (4) by any person authorized by the inspector or the Deputy Administrator under conditions specified by the inspector or Deputy Administrator. No person shall break seals applied under authority of this section except as provided in this paragraph. The movement into or through the United States, or interstate, of any means of conveyance or product or article on which a seal, applied under this paragraph, has been broken in violation of this paragraph is hereby prohibited, except as authorized by an inspector.
              (c) Notice of sealing. When an inspector seals any opening, product or article, he shall explain the purpose of such action to the owner or his representative and shall present him with a written notice of the conditions under which the seal may be broken, if requested to do so.

            Subpart—Movement of Plant Pests
            
              § 330.200
              Movement of plant pests regulated; permits required.
              No person shall knowingly move any plant pest into or through the United States from any place outside thereof, or interstate, or knowingly accept delivery of any plant pest so moving unless such movement is authorized under permit under this part and is made in accordance with the conditions therein and the provisions in this part. The movement of snails and slugs, as well as other plant pests, is governed by such provisions. Biological specimens of plant pests, in preservative or dried, may be imported without further restriction under this part, but subject to inspection on arrival in the United States to confirm the nature of the material and freedom from risk of plant pest dissemination.
            
            
              § 330.201
              Applications for permits to move plant pests.
              (a) Into or through the United States from any place outside thereof. Only persons resident in the United States may apply for permits to move plant pests into the United States from any place outside thereof. Persons resident in the United States proposing such movement into the United States, or any person proposing movement through the United States, of any plant pests shall first make application for permits authorizing such movement by submitting to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs the form provided therefor by the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, or by submitting in the form of a letter or other written communication the following information insofar as is known to the applicant, for each kind of pest for which a permit is requested: (1) Scientific name of the pest, (2) stage, (3) quantity, (4) origin, (5) destination, (6) whether the pest is established in the State, Territory or other jurisdiction of destination in the United States, (7) method of shipment, (8) proposed port of first arrival in the United States, (9) approximate date of arrival, (10) number of parcels expected to be moved, (11) intended use, (12) measures to be employed to prevent danger of plant pest dissemination, and (13) method of final disposition. In addition, if host materials must necessarily accompany the plant pests, the application shall show the name of the host materials and the reasons it is necessary for them to accompany the plant pests. Applications for permits to move plant pests through the United States should state the name of the port of export instead of the information required by paragraph (a)(6) of this section. Any applicant for a permit to move plant pests into or through the United States from any place outside thereof will facilitate the consideration of his application by furnishing any additional information known to him concerning the economic importance of the pests and the justification for the movement.
              (b) Interstate (including interstate for export). Persons proposing to move plant pests interstate shall first make application for permits authorizing such movement by submitting to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs the form provided therefor by the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs or by submitting the required information in the form of a letter or other written communication showing all pertinent information specified in paragraph (a) of this section and also the approximate date of the movement, except that persons desiring to move plant pests interstate to a port in the United States for export to a place outside of the United States 1
                 shall use the form provided therefor by the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs or submit to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs in the form of a letter or other written communication the following information for each kind of pest: Scientific name of the pest, stage, quantity, origin, destination, method of shipment, proposed port of export from the United States, approximate date of the movement, number of parcels to be moved, proposed use, and measures to be employed to prevent danger of plant pest dissemination during the interstate movement. However, in case it is proposed to move interstate, within or from an area quarantined under §§ 301.38, 301.45, 301.48, 301.52, 301.63, 301.64, 301.72, 301.76, 301.77, 301.78, 301.79, 301.80, or 301.81 of this chapter any plant pest covered by said section, the application should be made to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the Department. In any case the applicant for a permit will facilitate the consideration of his application by furnishing any additional information known to him concerning the economic importance of the pests and the justification for the movement.
              
                
                  1 Persons contemplating the shipment of plant pests to places outside the United States should make prior arrangements directly, or through the recipient, with the country of destination for the receipt of the plant pests into the country of destination. Many countries have laws governing the movement of plant pests into those countries, and therefore it is advisable to make advance arrangements for attaching permits, etc., as may be required by the countries of destination.

              § 330.202
              Consideration of applications for permits to move plant pests.
              The Deputy Administrator, upon the receipt of an application, made in accordance with § 330.201 (a) or (b), for a permit for movement of a plant pest into or through the United States from any place outside thereof, or interstate, shall consider the application on its merits.
              (a) Consultation. He may consult with any Federal officials, the appropriate officials of any State, Territory, or other jurisdiction in the United States in charge of research or regulatory programs relative to plant pests, and any other qualified governmental or private research laboratory, institution, or individual, for views on the danger of plant pest dissemination into the United States, or interstate, in connection with the movement proposed.
              (b) Inspection of premises. The Deputy Administrator may inspect the site where plant pests are proposed to be handled in connection with or after their movement under permit to determine whether existing or proposed facilities will be adequate to prevent plant pest dissemination in case a permit is issued, provided that the person in possession thereof is the applicant or such inspection is otherwise authorized.

              § 330.203
              Action on applications for permits to move plant pests; form of and conditions in permits.
              The Deputy Administrator, having considered an application for permit to move a plant pest, shall approve or deny the application in accordance with § 330.204. If the application is denied, the applicant shall be furnished the reasons therefor. If the application is approved, the Deputy Administrator shall issue the permit including any conditions which, in the opinion of the Deputy Administrator, are necessary to prevent dissemination of plant pests into the United States or interstate. Such conditions may include requirements for inspection of the premises where the plant pests are to be handled, after their movement under the permits, to determine whether the facilities thereat are adequate to prevent plant pest dissemination and the conditions of the permit are otherwise being observed. Permits authorizing movement of plant pests through the United States will include shipping instructions as to routing, labelling, and similar requirements as conditions of the permits. Any applicable conditions prescribed in administrative instructions may be incorporated in a written permit by citation, but shall be applicable whether or not so cited. The Deputy Administrator may, prior to the issuance of the permit, require the applicant to agree in writing to the conditions under which the plant pests will be safeguarded. The permits may be issued in a prescribed form or in letter form, or a combination thereof. A permit without conditions may be issued orally.
            
            
              § 330.204
              Denial or cancellation of permits; reconsiderations.
              (a) The Deputy Administrator will deny an application for a permit to move a plant pest when, in his opinion, such movement would involve a danger of dissemination of the pest. Danger of plant pest dissemination may be deemed to exist when:
              (1) No acceptable safeguards adequate to prevent plant pest dissemination can be arranged;
              (2) The destructive potential of the plant pest to plants, and parts and products thereof, should it escape despite proposed safeguards, outweighs the probable benefits to be derived from the proposed movement and use of the pest;
              (3) The applicant, as a previous permittee, failed to maintain the safeguards or otherwise observe the conditions prescribed in a previous permit and failed to demonstrate his ability or intent to observe them in the future;
              (4) The movement is adverse to the conduct of an eradication, suppression, control, or regulatory program of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service; or
              (5) The movement is objected to in writing by an appropriate official of a State, Territory or possession, or the District of Columbia on the ground it will involve a danger of dissemination of the plant pest into the State, Territory or possession, or District.
              (b) The Deputy Administrator may cancel any outstanding permit whenever:
              (1) Information is received subsequent to the issuance of the permit of circumstances that constitute cause for the denial of an application for permit under paragraph (a) of this section; or
              (2) The permittee has not maintained the safeguards or otherwise observed the conditions specified in the permit or in any applicable regulations or administrative instructions.
              (c) Any person denied a permit, or whose permit has been canceled, may request the Deputy Administrator in person or in writing for a reconsideration, and may submit any additional information he may have to support the original application.
            
            
              § 330.205
              Disposal of plant pests when permits are canceled.

              When an outstanding permit for the movement of a plant pest is canceled by the Deputy Administrator and not reinstated under § 330.204(c), the further movement of the plant pest covered thereby into or through the United States, or interstate, is prohibited by the Plant Protection Act unless authorized in another permit. The permittee should arrange for disposal of the plant pest involved in a manner satisfactory to the Deputy Administrator to prevent plant pest dissemination. The Deputy Administrator may, whenever he deems it necessary as an emergency measure in order to prevent the dissemination of any plant pest new to or not theretofore known to be widely prevalent or distributed within and throughout the United States, seize, quarantine, treat, apply other remedial measures to, destroy, or otherwise dispose of, in such manner as he deems appropriate, any plant pest which is moving without compliance with any conditions in the permit or the provisions of this part or after the permit has been canceled.

              Permits for plant pest movement associated with National Defense projects.
              The Deputy Administrator will facilitate research associated with National Defense projects through issuance of permits for movement of plant pests for such research, upon receiving assurance satisfactory to him that adequate safeguards will surround utilization of the plant pests to prevent their dissemination.
            
            
              § 330.207
              Permits for movement of organisms issued by other agencies.
              Inspectors shall recognize permits for the movement of organisms issued under other acts by other Federal agencies. When such organisms are also plant pests, any further conditions of movement to carry out the purposes of the Plant Protection Act which have been prescribed in administrative instructions, or in correspondence concerning a single shipment, shall be complied with but no additional permit will be required under this part.

              § 330.208
              Courtesy permits.
              The Deputy Administrator may issue permits for the movement into or through the United States, or interstate, or organisms which are not subject to regulation under the Plant Protection Actor any other act, as a courtesy to facilitate movement when the movement might otherwise be impeded because of the similarity of the organisms with others regulated under the Plant Protection Act. He may likewise issue such permits on behalf of any agency requesting such action as a courtesy to facilitate movement for organisms not subject to regulation under the Plant Protection Act but subject to regulation under some other act.

              Packing materials and containers for plant pest movement; host materials.

              Plant pests moved into or through the United States, or interstate, must be free of soil, except when the Deputy Administrator approves in the permit the movement of soil with the plant pest. Subject to this exception, only approved packing materials are to be employed in the shipment of plant pests. Approved packing materials for the movement of plant pests under this part will be prescribed in administrative instructions or approved in specific cases by the Deputy Administrator. Such actions will be coordinated with and may supplement any requirements of the Post Office Department governing packing and packaging of any materials for movements covered by the postal laws and regulations. All containers shall be stoutly constructed so as to prevent breakage in transit and danger of plant pest dissemination and shall be labeled in accordance with § 330.211. The Deputy Administrator may allow the movement of host materials with plant pests under permits when they must necessarily accompany the pests, although such movement is otherwise barred under the Plant Protection Act.

              (a) The following materials are approved as packing materials for use with any shipment of plant pests in accordance with § 330.210:
              (1) Absorbent cotton or processed cotton padding free of cottonseed.
              (2) Cellulose materials.

              § 330.211
              Labeling of plant pests for movement under permits.
              (a) Interstate movement. For interstate movements of plant pests a label shall be attached to each parcel containing the pests as evidence that the movement of the plant pests is authorized. Such label shall also disclose the contents of the parcel.
              (b) Movement into or through the United States from places outside thereof by mail or cargo. (1) When a permit authorizing the movement of plant pests into the United States from any place outside thereof is issued to an applicant under this part, it will be accompanied by distinctive labels, with instructions for their use by the foreign shipper. Such labels will be issued in quantity sufficient to permit attaching one to each parcel to be moved. The labels will direct the parcels to specified inspection stations of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, or other designated points, for clearance. The stations will be notified by the Deputy Administrator in advance of the expected arrival of the plant pests. Plant pests so moved by mail may be refused entry unless the containers thereof bear such labels. Cargo shipments of plant pests so moved may be refused entry unless they bear such labels or are otherwise plainly marked to identify the contents.
              (2) Any labelling requirements with respect to the movement of plant pests through the United States will be included in shipping instructions issued as conditions of the permits.
              (c) Misuse of labels. No labels unused in accordance with the terms of the permit may be used for the movement of any other plant pest. The Plant Protection Act provides for a penalty 2
                 for the misuse of such labels. Any unauthorized movement of plant pests under a label will be refused by the inspector, and the plant pests may be destroyed or otherwise dealt with as set forth in § 330.106 if deemed necessary as an emergency measure.
              
                
                  2 Section 424 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7734) provides that persons who violate this act, or who forge, counterfeit or—without authority from the Secretary—use, alter, deface, or destroy any certificate, permit or other document may, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, be assessed a civil penalty that does not exceed the greater of: (a) $50,000 for individuals, except that the civil penalty may not exceed $1,000 in the case of an initial violation by an individual moving regulated articles not for monetary gain; $250,000 for any other person or legal entity, such as partnerships, corporations, associations, or joint ventures; and $500,000 for all violations adjudicated in a single proceeding; or (b) twice the gross pecuniary gain derived from or loss caused by any violation, forgery, counterfeiting, unauthorized use, defacing, or destruction of a certificate, permit, or other document provided for by this act. Section 424 of the Plant Protection Act also provides penalties for criminal violations, under which knowing violators of the act may be found guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, fined in accordance with title 18 of the United States Code, imprisoned for a period not to exceed 1 year, or both.

              No soil shall be moved into or through the United States from any place outside thereof or from any Territory or possession into or through any other Territory or possession or the Continental United States, whether the soil is moved as such or incidentally adhering to means of conveyance or other articles, except as authorized in § 318.60 or § 319.69 of this chapter, or this subpart.
              (a) Permits authorized. The Deputy Administrator may issue permits under this section for movements of soil not governed by § 318.60 or § 319.69 of this chapter, for research, analytical, religious, ceremonial, patriotic, or similar purposes, or such other purposes as he shall deem consistent with the objectives of this part, specifying in the permit or in the related correspondence, the safeguards, including treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter, or other conditions which he deems necessary for the purpose of preventing the dissemination of plant pests into the United States or interstate. Whenever it is possible to formulate a general rule specifying such conditions, it shall be promulgated in administrative instructions and the applicable provisions thereof may be incorporated into a permit by citation, but shall be applicable whether or not so cited.
              (b) Application for permits. Only persons resident in the United States may apply for permits under this section to move soil into the United States from any place outside thereof, or from any territory or possession into or through any other Territory or possession or the Continental United States. Persons resident in the United States contemplating such movements, or any persons contemplating movement through the United States, of soil under this section shall first make application for permits authorizing such movement by submitting to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs the form provided therefor by the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs or by submitting, in the form of a letter or other written communication, the following information: Origin of the shipment, destination, quantity, method of shipment, proposed port of first arrival in the United States, port of export (if applicable), approximate date of arrival in the United States, intended use, measures to be employed to prevent danger of plant pest dissemination, method of final disposition, and the number of parcels expected to be moved. In acting upon the application for permits for such movement of soil, the Deputy Administrator will follow the procedures outlined in § 330.202 for the consideration of applications for permits to move plant pests insofar as they are applicable.
              (c) Issuance of permits; conditions of permits. Upon the approval of an application for a permit authorizing the movement of soil under this section, the permit will be issued. The permit may contain any conditions which are necessary, in the opinion of the Deputy Administrator, to prevent dissemination of plant pests into the United States or interstate, including conditions with respect to routing, packing, and labeling of the soil. The Deputy Administrator may require the applicant to agree in writing to such conditions prior to the issuance of the permit. The importer will receive, as a part of the permit, information on the manner in which the importation is to be made. A permit without conditions may be issued orally.
              (d) Containers; labels. All containers for soil moved under this section shall be stoutly constructed so as to prevent breakage in transit and danger of plant pest dissemination and shall be appropriately labeled as to contents. If the soil is moved by mail, special mailing labels will be issued to the importer, with instructions for their use, which he is to send to the foreign shipper. The quantity of mailing labels issued will be sufficient for the foreign shipper to attach one to each parcel moved by mail. Such mailing labels will indicate to the postal and the plant quarantine officials that the movement is authorized under the conditions specified in this permit. Importations arriving by mail without labels will be subject to refusal of entry into the United States, or interstate movement, by the inspector unless treated, at the expense of the owner, in a manner to remove danger of plant pest dissemination. The Deputy Administrator may issue mailing labels for movement into or through the United States from any place outside thereof, or from any Territory or possession into or through any other Territory or possession of the continental United States, of earth other than soil when the movement might otherwise be impeded because of the similarity to soil subject to this section.

              § 330.401
              Garbage generated onboard a conveyance.
              (a) Applicability. This section applies to garbage generated onboard any means of conveyance during international or interstate movements as provided in this section and includes food scraps, table refuse, galley refuse, food wrappers or packaging materials, and other waste material from stores, food preparation areas, passengers' or crews' quarters, dining rooms, or any other areas on the means of conveyance. This section also applies to meals and other food that were available for consumption by passengers and crew on an aircraft but were not consumed.
              (1) Not all garbage generated onboard a means of conveyance is regulated for the purposes of this section. Garbage regulated for the purposes of this section is defined as “regulated garbage” in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

              (2) Garbage that is commingled with regulated garbage is also regulated garbage.
              
              (b) Garbage regulated because of movements outside the United States or Canada. For purposes of this section, garbage on or removed from a means of conveyance is regulated garbage, if, when the garbage is on or removed from the means of conveyance, the means of conveyance has been in any port outside the United States and Canada within the previous 2-year period. There are, however, two exceptions to this provision. These exceptions are as follows:
              (1) Exception 1: Aircraft. Garbage on or removed from an aircraft is exempt from requirements under paragraph (d) of this section if the following conditions are met when the garbage is on or removed from the aircraft:
              (i) The aircraft had previously been cleared of all garbage and of all meats and meat products, whatever the country of origin, except meats that are shelf-stable; all fresh and condensed milk and cream from countries designated in 9 CFR 94.1 as those in which foot-and-mouth disease exists; all fresh fruits and vegetables; and all eggs; and the items previously cleared from the aircraft as prescribed by this paragraph have been disposed of according to the procedures for disposing of regulated garbage, as specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.
              (ii) After the garbage and stores referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section were removed, the aircraft has not been in a non-Canadian foreign port.
              (2) Exception 2: Other conveyances. Garbage on or removed in the United States from a means of conveyance other than an aircraft is exempt from requirements under paragraph (d) of this section if the following conditions are met when the garbage is on or removed from the means of conveyance:
              (i) The means of conveyance is accompanied by a certificate from an inspector stating the following:
              (A) That the means of conveyance had previously been cleared of all garbage and of all meats and meat products, whatever the country of origin, except meats that are shelf-stable; all fresh and condensed milk and cream from countries designated in 9 CFR 94.1 as those in which foot-and-mouth disease exists; all fresh fruits and vegetables; and all eggs; and the items previously cleared from the means of conveyance as prescribed by this paragraph have been disposed of according to the procedures for disposing of regulated garbage, as specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.
              (B) That the means of conveyance had then been cleaned and disinfected in the presence of the inspector; and
              (ii) Since being cleaned and disinfected, the means of conveyance has not been in a non-Canadian foreign port.
              (c) Garbage regulated because of certain movements to or from Hawaii, territories, or possessions. For purposes of this section, garbage on or removed from a means of conveyance is regulated garbage, if at the time the garbage is on or removed from the means of conveyance, the means of conveyance has moved during the previous 1-year period, either directly or indirectly, to the continental United States from any territory or possession or from Hawaii, to any territory or possession from any other territory or possession or from Hawaii, or to Hawaii from any territory or possession. There are, however, two exceptions to this provision. These exceptions are as follows:
              (1) Exception 1: Aircraft. Garbage on or removed from an aircraft is exempt from requirements under paragraph (d) of this section if the following two conditions are met when the garbage is on or removed from the aircraft:
              (i) The aircraft had been previously cleared of all garbage and all fresh fruits and vegetables, and the items previously cleared from the aircraft as prescribed by this paragraph have been disposed of according to the procedures for disposing of regulated garbage, as specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.
              (ii) After the garbage and stores referred to in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section were removed, the aircraft has not moved to the continental United States from any territory or possession or from Hawaii; to any territory or possession from any other territory or possession or from Hawaii; or to Hawaii from any territory or possession.
              (2) Exception 2: Other conveyances. Garbage on or removed from a means of conveyance other than an aircraft is exempt from requirements under paragraph (d) of this section if the following two conditions are met when the garbage is on or removed from the means of conveyance:
              (i) The means of conveyance is accompanied by a certificate from an inspector stating that the means of conveyance had been cleared of all garbage and all fresh fruits and vegetables; and the items previously cleared from the means of conveyance as prescribed by this paragraph have been disposed of according to the procedures for disposing of regulated garbage, as specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.
              (ii) After being cleared of the garbage and stores referred to in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the means of conveyance has not moved to the continental United States from any territory or possession or from Hawaii; to any territory or possession from any other territory or possession or from Hawaii; or to Hawaii from any territory or possession.
              (d) Restrictions on regulated garbage. (1) Regulated garbage may not be disposed of, placed on, or removed from a means of conveyance except in accordance with this section.
              (2) Regulated garbage is subject to general surveillance for compliance with this section by inspectors and to disposal measures authorized by the Plant Protection Act and the Animal Health Protection Act to prevent the introduction and dissemination of pests and diseases of plants and livestock.

              (3) All regulated garbage must be contained in tight, covered, leak-proof receptacles during storage on board a means of conveyance while in the territorial waters, or while otherwise within the territory of the United States. All such receptacles shall be contained inside the guard rail if on a watercraft. Such regulated garbage shall not be unloaded from such means of conveyance in the United States unless such regulated garbage is removed in tight, covered, leak-proof receptacles under the direction of an inspector to an approved facility for incineration, sterilization, or grinding into an approved sewage system, under direct supervision by such an inspector, or such regulated garbage is removed for other handling in such manner and under such supervision as may, upon request in specific cases, be approved by the Administrator as adequate to prevent the introduction and dissemination of plant pests and animal diseases and sufficient to ensure compliance with applicable laws for environmental protection. Provided that, a cruise ship may dispose of regulated garbage in landfills at Alaskan ports only, if and only if the cruise ship does not have prohibited or restricted meat or animal products on board at the time it enters Alaskan waters for the cruise season, and only if the cruise ship, except for incidental travel through international waters necessary to navigate safely between ports, remains in Canadian and U.S. waters off the west coast of North America, and calls only at continental U.S. and Canadian ports during the entire cruise season.
              (i) Application for approval of a facility or sewage system may be made in writing by the authorized representative of any carrier or by the official having jurisdiction over the port or place of arrival of the means of conveyance to the Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250. The application must be endorsed by the operator of the facility or sewage system.

              (ii) Approval will be granted if the Administrator determines that the requirements set forth in this section are met. Approval may be denied or withdrawn at any time, if the Administrator determines that such requirements are not met, after notice of the proposed denial or withdrawal of the approval and the reasons therefor, and an opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with such requirements, has been afforded to the operator of the facility or sewage system and to the applicant for approval. However, approval may also be withdrawn without such prior procedure in any case in which the public health, interest, or safety requires immediate action, and in such case, the operator of the facility or sewage system and the applicant for approval shall promptly thereafter be given notice of the withdrawal and the reasons therefor and an opportunity to show cause why the approval should be reinstated.
              (e) The Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs and Veterinary Services, Animal, and Plant Health Inspection Service, will cooperate with other Federal, State, and local agencies responsible for enforcing other statutes and regulations governing disposal of the regulated garbage to the end that such disposal shall be adequate to prevent the dissemination of plant pests and livestock or poultry diseases and comply with applicable laws for environmental protection. The inspectors, in maintaining surveillance over regulated garbage movements and disposal, shall coordinate their activities with the activities of representatives of the Environmental Protection Agency and other Federal, State, and local agencies also having jurisdiction over such regulated garbage
            
            
              § 330.402
              Garbage generated in Hawaii.
              (a) Applicability. This section applies to garbage generated in households, commercial establishments, institutions, and businesses prior to interstate movement from Hawaii, and includes used paper, discarded cans and bottles, and food scraps. Such garbage includes, and is commonly known as, municipal solid waste.
              (1) Industrial process wastes, mining wastes, sewage sludge, incinerator ash, or other wastes from Hawaii that the Administrator determines do not pose risks of introducing animal or plant pests or diseases into the continental United States are not regulated under this section.
              (2) The interstate movement from Hawaii to the continental United States of agricultural wastes and yard waste (other than incidental amounts (less than 3 percent) that may be present in municipal solid waste despite reasonable efforts to maintain source separation) is prohibited.
              (3) Garbage generated onboard any means of conveyance during interstate movement from Hawaii is regulated under § 330.401.
              (b) Restrictions on interstate movement of garbage. The interstate movement of garbage generated in Hawaii to the continental United States is regulated as provided in this section.
              (1) The garbage must be processed, packaged, safeguarded, and disposed of using a methodology that the Administrator has determined is adequate to prevent the introduction or dissemination of plant pests into noninfested areas of the United States.
              (2) The garbage must be moved under a compliance agreement in accordance with § 330.403. APHIS will only enter into a compliance agreement when the Administrator is satisfied that the Agency has first satisfied all its obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act and all applicable Federal and State statutes to fully assess the impacts associated with the movement of garbage under the compliance agreement.
              (3) All such garbage moved interstate from Hawaii to any of the continental United States must be moved in compliance with all applicable laws for environmental protection.
            
            
              § 330.403
              Compliance agreement and cancellation.
              (a) Any person engaged in the business of handling or disposing of garbage in accordance with this subpart must first enter into a compliance agreement with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). Compliance agreement forms (PPQ Form 519) are available without charge from local USDA/APHIS/Plant Protection and Quarantine offices, which are listed in telephone directories.
              (b) A person who enters into a compliance agreement, and employees or agents of that person, must comply with the following conditions and any supplemental conditions which are listed in the compliance agreement, as deemed by the Administrator to be necessary to prevent the dissemination into or within the United States of plant pests and livestock or poultry diseases:
              (1) Comply with all applicable provisions of this subpart;

              (2) Allow inspectors access to all records maintained by the person regarding handling or disposal of garbage, and to all areas where handling or disposal of garbage occurs;
              
              (3)(i) If the garbage is regulated under § 330.401, remove garbage from a means of conveyance only in tight, covered, leak-proof receptacles;
              (ii) If the garbage is regulated under § 330.402, transport garbage interstate in packaging approved by the Administrator;
              (4) Move the garbage only to a facility approved by the Administrator; and
              (5) At the approved facility, dispose of the garbage in a manner approved by the Administrator and described in the compliance agreement.
              (c) Approval for a compliance agreement may be denied at any time if the Administrator determines that the applicant has not met or is unable to meet the requirements set forth in this subpart. Prior to denying any application for a compliance agreement, APHIS will provide notice to the applicant thereof, and will provide the applicant with an opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with requirements.
              (d) Any compliance agreement may be canceled, either orally or in writing, by an inspector whenever the inspector finds that the person who has entered into the compliance agreement has failed to comply with this subpart. If the cancellation is oral, the cancellation and the reasons for the cancellation will be confirmed in writing as promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose compliance agreement has been canceled may appeal the decision, in writing, within 10 days after receiving written notification of the cancellation. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the compliance agreement was wrongfully canceled. As promptly as circumstances allow, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision. A hearing will be held to resolve any conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice concerning a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator. This administrative remedy must be exhausted before a person can file suit in court challenging the cancellation of a compliance agreement.
              (e) Where a compliance agreement is denied or canceled, the person who entered into or applied for the compliance agreement may be prohibited, at the discretion of the Administrator, from handling or disposing of regulated garbage.

Surrogate strains that are known to possess equivalent properties with respect to inactivation can be used to validate an inactivation procedure; however, if there are known strain-to-strain variations in the resistance of a select agent to an inactivation procedure, then an inactivation procedure validated on a lesser resistant strain must also be validated on the more resistant strains.
            (5) Material containing a select agent that is subjected to a procedure that removes all viable select agent cells, spores, or virus particles if the material is subjected to a viability testing protocol to ensure that the removal method has rendered the material free of all viable select agent.
            (6) A select agent or regulated nucleic acids that can produce infectious forms of any select agent virus not subjected to a validated inactivation procedure or material containing a select agent not subjected to a procedure that removes all viable select agent cells, spores, or virus particles if the material is determined by the Administrator to be effectively inactivated or effectively removed. To apply for a determination an individual or entity must submit a written request and supporting scientific information to APHIS. A written decision granting or denying the request will be issued.
            (7) A PPQ select toxin identified in an original food sample or clinical sample.
            (8) Waste generated during the delivery of patient care by health care professionals from a patient diagnosed with an illness or condition associated with a select agent, where that waste is decontaminated or transferred for destruction by complying with State and Federal regulations within 7 calendar days of the conclusion of patient care.
            (9) Any subspecies of Ralstonia solanacearum except race 3, biovar 2 and all subspecies of Sclerophthora rayssiae except var. zeae, provided that the individual or entity can identify that the agent is within the exclusion category.
            (e) An attenuated strain of a select agent or a select toxin modified to be less potent or toxic may be excluded from the requirements of this part based upon a determination by the Administrator that the attenuated strain or modified toxin does not pose a severe threat to plant health or plant products.

            (1) To apply for exclusion, an individual or entity must submit a written request and supporting scientific information. A written decision granting or denying the request will be issued. An exclusion will be effective upon notification to the applicant. Exclusions will be listed on the National Select Agent Registry Web site at http://www.selectagents.gov/.
            
            (2) If an excluded attenuated strain or modified toxin is subjected to any manipulation that restores or enhances its virulence or toxic activity, the resulting select agent or toxin will be subject to the requirements of this part.
            (3) An individual or entity may make a written request to the Administrator for reconsideration of a decision denying an application for the exclusion of an attenuated strain of a select agent or a select toxin modified to be less potent or toxic. The written request for reconsideration must state the facts and reasoning upon which the individual or entity relies to show the decision was incorrect. The Administrator will grant or deny the request for reconsideration as promptly as circumstances allow and will state, in writing, the reasons for the decision.

            § 340.0
            Restrictions on the introduction of regulated articles.
            (a) No person shall introduce any regulated article unless the Administrator is:
            (1) Notified of the introduction in accordance with § 340.3, or such introduction is authorized by permit in accordance with § 340.4, or such introduction is conditionally exempt from permit requirements under § 340.2(b); and
            (2) Such introduction is in conformity with all other applicable restrictions in this part. 1
              
            
            
              
                1 Part 340 regulates, among other things, the introduction of organisms and products altered or produced through genetic engineering that are plant pests or are believed to be plant pests. The introduction into the United States of such articles also may be subject to other regulations promulgated under the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7701-7772) and found in 7 CFR parts 319, 330, and 360. For example, under regulations promulgated in “Subpart- Plants for Planting” (7 CFR 319.37-5 of this chapter), a permit is required for the importation of certain classes of plants for planting whether such plants are genetically engineered or not. Accordingly, individuals should refer to those regulations before importing any plants for planting.
            
            (b) Any regulated article introduced not in compliance with the requirements of this part shall be subject to the immediate application of such remedial measures or safeguards as an inspector determines necessary to prevent the introduction of such plant pests. 2
              
            
            
              
                2 An inspector may hold, seize, quarantine, treat, apply other remedial measures to, destroy, or otherwise dispose of plants, plant pests, or other articles in accordance with sections 411, 412, 421, and 434 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7711, 7712, 7731, and 7754).

            § 340.2
            Groups of organisms which are or contain plant pests and exemptions.
            (a) Groups of organisms which are or contain plant pests. The organisms that are or contain plant pests are included in the taxa or group of organisms contained in the following list. Within any taxonomic series included on the list, the lowest unit of classification actually listed is the taxon or group which may contain organisms which are regulated. Organisms belonging to all lower taxa contained within the group listed are included as organisms that may be or may contain plant pests, and are regulated if they meet the definition of plant pest in § 340.1 4
              
            
            
              
                4 Any organism belonging to any taxa contained within any listed genera or taxa is only considered to be a plant pest if the organism “can directly or indirectly injure, or cause disease, or damage in any plants or parts thereof, or any processed, manufactured, or other products of plants.” Thus a particular unlisted species within a listed genus would be deemed a plant pest for purposes of § 340.2, if the scientific literature refers to the organism as a cause of direct or indirect injury, disease, or damage to any plants, plant parts or products of plants. (If there is any question concerning the plant pest status of an organism belonging to any listed genera or taxa, the person proposing to introduce the organism in question should consult with APHIS to determine if the organism is subject to regulation.)
            
            
            
              Note:
              Any genetically engineered organism composed of DNA or RNA sequences, organelles, plasmids, parts, copies, and/or analogs, of or from any of the groups of organisms listed below shall be deemed a regulated article if it also meets the definition of plant pest in § 340.1.

            Notification for the introduction of certain regulated articles. 5
              
            
            
              
                5 APHIS may issue guidelines regarding scientific procedures, practices, or protocols which it has found acceptable in making various determinations under the regulations. A person may follow an APHIS guideline or follow different procedures, practices, or protocols. When different procedures, practices, or protocols are followed, a person may, but is not required to, discuss the matter in advance with APHIS to help ensure that the procedures, practices, or protocols to be followed will be acceptable to APHIS.
            
            (a) General. Certain regulated articles may be introduced without a permit, provided that the introduction is in compliance with the requirements of this section. Any other introduction of regulated articles require a permit under § 340.4, with the exception of introductions that are conditionally exempt from permit requirements under § 340.2(b) of this part.
            (b) Regulated articles eligible for introduction under the notification procedure. Regulated articles which meet all of the following six requirements and the performance standards set forth in paragraph (c) of this section are eligible for introduction under the notification procedure.
            (1) The regulated article is any plant species that is not listed as a noxious weed in regulations at 7 CFR part 360 under the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7712), and, when being considered for release into the environment, the regulated article is not considered by the Administrator to be a weed in the area of release into the environment.
            (2) The introduced genetic material is “stably integrated” in the plant genome, as defined in § 340.1.
            (3) The function of the introduced genetic material is known and its expression in the regulated article does not result in plant disease.
            (4) The introduced genetic material does not:
            (i) Cause the production of an infectious entity, or
            (ii) Encode substances that are known or likely to be toxic to nontarget organisms known or likely to feed or live on the plant species, or
            (iii) Encode products intended for pharmaceutical or industrial use.
            (5) To ensure that the introduced genetic sequences do not pose a significant risk of the creation of any new plant virus, plant virus-derived sequences must be:
            (i) Noncoding regulatory sequences of known function, or
            (ii) Sense or antisense genetic constructs derived from viral genes from plant viruses that are prevalent and endemic in the area where the introduction will occur and that infect plants of the same host species, and that do not encode a functional noncapsid gene product responsible for cell-to-cell movement of the virus.
            (6) The plant has not been modified to contain the following genetic material from animal or human pathogens:
            (i) Any nucleic acid sequence derived from an animal or human virus, or
            (ii) Coding sequences whose products are known or likely causal agents of disease in animals or humans.
            (c) Performance standards for introductions under the notification procedure. The following performance standards must be met for any introductions under the notification procedure.
            (1) If the plants or plant materials are shipped, they must be shipped in such a way that the viable plant material is unlikely to be disseminated while in transit and must be maintained at the destination facility in such a way that there is no release into the environment.
            (2) When the introduction is an environmental release, the regulated article must be planted in such a way that they are not inadvertently mixed with non-regulated plant materials of any species which are not part of the environmental release.
            (3) The plants and plant parts must be maintained in such a way that the identity of all material is known while it is in use, and the plant parts must be contained or devitalized when no longer in use.
            (4) There must be no viable vector agent associated with the regulated article.
            (5) The field trial must be conducted such that:
            (i) The regulated article will not persist in the environment, and
            (ii) No offspring can be produced that could persist in the environment.
            (6) Upon termination of the field test:
            (i) No viable material shall remain which is likely to volunteer in subsequent seasons, or
            (ii) Volunteers shall be managed to prevent persistence in the environment.
            (d) Procedural requirements for notifying APHIS. The following procedures shall be followed for any introductions under the notification procedure:
            (1) Notification should be directed to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Biotechnology and Scientific Services, Biotechnology Permits, 4700 River Road, Unit 147, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1237.
            (2) The notification shall include the following:
            (i) Name, title, address, telephone number, and signature of the responsible person;

            (ii) Information necessary to identify the regulated article(s), including:
            
            (A) The scientific, common, or trade names, and phenotype of regulated article,
            (B) The designations for the genetic loci, the encoded proteins or functions, and donor organisms for all genes from which introduced genetic material was derived, and
            (C) The method by which the recipient was transformed;
            (iii) The names and locations of the origination and destination facilities for movement or the field site location for the environmental release; and the size of the introduction,
            (iv) The date and, in the case of environmental release, the expected duration of the introduction (release); and
            (v) A statement that certifies that introduction of the regulated article will be in accordance with the provisions of this section.
            (3) Notification must be submitted to APHIS:
            (i) At least 10 days prior to the day of introduction, if the introduction is interstate movement.
            (ii) At least 30 days prior to the day of introduction, if the introduction is an importation.
            (iii) At least 30 days prior to the day of introduction, if the introduction is an environmental release.
            (4) Field test reports must be submitted to APHIS within 6 months after termination of the field test. Field test reports shall include the APHIS reference number, methods of observation, resulting data, and analysis regarding all deleterious effects on plants, nontarget organisms, or the environment.
            (5) The Administrator, shall be notified of any unusual occurrence within the time periods and in the manner specified in § 340.4(f)(10).
            (6) Access shall be allowed for APHIS and State regulatory officials to inspect facilities and/or the field test site and any records necessary to evaluate compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
            (e) Administrative action in response to notification. (1) APHIS will provide copies of all notifications to appropriate State regulatory official(s) for review within 5 business days of receipt. Comments to APHIS from appropriate State regulatory officials in response to notifications for interstate movement of regulated articles will not be required by APHIS prior to acknowledgment, although States may provide their reviews to APHIS at their discretion.
            (2) The Administrator, will provide acknowledgement within 10 days of receipt that the interstate movement is appropriate under notification.
            (3) The Administrator, will provide acknowledgement within 30 days of receipt that the importation is appropriate under notification.
            (4) APHIS will provide acknowledgment within 30 days of receipt that the environmental release is appropriate under notification. Such acknowledgment will apply to field testing for 1 year from the date of introduction, and may be renewed annually by submission of an additional notification to APHIS.
            (5) A person denied permission for introduction of a regulated article under notification may apply for a permit for introduction of that regulated article without prejudice.

            (e) Extensions to determinations of nonregulated status. (1) The Administrator may determine that a regulated article does not pose a potential for plant pest risk, and should therefore not be regulated under this part, based on the similarity of that organism to an antecedent organism.
            (2) A person may request that APHIS extend a determination of nonregulated status to other organisms. Such a request shall include information to establish the similarity of the antecedent organism and the regulated articles in question.
            (3) APHIS will announce in the Federal Register all preliminary decisions to extend determinations of nonregulated status 30 days before the decisions become final and effective. If additional information becomes available that APHIS believes justifies changing its decision, it will issue a revised decision.
            (4) If a request to APHIS to extend a determination of nonregulated status under this part is denied, APHIS will inform the submitter of that request of the reasons for denial. The submitter may submit a modified request or a separate petition for determination of nonregulated status without prejudice.
            (f) Denial of a petition; appeal. (1) The Administrator's written notification of denial of a petition shall briefly set forth the reason for such denial. The written notification shall be sent by certified mail. Any person whose petition has been denied may appeal the determination in writing to the Administrator within 10 days from receipt of the written notification of denial.
            (2) The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies, including any new information, to show that the petition was wrongfully denied. The Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision as promptly as circumstances allow. An informal hearing may be held by the Administrator if there is a dispute of a material fact. Rules of Practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.

            § 340.8
            Container requirements for the movement of regulated articles.
            (a) General requirements. A regulated article shall not be moved unless it complies with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, unless a variance has been granted in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. 12
              
            
            
              
                12 The requirements of this section are in addition to and not in lieu of any other packing requirements such as those for the transportation of etiologic agents prescribed by the Department of Transportation in Title 49 CFR or any other agency of the Federal government.
            
            (b) Container requirements—(1) Plants and plant parts. All plants or plant parts, except seeds, cells, and subcellular elements, shall be packed in a sealed plastic bag of at least 5 mil thickness, inside a sturdy, sealed, leak-proof, outer shipping container constructed of corrugated fiberboard, corrogated cardboard, wood, or other material of equivalent strength.
            (2) Seeds. All seeds shall be transported in a sealed plastic bag of at least 5 mil thickness, inside a sealed metal container, which shall be placed inside a second sealed metal container. Shock absorbing cushioning material shall be placed between the inner and outer metal containers. Each metal container shall be independently capable of protecting the seeds and preventing spillage or escape. Each set of metal containers shall then be enclosed in a sturdy outer shipping container constructed of corrugated fiberboard, corrugated cardboard, wood, or other material of equivalent strength.
            (3) Live microorganisms and/or etiologic agents, cells, or subcellular elements. All regulated articles which are live (non-inactivated) microorganisms, or etiologic agents, cells, or subcellular elements shall be packed as specified below:
            (i) Volume not exceeding 50 ml. Regulated articles not exceeding 50 ml shall be placed in a securely closed, watertight container (primary container, test tube, vial, etc.) which shall be enclosed in a second, durable watertight container (secondary container). Several primary containers may be enclosed in a single secondary container, if the total volume of all the primary containers so enclosed does not exceed 50 ml. The space at the top, bottom, and sides between the primary and secondary containers shall contain sufficient nonparticulate absorbent material (e.g., paper towel) to absorb the entire contents of the primary container(s) in case of breakage or leakage. Each set of primary and secondary containers shall then be enclosed in an outer shipping container constructed of corrugated fiberboard, corrugated cardboard, wood, or other material of equivalent strength.
            (ii) Volume greater than 50 ml. Regulated articles which exceed a volume of 50 ml. shall comply with requirements specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. In addition, a shock absorbing material, in volume at least equal to that of the absorbent material between the primary and secondary containers, shall be placed at the top, bottom, and sides between the secondary container and the outer shipping container. Single primary containers shall not contain more than 1,000 ml. of material. However, two or more primary containers whose combined volumes do not exceed 1,000 ml. may be placed in a single, secondary container. The maximum amount of micro-organisms or etiologic agents, cells, or subcellular elements which may be enclosed within a single outer shipping container shall not exceed 4,000 ml.
            (iii) Dry ice. If dry ice is used as a refrigerant, it shall be placed outside the secondary container(s). If dry ice is used between the secondary container and the outer shipping container, the shock absorbing material shall be placed so that the secondary container does not become loose inside the outer shipping container as the dry ice sublimates.
            (4) Insects, mites, and related organisms. Insects, mites, and other small arthropods shall be packed for shipment as specified in this paragraph or in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Insects (any life stage) shall be placed in an escape-proof primary shipping container (insulated vacuum container, glass, metal, plastic, etc.) and sealed to prevent escape. Such primary container shall be placed securely within a secondary shipping container of crushproof styrofoam or other material of equivalent strength; one or more rigid ice packs may also be placed within the secondary shipping container; and sufficient packing material shall be added around the primary container to prevent movement of the primary shipping container. The secondary (styrofoam or other) container shall be placed securely within an outer shipping container constructed of corrugated fiberboard, corrugated cardboard, wood, or other material of equivalent strength.
            (5) Other macroscopic organisms. Other macroscopic organisms not covered in paragraphs (b) (1), (2), and (4) of this section which do not require continuous access to atmospheric oxygen shall be packaged as specified in paragraph (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section. All macroscopic organisms which are not plants and which require continuous access to atmospheric oxygen shall be placed in primary shipping containers constructed of a sturdy, crush-proof frame of wood, metal, or equivalent strength material, surrounded by escape-proof mesh or netting of a strength and mesh size sufficient to prevent the escape of the smallest organism in the shipment, with edges and seams of the mesh or netting sealed to prevent escape of organisms. Each primary shipping container shall be securely placed within a larger secondary shipping container constructed of wood, metal, or equivalent strength material. The primary and secondary shipping containers shall then be placed securely within an outer shipping container constructed of corrugated fiberboard, corrugated cardboard, wood, or other material of equivalent strength, which outer container may have air holes or spaces in the sides and/or ends of the container, provided that the outer shipping container must retain sufficient strength to prevent crushing of the primary and secondary shipping containers.
            (c) Request for a variance from container requirements. A responsible person who believes the container requirements normally applicable to the movement of the person's regulated article(s) are inappropriate due to unique circumstances (such as the nature, volume, or life stage of the regulated article) may submit in an application for a permit, a request for a variance from the container requirements. The request for a variance under this section shall consist of a short statement describing why the normally applicable container requirements are inappropriate for the regulated article which the person proposes to move and what container requirements the person would use in lieu of the normally prescribed container requirements. USDA shall advise the responsible person in writing at the time a permit is granted on the person's request for a variance.

            Where the plant quarantine inspector requires the entire shipment to be returned to the country of origin as a prohibited importation (in which event he shall endorse his action thereon) and delivers the shipment to the collector of customs, the collector shall in turn deliver it to the postmaster for dispatch to the country of origin. If, upon examination, the plant material is deemed dangerous to plant life, the collector of customs shall permit the plant quarantine inspector to destroy immediately both the container and its contents. In either case the plant quarantine inspector shall notify the addressee of the action taken and the reason therefor. If the objectionable plant material forms only a portion of the contents of the mail package and in the judgment of the inspector the package can safely be delivered to the addressee, after removing and destroying the objectionable material, such procedure is authorized. In the latter case the inspector shall place in the package a memorandum (Form AQI-387) informing the addressee of the action taken by the inspector and describing the matter which has been seized and destroyed and the reasons therefor.

            To collectors of customs and others concerned:
            (a) Shipments of plant material may be imported by mail free of duty for immediate exportation by mail subject to the following regulations, which have been approved by the Department of Agriculture and the Post Office Department:
            (1) Each shipment shall be dispatched in the mails from abroad, accompanied by a yellow and green special mail tag bearing the serial number of the permit for entry for immediate exportation or immediate transportation and exportation, issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and also the postal form of customs declaration.
            (2) Upon arrival, the shipment shall be detained by, or redispatched to, the postmaster at Washington, DC, Brownsville, Tex., Hoboken, N.J., Honolulu, Hawaii, Jamaica, L.I., N.Y., Laredo, Tex., Miami, Fla., New Orleans, La., San Francisco, Calif., San Juan, P.R., San Pedro, Calif., or Seattle, Wash., as may be appropriate, according to the address on the yellow and green tag, and there submitted to the customs officer and the Federal quarantine inspector. The merchandise shall under no circumstances be permitted to enter the commerce of the United States.
            (3) After inspection by the customs and quarantine officers, and with their approval, the addressee, or his authorized agent, shall repack and readdress the mail parcel under customs supervision; affix to the parcel the necessary postage, and comply with other mailing requirements, after which the parcel shall be delivered to the postmaster for exportation by mail pursuant to 19 CFR 9.11(a). The contents of the original parcel may be subdivided and exported in separate parcels in like manner.
            (4) It will not be necessary to issue a customs mail entry nor to require formal entry of the shipments.
            (5) The mail shipments referred to shall be accorded special handling only at the points specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
            (6) The foregoing procedure shall not affect the movement of plant material in the international mails in transit through the United States.

            Purpose; relation to other regulations; applicability; preemption of State and local laws.

            (a) Importations of plants, plant products, plant pests, noxious weeds, soil, and other products and articles that may be infested or infected by or contain plant pests or noxious weeds are exempt from the prohibitions or restrictions contained in parts 319, 330, and 360 of this chapter if they meet one of the conditions in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section and are moved into the United States and handled in compliance with this part. Provided: That these exemptions do not apply to cotton and covers imported into the United States from any country for exportation or transshipment and exportation or transportation and exportation as provided in §§ 319.8 through 319.8-26 of this chapter. Moreover, the applicable provisions of §§ 330.100 through 330.109 and 330.400 of this chapter also apply to products and articles subject to this part.
            (1) They are brought in temporarily where loading and landing is not intended;
            (2) They are unloaded or landed for transshipment and exportation;
            (3) They are unloaded or landed for transportation and exportation; or
            (4) They are intended for unloading and entry at a port other than the port of arrival.
            (b) Prohibited or restricted products and articles offered for and refused entry into the United States under parts 319, 330, or 360 of this chapter are subject to the applicable provisions in this part regarding their subsequent handling in this country.

            (c)(1) The provisions in this part apply whether the controls over arrival, temporary stay, unloading, landing, transshipment and exportation, or transportation and exportation, or other movement or possession in the United States and Guam are maintained by entry or other procedures of the U.S. Customs Service, Department of the Treasury, or the Customs Office of the Government of Guam, respectively. Such provisions will apply to arrivals in the United States, including arrivals in a foreign trade zone in the United States to which admission is sought in accordance with the Customs regulations in 19 CFR chapter I. Prohibited or restricted products and articles that have entered the United States, been exported pursuant to this part, and returned to the United States are subject to the applicable requirements of this part upon reentry.
            (2) Any restrictions and requirements under this part with respect to the arrival, temporary stay, unloading, landing, transshipment, exportation, transportation and exportation, or other movement or possession in the United States of any product or article shall apply to any person who, respectively, brings into, maintains, unloads, lands, transships, exports, transports and exports, or otherwise moves or possesses in the United States such product or article, whether he is the person who was required to have a permit for the product or article or a subsequent custodian of such product or article, and failure to comply with all applicable restrictions and requirements under this part by any such person shall be deemed to be a violation of this part.
            (d) Under section 436 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7756), a State or political subdivision of a State may not regulate in foreign commerce any article, means of conveyance, plant, biological control organism, plant pest, noxious weed, or plant product in order to control a plant pest or noxious weed, to eradicate a plant pest or noxious weed, or to prevent the introduction or dissemination of a biological control organism, plant pest, or noxious weed.

            § 352.3
            Enforcement and administration.
            (a) Plants, plant products, plant pests, noxious weeds, soil, and other products and articles subject to the regulations in this part that are unloaded, landed, or otherwise brought or moved into or through the United States in violation of this part may be seized, destroyed, or otherwise disposed of in accordance with section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714). Any person who unloads, lands, or otherwise brings or moves into or through the United States any regulated plants, plant products, plant pests, noxious weeds, soil, or other products or articles in violation of this part will be subject to prosecution under the applicable provisions of law.
            (b) Whenever the Deputy Administrator of the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs shall find that existing conditions of danger of plant pest escape or dissemination involved in the arrival, unloading, landing, or other movement, or possession in the United States of plants, plant products, plant pests, noxious weeds, soil, or other products or articles subject to the regulations in this part, make it safe to modify by making less stringent the restrictions contained in any such regulation, he shall publish such findings in administrative instructions, specifying the manner in which the regulations shall be made less stringent with respect thereto, whereupon such modification shall become effective; or he may, upon request in specific cases, when the public interests will permit, authorize arrival, unloading, landing, or other movement, or possession in the United States under conditions that are less stringent than those contained in the regulations in this part.
            (c) The Deputy Administrator also may set forth and publish, in administrative instructions, requirements and conditions for any class of products or articles supplemental to the regulations in this part, and may promulgate interpretations of this part.
            (d) The Deputy Administrator shall employ procedures to carry out the purposes of this part which will impose a minimum of impediment to foreign commerce, consistent with proper precaution against plant pest or noxious weed dissemination.

            § 352.4
            Documentation.
            (a) Manifest. Immediately upon the arrival of a carrier in the United States the owner shall make available to the inspector for examination a complete manifest or other documentation from which the inspector may determine whether there are on board any prohibited or restricted products or articles subject to this part, other than accompanied baggage and mail.
            
            (b) Other documentation. Any notifications, reports, and similar documentation not specified in the regulations in this part, but necessary to carry out the purpose of the regulations, will be prescribed in administrative instructions.
            (c) Procedure after examination of documents. After examination of the carrier cargo manifest or other documentation the inspector may notify the owner and the Customs officer that certain products or articles on board the carrier are subject to this part and may not be unloaded or landed for any purpose pending plant quarantine inspection. In such case the owner shall not unload or land such products or articles without authorization by an inspector.
          
          
            § 352.5
            Permit; requirement, form and conditions.
            (a) General. (1) Permits are required for the arrival, unloading or landing, or other movement into or through the United States of plants, plant products, plant pests, noxious weeds, and soil subject to this part. The permit may consist of a general authorization as set out in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section or § 352.11, or it may be a specific permit. A specific permit may be formal or oral except as a formal permit is required by paragraph (c) or (e) of this section. The Deputy Administrator may in administrative instructions require specific or formal permits for any class of products or articles subject to this part.
            (2) A formal permit may be issued in prescribed form, in letter form, or a combination thereof. A rubber stamp impression or other endorsement made by the inspector on pertinent Customs documents covering the products or articles involved may constitute the formal permit in appropriate cases.
            (b) Permit for prohibited or restricted products or articles brought in for temporary stay where unloading or landing in the United States is not intended. No permit other than the authorization contained in this paragraph shall be required for bringing into the United States any plants, plant products, plant pests, noxious weeds, or soil subject to this part for temporary stay where unloading or landing in the United States is not intended, e.g., in connection with residue cargo movement under Customs procedure, or in connection with Customs entry for exportation or for transportation and exportation. This authorization also includes transshipment of products and articles under this paragraph from a carrier directly to another carrier of the same company when necessitated by an emergency or operating requirement and effected in accordance with safeguards prescribed in writing or orally by the inspector under § 352.10.
            (c) Permit for prohibited or restricted products or articles unloaded or landed for immediate transshipment and exportation, or immediate transportation and exportation. When in the opinion of the inspector it is unnecessary to specify in a formal permit the safeguards required to prevent plant pest dissemination, plants, plant products, plant pests, noxious weeds, or soil subject to this part may be unloaded or landed for immediate transshipment and exportation or for immediate transportation and exportation, as provided in § 352.10, with the approval of the inspector and no further permit than the authorization contained in this paragraph; otherwise a formal permit shall be required for such unloading or landing.
            (d) Permit for restricted products or articles moving as residue cargo from port of first arrival to port of entry. Restricted plants, plant products, plant pests, noxious weeds, or soil subject to this part arriving in the United States for movement under residue cargo procedures of Customs from a port of first arrival to another port for Customs entry into the United States may be allowed to so move without permit other than the authorization contained in this paragraph, if the inspector finds that apparently they can meet the applicable requirements of parts 319, 330, and 360 of this chapter at the port where entry is to be made; otherwise a formal permit shall be required for such movement. Such restricted products and articles shall become subject to the applicable permit and other requirements of parts 319, 330, and 360 of this chapter upon arrival at the port where Customs entry is to be made and shall not be unloaded or landed unless they comply with the applicable requirements.
            (e) Formal permits required for certain prohibited or restricted products or articles brought into a foreign trade zone. A formal permit must be obtained to bring any prohibited or restricted plants, plant products, plant pests, noxious weeds, or soil subject to the provisions in this part, into a foreign trade zone for storage, manipulation, or other handling, except for immediate transshipment and exportation or for immediate transportation and exportation. Special conditions to safeguard such storage, manipulation, or other possession or handling may be specified in the permit, and when so specified shall be in addition to any other applicable requirements of this part or the safeguards prescribed by the inspector or otherwise under this part.

            (a) Plants and plant products (including noxious weeds). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, any person desiring to unload or land, or otherwise move into or through the United States, any plants or plant products for which a specific permit is required by § 352.5, shall in the case of prohibited plants or plant products, and should in the case of restricted plants or plant products, in advance of arrival in the United States of the plants or plant products, submit an application for a permit to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, 1

               stating such of the following information as is relevant: The name and address of the importer, the approximate quantity and kind of plants and plant products it is desired to import under this part, the country where grown, the United States port of arrival, the United States port of export, the proposed routing from the port of arrival to the port of exportation, means of transportation to be employed (i.e., mail, air mail, express, air express, freight, air freight, baggage), and the name and address of the agent representing the importer. Applications may be made on forms provided for the purpose by the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, or orally, or by letter, telegram, or other means of communication furnishing all the information required by this paragraph. Applications need not be made for shipments handled under general authorizations set forth in § 352.5 (b), (c), or (d), or in § 352.11.
            
              
                1 Application for such permits should be addressed to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Port Operations, Permit Unit, 4700 River Road, Unit 136, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1236.
            
            (b) Plant pests. Any person desiring to unload or land, or otherwise move into or through the United States, any plant pest for which a specific permit is required by § 352.5 shall, in advance of the arrival of the plant pests in the United States, submit an application to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs 2
               for a permit as specified by § 330.201 of this chapter.
            
              
                2 Application for permits should be made to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250.
            
            (c) Soil. Any person desiring to bring into or unload or land, or otherwise move into or through the United States, any soil for which a specific permit is required by § 352.5 shall, in advance of the arrival of the soil in the United States, submit an application for permit to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs 2 as specified by § 330.300(b) of this chapter.
            (d) Constructive oral application. If a permit has not been issued in advance of arrival, application for any required permit (other than a formal permit) shall be considered to have been made orally to the inspector at the port of arrival by presentation of the shipment for entry or its listing on the manifest or other documentation, but this shall not excuse failure to make timely application as required by this section. Express application is required for a formal permit.
            (e) Approval or denial of permits. Upon approval of the application, the permit will be issued. Any conditions necessary to eliminate danger of plant pest or noxious weed dissemination may be specified in the permit, or otherwise as provided in § 352.10. Permits will be denied if, in the opinion of the Deputy Administrator, it is not possible to prescribe conditions adequate to prevent danger of plant pest or noxious weed dissemination by the plants, plant products, plant pests, or soil involved.

            (a) Inspection and release. Prohibited and restricted products and articles subject to this part shall be subject to inspection at the port of first arrival in accordance with § 330.105(a) of this chapter and shall not be released by Customs officers for unloading, landing, or other onward movement or entry until released by an inspector or a Customs officer on behalf of an inspector in accordance with the procedure prescribed in § 330.105(a) of this chapter. If diversion or change of Customs entry is not permitted for any movements authorized under this part, the inspector at the original port of Customs entry shall appropriately endorse Customs documents to show that fact. However, the inspector at the U.S. port of export may approve diversion or change of Customs entry to permit movement to a different foreign country, or entry into the United States, subject to all other applicable requirements under this part or parts 319, 330, or 360 of this chapter. If diversion or change of Customs entry is desired at a Customs port in the United States where there is no inspector, the owner may apply to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs 3

               for information as to applicable conditions. If diversion or change of Customs entry is desired at port, confirmation will be given by the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs to the appropriate Customs officers and Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs inspectors.

            (b) Safeguards. (1) The unloading, landing, retention on board as stores and furnishings or cargo, transshipment and exportation, transportation and exportation, onward movment to the port of entry as residue cargo or under a Customs entry for immediate transportation, and other movement or possession within the United States of prohibited or restricted products and articles under this part shall be subject to such safeguards as may be prescribed in the permits and this part and any others which, in the opinion of the inspector, are necessary and are specified by him to prevent plant pest or noxious weed dissemination. In the case of prohibited or restricted products or articles subject to this part which are unloaded or landed for transshipment and exportation or transportation and exportation, or for onward movement to the port of entry as residue cargo or under a Customs entry for immediate transportation, this shall include necessary safeguards with respect to any movement within the port area between the point of arrival and the point of temporary storage, other handling, or point of departure, including a foreign trade zone. Prohibited and restricted products and articles subject to this part which are unloaded or landed for transshipment and exportation or transportation and exportation, or for onward movement as residue cargo or under a Customs entry for immediate transportation, shall be transshipped, or transported and exported from the United States, or moved onward immediately. This shall mean the shortest practicable interval of time commensurate with the risk of plant pest or noxious weed dissemination required to transfer the products or articles from one carrier to another and to move them onward or from the United States. If, in the opinion of the inspector, considerations of risk of plant pest or noxious weed dissemination require, such movement shall be made without regard to the noncompetitive or competitive relations of the carriers concerned, and the inspector shall promptly report to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs the circumstances when the emergency is so acute that subsequent movement is required on a carrier of a company other than the one bringing the products or articles to the United States or on which onward movement was contemplated by the shipper or forwarding carrier. Prohibited or restricted plants, plant products, plant pests, and soil which were intended for entry into the United States under parts 319, 330, or 360 of this chapter, or for movement into or through the United States under this part, and which were refused such entry or movement before unloading or landing, or which were refused such entry or movement after unloading or landing and are immediately reloaded on the same carrier, may be retained on board pending removal from the United States or other disposal, but shall be subject to the safeguards specified under this section. Prohibited or restricted products and articles which were refused entry or movement under said parts after unloading or landing and which are not immediately reloaded in accordance with this section shall be subject to such safeguard action as the inspector deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this part.

            (2) Safeguards prescribed by an inspector under this section shall be prescribed to the owner by the inspector in writing except that the inspector may prescribe the safeguards orally when, in his opinion, the circumstances and related Customs procedures do not require written notice to the owner of the safeguards to be followed by the owner. In prescribing safeguards, the relevant requirements of parts 319, 330, or 360 of this chapter and this part shall be considered. The safeguards prescribed shall be the minimum required to prevent plant pest or noxious weed dissemination. Destruction or exportation shall be required only when no less drastic measures are deemed by the inspector to be adequate to prevent plant pest or noxious weed dissemination. The inspector may follow administrative instructions promulgated for certain situations, or he may follow a procedure selected by him from administratively approved methods known to be effective in similar situations. In the case of aircraft that are contaminated with insect pests, only an insecticidal formulation, approved for use in aircraft, may be so applied as an emergency measure. If the application is not effective against the insect pests or if other pests must be safeguarded against, the inspector shall report the circumstances promptly to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs and receive instructions as to safeguards that will not have a deleterious effect on the structure of the aircraft or its operating equipment. In prescribing safeguards consideration will be given to such factors as:
            (i) The nature and habits of the plant pests known to be, or likely to be, present with the plants, plant products, soil, or other products or articles.
            (ii) Nature of the plants, plant products, plant pests, soil, or other products or articles.
            (iii) Nature of containers or other packaging and adequacy thereof to prevent plant pest or noxious weed dissemination.
            (iv) Climatic conditions as they may have a bearing on plant pest dispersal, and refrigeration if provided.
            (v) Routing pending exportation.
            (vi) Presence of soil.
            (vii) Construction or physical condition and type of carrier.
            (viii) Facilities for treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter, or for incineration or other destruction.
            (ix) Availability of transportation facilities for immediate exportation.
            (x) Any other related factor which should be considered, such as intent to export to an adjacent or nearby country.
            (c) Disposal. (1) If prohibited or restricted products or articles subject to this part are not safeguarded in accordance with measures prescribed under this part, or cannot be adequately safeguarded to prevent plant pest or noxious weed dissemination, they shall be seized, destroyed, or otherwise disposed of according to law. Whenever disposal action is to be taken by the inspector he shall notify the local Customs officer in advance.
            (2) When a shipment of any products or articles subject to this part has been handled in accordance with all conditions and safeguards prescribed in this part and in the permit and by the inspector, the inspector shall inform the local Customs officer concerned of the release of such products or articles, in appropriate manner.

Notice of arrival shall not be required as other documentation meets the requirement for this notice.
            (2) Inspectors ordinarily will not inspect transit mail or parcel post, whether transmitted in open mail or in closed dispatches. They may do so if it comes to their attention that any such mail or parcel post contains prohibited or restricted products or articles which require safeguard action. Inspection and disposal in such cases will be made in accordance with this part and part 330 of this chapter, and in conformity with regulations and procedures of the Post Office Department for handling transit mail and parcel post.

            Purpose and administration.
            The export certification program does not require certification of any exports, but does provide certification of plants and plant products as a service to exporters. After assessing the phytosanitary condition of the plants or plant products intended for export, relative to the receiving country's regulations, an inspector issues an internationally recognized phytosanitary certificate, a phytosanitary certificate for reexport, or an export certificate for processed plant products if warranted. APHIS also enters into written agreements with industry to allow the issuance of industry-issued certificates giving assurance that a plant product has been handled, processed, or inspected in a manner required by a foreign government. An industry-issued certificate includes an ISPM 15 quality/treatment mark.

            § 353.8
            Accreditation of non-government facilities.
            (a) The Administrator may accredit a non-government facility to perform specific laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services if the Administrator determines that the non-government facility meets the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section. 1
              
            
            
              
                1 A list of accredited non-government facilities may be obtained by writing to Phytosanitary Issues Management, PPQ, APHIS, 4700 River Road, Unit 140, Riverdale, MD 20737-1236.
            
            (1) A non-government facility's compliance with the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section shall be determined through an assessment of the facility and its fitness to conduct the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which it seeks to be accredited. If, after evaluating the results of the assessment, the Administrator determines that the facility meets the accreditation criteria, the facility's application for accreditation will be approved.
            (2) The Administrator may deny accreditation to, or withdraw the accreditation of, any non-government facility to conduct laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services upon a determination that the facility does not meet the criteria for accreditation or maintenance of accreditation under paragraph (b) of this section and has failed to take the remedial action recommended to correct identified deficiencies.
            (i) In the case of a denial, the operator of the facility will be informed of the reasons for the denial and may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving notification of the denial. The appeal must include all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the facility was wrongfully denied accreditation. The Administrator will grant or deny the appeal in writing as promptly as circumstances permit, stating the reason for his or her decision. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing will be held to resolve the conflict. Rules of practice concerning the hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.

            (ii) In the case of withdrawal, before such action is taken, the operator of the facility will be informed of the reasons for the proposed withdrawal. The operator of the facility may appeal the proposed withdrawal in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after being informed of the reasons for the proposed withdrawal. The appeal must include all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the reasons for the proposed withdrawal are incorrect or do not support the withdrawal of the accreditation of the facility. The Administrator will grant or deny the appeal in writing as promptly as circumstances permit, stating the reason for his or her decision. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing will be held to resolve the conflict. Rules of practice concerning the hearing will be adopted by the Administrator. However, withdrawal shall become effective pending final determination in the proceeding when the Administrator determines that such action is necessary to protect the public health, interest, or safety. Such withdrawal will be effective upon oral or written notification, whichever is earlier, to the operator of the facility. In the event of oral notification, written confirmation will be given as promptly as circumstances allow. This withdrawal will continue in effect pending the completion of the proceeding, and any judicial review thereof, unless otherwise ordered by the Administrator.
            (3) The Administrator will withdraw the accreditation of a non-government facility if the operator of the facility informs APHIS in writing that the facility wishes to terminate its accredited status.
            (4) A non-government facility whose accreditation has been denied or withdrawn may reapply for accreditation using the application procedures in paragraph (b) of this section. If the facility's accreditation was denied or withdrawn under the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the facility operator must include with the application written documentation specifying what actions have been taken to correct the conditions that led to the denial or withdrawal of accreditation.
            (5) All information gathered during the course of a non-government facility's assessment and during the term of its accreditation will be treated by APHIS with the appropriate level of confidentiality, as set forth in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's administrative regulations in § 1.11 of this title.
            (b) Criteria for accreditation of non-government facilities. (1) Specific standards for accreditation in a particular area of laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection are set forth in this part and may be obtained by writing to APHIS. If specific standards for accreditation in a particular area of laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection have not been promulgated by APHIS, and the Administrator determines that accreditation in that area is practical, APHIS will develop appropriate standards applicable to accreditation in the area for which the non-government facility is seeking accreditation and publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register to inform the public and other interested persons of the opportunity to comment on and participate in the development of those standards.
            (2) The operator of a non-government facility seeking accreditation to conduct laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection shall submit an application to the Administrator. The application must be completed and signed by the operator of the facility or his or her authorized representative and must contain the following:
            (i) Legal name and full address of the facility;
            (ii) Name, address, and telephone and fax number of the operator of the facility or his or her authorized representative;
            (iii) A description of the facility, including its physical plant, primary function, scope of operation, and, if applicable, its relationship to a larger corporate entity; and
            (iv) A description of the specific laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which the facility is seeking accreditation.

            (3) Upon receipt of the application, APHIS will review the application to identify the scope of the assessment that will be required to adequately review the facility's fitness to conduct the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which it is seeking accreditation. Before the assessment of the facility begins, the applicant's representative must agree, in writing, to fulfill the accreditation procedure, especially to receive the assessment team, to supply any information needed for the evaluation of the facility, and to enter into a trust fund agreement as provided by paragraph (c) of this section to pay the fees charged to the applicant facility regardless of the result of the assessment and to pay the charges of subsequent maintenance of the accreditation of the facility. Once the agreement has been signed, APHIS will assemble an assessment team and commence the assessment as soon as circumstances permit. The assessment team will measure the facility's fitness to conduct the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which it is seeking accreditation against the specific standards identified by the Administrator for those services by reviewing the facility in the following areas:
            (i) Physical plant. The facility's physical plant (e.g., laboratory space, office space, greenhouses, vehicles, etc.) must meet the criteria identified in the accreditation standards as necessary to properly conduct the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which it seeks accreditation.
            (ii) Equipment. The facility's personnel must possess or have unrestricted access to the equipment (e.g., microscopes, computers, scales, triers, etc.) identified in the accreditation standards as necessary to properly conduct the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which it seeks accreditation. The calibration and monitoring of that equipment must be documented and conform to prescribed standards.
            (iii) Methods of testing or inspection. The facility must have a quality manual or equivalent documentation that describes the system in place at the facility for the conduct of the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which the facility seeks accreditation. The manual must be available to, and in use by, the facility personnel who perform the services. The methods and procedures followed by the facility to conduct the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which it seeks accreditation must be commensurate with those identified in the accreditation standards and must be consistent with or equivalent to recognized international standards for such testing or inspection.
            (iv) Personnel. The management and facility personnel accountable for the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which the facility is seeking accreditation must be identified and must possess the training, education, or experience identified in the accreditation standards as necessary to properly conduct the testing or inspection services for which the facility seeks accreditation, and that training, education, or experience must be documented.
            (4) To retain accreditation, the facility must agree to:
            (i) Observe the specific standards applicable to its area of accreditation;
            (ii) Be assessed and evaluated on a periodic basis by means of proficiency testing or check samples;
            (iii) Demonstrate on request that it is able to perform the tests or inspection services representative of those for which it is accredited;
            (iv) Resolve all identified deficiencies;
            (v) Notify APHIS as soon as possible, but no more than 10 days following its occurrence, of any change in key management personnel or facility staff accountable for the laboratory testing or phytosanitary inspection services for which the facility is accredited; and
            (vi) Report to APHIS as soon as possible, but no more than 10 days following its occurrence, any change involving the location, ownership, physical plant, equipment, or other conditions that existed at the facility at the time accreditation was granted.
            (c) Fees and trust fund agreement. The fees charged by APHIS in connection with the initial accreditation of a non-government facility and the maintenance of that accreditation shall be adequate to recover the costs incurred by the government in the course of APHIS' accreditation activities. To cover those costs, the operator of the facility seeking accreditation must enter into a trust fund agreement with APHIS under which the operator of the facility will pay in advance all estimated costs that APHIS expects to incur through its involvement in the pre-accreditation assessment process and the maintenance of the facility's accreditation. Those costs shall include administrative expenses incurred in those activities, such as laboratory fees for evaluating check test results, and all salaries (including overtime and the Federal share of employee benefits), travel expenses (including per diem expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred by the APHIS in performing those activities. The operator of the facility must deposit a certified or cashier's check with APHIS for the amount of the costs, as estimated by APHIS. If the deposit is not sufficient to meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the operator of the facility must deposit another certified or cashier's check with APHIS for the amount of the remaining costs, as determined by APHIS, before APHIS' services will be completed. After a final audit at the conclusion of the pre-accreditation assessment, any overpayment of funds will be returned to the operator of the facility or held on account until needed for future activities related to the maintenance of the facility's accreditation.

            § 353.9
            Standards for accreditation of non-government facilities to perform laboratory seed health testing and seed crop phytosanitary inspection.
            (a) Application for accreditation, certification of accreditation, and monitoring of accredited facilities. A facility may apply to be accredited to perform laboratory seed health testing or seed crop phytosanitary inspection, or to renew such accreditation, by submitting an application in accordance with § 353.8(b)(2) of this part. If there are portions of the application deemed to contain trade secret or confidential business information (CBI), each page of the application containing such information should be marked “CBI Copy.” The application must be accompanied by a copy of the facility's quality manual and a nonrefundable application fee of $1,000. The applicant must make additional deposits to cover the costs of gaining and maintaining accreditation into a trust fund established in accordance with § 353.8(c) of this part upon request by the Administrator.
            (1) Upon determining that a facility is eligible for accreditation, the Administrator will issue the facility a certificate of accreditation. Accreditation will be for a period of 3 years from the date of issuance of the certificate of accreditation and may be renewed by submitting a new application and application fee in accordance with this paragraph.
            (2) The Administrator may deny or withdraw accreditation in accordance with § 353.8(a)(2) of this part. A facility may appeal denial of accreditation in accordance with § 353.8(a)(2)(i) of this part, and may appeal withdrawal of accreditation in accordance with § 353.8(a)(2)(ii) of this part.
            (3) A facility that has been denied accreditation or had its accreditation withdrawn may not reapply within 60 days of the date the facility was notified in writing that accreditation was denied or withdrawn.
            (4) After a facility is accredited, the facility must allow APHIS access to the facility and all of its equipment and records for the purpose of conducting unannounced audits to determine the facility's continuing eligibility for accreditation. Such audits will occur at least once a year and may be performed more frequently at the discretion of the Administrator.
            (b) Standards for accreditation. A facility that, in accordance with § 353.8(b)(2) of this part, applies to be accredited to perform laboratory seed health testing or seed crop phytosanitary inspection will be evaluated for accreditation against these standards:
            (1) Physical plant. The facility's physical plant (e.g., laboratory space, office space, greenhouses, vehicles, etc.) must:
            (i) Have laboratory and office spaces enclosed by walls and locking doors to prevent unauthorized access;
            (ii) Conform to all State and local zoning and other ordinances; and
            (iii) Provide a work area that is dedicated to laboratory functions and has sufficient space to conduct the required tests and store the materials and samples required for the tests in a manner that prevents contamination by other samples in the laboratory and from other sources.
            (2) The facility must have access to all equipment required to conduct the laboratory testing or seed crop phytosanitary inspections for which it is accredited. Specific test methodologies, materials, and the calibration and monitoring of the equipment must conform to Reference Manual B, which is incorporated by reference at § 300.4 of this chapter. The general requirements for each test category are as follows:
              
            
            (i) Seed crop phytosanitary inspections. Seed crop phytosanitary inspection may also include related activities such as collection of seed samples for later laboratory testing, visual inspection of seed just prior to export, and inspection of greenhouses or growth chambers where plants are grown for seed production, as well as visual inspection of seed crops. In the field, inspectors must use accurate field maps, hand lenses, and secure containers for the collection, storage, and transportation of samples. Inspectors must have direct access to a laboratory that is fully equipped to carry out any necessary diagnostic tests needed for field samples.
            (ii) Direct visual examination. Visual examination of seed requires a stereo microscope. Visual examination of tissue requires a compound light microscope. Visual examination of loosely attached or accompanying material requires a centrifuge and shaker.
            (iii) Incubation. Required equipment includes incubation chambers, laminar flow hoods, media preparation equipment, scales, pH meters, distilled and sterile water, gas burners, an autoclave, and the appropriate media for the specified tests.
            (iv) Grow-out tests. Grow-out tests require a greenhouse, growth chamber, or an outdoor quarantine location, and access to a laboratory that is fully equipped to carry out any required diagnostic tests.
            (v) Serological tests. These tests require grinding, extraction, and sample purification equipment; fluorescent microscopes; plate readers; spectrophotometers; and the appropriate assay materials; or the appropriate equipment to use field ready test kits.
            (vi) DNA probes. To conduct these tests, a laboratory must be equipped with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) equipment, including thermal cyclers, electrophoresis and gel blotting equipment, and the reagents and DNA polymerases necessary to conduct the PCR.
            (3) Methods of testing and inspection. The facility must conduct its laboratory seed health testing and seed crop phytosanitary inspection procedures in accordance with Reference Manual B. The facility must have a quality manual documenting its quality system for laboratory seed health testing and seed crop phytosanitary inspection procedures. The quality system must follow the general guidelines described in ANSI/ASQC Q9001-1994, American National Standard: Quality Systems-Model for Quality Assurance in Design, Development, Production, Installation and Servicing. Acceptable models for quality systems for accredited facilities are also described in detail in Reference Manual A, which is incorporated by reference at § 300.3 of this chapter. The personnel who perform the testing and inspection services must comply with the quality manual, and management must enforce this compliance. The facility must maintain documented procedures for identification, collection, indexing, access, filing, storage, maintenance, and disposition of quality system records. The facility must maintain quality system records to demonstrate conformance to the quality manual and the effective operation of the quality system.
            (4) Personnel. There must be a selection procedure and a training system to ensure technical competence of all staff members. The education, technical knowledge, and experience required to perform assigned test and inspection functions must be documented and clearly defined. In addition:
            (i) Evaluation of plant or tissue samples must be undertaken by a plant pathologist or by laboratory technicians under the supervision of a plant pathologist, who may provide such supervision either on-site, or from a remote location. Where personnel are required to be trained at a facility to evaluate the particular types of plants or tissue samples handled by the facility, the training program must be evaluated by APHIS and determined to be effective.
            (ii) All staff must have access to and be familiar with the reference materials, guides, and manuals required for the routine performance of the tests and inspections they conduct.

            (b) The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service or U.S. Customs and Border Protection inspector in charge of honoring a request to furnish inspection, laboratory testing, quarantine or certification service, shall assign employees to such Sunday or holiday or overtime duty with due regard to the work program and availability of employees for duty.
            (c) As used in this section—
            (1) The term private aircraft means any civilian aircraft not being used to transport persons or property for compensation or hire, and
            
            (2) The term private vessel means any civilian vessel not being used (i) to transport persons or property for compensation or hire, or (ii) in fishing operations or in processing of fish or fish products.

            (2) Since the payment must be collected before service can be provided, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service or U.S. Customs and Border Protection inspector will estimate the amount to be paid. Any difference between the inspector's estimate and the actual amount owed to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service or U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be resolved as soon as reasonably possible following the delivery of service, with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service or U.S. Customs and Border Protection either returning the difference to the agent, broker, or principal, or billing the agent, broker, or principal for the difference.
            (3) The prepayment must be in some guaranteed form, such as money order, certified check, or cash. Prepayment in guaranteed form will continue until the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service or U.S. Customs and Border Protection determines that the agent, broker, or principal has established an acceptable credit history.
            (4) For security reasons, cash payments will be accepted only from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., and only at a location designated by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service or U.S. Customs and Border Protection inspector.
            (e)(1) Any principal, or any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other legal entity requesting Sunday, holiday, or overtime services of an Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service or U.S. Customs and Border Protection inspector, and who has a debt to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service or U.S. Customs and Border Protection more than 60 days delinquent, must pay the inspector before service is provided.
            (2) Since the payment must be collected before service can be provided, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service or U.S. Customs and Border Protection inspector will estimate the amount to be paid. Any difference between the inspector's estimate and the actual amount owed to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service or U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be resolved as soon as reasonably possible following the delivery of service, with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service or U.S. Customs and Border Protection either returning the difference to the agent, broker, or principal, or billing the agent, broker, or principal for the difference.
            (3) The prepayment must be in some guaranteed form, such as money order, certified check, or cash. Prepayment in guaranteed form will continue until the debtor pays the delinquent debt.
            (4) For security reasons, cash payments will be accepted only from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., and only at a location designated by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service or U.S. Customs and Border Protection inspector.
            (f) Reimbursable Sunday, holiday, or overtime services will be denied to any principal, or any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other legal entity who has a debt to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service or U.S. Customs and Border Protection more than 90 days delinquent. Services will be denied until the delinquent debt is paid.

            (4) If a designated State inspector issues a certificate, the State where the certificate is issued may charge for inspection services provided in that State.
            (5) Any State which wishes to charge a fee for services it provides to issue certificates must establish fees in accordance with one of the following guidelines:
            (i) Calculation of a “cost-per-certificate” fee. The State must:
            (A) Estimate the annual number of certificates to be issued;

            (B) Determine the total cost of issuing certificates by adding togetherdelivery, 2
               support, 3
               and administrative 4
               costs; and
            
              
                2 Delivery costs are costs such as employee salary and benefits, transportation, per diem, travel, purchase of specialized equipment, and user fee costs associated with maintaining field offices. Delivery hours are similar hours taken by inspectors, including travel time, inspection time, and time taken to complete paperwork.
            
            
              
                3 Support costs are costs at supervisory levels which are similar to delivery costs, and user fee costs such as training, automated data processing, public affairs, enforcement, legal services, communications, postage, budget and accounting services, and payroll, purchasing, billing, and collecting services. Support hours are similar hours taken at supervisory levels, as well as hours taken in training, automated data processing, enforcement, legal services, communication, budgeting and accounting, payroll purchasing, billing, and collecting.
            
            
              
                4 Administrative costs are costs incurred as a direct result of collecting and monitoring Federal phytosanitary certificates. Administrative hours are hours taken as a direct result of collecting and monitoring Federal phytosanitary certificates.
            
            (C) Divide the cost of issuing certificates by the estimated number of certificates to be issued to obtain a “raw” fee. The State may round the “raw” fee up to the nearest quarter, if necessary for ease of calculation, collection, or billing; or
            (ii) Calculation of a “cost-per-hour” fee. The State must:
            (A) Estimate the annual number of hours taken to issue certificates by adding together delivery, 2 support, 3 and administrative 4 hours;
            (B) Determine the total cost of issuing certificates by adding together delivery, support, and administrative costs; and
            (C) Divide the cost of issuing certificates by the estimated number of hours taken to issue certificates to obtain a “cost-per-hour” fee. The State may round the “cost-per-hour” fee up to the nearest quarter, if necessary for ease of calculation, collection, or billing.
            (h) Fee for conducting and monitoring treatments. (1) Each importer of a consignment of articles that require treatment upon arrival from a place outside of the customs territory of the United States, either as a preassigned condition of entry or as a remedial measure ordered following the inspection of the consignment, must pay an AQI user fee. The AQI user fee is charged on a per-treatment basis, i.e., if two or more consignments are treated together, only a single fee will be charged, and if a single consignment is split or must be retreated, a fee will be charged for each separate treatment conducted. The AQI user fee for each treatment is shown in the following table:

            (2) Treatment provider. (i) Private entities that provide AQI treatment services to importers are responsible for collecting the AQI treatment user fee from the importer for whom the service is provided. Treatment providers must collect the AQI treatment fee applicable at the time the treatment is applied.
            (ii) When AQI treatment services are provided by APHIS, APHIS will collect the AQI treatment fee applicable at the time the treatment is applied from the person receiving the services. Remittances must be made by check or money order, payable in United States dollars, through a United States bank, to “The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.”
            (3) Collection of fees. (i) In cases where APHIS is not providing the AQI treatment and collecting the associated fee, AQI user fees collected from importers pursuant to this paragraph shall be held in trust for the United States by the person collecting such fees, by any person holding such fees, or by the person who is ultimately responsible for remittance of such fees to APHIS. AQI user fees collected from importers shall be accounted for separately and shall be regarded as trust funds held by the person possessing such fees as agents, for the beneficial interest of the United States. All such user fees held by any person shall be property in which the person holds only a possessory interest and not an equitable interest. As compensation for collecting, handling, and remitting the AQI treatment user fees, the person holding such user fees shall be entitled to any interest or other investment return earned on the user fees between the time of collection and the time the user fees are due to be remitted to APHIS under this section. Nothing in this section shall affect APHIS' right to collect interest from the person holding such user fees for late remittance.
            (4) Remittance and statement procedures. (i) The treatment provider that collects the AQI treatment user fee must remit the fee to USDA, APHIS, AQI, PO Box 979044, St. Louis, MO 63197-9000.
            (ii) AQI treatment user fees must be remitted to [address to be added in final rule] for receipt no later than 31 days after the close of the calendar quarter in which the AQI user fees were collected. Late payments will be subject to interest, penalty, and handling charges as provided in the Debt Collection Act of 1982, as amended by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 3717).
            (iii) The remitter must mail with the remittance a written statement to USDA, APHIS, AQI, PO Box 979044, St. Louis, MO 63197-9000. The statement must include the following information:
            (A) Name and address of the person remitting payment;
            (B) Taxpayer identification number of the person remitting payment;
            (C) Calendar quarter covered by the payment; and
            (D) Amount collected and remitted.
            (iv) Remittances must be made by check or money order, payable in United States dollars, through a United States bank, to “The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.”
            (i) Payment methods. For payment of any of the AQI user fees required in paragraph (g) of this section, we will accept personal checks for amounts less than $100, and checks drawn on commercial accounts, cashier's checks, certified checks, traveler's checks, and money orders for any amount. All payments must be for the exact amount due.
            (j) The person for whom the service is provided and the person requesting the service are jointly and severally liable for payment of user fees for any import or entry services listed below, of $56 per hour, or $14 per quarter hour, with a minimum fee of $14 for each employee required to perform the following services. If the services must be conducted on a Sunday or holiday or at any other time outside the normal tour of duty of the employee, then the premium user fee rate as listed below applies, as well as the 2-hour minimum charge and a commuted traveltime period required by § 354.1(a)(2). If the services requested are performed on a Sunday, the hourly user fee rate will be $74, or $18.50 per quarter hour, with a $18.50 minimum. If the services requested are performed on a day other than Sunday outside the normal tour of duty of the employee providing the service, the hourly user fee rate will be $65, or $16.25 per quarter hour, with a $16.25 minimum:
            (1) Conducting inspections, on vessels or in storage areas, of solid wood packing material or cargo when a shipment arrives without a certificate or exporter statement required under § 319.40-5(g) or § 319.40-5(h) of this chapter, or with an incomplete certificate or exporter statement; and

Before such action is taken, the applicant or permittee will be informed of the reasons for the proposed action, and upon request, shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the merits or validity of such action, in accordance with rules of practice which shall be adopted for the proceeding. However, such denial, suspension or revocation may become effective pending final determination in the proceeding, if the permittee has been convicted or a criminal violation of the Act, or of any regulation, permit, or certificate issued under the Act.

              (a) Documentation for any mailed or nonmailed terrestrial plant which is required to have documentation under 50 CFR part 17 or part 23 at the time of importation, must be validated by an inspector prior to movement of such plant from the Customs inspection area at the port of entry. The original documentation must be surrendered to the inspector at the time of validation.

              (b) Documentation for any mailed or nonmailed terrestrial plant which is listed in 50 CFR 17.12 or 23.23 and which is required to have documentation under 50 CFR part 17 or part 23 at the time of exportation or reexportation, must be validated at the port of export or reexport by an inspector prior to the exportation or reexportation of such plant. 5
                 The original and one copy of the documentation must be submitted for validation, and the copy must be surrendered to the inspector at the time of validation.
              
                
                  5 It is the policy of the Department of Agriculture to allow, if inspectors are available, terrestrial plants listed in 50 CFR 17.12 or 23.23 which are intended for export to be inspected at the premises where such plants are grown. However, the documentation required for the export of such plants by 50 CFR part 17 or part 23 shall only be validated at the port of export and only when such plants are presented at the port for export together with the documents required by 50 CFR part 17 or part 23 and a certified statement by the inspector who inspected the plants that the plants are apparently eligible for exportation in accordance with the provisions of this part and provisions of 50 CFR chapter I relating to the Act and Convention. Plants which have been previously inspected must be exported through a designated port (unless allowed by the United States Department of the Interior to be exported through a nondesignated port) in order to comply with section 9(f) of the Act [16 U.S.C. 1538(f)]. Plants which are inspected at the premises of origin must be available at the port of export for monitoring inspections and for other inspections deemed need for enforcement purposes, but, unless so inspected, will not need to be unpacked, inspected and repacked at the port. Information concerning the availability of inspectors to conduct inspections at the premise of origin may be obtained by calling local offices of Plant Protection and Quarantine, which are listed in telephone directories, or by writing the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Operational Support—Director's Office, 4700 River Road, Unit 131, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1236.
              
              (c) Documentation for a plant shall be validated under this section upon endorsement of the documentation by an inspector when he or she determines that the plant was apparently eligible for importation, exportation, or reexportation in accordance with the provisions of this part and the provisions of 50 CFR chapter I relating to the Act and Convention.
              (d) To obtain validation of documentation, the importer, exporter, or reexporter, or agent thereof, shall make available to an inspector:
              (1) All shipping documents (including bills of lading, waybills, packing lists, and invoices):
              (2) All documents required by the Act and Convention; and
              (3) The plant being imported, exported, or reexported.

              (a) Any person engaged in business as an importer, exporter, or reexporter of terrestrial plants listed in 50 CFR part 17 or part 23 shall keep such records as will fully and correctly disclose each importation, exportation, or reexportation of terrestrial plants made by such person and the subsequent disposition made by such person of the plants. Such records shall include shipping documents for each shipment of plants imported, exported, or reexported; a description of the form of the plants (such as whole live plants, cuttings, seeds, or other specific parts or derivatives of plants); the scientific and common names of the plants; the country or place of origin of the plants; the date and place of importation, exportation, or reexportation of the plants; the number (weight if the plants cannot be quantified by number) and specific location of plants; the date and means of subsequent disposition of the plants, whether by sale, barter, consignment, loan, delivery, destruction, or other means; and names and addresses of persons to whom the plants were disposed, if applicable.
              (b) Every record required to be kept under this section shall be kept for a period of 5 years after the occurrence of the transactions to which the records relate, and for such further time as the Deputy Administrator may require by written notice to the person required to keep such records under this part for purposes of any investigation, litigation, or other proceeding under the Act or this part.

              (c) Any person engaged in business as an importer, exporter, or reexporter of terrestrial plants listed in 50 CFR part 17 or part 23 shall, upon presentation of credentials by an inspector or duly authorized representatives of the Secretary; during ordinary business hours of the person given notice, afford such inspector access to the person's place of business, the opportunity to examine the person's inventory of plants and the records required to be kept under paragraph (a) of this section, and the opportunity to copy such records. The use of a room, table, or other facilities (other than reproduction equipment) necessary for examination and copying of records and for such examination of inventory shall be afforded such inspector.
              (d) Any person engaged in business as an importer, exporter, or reexporter of terrestrial plants listed in 50 CFR part 17 or part 23, upon written request by the Deputy Administrator, shall submit within 60 days of such request, a report concerning any of the information required to be maintained under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

            Property subject to forfeiture procedures.
            This part sets forth procedures relating to the forfeiture of any plant, equipment, means of conveyance or other property 1

               seized under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) or the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16 U.S.C. 3371 et seq.), 2
               in possession (actual or constructive) of the United States Department of Agriculture, and subject to forfeiture under these Acts because of activities pertaining to the importation, exportation, or reexportation of terrestrial plants.
            
              
                1 Under section 11(e)(4) of the Endangered Species Act (“Act”; 16 U.S.C. 1540(e)(4)) any such equipment and means of conveyance would be subject to forfeiture upon conviction of a criminal violation pursuant to section 11(b)(1) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1540(b)(1)); however, such a plant may be subject to forfeiture regardless of whether a criminal conviction is obtained.
            
            
              
                2 Under section 5(a)(2) of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16 U.S.C. 3374(a)(2)) USDA has authority to initiate forfeiture proceedings against all vessels, vehicles, aircraft, and other equipment used to aid in the importation or exportation of plants in a criminal violation of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 for which a felony conviction has been obtained if (a) the owner of such vessel, vehicle, aircraft, or equipment was at the time of the alleged illegal act a consenting part or privy thereto or in the exercise of due care should have known that such vessel, vehicle, aircraft, or equipment would be used in a criminal violation of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981, and (b) the violation involved the sale or purchase of, the offer of sale or purchase of, or the intent to sell or purchase plants. However, under section 5(a)(1) of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16 U.S.C. 3474(a)(1) plants seized for violations of the Amendments are subject to forfeiture regardless of whether a civil penalty assessment or criminal conviction is obtained.

            § 356.2
            Appraisement.

            Promptly following the seizure or other receipt of property specified in § 356.1, the Deputy Administrator shall determine the retail value of such property in the same quantity or quantities as seized. If the property may lawfully be sold in the United States, the value thereof shall be determined by ascertaining the price at which the property or similar property in the ordinary course of trade is freely offered for sale at the time of appraisement, and at a principal market as close as possible to the place of appraisement. If the property may not lawfully be sold in the United States, the value thereof shall be determined by other reasonable means.
          
          
            § 356.3
            Property valued at greater than $10,000; notice of seizure and civil action to obtain forfeiture.
            Promptly following the seizures or other receipt of any property specified in § 356.1 and determined under § 356.2 to have a value greater than $10,000, the Deputy Administrator shall mail a notice of seizure by registered or certified mail to the current or last known or reasonable ascertainable address, return receipt requested, to persons known or reasonably ascertained to be the owner or agent of the seized property and to any other person having an interest in the property. Such notice shall describe the seized property, shall state the time, date, place, and reason for the seizure, that there is a right to petition for remission or mitigation of forfeiture pursuant to § 356.7, and shall state that action shall be taken in accordance with this part. Promptly following the seizure of such property, the Secretary shall also submit a report concerning such property to the U.S. Attorney for the district in which the seizure was made for institution of forfeiture proceedings in the U.S. District Court. The report shall provide a statement of all the relevant facts and circumstances of the case, including the names of the witnesses, and a citation to the laws believed to have been violated and on which reliance may be had for forfeiture.
          
          
            § 356.4
            Property valued at $10,000 or less; notice of seizure administrative action to obtain forfeiture.
            (a) When authorized. The Secretary shall take measures to obtain forfeiture in accordance with this section of any property specified in § 356.1 and determined under § 356.2 to have a value of $10,000 or less.
            (b) Waiver of forfeiture procedures by owner of seized property. A person claiming to be an owner or to have an interest in any property specified in § 356.1 with a value of $10,000 or less may waive any rights to any procedures relating to forfeiture under this subpart by signing a statement providing for waiver of such rights.
            (1) The Deputy Administrator shall publish a copy of the notice of seizure and proposed forfeiture as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, by posting for 21 days in a conspicuous place accessible to the public at the Plant Protection and Quarantine Enforcement office nearest the place of seizure. The time and date of posting shall be indicated on the notice.
            (2) Upon the execution of such statement and following publication of the notice for 21 days as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, any interest in such property by such owner shall become forfeited under the Act without further action under this subpart, and the Deputy Administrator shall not be required to send such owner any notices or declarations otherwise required by this subpart.
            (c) Procedure absent waiver of forfeiture procedures by owner. (1) Notice of seizure and proposed forfeiture. Promptly following seizure of property, the Deputy Administrator shall issue a notice of seizure and proposed forfeiture. The notice shall be in substantially the same form as a complaint for forfeiture filed in the U.S. District Court. The notice shall describe the seized property, including any identification numbers, such as the license, registration, motor, and serial numbers for a motor vehicle. The notice shall state the time, date, and place of seizure; the reason for seizure; and shall specify the value of the property as determined under § 356.2. The notice shall contain specific reference to the provisions of the Act, permit, certificate, or regulations allegedly violated and under which the property is subject to forfeiture. The notice shall state that any person desiring to claim the property must file a claim and a bond in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and shall state that if a proper claim and bond are not received by the specified office within the time prescribed by such paragraph, the property will be declared forfeited to the United States and disposed of according to law. The notice shall also advise interested persons of their right to file a petition for remission or mitigation of forfeiture in accordance with § 356.7.
            
            (i) Promptly following the seizure, The Deputy Administrator shall mail a copy of the notice by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to persons known or reasonably ascertained to be the owner or agent of the seized property, and to any other person having an interest in the property, if such owner or agent or other person and their address is known or reasonably ascertainable.
            (ii) Publication. Promptly following the seizure, the Deputy Administrator shall publish a copy of the notice by posting for 21 days in a conspicuous place accessible to the public at the Plant Protection and Quarantine enforcement office nearest the place of seizure. The time and date of posting shall be indicated on the notice.
            (2) Filing a claim and bond. Upon issuance of the notice of proposed forfeiture, any person claiming ownership of or other interest in the seized property may file with the office specified in the notice a claim to the property and a bond in the amount of $250, with sureties to be approved by the Deputy Administrator, conditioned that in case of condemnation of the articles so claimed, the obligor shall pay all the costs and expenses of the proceedings to obtain such condemnation. Any claim and bond must be received in such office within 20 days after posting of the notice of proposed forfeiture, and shall state claimant's interest in the property. The Deputy Administrator may extend the 20 day period with an appropriate statement on the posted notice of proposed forfeiture, if necessary, to allow a person deemed to have an interest in the property at least 10 days to file such a claim and bond after receipt of a notice of proposed forfeiture. The bond shall be on a U.S. Customs Form 4615 or on a similar form provided by Plant Protection and Quarantine. There shall be endorsed on the bond a list or schedule in substantially the following form which shall be signed by the claimant in the presence of the witnesses to the bond, and attested by the witnesses:
            
            
              List or schedule containing a description of seized articles, claim for which is covered by the bond:
              
              
              
              
              The foregoing list is correct.
              
              
              
              Claimant
              
              Attest:
              
            
            
            The claim and bond referred to in the paragraph shall not entitle the claimant or any other person to possession of the property.
            (3) Transmittal to U.S. Attorney. As soon as practicable after timely receipt by the specified office of a proper claim and bond in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Secretary shall transmit such claim, bond (with a duplicate list and description of the articles seized), and a report as described in § 356.3 to the U.S. Attorney for the district in which seizure was made for forfeiture proceedings in the U.S. District Court.
            (d) Summary forfeiture. If a proper claim and bond are not received by the specified office within the time periods as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the property shall be forfeited and the Deputy Administrator shall prepare a declaration of forfeiture. The declaration of forfeiture shall be in writing, and the Deputy Administrator shall send such declaration by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to each person whose whereabouts and prior interests in the seized property are known or reasonably ascertainable. The declaration shall be in substantially the same form as a default judgment of forfeiture entered in U.S. District Court. The declaration shall describe the property and state the time, date, place, and reason for its seizure. The declaration shall identify the notice of proposed forfeiture, describing the dates and manner of publication of the notice and any efforts made to serve the notice personally or by mail. The declaration shall state that in response to the notice a proper claim and bond were not timely received by the proper office from any claimant, and that, therefore, all potential claimants are deemed to admit the truth of the allegations of the notice. The declaration shall conclude with an order of condemnation and forfeiture of the property to the United States for disposition according to law.

            § 356.5
            Bonded release.
            (a) The Deputy Administrator may accept a bond or other security, in the amount of the value of the property as determined under § 356.3, in place of any property specified in § 356.1 and release the property to the owner or agent of the property, if such action would not frustrate the purposes of the Act and Convention. As an example, this section does not allow the release of terrestrial plants that are without documentation required under 50 CFR chapter I.
            (b) Any request for the return of property based on the acceptance of a bond or other security shall be submitted in writing to the Deputy Administrator. The request shall include evidence to establish that the person making the request is the sole owner of the property referred to in the request or is the agent of the sole owner of such property. A response in writing, granting or denying the request, and the reasons therefor, shall be sent to the person making the request.
          
          
            § 356.6
            Storage of property.
            Following the seizure or other receipt of any property specified in § 356.1 and valued at $10,000 or less, the property shall remain in the custody of the Deputy Administrator pending disposition. Pending such disposition, the property shall be stored in such place, as, in the opinion of the Deputy Administrator, is most convenient and appropriate with due regard to the expense involved, whether or not the place of storage is within the judicial district in which the property was seized.
          
          
            § 356.7
            Petition for remission or mitigation of forfeiture.
            (a) Any person who has an interest in any property specified in § 356.1 and valued at $10,000 or less, or any person who has incurred or is alleged to have incurred a forfeiture of any such property, may file with the Deputy Administrator a petition for remission or mitigation of forfeiture while the property is in the custody of the Deputy Administrator.
            (b) A petition filed with the Deputy Administrator need not be in any particular form, but must contain the following:
            (1) A description of the property:
            (2) The time, date, and place of seizure;
            (3) Evidence of the petitioner's interest in the property such as contracts, bills of sale, invoices, security interests, certificates of title; and
            (4) A statement of all facts and circumstances relied upon by the petitioners to justify remission or mitigation of the forfeiture.
            (c) The petition shall be signed by the petitioner or the petitioner's attorney at law. If the petitioner is a business, the petition must be signed by a partner, officer, or petitioner's attorney at law.
            (d) Upon receiving the petition, the Deputy Administrator shall decide whether or not to grant relief. In making a decision, the Deputy Administrator shall consider the information submitted by the petitioner, as well as any other available information relating to the matter, and may require that testimony be taken concerning the petition.
            (e) If the Deputy Administrator finds that the forfeiture was incurred without willful negligence or without any intention on the part of the petitioner to violate the law or finds the existence of such mitigating circumstances as to justify remission or mitigation of the forfeiture or alleged forfeiture, the Deputy Administrator may remit or mitigate the same upon terms and conditions as he deems reasonable and just. However, remission or mitigation will not be made if such action would frustrate the purposes of the Act or Convention. As an example, this section does not allow remission or mitigation with respect to terrestrial plants that are without documentation required under 50 CFR chapter I.

            (f) The Deputy Administrator shall notify the petitioner in writing concerning whether the petition was granted or denied, and shall state the reasons therefor. If the petition is denied fully or in part, the petitioner may then file a supplemental petition, but no supplemental petition shall be considered unless it is received within 60 days from the date of the Deputy Administrator's notification concerning the original petition. The Deputy Administrator shall notify the petitioner in writing concerning the action taken in response to the supplemental petition, and shall state the reasons therefor.

            § 356.8
            Return procedure.
            If, at the conclusion of proceedings, seized property is to be returned to the person determined to be the owner or agent thereof, the Deputy Administrator shall issue a letter or other document to the person determined to be owner or agent thereof authorizing its return. This letter shall be delivered personally or sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall identify the person determined to be the owner or agent, the seized property, and if appropriate, the bailee of the seized property. It shall also provide that upon presentation of the letter or other document and proper identification, and the signing of a receipt provided by Plant Protection and Quarantine, the seized property is authorized to be released.
          
          
            § 356.9
            Filing of documents.
            (a) Any document required by this subpart to be filed or served within a certain period of time, will be considered filed or served as of the time of receipt by the party with or upon whom filing or service is required.
            (b) Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays shall be included in computing the time allowed for the filing or serving of any document or paper; except that when such time expires on a Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday, such period shall be extended to include the next following business day.

            The Lacey Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 3371 et seq.), makes it unlawful to, among other things, import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce any plant, with some limited exceptions, taken, possessed, transported or sold in violation of any Federal, State, tribal, or foreign law that protects plants. The Lacey Act also makes it unlawful to make or submit any false record, account, or label for, or any false identification of, any plant covered by the Act. In addition, the Act requires that importers submit a declaration at the time of importation for plants and plant products. Common cultivars (except trees) and common food crops are among the categorical exclusions to the provisions of the Act. The Act does not define the terms “common cultivar” and “common food crop” but instead gives authority to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of the Interior to define these terms by regulation. The regulations in this part provide the required definitions.

            § 360.200
            Designation of noxious weeds.
            The Administrator has determined that it is necessary to designate the following plants 1
               as noxious weeds to prevent their introduction into the United States or their dissemination within the United States:
            
              
                1 One or more of the common names of weeds are given in parentheses after most scientific names to help identify the weeds represented by such scientific names; however, a scientific name is intended to include all subordinate taxa within the taxon. For example, taxa listed at the genus level include all species, subspecies, varieties, and forms within the genus; taxa listed at the species level include all subspecies, varieties, and forms within the species.

            § 360.302
            Consideration of applications for permits to move noxious weeds.
            Upon the receipt of an application made in accordance with § 360.301 for a permit for movement of a noxious weed into the United States or interstate, the Administrator will consider the application on its merits.
            (a) Consultation. The Administrator may consult with other Federal agencies or entities, States or political subdivisions of States, national governments, local governments in other nations, domestic or international organizations, domestic or international associations, and other persons for views on the danger of noxious weed dissemination into the United States, or interstate, in connection with the proposed movement.
            (b) Inspection of premises. The Administrator may inspect the site where noxious weeds are proposed to be handled in connection with or after their movement under permit to determine whether existing or proposed facilities will be adequate to prevent noxious weed dissemination if a permit is issued.

            Approval of an application for a permit to move a noxious weed; conditions specified in permit.
            The Administrator will approve or deny an application for a permit to move a noxious weed. If the application is approved, the Administrator will issue the permit including any conditions that the Administrator has determined are necessary to prevent dissemination of noxious weeds into the United States or interstate. Such conditions may include requirements for inspection of the premises where the noxious weed is to be handled after its movement under the permit, to determine whether the facilities there are adequate to prevent noxious weed dissemination and whether the conditions of the permit are otherwise being observed. Before the permit is issued, the Administrator will require the responsible person to agree in writing to the conditions under which the noxious weed will be safeguarded.

            § 360.304
            Denial of an application for a permit to move a noxious weed; revocation of a permit to move a noxious weed.
            (a) The Administrator may deny an application for a permit to move a noxious weed when the Administrator determines that:
            (1) No safeguards adequate or appropriate to prevent dissemination of the noxious weed can be implemented; or
            (2) The destructive potential of the noxious weed, should it escape despite proposed safeguards, outweighs the probable benefits to be derived from the proposed movement and use of the noxious weed; or
            (3) The responsible person, or the responsible person's agent, as a previous permittee, failed to maintain the safeguards or otherwise observe the conditions prescribed in a previous permit and failed to demonstrate the ability or intent to observe them in the future; or
            (4) The movement could impede an APHIS eradication, suppression, control, or regulatory program; or

            (5) A State plant regulatory official objects to the issuance of the permit on the grounds that granting the permit will pose a risk of dissemination of the noxious weed into the State; or
            (6) The application for the permit contains information that is found to be materially false, fraudulent, or deceptive; or
            (7) APHIS may deny a permit to a person who has previously failed to comply with any APHIS regulation.
            (b) The Administrator may revoke any outstanding permit when:
            (1) After the issuance of the permit, information is received that constitutes cause for the denial of an application for permit under paragraph (a) of this section; or
            (2) The responsible person has not maintained the safeguards or otherwise observed the conditions specified in the permit.
            (c) If a permit is orally revoked, APHIS will provide the reasons for the withdrawal of the permit in writing within 10 days. Any person whose permit has been revoked or any person who has been denied a permit may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving the written notification of the revocation or denial. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the permit was wrongfully revoked or denied. The Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision as promptly as circumstances allow. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing will be held to resolve the conflict. Rules of practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.

            § 360.305
            Disposal of noxious weeds when permits are revoked.
            When a permit for the movement of a noxious weed is revoked by the Administrator and not reinstated under § 360.304(c), further movement of the noxious weed covered by the permit into or through the United States, or interstate, is prohibited unless authorized by another permit. The responsible person must arrange for disposal of the noxious weed in question in a manner that the Administrator determines is adequate to prevent noxious weed dissemination. The Administrator may seize, quarantine, treat, apply other remedial measures to, destroy, or otherwise dispose of, in such manner as the Administrator deems appropriate, any noxious weed that is moved without compliance with any conditions in the permit or after the permit has been revoked whenever the Administrator deems it necessary in order to prevent the dissemination of any noxious weed into or within the United States.

            (1) They are treated in accordance with part 305 of this chapter at the time of arrival at the port of first arrival in the United States; or
            (2) They are treated prior to shipment to the United States at a facility that is approved by APHIS 4
               and that operates in compliance with a written agreement between the treatment facility owner and the plant protection service of the exporting country, in which the treatment facility owner agrees to comply with the provisions of § 319.37-9(c) of this chapter and allow inspectors and representatives of the plant protection service of the exporting country access to the treatment facility as necessary to monitor compliance with the regulations. Treatments must be certified in accordance with the conditions described in § 319.37-9(c) of this chapter.

            Petitions to add a taxon to the noxious weed list.

            A person may petition the Administrator to have a taxon added to the noxious weeds lists in § 360.200. Details of the petitioning process for adding a taxon to the lists are available on the Internet at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info/weeds/downloads/listingguide.pdf. Persons who submit a petition to add a taxon to the noxious weed lists must provide their name, address, telephone number, and (if available) e-mail address. Persons who submit a petition to add a taxon to the noxious weed lists are encouraged to provide the following information, which can help speed up the review process and help APHIS determine whether the specified plant taxon should be listed as a noxious weed:
            (a) Identification of the taxon. (1) The taxon's scientific name and author;
            (2) Common synonyms;
            (3) Botanical classification;
            (4) Common names;
            (5) Summary of life history;
            (6) Native and world distribution;
            (7) Distribution in the United States, if any (specific States, localities, or Global Positioning System coordinates);
            (8) Description of control efforts, if established in the United States; and
            (9) Whether the taxon is regulated at the State or local level.
            (b) Potential consequences of the taxon's introduction or spread. (1) The taxon's habitat suitability in the United States (predicted ecological range);
            (2) Dispersal potential (biological characteristics associated with invasiveness);
            (3) Potential economic impacts (e.g., potential to reduce crop yields, lower commodity values, or cause loss of markets for U.S. goods); and
            (4) Potential environmental impacts (e.g., impacts on ecosystem processes, natural community composition or structure, human health, recreation patterns, property values, or use of chemicals to control the taxon).
            (c) Likelihood of the taxon's introduction or spread. (1) Potential pathways for the taxon's movement into and within the United States; and
            (2) The likelihood of survival and spread of the taxon within each pathway.

            Petitions to remove a taxon from the noxious weed lists.

            A person may petition the Administrator to remove a taxon from the noxious weeds lists in § 360.200. Details of the petitioning process for removing a taxon from the lists are available at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info/weeds/downloads/delistingguide.pdf. Persons who submit a petition to remove a taxon from the noxious weed lists would be required to provide their name, address, telephone number, and (if available) e-mail address. Persons who submit a petition to remove a taxon from the noxious weed lists are encouraged to provide the following information, which can help speed up the review process and help APHIS determine whether the specified plant taxon should not be listed as a noxious weed:
            (a) Evidence that the species is distributed throughout its potential range or has spread too far to implement effective control.
            (b) Evidence that control efforts have been unsuccessful and further efforts are unlikely to succeed.
            (c) For cultivars of a listed noxious weed, scientific evidence that the cultivar has a combination of risk elements that result in a low pest risk. For example, the cultivar may have a narrow habitat suitability, low dispersal potential, evidence of sterility, inability to cross-pollinate with introduced wild types, or few if any potential negative impacts on the economy or environment of the United States.

            § 360.600
            Preemption of State and local laws.

            (a) Under section 436 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7756), a State or political subdivision of a State may not regulate in foreign commerce any noxious weed in order to control it, eradicate it, or prevent its dissemination. A State or political subdivision of a State also may not impose prohibitions or restrictions upon the movement in interstate commerce of noxious weeds if the Secretary has issued a regulation or order to prevent the dissemination of the noxious weed within the United States. The only exceptions to this are:
            (1) If the prohibitions or restrictions issued by the State or political subdivision of a State are consistent with and do not exceed the regulations or orders issued by the Secretary; or
            (2) If the State or political subdivision of a State demonstrates to the Secretary and the Secretary finds that there is a special need for additional prohibitions or restrictions based on sound scientific data or a thorough risk assessment.
            (b) Therefore, in accordance with section 436 of the Plant Protection Act, the regulations in this part preempt all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with or exceed the regulations in this part unless a special need request has been granted in accordance with the regulations in §§ 301.1 through 301.13 of this chapter.

            Preemption of State and local laws; general restrictions on the importation of seed and screenings.
            (a) The regulations in this part preempt State and local laws regarding seed and screenings imported into the United States while the seed and screenings are in foreign commerce. Seed and screenings imported for immediate distribution and sale to the consuming public remain in foreign commerce until sold to the ultimate consumer. The question of when foreign commerce ceases in other cases must be considered on a case-by-case basis.
            (b) No person shall import any agricultural seed, vegetable seed, or screenings into the United States unless the importation is in compliance with this part.
            (c) Any agricultural seed, vegetable seed, or screenings imported into the United States not in compliance with this part shall be subject to exportation, destruction, disposal, or any remedial measures that the Administrator determines are necessary to prevent the dissemination into the United States of noxious weeds.
            (d) Except as provided in § 361.7(b), and in addition to the permit requirements of § 319.37-5 of this chapter, coated or pelleted seed, or seed that is embedded in a substrate that obscures visibility may enter the United States only if each lot of seed is accompanied by an officially drawn and sealed sample of seed drawn from the lot before the seed was coated or pelleted. The sample must be drawn in a manner consistent with that described in § 361.5 of this part.
            (e) Except as provided in §§ 361.4(a)(3) and 361.7(c), screenings of all agricultural seed and vegetable seed are prohibited entry into the United States.
            [62 FR 48460, Sept. 16, 1997, as amended at 74 FR 53400, Oct. 19, 2009; 79 FR 74594, Dec. 16, 2014; 83 FR 11867, Mar. 19, 2018]
          
          
            § 361.3
            Declarations and labeling.
            (a) All lots of agricultural seed, vegetable seed, and screenings imported into the United States must be accompanied by a declaration from the importer of the seed or screenings. The declaration must state the kind, variety, and origin of each lot of seed or screenings and the use for which the seed or screenings are being imported.

            (b) Each container of agricultural seed and vegetable seed imported into the United States for seeding (planting) purposes must be labeled to indicate the identification code or designation for the lot of seed; the name of each kind or kind and variety of agricultural seed or the name of each kind and variety of vegetable seed present in the lot in excess of 5 percent of the whole; and the designation “hybrid” when the lot contains hybrid seed. Kind and variety names used on the label shall conform to the kind and variety names used in the definitions of “agricultural seed” and “vegetable seed” in § 361.1. If any seed in the lot has been treated, each container must be further labeled, in type no smaller than 8 point, as follows:
            (1) The label must indicate that the seed has been treated and provide the name of the substance or process used to treat the seed. Substance names used on the label shall be the commonly accepted coined, chemical (generic), or abbreviated chemical name.
            (i) Commonly accepted coined names are commonly recognized as names of particular substances, e.g., thiram, captan, lindane, and dichlone.
            (ii) Examples of commonly accepted chemical (generic) names are blue-stone, calcium carbonate, cuprous oxide, zinc hydroxide, hexachlorobenzene, and ethyl mercury acetate. The terms “mercury” or “mercurial” may be used in labeling all types of mercurials.
            (iii) Examples of commonly accepted abbreviated chemical names are BHC (1,2,3,4,5,6-Hexachlorocyclohexane) and DDT (dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane).

            (2) If the seed has been treated with a mercurial or similarly toxic substance harmful to humans and vertebrate animals, the label must include a representation of a skull and crossbones and a statement indicating that the seed has been treated with poison. The skull and crossbones must be at least twice the size of the type used for the information provided on the label, and the poison warning statement must be written in red letters on a background of distinctly contrasting color. Mercurials and similarly toxic substances include the following:
            
            
              Aldrin, technical
              Demeton
              Dieldrin
              p-Dimethylaminobenzenediazo sodium sulfonate
              Endrin
              Ethion
              Heptachlor
              Mercurials, all types
              Parathion
              Phorate
              Toxaphene
              O-O-Diethyl-O-(isopropyl-4-methyl-6-pyrimidyl) thiophosphate
              O,O-Diethyl-S-2-(ethylthio) ethyl phosphorodithioate
            
            

            (3) If the seed has been treated with a substance other than one classified as a mercurial or similarly toxic substance under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and the amount remaining with the seed is harmful to humans or other vertebrate animals, the label must indicate that the seed is not to be used for food, feed, or oil purposes. Any amount of any substance used to treat the seed that remains with the seed will be considered harmful when the seed is in containers of more than 4 ounces, except that the following substances will not be deemed harmful when present at a rate less than the number of parts per million (p/m) indicated:
            
            
              Allethrin—2 p/m
              Malathion—8 p/m
              Methoxyclor—2 p/m
              Piperonyl butoxide—20 p/m (8 p/m on oat and sorghum)
              Pyrethrins—3 p/m (1 p/m on oat and sorghum)
            
            
            (c) In the case of seed in bulk, the information required under paragraph (b) of this section shall appear in the invoice or other records accompanying and pertaining to such seed. If the seed is in containers and in quantities of 20,000 pounds or more, regardless of the number of lots included, the information required on each container under paragraph (b) of this section need not be shown on each container if each container has stenciled upon it or bears a label containing a lot designation and the invoice or other records accompanying and pertaining to such seed bear the various statements required for the respective seeds.
            (d) Each container of agricultural seed and vegetable seed imported into the United States for cleaning need not be labeled to show the information required under paragraph (b) of this section if:
            (1) The seed is in bulk;

            (2) The seed is in containers and in quantities of 20,000 pounds or more, regardless of the number of lots involved, and the invoice or other records accompanying and pertaining to the seed show that the seed is for cleaning; or
            (3) The seed is in containers and in quantities of less than 20,000 pounds, and each container carries a label that bears the words “Seed for cleaning.”
          
          
            § 361.4
            Inspection at the port of first arrival.
            (a) All agricultural seed, vegetable seed, and screenings imported into the United States shall be made available for examination by an APHIS inspector at the port of first arrival and shall remain at the port of first arrival until released by an APHIS inspector. Lots of agricultural seed, vegetable seed, or screenings may enter the United States without meeting the sampling requirements of paragraph (b) of this section if the lot is:
            (1) Seed that is not being imported for seeding (planting) purposes and the declaration required by § 361.3(a) states the purpose for which the seed is being imported;
            (2) Seed that is being shipped in bond through the United States;
            (3) Screenings from seeds of wheat, oats, barley, rye, buckwheat, field corn, sorghum, broomcorn, flax, millet, proso, soybeans, cowpeas, field peas, or field beans that are not being imported for seeding (planting) purposes and the declaration accompanying the screenings as required under § 361.2(a) indicates that the screenings are being imported for processing or manufacturing purposes;
            (4) Seed that is being imported for sowing for experimental or breeding purposes, is not for sale, is limited in quantity to the amount indicated in column 3 of table 1 of § 361.5, and is accompanied by a declaration stating the purpose for which it is being imported (seed imported for increase purposes only will not be considered as being imported for experimental or breeding purposes); or
            (5) Seed that was grown in the United States, exported, and is now returning to the United States, provided that the person importing the seed into the United States furnishes APHIS with the following documentation:
            (i) Export documents indicating the quantity of seed and number of containers, the date of exportation from the United States, the distinguishing marks on the containers at the time of exportation, and the name and address of the United States exporter;
            (ii) A document issued by a Customs or other government official of the country to which the seed was exported indicating that the seed was not admitted into the commerce of that country; and
            (iii) A document issued by a Customs or other government official of the country to which the seed was exported indicating that the seed was not commingled with other seed after being exported to that country.
            (b) Except as provided in §§ 361.5(a)(2) and 361.7, samples will be taken from all agricultural seed and vegetable seed imported into the United States for seeding (planting) purposes prior to being released into the commerce of the United States.
            (1) Samples of seed will be taken from each lot of seed in accordance with § 361.5 to determine whether any seeds of noxious weeds listed in § 361.6(a) are present. If seeds of noxious weeds are present at a level higher than the tolerances set forth in § 361.6(b), the lot of seed will be deemed to be adulterated and will be rejected for entry into the United States for seeding (planting) purposes. Once deemed adulterated, the lot of seed must be:
            (i) Exported from the United States;
            (ii) Destroyed under the monitoring of an APHIS inspector;
            (iii) Cleaned under APHIS monitoring at a seed-cleaning facility that is operated in accordance with § 361.8(a); or
            (iv) If the lot of seed is adulterated with the seeds of a noxious weed listed in § 361.6(a)(2), the seed may be allowed entry into the United States for feeding or manufacturing purposes, provided the importer withdraws the original declaration and files a new declaration stating that the seed is being imported for feeding or manufacturing purposes and that no part of the seed will be used for seeding (planting) purposes.

            (2) Seed deemed adulterated may not be mixed with any other seed unless the Administrator determines that two or more lots of seed deemed adulterated are of substantially the same quality and origin. In such cases, the Administrator may allow the adulterated lots of seed to be mixed for cleaning as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.
            (3) If the labeling of a lot of seed is false or misleading in any respect, the seed will be rejected for entry into the United States. A falsely labeled lot of seed must be:
            (i) Exported from the United States;
            (ii) Destroyed under the monitoring of an APHIS inspector; or
            (iii) The seed may be allowed entry into the United States if the labeling is corrected under the monitoring of an APHIS inspector to accurately reflect the character of the lot of seed.
          
          
            § 361.5
            Sampling of seeds.
            (a) Sample sizes. As provided in § 361.4(b), samples of seed will be taken from each lot of seed being imported for seeding (planting) purposes to determine whether any seeds of noxious weeds listed in § 361.6(a) are present. The samples shall be drawn in the manner described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Unused portions of samples of rare or expensive seeds will be returned by APHIS upon request of the importer.
            (1) A minimum sample of not less than 1 quart shall be drawn from each lot of agricultural seed; a minimum sample of not less than 1 pint shall be drawn from each lot of vegetable seed, except that a sample of 1/4 pint will be sufficient for a vegetable seed importation of 5 pounds or less. The minimum sample shall be divided repeatedly until a working sample of proper weight has been obtained. If a mechanical divider cannot be used or is not available, the sample shall be thoroughly mixed, then placed in a pile; the pile shall be divided repeatedly into halves until a working sample of the proper weight remains. The weights of the working samples for noxious weed examination for each lot of seed are shown in column 1 of table 1 of this section. If the lot of seed is a mixture, the following methods shall be used to determine the weight of the working sample:
            (i) If the lot of seed is a mixture consisting of one predominant kind of seed or a group of kinds of similar size, the weight of the working sample shall be the weight shown in column 1 of table 1 of this section for the kind or group of kinds that comprises more than 50 percent of the sample.
            (ii) If the lot of seed is a mixture consisting of two or more kinds or groups of kinds of different sizes, none of which comprises over 50 percent of the sample, the weight of the working sample shall be the weighted average (to the nearest half gram) of the weight shown in column 1 of table 1 of this section for each of the kinds that comprise the sample, as determined by the following method:
            (A) Multiply the percentage of each component of the mixture (rounded off to the nearest whole number) by the sample sizes shown in column 1 of table 1 of this section;
            (B) Add all these products;
            (C) Total the percentages of all components of the mixtures; and
            (D) Divide the sum in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section by the total in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(C) of this section.
            (2) It is not ordinarily practical to sample and test small lots of seed offered for entry. The maximum sizes of lots of each kind of seed not ordinarily sampled are shown in column 2 of table 1 of this section.

            (3) The maximum sizes of lots of each kind of seed allowed entry without sampling for sowing for experimental or breeding purposes as provided in § 361.4(a)(4) are shown in column 3 of table 1 of this section.

            (b) Method of sampling. (1) When an importation consists of more than one lot, each lot shall be sampled separately.
            (2) For lots of six or fewer bags, each bag shall be sampled. A total of at least five trierfuls shall be taken from the lot.
            (3) For lots of more than six bags, five bags plus at least 10 percent of the number of bags in the lot shall be sampled. (Round off numbers with decimals to the nearest whole number, raising 0.5 to the next whole number.) Regardless of the lot size, it is not necessary to sample more than 30 bags.
            (4) When the lot of seed to be sampled is comprised of seed in small containers that cannot practically be sampled as described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, entire unopened containers may be taken in sufficient number to supply a sample that meets the minimum size requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
            (c) Drawing samples. Samples will not be drawn unless each container is labeled to show the lot designation and the name of the kind and variety of each agricultural seed, or kind and variety of each vegetable seed, appearing on the invoice and other entry papers, and a declaration has been filed by the importer as required under § 361.2(a). In order to secure a representative sample, an APHIS inspector will draw equal portions from evenly distributed parts of the quantity of seed to be sampled; the APHIS inspector, therefore, must be given access to all parts of that quantity.
            (1) For free-flowing seed in bags or in bulk, a probe or trier shall be used. For small free-flowing seed in bags, a probe or trier long enough to sample all portions of the bag shall be used. When drawing more than one trierful of seed from a bag, a different path through the seed shall be used when drawing each sample.
            (2) For non-free-flowing seed in bags or bulk that may be difficult to sample with a probe or trier, samples shall be obtained by thrusting one's hand into the seed and withdrawing representative portions. The hand shall be inserted in an open position with the fingers held closely together while the hand is being inserted and the portion withdrawn. When more than one handful is taken from a bag, the handfuls shall be taken from well-separated points.
            (3) When more than one sample is drawn from a single lot, the samples may be combined into a composite sample unless it appears that the quantity of seed represented as a lot is not of uniform quality, in which case the separate samples shall be forwarded together, but without being combined into a composite sample.
            (d) In most cases, samples will be drawn and examined by an APHIS inspector at the port of first arrival. The APHIS inspector may release a shipment if no contaminants are found and the labeling is sufficient. If contaminants are found or the labeling of the seed is insufficient, the APHIS inspector may forward the sample to the USDA Seed Examination Facility (SEF), Beltsville, MD, for analysis, testing, or examination. APHIS will notify the owner or consignee of the seed that samples have been drawn and forwarded to the SEF and that the shipment must be held intact pending a decision by APHIS as to whether the seed is within the noxious weed seed tolerances of § 361.6 and is accurately labeled. If the decision pending is with regard to the noxious weed seed content of the seed and the seed has been determined to be accurately labeled, the seed may be released for delivery to the owner or consignee under the following conditions:
            (1) The owner or consignee executes with Customs either a Customs single-entry bond or a Customs term bond, as appropriate, in such amount as is prescribed by applicable Customs regulations;
            (2) The bond must contain a condition for the redelivery of the seed or any part thereof upon demand of the Port Director of Customs at any time;
            (3) Until the seed is approved for entry upon completion of APHIS' examination, the seed must be kept intact and not tampered with in any way, or removed from the containers except under the monitoring of an APHIS inspector; and
            (4) The owner or consignee must keep APHIS informed as to the location of the seed until it is finally entered into the commerce of the United States.
          
          
            § 361.6

            (a) Seeds of the plants listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall be considered noxious weed seeds.

If fewer than two seeds are found in an initial examination, the shipment from which the sample was drawn may be entered. If two seeds are found in an initial examination, a second sample must be examined. If two or fewer seeds are found in the second examination, the shipment from which the samples were drawn may be entered. If three or more seeds are found in the second examination, the shipment from which the samples were drawn may not be entered. If three or more seeds are found in an initial examination, the shipment from which the sample was drawn may not be entered.
            (c) Any seed of any noxious weed that can be determined by visual inspection (including the use of transmitted light or dissection) to be within one of the following categories shall be considered inert matter and not counted as a weed seed:
            (1) Damaged seed (other than grasses) with over one half of the embryo missing;
            (2) Grass florets and caryopses classed as inert:
            (i) Glumes and empty florets of weedy grasses;
            (ii) Damaged caryopses, including free caryopses, with over one-half the root-shoot axis missing (the scutellum excluded);
            (iii) Immature free caryopses devoid of embryo or endosperm;
            (iv) Free caryopses of quackgrass (Elytrigia repens) that are 2 mm or less in length; or
            (v) Immature florets of quackgrass (Elytrigia repens) in which the caryopses are less than one-third the length of the palea. The caryopsis is measured from the base of the rachilla.
            (3) Seeds of legumes (Fabaceae) with the seed coats entirely removed.

            (4) Immature seed units, devoid of both embryo and endosperm, such as occur in (but not limited to) the following plant families: buckwheat (Polygonaceae), morning glory (Convolvulaceae), nightshade (Solanaceae), and sunflower (Asteraceae).
            (5) Dodder (Cuscuta spp.) seeds devoid of embryos and seeds that are ashy gray to creamy white in color are inert matter. Dodder seeds should be sectioned when necessary to determine if an embryo is present, as when the seeds have a normal color but are slightly swollen, dimpled, or have minute holes.

            § 361.7
            Special provisions for Canadian-origin seed and screenings.
            (a) In addition to meeting the declaration and labeling requirements of § 361.2 and all other applicable provisions of this part, all Canadian-origin agricultural seed and Canadian-origin vegetable seed imported into the United States from Canada for seeding (planting) purposes or cleaning must be accompanied by a certificate of analysis issued by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency or by a private seed laboratory accredited by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Samples of seed shall be drawn using sampling methods comparable to those detailed in § 361.5 of this part. The seed analyst who examines the seed at the laboratory must be accredited to analyze the kind of seed covered by the certificate.
            (1) If the seed is being imported for seeding (planting) purposes, the certificate of analysis must verify that the seed meets the noxious weed seed tolerances of § 361.6. Such seed will not be subject to the sampling requirements of § 361.3(b).
            (2) If the seed is being imported for cleaning, the certificate of analysis must name the kinds of noxious weed seeds that are to be removed from the lot of seed. Seed being imported for cleaning must be consigned to a facility operated in accordance with § 361.8(a).
            (b) Coated or pelleted agricultural seed and coated or pelleted vegetable seed of Canadian origin may be imported into the United States if the seed was analyzed prior to being coated or pelleted and is accompanied by a certificate of analysis issued in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
            (c) Screenings otherwise prohibited under this part may be imported from Canada if the screenings are imported for processing or manufacture and are consigned to a facility operating under a compliance agreement as provided by § 361.8(b).

            § 361.8
            Cleaning of imported seed and processing of certain Canadian-origin screenings.

            (a) Imported seed that is found to contain noxious weed seeds at a level higher than the tolerances set forth in § 361.6(b) may be cleaned under the monitoring of an APHIS inspector. The cleaning will be at the expense of the owner or consignee.
            
            (1) At the location where the seed is being cleaned, the identity of the seed must be maintained at all times to the satisfaction of the Administrator. The refuse from the cleaning must be placed in containers and securely sealed and identified. Upon completion of the cleaning, a representative sample of the seed will be analyzed by a registered seed technologist, an official seed laboratory, or by APHIS; if the seed is found to be within the noxious weed tolerances set forth in § 361.6(b), the seed may be allowed entry into the United States;
            (2) The refuse from the cleaning must be destroyed under the monitoring of an APHIS inspector at the expense of the owner or consignee of the seed.
            (3) Any person engaged in the business of cleaning imported seed may enter into a compliance agreement under paragraph (c) of this section to facilitate the cleaning of seed imported into the United States under this part.
            (b) Any person engaged in the business of processing screenings who wishes to process screenings imported from Canada under § 361.7(c) that are otherwise prohibited under this part must enter into a compliance agreement under paragraph (c) of this section.
            (c) A compliance agreement for the cleaning of imported seed or processing of otherwise prohibited screenings from Canada shall be a written agreement 1
               between a person engaged in such a business, the State in which the business operates, and APHIS, wherein the person agrees to comply with the provisions of this part and any conditions imposed pursuant thereto. Any compliance agreement may be canceled orally or in writing by the APHIS inspector who is monitoring its enforcement whenever the inspector finds that the person who entered into the compliance agreement has failed to comply with the provisions of this part or any conditions imposed pursuant thereto. If the cancellation is oral, the decision and the reasons for the decision shall be confirmed in writing, as promptly as circumstances permit. Any person whose compliance agreement has been canceled may appeal the decision to the Administrator, in writing, within 10 days after receiving written notification of the cancellation. The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the compliance agreement was wrongfully canceled. The Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for such decision, as promptly as circumstances permit. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall be held to resolve such conflict. Rules of practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.
            
              
                1 Compliance Agreement forms are available without charge from Permit Unit, PPQ, APHIS, 4700 River Road Unit 136, Riverdale, MD 20737-1236, and from local offices of the Plant Protection and Quarantine. (Local offices are listed in telephone directories).
            
          
          
            § 361.9
            Recordkeeping.
            (a) Each person importing agricultural seed or vegetable seed under this part must maintain a complete record, including copies of the declaration and labeling required under this part and a sample of seed, for each lot of seed imported. Except for the seed sample, which may be discarded 1 year after the entire lot represented by the sample has been disposed of by the person who imported the seed, the records must be maintained for 3 years following the importation.
            (b) Each sample of vegetable seed and each sample of agricultural seed must be at least equal in weight to the sample size prescribed for noxious weed seed examination in table 1 of § 361.5.
            (c) An APHIS inspector shall, during normal business hours, be allowed to inspect and copy the records.

            § 361.10
            Costs and charges.

            Unless a user fee is payable under § 354.3 of this chapter, the services of an APHIS inspector during regularly assigned hours of duty and at the usual places of duty will be furnished without cost. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's provisions relating to overtime charges for an APHIS inspector's services are set forth in part 354 of this chapter. The U.S. Department of Agriculture will not be responsible for any costs or charges incident to inspections or compliance with this part, other than for the services of the APHIS inspector during regularly assigned hours of duty and at the usual places of duty. All expenses incurred by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (including travel, per diem or subsistence, and salaries of officers or employees of the Department) in connection with the monitoring of cleaning, labeling, other reconditioning, or destruction of seed, screenings, or refuse under this part shall be reimbursed by the owner or consignee of the seed or screenings.

            Scope and purpose.
            These regulations are issued pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552), and in accordance with the requirements of the Department of Agriculture regulations in part 1, subpart A of this title. The availability of records of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), and the procedures by which the public may obtain such information, shall be governed by the Department regulations as implemented by the regulations in this part. It is the policy of APHIS to be an open agency and to promptly make available for public inspection any records or information which are required to be released under the Act. Material which is exempt from disclosure will also be promptly made available when the Agency in its discretion determines that release of such material is in the public interest.
          
          
            § 370.2
            Published materials.

            Rules and regulations of APHIS relating to its regulatory responsibilities are continuously published in the Federal Register, and codified in this chapter III, title 7, and in 9 CFR chapter I. APHIS issues publications explaining animal and plant health programs and the laws and regulations, including quarantines, under which the programs are conducted. These publications are, for the most part available free from the Office of Governmental and Public Affairs, USDA, Washington, DC 20250; or, in some cases from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, at established rates.

            Index.
            Pursuant to the regulations in § 1.4(b) of this title, APHIS will maintain and make available for public inspection and copying a current index providing identifying information regarding the materials required to be published or made available under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)). Notice is hereby given that publication of this index is unnecessary and impracticable, since the material is voluminous and does not change often enough to justify the expense of publication.
          
          
            § 370.4
            Facilities for inspection and copying.

            Facilities for public inspection and copying of the index and materials required to be made available under 5 U.S.C. 552(c)(2) will be provided by APHIS, on business days between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Requests for this information should be made to the FOIA Coordinator at the following address:
            
            
              Freedom of Information Act Coordinator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Legislative and Public Affairs, Freedom of Information, 4700 River Road, Unit 50, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1231.
            
            
            Copies of such material may be obtained in person or by mail. Applicable fees for copies will be charged in accordance with the regulations prescribed by the Office of Operations and Finance, USDA, pursuant to § 2.75 of this title. See § 1.10 and appendix A—Fee Schedule in part 1, subtitle A of this title.

            Requests for records.

            (a) Requests for APHIS records or information other than material published or made available under the preceding sections, shall be made in writing in accordance with 7 CFR 1.3(a) and submitted to the APHIS Freedom of Information Act Coordinator at the following address:
            
            
              Freedom of Information Act Coordinator, (FOIA Request), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Legislative and Public Affairs, Freedom of Information, 4700 River Road, Unit 50, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1231.
            
            
            The request shall identify each record with reasonable specificity as prescribed in § 1.3(b) of this title. The APHIS FOIA Coordinator is hereby delegated authority to make determinations with respect to such requests in accordance with 7 CFR.
            (b) The FOIA Coordinator or his designee is authorized to receive requests and to exercise the authority under § 1.4(c) of this title to:
            (1) Make determinations to grant or deny requests,
            (2) Extend the administrative deadline,
            (3) Make discretionary releases of exempt records, and

            Purpose.
            These procedures implement section 102(2) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by assuring early and adequate consideration of environmental factors in Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service planning and decisionmaking and by promoting the effective, efficient integration of all relevant environmental requirements under the NEPA. The goal of timely, relevant environmental analysis will be secured principally by adhering to the NEPA implementing regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), especially provisions pertaining to timing (§ 1502.5), integration (§ 1502.25), and scope of analysis (§ 1508.25).

            § 372.5
            Classification of actions.
            (a) Actions normally requiring environmental impact statements. This class of policymakings and rulemakings seeks to establish programmatic approaches to animal and plant health issues. Actions in this class typically involve the agency, an entire program, or a substantial program component and are characterized by their broad scope (often global or nationwide) and potential effect (impacting a wide range of environmental quality values or indicators, whether or not affected individuals or systems may be completely identified at the time). Ordinarily, new or untried methodologies, strategies, or techniques to deal with pervasive threats to animal and plant health are the subjects of this class of actions. Alternative means of dealing with those threats usually have not been well developed. Actions in this class include:
            (1) Formulation of contingent response strategies to combat future widespread outbreaks of animal and plant diseases; and
            (2) Adoption of strategic or other long-range plans that purport to adopt for future program application a preferred course of action.
            (b) Actions normally requiring environmental assessments but not necessarily environmental impact statements. This class of APHIS actions may involve the agency as a whole or an entire program, but generally is related to a more discrete program component and is characterized by its limited scope (particular sites, species, or activities) and potential effect (impacting relatively few environmental values or systems). Potential environmental impacts associated with the proposed action are not considered potentially significant at the outset of the planning process. Any effects of the action on environmental resources (such as air, water, soil, plant communities, animal populations, or others) or indicators (such as dissolved oxygen content of water) can be reasonably identified, and mitigation measures are generally available and have been successfully employed. Unless the actions are categorically excluded as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, actions in this class include:
            (1) Policymakings and rulemakings that seek to remedy specific animal and plant health risks or that may affect opportunities on the part of the public to influence agency environmental planning and decisionmaking. Examples of this category of actions include:
            (i) Development of program plans that seek to adopt strategies, methods, and techniques as the means of dealing with particular animal and plant health risks that may arise in the future; and
            (ii) Implementation of program plans at the site-specific, action level.
            (2) Planning, design, construction, or acquisition of new facilities, or proposals for modifications to existing facilities.
            (3) Disposition of waste and other hazardous or toxic materials at laboratories and other APHIS facilities.
            (4) Approvals and issuance of permits for proposals involving regulated genetically engineered organisms or products, or regulated nonindigenous species.
            (5) Programs or statewide activities to reduce damage or harm by a specific wildlife species or group of species, such as deer or birds, or to reduce a specific type of damage or harm, such as protection of agriculture from wildlife depredation and disease; for the management of rabies in wildlife; or for the protection of threatened or endangered species.
            (6) Research or testing that will be conducted outside of a laboratory or other containment area or reaches a stage of development (e.g., formulation of premarketing strategies) that forecasts an irretrievable commitment to the resulting products or technology.
            (7) Determination of nonregulated status for genetically engineered organisms.
            (c) Categorically excluded actions. This class of APHIS actions shares many of the same characteristics—particularly in terms of the extent of program involvement, as well as the scope, effect of, and the availability of alternatives to proposed actions—as the class of actions that normally requires environmental assessments but not necessarily environmental impact statements. The major difference is that the means through which adverse environmental impacts may be avoided or minimized have actually been built right into the actions themselves. The efficacy of this approach generally has been established through testing and/or monitoring. The Department of Agriculture has also promulgated a listing of categorical exclusions that are applicable to all agencies within the department unless their procedures provide otherwise. Those categorical exclusions, codified at 7 CFR 1b.3(a), are entirely appropriate for APHIS. Other actions in this class include:
            (1) Routine measures. (i) Routine measures, such as identifications, inspections, surveys, sampling that does not cause physical alteration of the environment, testing, seizures, quarantines, removals, sanitizing, inoculations, control, and monitoring employed by agency programs to pursue their missions and functions. Such measures may include the use—according to any label instructions or other lawful requirements and consistent with standard, published program practices and precautions—of chemicals, pesticides, or other potentially hazardous or harmful substances, materials, and target-specific devices or remedies, provided that such use meets all of the following criteria (insofar as they may pertain to a particular action):
            
            (A) The use is localized or contained in areas where humans are not likely to be exposed, and is limited in terms of quantity, i.e., individualized dosages and remedies;
            (B) The use will not cause contaminants to enter water bodies, including wetlands;
            (C) The use does not adversely affect any federally protected species or critical habitat; and
            (D) The use does not cause bioaccumulation.
            (ii) Examples of routine measures include:
            (A) Inoculation or treatment of discrete herds of livestock or wildlife undertaken in contained areas (such as a barn or corral, a zoo, an exhibition, or an aviary);
            (B) Use of vaccinations or inoculations including new vaccines (e.g., genetically engineered vaccines) and applications of existing vaccines to new species provided that the project is conducted in a controlled and limited manner, and the impacts of the vaccine can be predicted; and
            (C) Isolated (for example, along a highway) weed control efforts.
            (2) Research and development activities. (i) Activities limited in magnitude, frequency, and scope that occur in laboratories, facilities, pens, or field sites. Examples are:
            (A) Vaccination trials that occur on groups of animals in areas designed to limit interaction with similar animals, or include other controls needed to mitigate potential risk.
            (B) Laboratory research involving the evaluation and use of chemicals in a manner not specifically listed on the product label pursuant to applicable Federal authorizations.
            (C) The development and/or production (including formulation, packaging or repackaging, movement, and distribution) of articles such as program materials, devices, reagents, and biologics that were approved and/or licensed in accordance with existing regulations, or that are for evaluation in confined animal, plant, or insect populations under conditions that prevent exposure to the general population.
            (D) Research evaluating wildlife management products or tools, such as animal repellents, frightening devices, or fencing, that is carried out in a manner and area designed to eliminate the potential for harmful environmental effects and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.
            (ii) Development, production, and release of sterile insects.
            (3) Licensing and permitting.
            
            (i) Issuance of a license, permit, authorization, or approval to ship or field test previously unlicensed veterinary biologics, including veterinary biologics containing genetically engineered organisms (such as vector-based vaccines and nucleic acid-based vaccines);
            (ii) Issuance of a license, permit, authorization, or approval for movement or uses of pure cultures of organisms (relatively free of extraneous micro-organisms and extraneous material) that are not strains of quarantine concern and occur, or are likely to occur, in a State's environment; or
            (iii) Permitting, or acknowledgment of notifications for, confined field releases of genetically engineered organisms and products; and
            (iv) Permitting of:
            (A) Importation of nonindigenous species into containment facilities,
            (B) Interstate movement of nonindigenous species between containment facilities, or
            (C) Releases into a State's environment of pure cultures of organisms that are either native or are established introductions.
            (4) Extending deregulations for genetically engineered organisms. Extension of nonregulated status under part 340 of this chapter to organisms similar to those already deregulated.
            (5) Minor renovation, improvement, and maintenance of facilities. Examples are:
            (i) Renovation of existing laboratories and other facilities.
            (ii) Functional replacement of parts and equipment.
            (iii) Minor additions to existing facilities.
            (iv) Minor excavations of land and repairs to properties.
            (d) Exceptions for categorically excluded actions. Whenever the decisionmaker determines that a categorically excluded action may have the potential to affect “significantly” the quality of the “human environment,” as those terms are defined at 40 CFR 1508.27 and 1508.14, respectively, an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement will be prepared. For example:
            (1) When any routine measure, the incremental impact of which, when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions (regardless of what agency or person undertakes such actions), has the potential for significant environmental impact;
            (2) When a previously licensed or approved biologic has been subsequently shown to be unsafe, or will be used at substantially higher dosage levels or for substantially different applications or circumstances than in the use for which the product was previously approved; or
            (3) When a confined field release of genetically engineered organisms or products involves new species or organisms or novel modifications that raise new issues.

            § 372.7
            Planning and decision points and public involvement.
            (a) Major planning and decisions points. The NEPA process will be fully coordinated with APHIS planning in cooperation with program personnel. Specific decision points or milestones will be identified and communicated to the public and others in a notice of intent and in the context of the public scoping process.
            (b) Public involvement. There will be an early and open process for determining the scope of issues to be addressed in the environmental impact statement process.

            (1) A notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement will be published in the Federal Register as soon as it is determined that a proposed major Federal action has the potential to affect significantly the quality of the human environment. The notice may include a preliminary scope of environmental study. All public and other involvement in APHIS' environmental impact statement process, including the scoping process, commenting on draft documents, and participation in the preparation of any supplemental documents, will be pursuant to CEQ's implementing regulations.
            (2) Opportunities for public involvement in the environmental assessment process will be announced in the same fashion as the availability of environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact.

            (3) Notification of the availability of environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact for proposed activities will be published in the Federal Register, unless it is determined that the effects of the action are primarily of regional or local concern. Where the effects of the action are primarily of regional or local concern, notice will normally be provided through publication in a local or area newspaper of general circulation and/or the procedures implementing Executive Order 12372, “Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs.”

            (4) All environmental documents and comments received will be made available to the public via Regulations.gov.

            § 372.8
            Processing and use of environmental documents.
            (a) Environmental assessments will be forwarded immediately upon completion to the decisionmaker for a determination of whether the proposed action may have significant effects on the quality of the human environment, and for the execution, as appropriate, of a finding of no significant impact or a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. This determination is based on information provided in the NEPA document and available in the record.
            (1) The availability of environmental assessments will be announced by publishing a notice consistent with the notification provisions of § 372.7.

            (2) Comments, if any, will be transmitted, together with any analyses and recommendations, to the APHIS decisionmaker who may then take appropriate action.
            (3) Changes to environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact that are prompted by comments, new information, or any other source, will normally be announced in the same manner as the notice of availability prior to implementing the proposed action or any alternative. APHIS will mail notice upon request.
            (b) Environmental impact statements will be processed from inception (publication of the notice of intent) to completion (publication of a final environmental impact statement or a supplement) according to the Council on Environmental Quality implementing regulations.
            (c) For rulemaking or adjudicatory proceedings, relevant environmental documents, comments, and responses will be a part of the administrative record.
            (d) For all APHIS activity that is subject to the NEPA process, relevant environmental documents, comments, and responses will accompany proposals through the review process.
            (e) The APHIS decisionmaker will consider the alternatives discussed in environmental documents in reaching a determination on the merits of proposed actions.
            (f) APHIS will implement mitigation and other conditions established in environmental documentation and committed to as part of the decisionmaking process.

            § 372.9
            Supplementing environmental impact statements.
            Once a decision to supplement an environmental impact statement is made, a notice of intent will be published. The supplemental document will then be processed in the same fashion (exclusive of scoping) as a draft and a final statement (unless alternative procedures are approved by CEQ) and will become part of the record.

            § 372.10
            Process for rapid response to emergencies.
            When it is determined (by the Administrator or the delegated Agency official responsible for environmental review) that an emergency exists that requires immediate action before preparing and completing the usual NEPA review, then the provisions of this section apply.
            (a) The Administrator or the delegated Agency official responsible for environmental review may take actions that are necessary to control the immediate impacts of the emergency and that are urgently needed to prevent imminent damage to public health or safety, or prevent threats to valuable resources. When taking such actions, the Administrator or the delegated Agency official responsible for environmental review will consider the probable environmental consequences of the emergency action and mitigate foreseeable adverse environmental effects to the extent practicable.
            (b) If a proposed emergency action is normally analyzed in an environmental assessment as described in § 372.5 and the nature and scope of proposed emergency actions are such that there is insufficient time to prepare an EA and FONSI before commencing the proposed action, the Administrator shall consult with APHIS' Chief of Environmental and Risk Analysis Services about alternative arrangements for NEPA compliance. APHIS' Chief of Environmental and Risk Analysis Services may authorize emergency alternative arrangements for completing the required NEPA compliance documentation. Any alternative arrangements must be documented and notice of their use provided to CEQ.

            (c) If a proposed emergency action is likely to result in significant environmental impacts, then APHIS will immediately consult with CEQ and request alternative arrangements in accordance with CEQ regulations at 40 CFR 1506.11. Such alternative arrangements will apply only to the proposed actions necessary to control the immediate impacts of the emergency. Other proposed actions remain subject to NEPA analysis and documentation in accordance with the CEQ regulations and these regulations.
