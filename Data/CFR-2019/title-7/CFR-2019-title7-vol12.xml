      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(a) No departures are to be made to the prescribed Rural Development USoA without the prior written approval of Rural Development. Requests for departures from the Rural Development USoA shall be addressed, in writing, to the Assistant Administrator, Program Accounting and Regulatory Analysis. (AA-PARA).</P>
              <P>(b) RUS borrowers subject to the jurisdiction of a state regulatory authority with jurisdiction over rates and/or accounting for electric utilities will not:</P>
              <P>(1) Request approval of such authority to use accounting methodologies and principles that depart from the provisions herein; or</P>
              <P>(2) File with such authority, any documents or information, including without limitation, any filings associated with the borrower's rates, based upon accounting methods and principles inconsistent with the provisions of this part.</P>
              <P>(c) If any state regulatory authority with jurisdiction over an RUS borrower prescribes accounting methods or principles for the borrower that are inconsistent with the provisions of this part, the borrower must immediately notify the Director, BAD, and provide such documents, information, and reports as RUS may request to evaluate the impact that such accounting methods or principles may have on the interests of RUS.</P>
              <P>(1) If RUS determines that the accounting methods and principles do not adversely impact RUS interests, RUS will permit the borrower to use the accounting methods and principles as prescribed by the state regulatory authority to comply with the provisions of the RUS loan documents.</P>
              <P>(2) If RUS determines that the accounting methods and principles may adversely impact RUS's interests, RUS may require that, for the purposes of complying with provisions of RUS loan documents, including, without limitation, those provisions relating to financial coverage standards (e.g. “TIER”), the borrower continue to maintain books, records, and accounts in accordance with this subpart.</P>
              <P>(i) RUS may, however, approve requests by the borrower to maintain such additional books, records, and accounts as necessary to comply with the requirements of the state regulatory authority.</P>
              <P>(ii) Such approval will not waive, modify or amend the requirements of the RUS loan documents or of this subpart.</P>

              <P>(d) RUS borrowers will not implement the provisions of Statement of <PRTPAGE P="12"/>Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, SFAS No. 90, Regulated Enterprises—Accounting for Abandonments and Disallowances of Plant Costs, SFAS No. 92, Regulated Enterprises—Accounting for Phase-in Plans, without the prior written approval of RUS except as provided for in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section. Requests for approval shall be addressed, in writing, to the Director, PASD. The specific deferrals set forth in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section may be implemented without the prior written approval of RUS provided that the deferrals comply with Statement No. 71 and that the RUS borrowers implementing such deferrals continue to meet the requirements set forth in Statement No. 71 for doing so:</P>
              <P>(1) The deferral and amortization of prior service pension costs (See § 1767.41, Interpretation No. 606, Pension Costs), remapping expenses (See § 1767.41, Interpretation No. 613, Mapping Costs), and preliminary survey and investigation charges (See § 1767.17, Interpretation No. 111, Engineering Contracts for System Planning);</P>
              <P>(2) The deferral of any current period expense or expenses, on a cumulative basis for the fiscal year, only if a borrower would have met each of its financial tests or coverage ratios that it has covenanted with RUS to meet for that fiscal year, had the deferral not been made;</P>
              <P>(3) The deferral of any cost that will be fully amortized within the next 12 succeeding months;</P>
              <P>(4) The accelerated amortization of any previously deferred expense; and</P>
              <P>(5) The deferral of revenues coincident with a moratorium imposed by the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association on its Retirement and Security Program, provided, however, that the deferral is for the sole purpose of offsetting future pension costs.</P>
              <P>(e) RUS will consider approval of specific departures from this part upon submission of:</P>
              <P>(1) A detailed description of the proposed departure;</P>
              <P>(2) The specific accounting journal entries that will be used including the account number and title, and the dollar amounts where appropriate;</P>
              <P>(3) The total dollar amount of the departure and the impact on margins during the time period of the departure; and</P>
              <P>(4) A resolution from the borrower's Board of Directors authorizing such action; and</P>
              <P>(5) Any additional information RUS may deem necessary to adequately evaluate the borrower's request.</P>
              <P>(f) RUS will, within 90 days of final receipt of this information, render a decision on the borrower's request for a departure from the prescribed RUS USoA.</P>
              <P>(1) If, due to extenuating circumstances, RUS is unable to reach a decision within the required time period, RUS will notify the borrower of the delay within this same 90-day period, and provide a projected decision date.</P>
              <P>(2) The requested departure from the prescribed RUS USoA must not be implemented until final approval is granted by RUS.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(3) The books and records referred to herein include not only accounting records in a limited technical sense, but all other records, such as minute books, stock books, reports, correspondence, memoranda, etc., which may be useful in developing the history of or facts regarding any transaction.</P>

              <P>(2) In certain instances, numbers have been skipped in order to allow for possible later expansion or to permit better coordination with the numbering system for other utility departments.</P>
              <P>(3) The numbers prefixed to account titles are to be considered as parts of the titles.</P>
              <P>(i) Each utility, however, may adopt, for its own purposes, a different system of account numbers provided that the numbers herein prescribed shall appear in the descriptive headings of the ledger accounts and in the various sources of original entry.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a utility uses a different group of account numbers and it is not practicable to show the prescribed account numbers in the various sources of original entry, such reference to the prescribed account numbers may be omitted from the various sources of original entry.</P>
              <P>(iii) Each utility using different account numbers for its own purposes shall keep readily available, a list of such account numbers which it uses and a reconciliation of such account numbers with the account numbers provided herein.</P>
              <P>(iv) The utility's records shall be so kept as to permit ready analysis by prescribed accounts (by direct reference to sources of original entry to the extent practicable) and to permit preparation of financial and operating statements directly from such records at the end of each accounting period according to the prescribed accounts.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Accounting period.</E> (1) Each utility shall keep its books on a monthly basis so that for each month, all transactions applicable thereto, as nearly as may be ascertained, shall be entered in the books of the utility.</P>
              <P>(2) Amounts applicable or assignable to specific utility departments shall be so segregated monthly.</P>
              <P>(3) Each utility shall close its books at the end of each fiscal year unless otherwise authorized by RUS.</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Item lists.</E> (1) Lists of “items” appearing in the texts of the accounts or elsewhere herein are for the purpose of more clearly indicating the application of the prescribed accounting.</P>
              <P>(2) The lists are intended to be representative, but not exhaustive.</P>

              <P>(3) The appearance of an item in a list warrants the inclusion of the item in the account mentioned only when the text of the account also indicates <PRTPAGE P="14"/>inclusion inasmuch as the same item frequently appears in more than one list.</P>
              <P>(4) The proper entry in each instance must be determined by the texts of the accounts.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Extraordinary items.</E> (1) Net income shall reflect all items of profit and loss during the period with the exception of prior period adjustments as described in § 1767.15 (g) and long-term debt as described in § 1767.15 (q).</P>
              <P>(2) Those items related to the effects of events and transactions which have occurred during the current period and which are not typical or customary business activities of the company shall be considered extraordinary items.</P>
              <P>(3) They will be events and transactions of significant effect which would not be expected to recur frequently and which would not be considered as recurring factors in any evaluation of the ordinary operating processes of business.</P>
              <P>(i) In determining significance, items of a similar nature should be considered in the aggregate.</P>
              <P>(ii) Dissimilar items should be considered individually; however, if they are few in number, they may be considered in the aggregate.</P>
              <P>(iii) To be considered as extraordinary under the above guidelines, an item should be more than approximately 5 percent of income, computed before extraordinary items.</P>
              <P>(iv) RUS approval must be obtained to treat an item of less than 5 percent, as extraordinary. (See Accounts 434 and 435.)</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Prior period items.</E> (1) Items of profit and loss related to the following shall be accounted for as prior period adjustments and excluded from the determination of net income for the current year:</P>

              <P>(ii) Adjustments that result from realization of income tax benefits of preacquisition operating loss carryforwards of purchased subsidiaries.</P>

              <P>(h) <E T="03">Unaudited items.</E> (1) Whenever a financial statement is required by RUS, if it is known that a transaction has occurred which affects the accounts but the amount involved in the transaction and its effect upon the accounts cannot be determined with absolute accuracy, the amount shall be estimated and such estimated amount included in the proper accounts.</P>
              <P>(2) The utility is not required to anticipate minor items which would not appreciably affect the accounts.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Distribution of pay and expenses of employees.</E> Charges to electric plant, operating expense, and other accounts for services and expenses of employees engaged in activities chargeable to various accounts, such as construction, maintenance, and operations, shall be based upon the actual time engaged in the respective classes of work, or in case that method is impracticable, upon the basis of a study of the time actually engaged during a representative period.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Payroll distribution.</E> (1) Underlying accounting data shall be maintained so that the distribution of the cost of labor charged direct to the various accounts will be readily available.</P>
              <P>(2) Such underlying data shall permit a reasonably accurate distribution to be made of the cost of labor charged initially to clearing accounts so that the total labor cost may be classified among construction, cost of removal, electric operating functions (steam generation, nuclear generation, hydraulic generation, transmission, distribution, etc.) and nonutility operations.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Accounting on an accrual basis.</E> (1) The utility is required to keep its accounts on the accrual basis.</P>
              <P>(i) This requires the inclusion, in its accounts, of all known transactions of appreciable amount which affect the accounts.</P>
              <P>(ii) If bills covering such transactions have not been received or rendered, the amounts shall be estimated and appropriate adjustments made when the bills are received.</P>

              <P>(2) When payments are made in advance for items such as insurance, rents, taxes, or interest, the amount applicable to future periods shall be charged to Account 165, Prepayments, <PRTPAGE P="15"/>and spread over the periods to which applicable, by credits to Account 165, and charges to the accounts appropriate for the expenditure.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Records for each plant.</E> (1) Separate records shall be maintained by electric plant accounts of the book cost of each plant owned, including additions by the utility to plant leased from others, and of the cost of operating and maintaining each plant owned or operated.</P>
              <P>(2) The term “plant” as used herein includes each generating station and each transmission line or appropriate group of transmission lines.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Accounting for other departments.</E> (1) If the utility also operates other utility departments, such as gas or water, it shall keep such accounts for the other departments as may be prescribed by proper authority and in the absence of prescribed accounts, it shall keep such accounts as are proper or necessary to reflect the results of operating each such department.</P>
              <P>(2) It is not intended that proprietary and similar accounts which apply to the utility as a whole shall be departmentalized.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Transactions with associated companies.</E> (1) Each utility shall keep its accounts and records so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously statements of all transactions with associated companies.</P>
              <P>(2) The statements may be required to show the general nature of the transactions, the amounts involved therein and the amounts included in each account prescribed herein with respect to such transactions. Transactions with associated companies shall be recorded in the appropriate accounts for transactions of the same nature. Nothing herein contained, however, shall be construed as restraining the utility from subdividing accounts for the purpose of recording separately transactions with associated companies.</P>
              <P>(o) <E T="03">Contingent assets and liabilities.</E> (1) Contingent assets represent a possible source of value to the utility contingent upon the fulfillment of conditions regarded as uncertain.</P>
              <P>(2) Contingent liabilities include items which may, under certain conditions, become obligations of the utility but which are neither direct nor assumed liabilities at the date of the balance sheet. The utility shall be prepared to give a complete statement of significant contingent assets and liabilities (including cumulative dividends on preference stock) in its audited financial statements; its RUS Form 7, Financial and Statistical Report, or its RUS Form 12, Operating Report—Financial; and at such other times as may be requested by RUS.</P>
              <P>(p) <E T="03">Separate accounts or records for each licensed project.</E> The accounts or records of each borrower shall be so kept as to show for each project (including pumped storage) under license:</P>
              <P>(1) The actual legitimate original cost of the project, including the original cost of the original project, the original cost of additions thereto and betterments thereof, and credits for property retired from service, as determined under RUS's regulations in 7 CFR chapter XVII;</P>
              <P>(2) The charges for operation and maintenance of the project property directly assignable to the project;</P>
              <P>(3) The credits and debits to the depreciation and amortization accounts, and the balances in such accounts; and</P>

                <P>The purpose of this instruction is to insure that accounts or records are currently maintained by each borrower from which reports may be made to RUS for use in determining the net investment in each licensed project.

              <P>(5) When the utility recognizes the loss in the year of reacquisition as a tax deduction, Account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, shall be debited and Account 283, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other, shall be credited with the amount of the related tax effect, such amount to be allocated to the periods affected in accordance with the provisions of Account 283.</P>
              <P>(6) When the utility chooses to recognize the gain in the year of reacquisition as a taxable gain, Account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Utility Operating Income, shall be debited with the amount of the related tax effect, such amount to be allocated to the periods affected in accordance with the provisions of Account 190, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes.</P>

              <P>(7) When the utility chooses to use the optional privilege of deferring the <PRTPAGE P="17"/>tax on the gain attributable to the reacquisition of debt by reducing the depreciable basis of utility property for tax purposes, pursuant to Section 108 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 108), the related tax effects shall be deferred as the income is recognized for accounting purposes, and the deferred amounts shall be amortized over the life of the associated property on a vintage year basis.</P>
              <P>(i) Account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, shall be debited, and Account 282, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other Property, shall be credited with an amount equal to the estimated income tax effect applicable to the portion of the income, attributable to reacquired debt, recognized for accounting purposes during the period.</P>
              <P>(ii) Account 282 shall be debited and Account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Utility Operating Income, shall be credited with an amount equal to the estimated income tax effects, during the life of the property, attributable to the reduction in the depreciable basis for tax purposes.</P>
              <P>(8) The tax effects relating to gain or loss shall be allocated as above to utility operations except in cases where a portion of the debt reacquired is directly applicable to nonutility operations.</P>
              <P>(i) In that event, the related portion of the tax effects shall be allocated to nonutility operations.</P>
              <P>(ii) Where it can be established that reacquired debt is generally applicable to both utility and nonutility operations, the tax effects shall be allocated between utility and nonutility operations based on the ratio of net investment in utility plant to net investment in nonutility plant.</P>
              <P>(9) Premium, discount, or expense on debt shall not be included as an element in the cost of construction or acquisition of property (tangible or intangible), except under the provisions of Account 432, Allowance for Borrowed Funds Used During Construction—Credit.</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Alternate method.</E> Where a regulatory authority or a group of regulatory authorities having prime rate jurisdiction over the utility specifically disallows the rate principle of amortizing gains or losses on reacquisition of long-term debt without refunding, and does not apply the gain or loss to reduce interest charges in computing the allowed rate of return for rate purposes, the following alternate method may be used to account for gains or losses relating to reacquisition of long-term debt, with or without refunding:</P>
              <P>(i) The difference between the amount paid upon reacquisition of any long-term debt and the face value, adjusted for unamortized discount, expenses or premium, as the case may be, applicable to the debt redeemed shall be recognized currently in income and recorded in Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or Account 426.5, Other Deductions.</P>
              <P>(ii) When this alternate method of accounting is used, the utility shall include a footnote to each financial statement, prepared for public use, explaining why this method is being used along with the treatment given for ratemaking purposes.</P>
              <P>(r) <E T="03">Comprehensive interperiod income tax allocation.</E> (1) Where there are timing differences between the periods in which transactions affect taxable income and the periods in which they enter into the determination of pretax accounting income, the income tax effects of such transactions are to be recognized in the periods in which the differences between book accounting income and taxable income arise and in the periods in which the differences reverse using the deferred tax method.</P>
              <P>(2) Comprehensive interperiod tax allocation should be followed whenever transactions enter into the determination of pretax accounting income for the period even though some transactions may affect the determination of taxes payable in a different period.</P>
              <P>(3) Utilities are not required to utilize comprehensive interperiod income tax allocation until the deferred income taxes are included as an expense in the rate level by the regulatory authority having rate jurisdiction over the utility.</P>

              <P>(4) Where comprehensive interperiod tax allocation accounting is not practiced the utility shall include as a note to each financial statement, prepared for public use, a footnote explanation <PRTPAGE P="18"/>setting forth the utility's accounting policies with respect to interperiod tax allocation and describing the treatment for rate making purposes of the tax timing differences by regulatory authorities having rate jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(5) Should the utility be subject to more than one agency having rate jurisdiction, its accounts shall appropriately reflect the ratemaking treatment (deferral or flow through) of each jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(6) Once comprehensive interperiod tax allocation has been initiated either in whole or in part it shall be practiced on a consistent basis and shall not be changed or discontinued without prior RUS approval.</P>
              <P>(7) Tax effects deferred currently will be recorded as deferred debits or deferred credits in Accounts 190, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes; 281, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Accelerated Amortization Property; 282, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other Property, and 283, Accumulated Deferred Taxes—Other, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(8) The resulting amounts recorded in these accounts shall be disposed of as prescribed in this system of accounts or as otherwise authorized by RUS.</P>
              <P>(s) <E T="03">Criteria for classifying leases.</E> (1) If, at its inception, a lease meets one or more of the following criteria, the lease shall be classified as a capital lease:</P>
              <P>(i) The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the end of the lease term.</P>
              <P>(ii) The lease contains a bargain purchase option.</P>
              <P>(iii) The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated economic life of the leased property. However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the leased property, including earlier years of use, this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease.</P>
              <P>(iv) The present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, including any profit thereon, equals or exceed 90 percent of the excess of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at the inception of the lease over any related investment tax credit retained by the lessor and expected to be realized by lessor.</P>
              <P>(A) However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the leased property, including earlier years of use, this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease.</P>
              <P>(B) The lessee utility shall compute the present value of the minimum lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate, unless it is practicable for the utility to learn the implicit rate computed by the lessor, and the implicit rate computed by the lessor is less than the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. If both of those conditions are met, the lessee shall use the implicit rate.</P>
              <P>(2) If, at any time, the lessee and lessor agree to change the provisions of the lease, other than by renewing the lease or extending its term, in a manner that would have resulted in a different classification of the lease under the criteria in paragraph (s)(1) of this section had the changed terms been in effect at the inception of the lease, the revised agreement shall be considered as a new agreement over its term, and the criteria in paragraph (s)(1) of this section shall be applied for purposes of the expiration of the existing lease term, such as the exercise of a lease renewal option other than those already included in the lease term, shall be considered as a new agreement and shall be classified according to the above provision. Changes in estimates (for example, changes in estimates of the economic life or of the residual value of the leased property) or changes in circumstances (for example, default by the lessee) shall not give rise to a new classification of a lease for accounting purposes.</P>
              <P>(t) <E T="03">Accounting for leases.</E> (1) All leases shall be classified as either capital or operating leases.</P>

              <P>(2) The utility shall record a capital lease as an asset in Account 101.1, Property Under Capital Leases, Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel Under Capital Leases or Account 121, Nonutility Property;<PRTPAGE P="19"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The utility, as a lessee, shall recognize an asset retirement obligation arising from the plant under a capital lease unless the obligation is recorded as an asset and liability under a capital lease. The utility shall record the asset retirement cost by debiting Account 101.1, Property Under Capital Leases, or Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel Under Capital Leases, or Account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate, and crediting the liability for the asset retirement obligation in Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations. Asset retirement costs recorded in Account 101.1, Account 120.6, or Account 121 shall be amortized by charging rent expense, or Account 518, Nuclear Fuel Expense, or Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, as appropriate, and crediting a separate subaccount of the account in which the asset retirement costs are recorded. Charges for the periodic accretion of the liability in Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations, shall be recorded by a charge to Account 411.10, Accretion Expense, for electric utility plant, and Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, for nonutility plant and a credit to Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations.</P>
              <P>(4) Rental payments on all leases shall be charged to rent expense, fuel expense, construction work in progress, or other appropriate accounts as they become payable.</P>
              <P>(5) For a capital lease, for each period during the lease term, the amounts recorded for the asset and obligation shall be reduced by an amount equal to the portion of each lease payment that would have been allocated to the reduction of the obligation, if the payment had been treated as a payment on an installment obligation (liability) and allocated between interest expense and a reduction of the obligation so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance.</P>
              <P>(u) <E T="03">Allowances.</E> (1) Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399, 2584 (42 U.S.C. 7407 and 42 U.S.C. 7651), provides for the issuance of allowances as a means to limit the emissions of certain airborne pollutants by various entities, including utilities. Utilities owning allowances, other than those acquired for speculative purposes, shall account for such allowances at cost in Account 158.1, Allowance Inventory, or Account 158.2, Allowances Withheld, as appropriate. Allowances acquired for speculative purposes and identified as such in contemporaneous records at the time of purchase shall be accounted for in Account 124, Other Investments.</P>
              <P>(2) When purchased, allowances become eligible for use in different years, and the allocation of the purchase cost cannot be determined by fair value, the purchase cost allocated to allowances of each vintage shall be determined through use of a present-value based measurement. The interest rate used in the present-value measurement shall be the utility's incremental borrowing rate, in the month in which the allowances are acquired, for a loan with a term similar to the period that it will hold the allowances and in an amount equal to the purchase price.</P>
              <P>(3) The underlying records supporting Account 158.1 and Account 158.2 shall be maintained in sufficient detail so as to provide the number of allowances and the related cost by vintage year.</P>
              <P>(4) Issuances from inventory included in Account 158.1 and Account 158.2 shall be accounted for on a vintage basis using a monthly weighted-average method of cost determination. The cost of eligible allowances not used in the current year shall be transferred to the vintage for the immediately following year.</P>
              <P>(5) Account 158.1 shall be credited and Account 509, Allowances, debited so that the cost of the allowances to be remitted for the year is charged to expense monthly based on each month's emissions. This may, in certain circumstances, require allocation of the cost of an allowance between months on a fractional basis.</P>

              <P>(6) In any period in which actual emissions exceed the amount allowable based on eligible allowances owned, the utility shall estimate the cost to acquire the additional allowances needed and charge Account 158.1 with the estimated cost. This estimated cost of future allowance acquisitions shall be credited to Account 158.1 and charged to Account 509 in the same accounting period as the related charge to Account 158.1. Should the actual cost of these <PRTPAGE P="20"/>allowances differ from the estimated cost, the differences shall be recognized in the then-current period's inventory issuance cost.</P>
              <P>(7) Any penalties assessed by the Environmental Protection Agency for the emission of excess pollutants shall be charged to Account 426.3, Penalties.</P>
              <P>(8) Gains on dispositions of allowances, other than allowances held for speculative purposes, shall be accounted for as follows. First, if there is uncertainty as to the regulatory treatment, the gain shall be deferred in Account 254, Other Regulatory Liabilities, pending resolution of the uncertainty. Second, if there is certainty as to the existence of a regulatory liability, the gain will be credited to Account 254, with subsequent recognition in income when reductions in charges to customers occur or the liability is otherwise satisfied. Third, all other gains will be credited to Account 411.8, Gains from Disposition of Allowances. Losses on disposition of allowances, other than allowances held for speculative purposes, shall be accounted for as follows. Losses that qualify as regulatory assets shall be charged directly to Account 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets. All other losses shall be charged to Account 411.9, Losses from Disposition of Allowances. (See the definition of regulatory assets and liabilities.) Gains or losses on disposition of allowances held for speculative purposes shall be recognized in Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or Account 426.5, Other Deductions, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(9) The costs and benefits of exchange-traded allowance futures contracts used to protect the utility from the risk of unfavorable price changes (“hedging transactions”) shall be deferred in Account 186, Miscellaneous Deferred Debits, or Account 253, Other Deferred Credits, as appropriate. Such deferred amounts shall be included in Account 158.1, Allowance Inventory, in the month in which the related allowances are acquired, sold or otherwise disposed of. Where the costs or benefits of hedging transactions are not identifiable with specific allowances, the amounts shall be included in Account 158.1 when the futures contract is closed. The costs and benefits of exchange-traded allowance futures contracts entered into as a speculating activity shall be charged or credited to Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or Account 426.5, Other Deductions, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Depreciation accounting</E>—(1) <E T="03">Method.</E> Utilities must use a method of depreciation that allocates in a systematic and rational manner the service value of depreciable property over the service life of the property.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Service lives.</E> Estimated useful service lives of depreciable property must be supported by engineering, economic, and other depreciation studies.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Rate.</E> Utilities must use percentage rates of depreciation that are based on a method of depreciation that allocates in a systematic and rational manner the service value of depreciable property to the service life of the property. Where composite depreciation rates are used, they should be based on the weighted average estimated useful service lives of the depreciable property comprising the composite group.</P>
              <P>(w) <E T="03">Accounting for other comprehensive income.</E> (1) Utilities shall record items of other comprehensive income in Account 209, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. Amounts included in this account shall be maintained by each category of other comprehensive income. Examples of categories of other comprehensive income include foreign currency items, minimum pension liability adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale type securities and cash flow hedge amounts. Supporting records shall be maintained for Account 209 so that the cumulative amount of other comprehensive income for each item included in this account can be readily identified.</P>
              <P>(2) When an item of other comprehensive income enters into the determination of net income in the current or subsequent periods, a reclassification adjustment shall be recorded in Account 209 to avoid double counting of that amount.</P>

              <P>(3) When it is probable that an item of other comprehensive income will be included in the development of cost-of-service rates in subsequent periods, that amount of unrealized losses or gains will be recorded in Accounts <PRTPAGE P="21"/>182.3, Other Regulatory Assets or 254, Other Regulatory Liabilities, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(x) <E T="03">Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities.</E> (1) Utilities shall recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the financial statements and measure those instruments at fair value, except those falling within recognized exceptions. Normal purchases or sales are contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of goods that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold by the utility over a reasonable period in the normal course of business. A derivative instrument is a financial instrument or other contract with all of the following characteristics:</P>
              <P>(i) It has one or more underlyings and a notional amount or payment provision. Those terms determine the amount of the settlement or settlements, and, in some cases, whether or not a settlement is required.</P>
              <P>(ii) It requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors.</P>
              <P>(iii) Its terms require or permit net settlement, can readily be settled net by a means outside the contract, or provide for delivery of an asset that puts the recipient in a position not substantially different from net settlement.</P>
              <P>(2) The accounting for the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends upon its intended use and designation. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges shall be recorded in Account 175, Derivative instrument assets, or Account 244, Derivative Instrument Liabilities, as appropriate, with the gains recorded in Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, and losses recorded in Account 426.5, Other Deductions.</P>
              <P>(3) A derivative instrument may be specifically designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge. A hedge is used to manage risk to price, interest rates, or foreign currency transactions. A company shall maintain documentation of the hedge relationship at the inception of the hedge that details the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how hedge effectiveness will be determined.</P>
              <P>(4) If the utility designates the derivative instrument as a fair value hedge against exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment, it shall record the change in fair value of the derivative instrument to Account 176, Derivatives in Instrument Assets—Hedges, or Account 245, Derivative Instrument Liabilities—Hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding adjustment to the subaccount of the item being hedged. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the same income or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income. In the case of a fair value hedge of a firm commitment a new asset or liability is created. As a result of the hedge relationship, the new asset or liability will become part of the carrying amount of the item being hedged.</P>
              <P>(5) If the utility designates the derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge against exposure to variable cash flows of a probable forecasted transaction, it shall record changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument in Account 176, Derivative Instrument Assets—Hedges, or Account 245, Derivative Instrument Liabilities—Hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding amount in Account 209, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, for the effective portion of the hedge. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the same account or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income shall be reclassified into earning in the same period or periods that the hedged forecasted item enters into the determination of net income.</P>
              <P>(y) <E T="03">Accounting for asset retirement obligations.</E> (1) An asset retirement obligation represents a liability for the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that <PRTPAGE P="22"/>a company is required to settle as a result of an existing or enacted law, statute, ordinance, or written or oral contract or by legal construction of a contract under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. An asset retirement cost represents the amount capitalized when the liability is recognized for the long-lived asset that gives rise to the legal obligation. The amount recognized for the liability and an associated asset retirement cost shall be stated at the fair value of the asset retirement obligation in the period in which the obligation is incurred.</P>
              <P>(2) The utility shall initially record a liability for an asset retirement obligation in Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations, and charge the associated asset retirement costs to electric utility plant (including Accounts 101.1 and 120.6), and nonutility plant, as appropriate, related to the plant that gives rise to the legal obligation. The asset retirement cost shall be depreciated over the useful life of the related asset that gives rise to the obligation. For periods subsequent to the initial recording of the asset retirement obligation, a utility shall recognize the period to period changes of the asset retirement obligation that result from the passage of time due to the accretion of the liability and any subsequent measurement changes to the initial liability for the legal obligation recorded in Account 230, Asset retirement obligations, as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) The utility shall record the accretion of the liability by debiting Account 411.10, Accretion Expense, for electric utility plant, Account 413, Expenses of Electric Plant Leased to Others, for electric plant leased to others, and Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, for nonutility plant and crediting Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The utility shall recognize any subsequent measurement changes of the liability initially recorded in Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligation, for each specific asset retirement obligation as an adjustment of that liability in Account 230 with the corresponding adjustment to electric utility plant, electric plant leased to others, and nonutility plant, as appropriate. The utility shall on a timely basis monitor any measurement changes of the asset retirement obligations.</P>
              <P>(3) Gains or losses resulting from the settlement of asset retirement obligations associated with utility plant resulting from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation included in Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations, and the actual amount paid to settle the obligation shall be accounted for as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Gains shall be credited to Account 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant, and;</P>
              <P>(ii) Losses shall be charged to Account 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant.</P>
              <P>(4) Gains or losses on the settlement of asset retirement obligations associated with nonutility plant resulting from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation in Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations, and the amount paid to settle the obligation, shall be accounted for as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Gains shall be credited to Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, and;</P>
              <P>(ii) Losses shall be charged to Account 426.5, Other Deductions.</P>
              <P>(5) For purposes of analyses a utility shall maintain supporting documentation so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously with respect to each asset retirement obligation the full details of the identity and nature of the legal obligation, the year incurred, the identity of the plant giving rise to the obligation, the full particulars relating to each component and supporting computations related to the measurement of the asset retirement obligation.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Classification of electric plant at effective date of system of accounts.</E> (1) The electric plant accounts provided herein are the same as those contained in the prior system of accounts except for inclusion of accounts for nuclear production plant and some changes in classification in the general equipment accounts. Except for these changes, the <PRTPAGE P="23"/>balances in the various plant accounts, as determined under the prior system of accounts, should be carried forward. Any remaining balance of plant which has not yet been classified, pursuant to the requirements of the prior system, shall be classified in accordance with the following instructions.</P>
              <P>(2) The cost to the utility of its unclassified plant shall be ascertained by analysis of the utility's records. Adjustments shall not be made to record in utility plant accounts amounts previously charged to operating expenses or to income deductions in accordance with the USoA in effect at the time or in accordance with the discretion of management as exercised under a USoA, or under accounting practices previously followed.</P>
              <P>(3) The detailed electric plant accounts (301 to 399, inclusive) shall be stated on the basis of cost to the utility of plant constructed by it and the original cost, estimated if not known, of plant acquired as an operating unit or system. The difference between the original cost, as above, and the cost to the utility of electric plant after giving effect to any accumulated provision for depreciation or amortization shall be recorded in Account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments. The original cost of electric plant shall be determined by analysis of the utility's records or those of the predecessor or vendor companies with respect to electric plant previously acquired as operating units or systems and the difference between the original cost so determined, less accumulated provisions for depreciation and amortization and the cost to the utility with necessary adjustments for retirements from date of acquisition, shall be entered in Account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments. Any difference between the cost of electric plant and its book cost, when not properly includible in other accounts, shall be recorded in Account 116, Other Electric Plant Adjustments.</P>
              <P>(4) Plant acquired by lease which qualifies as capital lease property under Sec. 1767.15(s), Criteria for Classifying Leases, shall be recorded in Account 101.1, Property Under Capital Leases, or Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel Under Capital Leases, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Electric plant to be recorded at cost.</E> (1) All amounts included in the accounts for electric plant acquired as an operating unit or system, except as otherwise provided in the texts of the intangible plant accounts, shall be stated at the cost incurred by the person who first devoted the property to utility service. All other electric plant shall be included in the accounts at the cost incurred by the utility except for property acquired by lease which qualifies as capital lease property under § 1767.15 (s), Criteria for Classifying Leases, and is recorded in Account 101.1, Property Under Capital Lease, or Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel Under Capital Leases. Where the term “cost” is used in the detailed plant accounts, it shall have the meaning stated in this paragraph (b).</P>
              <P>(2) When the consideration given for property is other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be determined on a cash basis (see, however, the definition of cost in § 1767.10). In the entry recording such transition, the actual consideration shall be described with sufficient particularity to identify it. The utility shall be prepared to furnish RUS the particulars of its determination of the cash value of the consideration if other than cash.</P>
              <P>(3) When property is purchased under a plan involving deferred payments, no charge shall be made to the electric plant accounts for interest, insurance, or other expenditures occasioned solely by such form of payment.</P>

              <P>(4) The electric plant accounts shall not include the cost or other value of electric plant contributed to the company.

              </NOTE>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Equipment.</E> (1) The cost of equipment chargeable to the electric plant accounts, unless otherwise indicated in the text of an equipment account, includes the net purchase price thereof, sales taxes, investigation and inspection expenses necessary to such purchase, expenses of transportation when borne by the utility, labor employed, materials, and supplies consumed, and expenses incurred by the utility in unloading and placing the equipment in readiness to operate.
              </P>
              <P>(2) Also include those costs incurred in connection with the first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with construction and installation of plant.</P>
              <P>(3) Exclude from equipment accounts hand and other portable tools, which are likely to be lost or stolen or which have relatively small value (for example, $500 or less) or short life, unless the correctness of the accounting therefor as electric plant is verified by current inventories.</P>
              <P>(i) Special tools acquired and included in the purchase price of equipment shall be included in the appropriate plant accounts.</P>
              <P>(ii) Portable drills and similar tool equipment when used in connection with the operation and maintenance of a particular plan or department, such as production, transmission, or distribution or in “stores”, shall be charged to the plant accounts appropriate for their use.</P>
              <P>(4) The equipment accounts shall include angle irons and similar items which are installed at the base of an item of equipment, but piers and foundations which are designed to be as permanent as the buildings which house the equipment, or which are constructed as a part of the building and which cannot be removed without cutting into the walls, ceilings, or floors or, without in some way impairing the building, shall be included in the building accounts.</P>
              <P>(5) The equipment accounts shall include the necessary costs of testing or running a plant or parts thereof during an experimental or test period prior to such plant becoming ready for or placed in service.</P>
              <P>(i) The utility shall furnish RUS with full particulars of and justification for any test or experimental run extending beyond a period of 120 days for nuclear plant, and a period of 90 days for all other plant.</P>
              <P>(ii) Such particulars shall include a detailed operational and downtime log showing days of production, gross kilowatts generated by hourly increments, types, and periods of outages by hours with explanation thereof, beginning with the first date the equipment was either tested or synchronized on the line to the end of the test period.</P>

              <P>(6) The cost of efficiency or other tests made subsequent to the date equipment becomes available for service shall be charged to the appropriate expense accounts, except that tests to determine whether equipment meets the specifications and requirements as <PRTPAGE P="33"/>to efficiency, or performance guaranteed by manufacturers, made after operations have commenced and within the period specified in the agreement or contract of purchase, may be charged to the appropriate electric plant accounts.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Additions and retirements of electric plant.</E> (1) For the purpose of avoiding undue refinement in accounting for additions to and retirements and replacements of electric plant, all property shall be considered as consisting of retirement units and minor items of property.</P>
              <P>(2) The addition and retirement of retirement units shall be accounted for as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) When a retirement unit is added to electric plant, the cost thereof shall be added to the appropriate electric plant account, except that when units are acquired in the acquisition of any electric plant constituting an operating system, they shall be accounted for as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) When a retirement unit is retired from electric plant, with or without replacement, the book cost thereof shall be credited to the electric plant account in which it is included, determined in the manner set forth in Item in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. If the retirement unit is of a depreciable class, the book cost of the unit retired and credited to electric plant shall be charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation applicable to such property. The cost of removal and the salvage shall be charged or credited, as appropriate, to such depreciation account.</P>
              <P>(3) The addition and retirement of minor items of property shall be accounted for as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) When a minor item of property which did not previously exist is added to plant, the cost thereof shall be accounted for in the same manner as for the addition of a retirement unit, as set forth in Item in paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, if a substantial addition results, otherwise the charge shall be to the appropriate maintenance expense account.</P>
              <P>(ii) When a minor item of property is retired and not replaced, the book cost thereof shall be credited to the electric plant account in which it is included; and, in the event the minor item is a part of depreciable plant, the account for accumulated provision for depreciation shall be charged with the book cost and cost of removal and credited with the salvage. If, however, the book cost of the minor item retired and not replaced has been or will be accounted for by its inclusion in the retirement unit of which it is a part when such unit is retired, no separate credit to the property account is required when such minor item is retired.</P>
              <P>(iii) When a minor item of depreciable property is replaced independently of the retirement unit of which it is a part, the cost of replacement shall be charged to the maintenance account appropriate for the item, except that if the replacement effects a substantial betterment (the primary aim of which is to make the property affected more useful, more efficient, of greater durability, or of greater capacity), the excess cost of the replacement over the estimated cost at current prices of replacing without betterment shall be charged to the appropriate electric plant accounts.</P>
              <P>(4) The book cost of electric plant retired shall be the amount at which such property is included in the electric plant accounts, including all components of construction costs. The book cost shall be determined from the utility's records and if this cannot be done, it shall be estimated. When it is impracticable to determine the book cost of each unit, due to the relatively large number or small cost thereof, an appropriate average book cost of the units with due allowance for any differences in size and character, shall be used as the book cost of the units retired.</P>

              <P>(5) The book cost of land retired shall be credited to the appropriate land accounts. If the land is sold, the difference between the book cost (less any accumulated provision for depreciation or amortization therefore which has been authorized and provided) and the sale price of the land (less commissions and other expenses of making the sale) shall be recorded in Account 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant, or Account 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant, when the <PRTPAGE P="34"/>property has been recorded in Account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, otherwise to Accounts 421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property, or 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property, as appropriate. If the land is not used in utility service but is retained by the utility, the book cost shall be charged to Account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, or Account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(6) The book cost less net salvage of depreciable electric plant retired shall be charged in its entirety to Account 108, Accumulated Provision for Depreciation of Electric Utility Plant in Service. Any amounts which, by approval or order of RUS, are charged to Account 182.1, Extraordinary Property Losses, shall be credited to Account 108.</P>
              <P>(7) The accounting for the retirement of amounts included in Account 302, Franchises and Consents, and Account 303, Miscellaneous Intangible Plant, and the items of limited-term interest in land included in the accounts for land and land rights, shall be as provided for in the text of Account 111, Accumulated Provision for Amortization of Electric Utility Plant in Service; Account 404, Amortization of Limited-Term Electric Plant; and Account 405, Amortization of Other Electric Plant.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Work order and property record system required.</E> (1) Each utility shall record all construction and retirements of electric plant by means of work orders or job orders. Separate work orders may be opened for additions to and retirements of electric plant or the retirements may be included with the construction work order, provided, however, that all items relating to the retirements shall be kept separate from those relating to construction and provided, further, that any maintenance costs involved in the work shall likewise be segregated.</P>
              <P>(2) Each utility shall keep its work order system so as to show the nature of each addition to or retirement of electric plant, the total cost thereof, the source or sources of costs, and the electric plant account or accounts to which charged or credited. Work orders covering jobs of short duration may be cleared monthly.</P>
              <P>(3) Each utility shall maintain records in which, for each plant account, the amounts of the annual additions and retirements are classified so as to show the number and cost of the various record units or retirement units.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Transfers of property.</E> When property is transferred from one electric plant account to another, from one utility department to another, such as from electric to gas, from one operating division or area to another, to or from Account 101, Electric Plant in Service; Account 104, Electric Plant Leased to Others; Account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, and Account 121, Nonutility Property, the transfer shall be recorded by transferring the original cost thereof from the one account, department, or location to the other. Any related amounts carried in the accounts for accumulated provision for depreciation or amortization shall be transferred in accordance with the segregation of such accounts.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Common utility plant.</E> (1) If the utility is engaged in more than one utility service, such as electric, gas, and water, and any of its utility plant is used in common for several utility services or for other purposes to such an extent and in such manner that it is impracticable to segregate it by utility services currently in the accounts, such property, with the approval of RUS, may be designated and classified as “common utility plant.”</P>

              <P>(2) The book amount of utility plant designated as common plant shall be included in Account 118, Other Utility Plant, and if applicable in part to the electric department, shall be segregated and accounted for in subaccounts as electric plant is accounted for in Accounts 101 to 107, inclusive, and electric plant adjustments in Account 116, Other Electric Plant Adjustments; any amounts classifiable as common plant acquisition adjustments or common plant adjustments shall be subject to disposition as provided in Paragraphs C and B of Accounts 114 and 116, respectively, for amounts classified in those accounts. The original cost of common utility plant in service shall be classified according to the detailed utility plant accounts appropriate for the property.<PRTPAGE P="35"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The utility shall be prepared to show, at any time, and to report to RUS annually, or more frequently, if required, and by utility plant accounts (301 to 399) the book cost of common utility plant, the allocation of such cost to the respective departments using the common utility plant, and the basis of the allocation.</P>
              <P>(4) The accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization of the utility shall be segregated so as to show the amount applicable to the property classified as common utility plant.</P>
              <P>(5) The expenses of operation, maintenance, rents, depreciation and amortization of common utility plant shall be recorded in the accounts prescribed herein, but designated as common expenses, and the allocation of such expenses to the departments using the common utility plant shall be supported in such manner as to reflect readily the basis of allocation used.</P>

This account shall be debited and Account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Utility Operating Income, or Account 411.2, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Other Income and Deductions, as appropriate, shall be credited with an amount equal to that by which income taxes payable for the year are higher because of the inclusion of certain items in income for tax purposes, which items for general accounting purposes will not be fully reflected in the utility's determination of annual net income until subsequent years.</P>
                <P>B. This account shall be credited and Account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, or Account 410.2, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Other Income and Deductions, as appropriate, shall be debited with an amount equal to that by which income taxes payable for the year are lower because of prior payment of taxes as provided by Paragraph A above, because of difference in timing for tax purposes of particular items of income or income deductions from that recognized by the utility for general accounting purposes. Such credit to this account and debit to Account 410.1 or Account 410.2 shall, in general, represent the effect on taxes payable in the current year of the smaller amount of book income recognized for tax purposes as compared to the amount recognized in the utility's current accounts with respect to the item or class of items for which deferred tax accounting by the utility was authorized by RUS.</P>

It shall not make use of the balance in this account or any portion thereof except as provided in the text of this account, without prior approval of RUS. Any remaining deferred tax account balance with respect to an amount for any prior year's tax deferral, the amortization of which or other recognition in the utility's income accounts has been completed, or other disposition made, shall be debited to Account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, or Account 410.2, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Other Income and Deductions, as appropriate, or otherwise disposed of as RUS may authorize or direct.

              <SUBJECT>Accounting methods and procedures required of all RUS borrowers.</SUBJECT>
              <P>All RUS borrowers shall maintain and keep their books of accounts and all other books and records which support the entries in such books of accounts in accordance with the accounting principles prescribed in this section. Interpretations Nos. 133, 134, 137, 403, 404, 602, 606, 618, 627, 628, and 629 adopt and implement the provisions of standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Each interpretation includes a synopsis of the requirements of the standard as well as specific accounting requirements and interpretations required by RUS. The synopsis provides general information to assist borrowers in determining whether the standard applies to an individual cooperative's operations. The synopsis is not intended to change the requirements of the FASB standards unless it is set forth in the section entitled RUS Accounting Requirements in each interpretation. If a particular borrower believes a conflict exists between the FASB standard and an RUS interpretation, the borrower shall contact the Director, PASD, to seek resolution of the issue.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD3">101 Work Order Procedures</HD>
                <P>When a minor item of property is removed from service and not replaced, a retirement work order is not required except in the case of a conductor. The cost of the minor item shall remain in the appropriate plant account until the retirement unit, of which it is a part, is retired. However, as conductor is recorded in feet and is not part of any specific retirement unit, conductor shall be retired even though the amount taken down and not replaced is less than a retirement unit (two spans).</P>
                <P>When minor items of plant are removed and not replaced, material salvaged shall be recorded on a material salvage ticket. Items of material recorded on this ticket shall be charged to the materials and supplies account and credited in the miscellaneous columns of the Materials Register to the Accumulated Provision for Depreciation. In this example, it is assumed that the cost of removal is nil. If, however, costs are incurred during the removal of minor items of plant, these costs shall reduce the credit to the Accumulated Provision for Depreciation.</P>

                <P>When a staking sheet supporting a single work order reflects a combination of new construction and replacements, or system improvements, the predominant cost shall be the governing factor in determining the amount of cost RUS will finance. To illustrate, assume that a service is to be run to a new home near the end of an existing line. On inspection, the pole from which the service is to be run is found to be in very poor physical condition and must be replaced. In addition, a single span of wire and a service are presently connected to this pole which serve no purpose. The home originally served has been demolished and the existing span, pole, and service were retired. In other <PRTPAGE P="150"/>words, what started out to be simply the installation of a new service now includes the retirement of a span of wire, a pole, and a service; the replacement of a pole; and the running of a new service. Assuming the replacement of the pole is the costliest part of this project, the construction and retirement activity shall be classified as an ordinary replacement even though the work includes new construction and retirements without replacement.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">102 Line Conversion</HD>
                <P>If it is necessary to move a conductor from one location to another on a pole assembly during the conversion of a line from one phase to another phase, the cost of moving the conductor is capitalizable as a system improvement.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">103 Sacrificial Anodes and the Replacement of a Neutral</HD>
                <P>Many utilities conduct studies to determine whether sacrificial anodes are needed to protect underground cable against corrosion. The following procedures shall be followed to account for sacrificial anodes and the replacement of a neutral:</P>
                <P>1. If the study results in the installation of sacrificial anodes, the cost of the study shall be capitalized to Account 367, Underground Conductors and Devices. If the study does not result in the installation of anodes, the cost shall be charged to Account 594, Maintenance of Underground Lines.</P>
                <P>2. Costs incurred in the first installation are capitalizable even though anodes are considered minor items of property. However, only the first costs of installation shall be capitalized. All subsequent replacements of anodes shall be expensed.</P>
                <P>3. Sacrificial anodes do not constitute a record unit; therefore, the cost of anodes shall be added to the cost of the underground cable unit.</P>
                <P>4. Because a neutral is part of an underground cable record unit, and is not, in and of itself, a record unit, the cost to replace a corroded neutral shall be charged to Account 594, Maintenance of Underground Lines.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">104 Terminal Facilities</HD>
                <P>Borrowers are sometimes required to construct terminal facilities in the transmission line of another utility in order to receive power from their power supplier. The document executed between the borrower and the utility is normally referred to as a “License Agreement”. The license agreement may stipulate that certain items of the terminal facilities are to be transferred to, and become the property of, the other utility upon completion of the construction. The accounting for this type of transaction shall be as follows:</P>
                <P>1. All construction costs incurred shall be charged to a work order. Upon completion of the construction and accumulation of all costs, the cost of the facilities that become the property of another utility shall be transferred from construction work-in-progress to Account 303, Miscellaneous Intangible Plant. The cost of the plant for which the borrower retains title shall be charged to the appropriate plant accounts.</P>
                <P>2. The cost of the facilities recorded in Account 303 shall be amortized to Account 405, Amortization of Other Electric Plant, over the contract term or the estimated useful service life of the plant, whichever is shorter. If the related contract or contracts for this power supply are terminated, the unamortized balance shall be expensed, in the current period, in Account 557.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">105 Pole Top Disconnect Switch</HD>
                <P>The installation of pole top service disconnect switches, where title is retained by the utility, shall be capitalized in Account 371, Installations on Customers' Premises. If a switch cabinet is purchased with a current transformer included as an integral part of the cabinet, the entire cost of the switch shall be charged to Account 371. If the current transformer is installed outside of the switch cabinet, the transformer, meter, and meter base, together with the first installation costs, shall be capitalized, upon purchase, in Account 370, Meters.</P>
                <P>Payments received from the customer toward construction costs shall be credited to Account 371, Installations on Customers' Premises. Such payments, together with any amount not financed by RUS, shall be entered in column 9 of the RUS Form 219, Inventory of Work Orders. The associated maintenance costs shall be charged to Account 587, Customer Installations Expenses, or to Account 597, Maintenance of Meters, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>When pole top disconnect switches are installed and title is held by the customer, the cost of the material shall be charged to Account 456, Other Electric Revenues and the receipts from the sale of line material shall be credited to Account 456. The portion of the receipts for resale material as well as that for installation shall be credited to Account 415, Revenues from Merchandising, Jobbing, and Contract Work. The cost of resale material sold and the cost of installation shall be charged to Account 416, Costs and Expenses of Merchandising, Jobbing and Contract Work.</P>

                <P>Future maintenance costs incurred by the cooperative that are not billed to the customer shall be charged to Account 587, Customer Installations Expenses.<PRTPAGE P="151"/>

                <P>The cost associated with the purchase and installation of steel pole reinforcers shall be charged to Account 593, Maintenance of Overhead Lines.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">107 Mobile Substations</HD>
                <P>Mobile substations shall be accounted for in a manner similar to that for a spare and are, therefore, included as part of transmission or distribution station equipment, depending upon the use of the mobile substation. The mobile substation, together with the trailer on which it is permanently mounted, shall be capitalized upon purchase. A general purpose truck or tractor used to relocate a mobile substation and trailer shall be classified as transportation equipment.</P>
                <P>The composite depreciation rate used for transmission plant or distribution plant, as appropriate, shall be applied to the mobile substation.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">108 Security Lights</HD>
                <P>Where a pole supports both a secondary wire and a security light, the cost of the pole shall be charged to Account 364, Poles, Towers, and Fixtures, even though the plant investment in security lights is recorded in Account 371, Installations on Customers' Premises.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">109 Joint Use</HD>
                <P>There are many cases in which an electric utility and a communications utility enter into an agreement that provides for joint use of poles. Under the terms of these agreements, either utility may occupy the poles of the other upon payment of a stipulated annual rental. If such joint occupancy necessitates the use of a higher than standard pole, the new pole shall be provided at the expense of the utility having the need for the higher pole.</P>
                <P>When an electric utility replaces, at its own expense, a standard pole belonging to the communications utility with a higher pole, the cost of the higher pole, less net salvage (if any) of the pole replaced, shall be charged to the account in which the pole rental is included.</P>
                <P>Contributions made to an electric utility by a communications utility for the costs incurred in stubbing joint use electric poles shall be credited to Account 593, Maintenance of Overhead Lines. The cost of pole stubbing on electric plant distribution facilities shall be charged to Account 593.</P>
                <P>An investment in outside plant that is held in joint ownership shall be recorded in the appropriate plant accounts at its cost to the utility. For continuing property record purposes, jointly owned property units shall be priced at their cost to the utility and shall be appropriately segregated in the CPRs to indicate joint ownership.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">110 First Clearing and Grading of Land and Rights of Way</HD>

                <P>Utility accounting practice requires the costs associated with the first clearing and grading of land and rights of way and any resulting damage thereto, to be included in the accounts for structures and improvements or equipment to which such costs relate. Since the first clearing, as well as clearing which is “directly occasioned by the building of a structure,” is done, not for the purpose of enhancing the value of the land or the rights of way, but for the purpose of constructing plant, these costs are more directly related to the construction of plant than to the purchase of land or rights of way. The accounts shall be charged as follows:
                </P>
                <P>1. For overhead transmission pole lines, Account 356, Overhead Conductors and Devices;</P>
                <P>2. For overhead distribution lines, Account 365, Overhead Conductors and Devices; and</P>
                <P>3. For underground distribution lines, Account 366, Underground Conduit, for a conduit installation; or Account 367, Underground Conductors and Devices, for a direct burial installation.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">111 Engineering Contracts for System Planning</HD>
                <P>Engineering costs for long-range system plans shall be charged to Account 183, Preliminary Survey and Investigation Charges, as incurred. The cost of engineering services incurred in preparing a long-range system plan represents a legitimate component of the total cost of construction of all system improvements detailed in the plan. The amount of engineering costs to be associated with any specific system improvement is the annual costs incurred up to the time of the allocation (not previously allocated), plus that portion of the initial cost which relates to the particular construction in question. If any major system improvement included in the engineering plan is not constructed, or if the study is superseded by another complete study, the cost of that portion of the original study not resulting in construction shall be charged to Account 182.2, Unrecovered Plant and Regulatory Study Costs, if the costs are to be recovered through future rates. Costs recorded in Account 182.2 shall be amortized to Account 407, Amortization of Property Losses, Unrecovered Plant and Regulatory Study Costs, as the costs are recovered through the rates. Any costs included in Account 182.2 that are disallowed for rate-making purposes shall be charged to Account 426.5, Other Deductions.</P>

                <P>The allocation of engineering services to the various construction projects requires <PRTPAGE P="152"/>the exercise of judgment. In some cases, system improvements are continuous over a period of months or years, thus permitting the engineering cost to be spread monthly as overhead in relation to the direct costs incurred in construction. (If a substantial amount of retirement work is performed in connection with system improvements, a proportionate share of the engineering cost shall be allocated on the basis of direct retirement labor.) If the system improvements detailed in the plan are not performed in a continuous manner, the engineering cost shall be allocated on the basis of the estimated costs of the various larger system improvement projects which result from the long-range plan.</P>
                <P>If construction is performed by contract, the engineering cost applicable thereto shall be transferred from Account 183 to Account 107, Construction Work-in-Progress—Electric, and thereby spread to the appropriate plant accounts on the basis of contract costs.</P>
                <P>In the case of system improvement construction performed on the basis of work orders, engineering costs shall be transferred to Account 107, Construction Work-in-Progress—Electric, and included in total work order costs as either overhead or special services. If engineering services are not readily identifiable with individual work orders, they shall be capitalized as overhead. If engineering costs for each work order are readily separable from the engineering costs for all other work orders, they shall be capitalized as special services.</P>
                <P>In summarizing system improvement work orders on the RUS Form 219, Inventory of Work Orders, the amount of engineering costs previously approved for advance on the long range plan, if any, shall be deducted to determine the balance of loan funds subject to advance by RUS.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">112 Determination of Availability of Service</HD>
                <P>Costs relating to the determination of availability of service, rates, and similar items for individual applicants shall be charged to Account 912, Demonstrating and Selling Expenses. If it is expected that construction will result, the costs incurred to provide service, including staking, shall be charged to Account 107, Construction Work-in-Progress—Electric. If construction does not result, Account 107 shall be credited and Account 426.5, Other Deductions, shall be charged.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">113 Temporary Facilities (Services)</HD>
                <P>Plant installed for temporary use, a period of less than 1.ar, shall be recorded in Account 185, Temporary Facilities, net of any payments received from customers. Upon retirement, this net cost plus cost of removal, less any salvage value, shall be cleared to Account 451, Miscellaneous Service Revenues.</P>
                <P>When a temporary service is installed at the site of a building under construction, the location of the permanent service entrance and the load and its characteristics are usually known. The temporary service is of the proper capacity and is so located or has sufficient slack, that it can be relocated to serve the new building as a permanent service. Under these conditions, the service shall be charged to Account 369, Services, when first installed. The cost of moving and attaching the service to the permanent service entrance shall be charged to Account 593, Maintenance of Overhead Lines or Account 594, Maintenance of Underground Lines, as appropriate.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">114 Construction Work-in-Progress Damaged or Destroyed by Storm</HD>
                <P>When installed plant, not yet completed or completed but not yet placed in service, has been damaged or destroyed by storm, the cost of the repair and restoration shall be added to the cost of construction and capitalized if the plant was constructed under force account or work order construction, and the utility paid for the cost of the repairs. If the plant was constructed under contract, the contractor is required to deliver the plant in new condition.

                <P>The primary purpose of a Load Management System is to optimize load dispatch and to reduce or minimize system peaks in order to reduce purchases of power or to delay or eliminate the need for construction of new plant. A Load Management System may be used on integrated systems, or on generation, transmission, or distribution systems separately. The telemetry equipment used for data acquisition and interpretation may be included at various points on a system, such as generation, transmission, or distribution substation, switchyards or on consumers' premises.</P>
                <P>An effective load control program should be coordinated with the G&amp;T and requires full participation of all member distribution systems. The G&amp;T monitors the power load of the total member distribution system to predict the time of the system's peak load. An optimal load control strategy is developed by the G&amp;T and is passed on from the G&amp;T computer system to the load control computer systems of the member distribution cooperatives.</P>
                <P>The equipment at the member distribution system level is the type actually being used by an integrated power system to operate a load control program. The equipment used may vary from one integrated power system to another. The selection of equipment used is determined by the information needs of the integrated power system, and the method selected to operate the load control system.</P>
                <P>Some equipment performs only SCADA-type functions. This equipment is included with the equipment that performs only load control functions because SCADA-type equipment is an integral part of a load control program. An effective load control strategy requires current information on loads so that member distribution systems can determine the actual loads to be shed and the duration of the load control.</P>
                <P>The function and location of the load control equipment are the primary factors in determining the account in which the equipment shall be recorded. The following example depicts a common load control system and the associated accounting. Equipment type may vary, thereby necessitating the use of accounts not prescribed below. In all instances, however, the function and location of the equipment shall dictate the appropriate account classification.</P>

                <P>The Load Control Receiver, also known as a load control switch, is located at the site of the consumer's load. These receivers directly control the electric supply to an end-use appliance, such as an electric water heater, central air conditioning compressor, or irrigation pump. The amount of time that an appliance will be turned off by the load control receiver is preset. When the member system computer determines that load shedding is necessary, it sends a signal to the communication link which then sends signals directly to the Load Control Receivers. In a power line based system, the signal from the communications link is sent by radio or telephone line to the Substation Injection Units, which then signals the Load Control Receivers to shut down the appliances for the present time. In nonpower line based systems, the signal from the communications link is sent by radio directly to the Load Control Receivers.</P>
                <P>Load Control Receivers are located on the consumer's side of the meter. When the member distribution system retains title to the Load Control Receivers and assumes full responsibility for maintenance and replacement of the equipment, it shall be classified in Account 371, Installations on Customer's Premises.

                <P>Special Equipment items are classified as such because they are continually being moved from one location to another due to load changes and maintenance practices. The USoA provides accounting that differs from that used for other types of materials. The cost, new, of special equipment items shall be capitalized at the time of purchase; it shall not be charged to Account 154 as is the case with other materials. The first installation cost, as well as all incidental costs necessary to prepare the equipment for use, shall be capitalized with the material upon purchase. All subsequent costs of removing, resetting, changing, renewing oil, and repairing constitute operations and maintenance expenses. The capitalized cost of special equipment items, including the first installation, shall be removed from the electric plant accounts only when the items are abandoned or retired from the system.</P>

                <P>Meters, line-type transformers, oil circuit reclosers, sectionalizers, current and potential transformers, meter sockets, and other metering equipment listed in Account 370, Meters, as well as pole-type and underground voltage regulators in Account 368, Line Transformers, are considered to be special <PRTPAGE P="156"/>equipment items. Similarly, load control receivers (load control switches) recorded in Account 371, Installations on Customers' Premises, are considered to be items of special equipment. (<E T="03">See</E> Interpretation No. 118.) Transformers, voltage regulators, metering equipment, and current and potential transformers for substations are not.</P>
                <P>Special equipment items which are classified as nonusable shall be segregated in the warehouse and retired from service. The Summary of Special Equipment Costs shall be retitled Summary of Special Equipment Costs Retired and used for this purpose. A journal entry reflecting this information shall be prepared and posted to the books. Since loan funds for special equipment, including first installation costs, are approved for advance by the Rural Development upon receipt of the borrower's written estimate of funds required, and not on the basis of an Inventory of Work Orders, it is improper to take a credit for any salvage involved in the retirement of special equipment on the Inventory of Work Orders.</P>
                <P>Electric borrowers that wish to receive a waiver from the special equipment accounting requirements should submit a letter request to Rural Development. In order to expedite these requests the letter to Rural Development should state that the borrower will adhere to the following requirements to account for special equipment using the work order procedure rather than the special equipment accounting procedures prescribed by Rural Development:</P>
                <P>1. New purchases of special equipment items are to be charged to Account 154, Materials and Supplies, upon purchase.</P>
                <P>2. Labor, material and overhead costs associated with the initial installation and all subsequent installations of special equipment are recorded on construction work orders and charged to the appropriate plant accounts upon closeout of the construction work order.</P>
                <P>3. Labor and overhead costs associated with the removal of special equipment items, whether the items removed are placed in inventory or permanently retired and disposed of, are recorded on retirement work orders and charged or credited to the depreciation reserve account upon closeout of the retirement work order.</P>
                <P>4. The special equipment items retired and salvaged for reuse are returned to the materials and supplies account at the average material cost in the materials and supplies account and credited to the depreciation reserve upon closeout of the retirement work order.</P>
                <P>In addition to recognition of the requirements noted above, the borrower should indicate how it plans to account for the items of special equipment that have been charged to the plant accounts but not installed (in inventory). Two acceptable methods to account for this equipment are: (1) Leave the equipment in the plant accounts until the inventory is depleted and charge only new purchases to materials and supplies, or (2) credit the plant accounts for the installed cost of the equipment in inventory, charge the equipment cost to materials and supplies, and charge the installation cost to the appropriate operations expense account. Also, under the second method, the borrower must submit a “negative” special equipment summary to Rural Development to return to the balance in reserve for the current loan the installed cost of special equipment in inventory on the date of transition.</P>

It is normally installed on a pole in connection with a 1<FR>1/2</FR> kVA transformer, a meter base and connecting wires, and other small items of materials. Meter bases are ordinarily set for these voltmeters throughout the system, and a lesser number of voltmeters are rotated among them periodically to obtain voltage readings. An average system may have one voltmeter to two installations, with a maximum of 20 or 25 voltmeters for the whole system.</P>
                <P>Minimum—maximum voltmeters shall be recorded, through work orders, in Account 370, Meters, when installed.

                <P>Electronic or solid state demand meters have a direct readout which reads kilowatt demand to two decimal places. The use of a direct readout demand meter may result in increased revenues as pointer readings tend to register lower than actual usages.</P>
                <P>The process of retrofitting a demand meter replaces the pointer with a direct readout. The cost of such a replacement is usually expensed as a minor item of property; however, since the use of a direct readout results in a substantial betterment, the excess cost of the replacement over the estimated cost, at current prices, of replacing the pointer without the betterment is capitalized.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">123 Transformer Conversions</HD>
                <P>The conversion of an overhead transformer to an underground transformer constitutes a betterment and shall, therefore, be capitalized.</P>

                <P>Transclosures are enclosures or cabinets in which line transformers are mounted. The cost of transclosures that are purchased separately from the transformer shall be charged to Account 154, Plant Materials and Operating Supplies, when received, and capitalized, upon installation, to Account 368, Line Transformers, as a separate unit of property. If the case and the transformer are inseparable, the unit is considered a transformer and shall be capitalized upon purchase.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Services</HD>
                <P>A retirement unit shall consist of a complete service rather than the individual wires comprising that service. If each separate wire of a service were treated as a retirement unit, the retirement unit would represent a comparatively small cost. Such a small unit of property would substantially increase the number of retirement work orders. The complete service shall, therefore, be considered a retirement unit.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Minor Items</HD>
                <P>When minor items of property are added separately from complete retirement units, the costs of these items shall be included in work orders, and by unitizing all costs of completed construction for a month, these minor items shall be spread to the retirement units of which they normally form a part. For example, to convert a two-phase line to a three-phase line requires the addition of a conductor, an insulator and a pole-top pin. A pole-top pin is typically capitalized as a component of the cost of the pole to which it is attached. Assuming this is the only work order for the month, the cost of this pin shall be charged to the conductor, so that its cost is included in the total cost of the project. In actual practice, however, this does not happen as it is normal to have a number of work orders for a given month, which include the setting of poles. In allocating the cost of all construction projects for the month, part of the cost of pole-top pins shall be allocated to poles even though the work orders on which they were capitalized did not include poles.</P>

                <P>In December 1986, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 90, Regulated Enterprises—Accounting for Abandonments (Statement No. 90) and Disallowances of Plant Costs. This section provides an overview of the requirements outlined in Statement No. 90 together with the specific accounts that shall be used to record a plant abandonment or a disallowance of plant costs.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Plant Abandonments</HD>

                <P>When an abandonment becomes probable, the cost of the abandoned asset shall be removed from Construction Work-in-Progress or Plant-in-Service, as applicable. Before making this transfer, however, a determination must be made as to whether recovery of the allowed cost is likely to be provided with a full return on the investment during the period from the time the abandonment becomes probable, to the time when recovery is completed, or with a partial or no return on the investment. This determination shall be made based upon the facts and circumstances of the specific abandonment, and past practices and current policies of regulatory jurisdiction.<PRTPAGE P="159"/>
                </P>
                <P>If a full return on the investment is likely to be provided, any disallowance of all or part of the cost of abandoned plant that is both probable and reasonably estimated shall be recognized as a loss in the current year with the carrying basis of the asset reduced by an equal amount. The remaining cost of abandoned plant shall be recorded as a separate new asset.</P>
                <P>If partial or no return on the investment is likely to be provided, any disallowance of abandoned plant costs that is both probable and reasonably estimated shall be recognized as a loss. The present value of the future revenues expected to be provided to recover the allowable cost of the abandoned plant and return on the investment, if any, shall be reported as a separate new asset. The discount rate used to compute the present value shall be the borrower's incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate that the borrower would have to pay to borrow an equivalent amount for a period equal to the expected recovery period. In determining the value of expected future revenues, the borrower shall consider the probable time period before the recovery is expected to begin and the probable time period over which recovery is expected to be provided.</P>
                <P>The amount of the new asset shall be adjusted from time to time, as necessary, if new information indicates that the estimates used to record the new asset have changed. The carrying value of the new asset, however, shall not be adjusted for changes in the incremental borrowing rate. The amount of any adjustments shall be recorded as a gain or loss.</P>

                <P>During the period between the date on which a new asset is recognized and the date on which recovery begins, the carrying amount shall be increased by accruing a carrying charge. The rate used to accrue the carrying charge shall be:
                </P>
                <P>1. If a full return on the investment is likely, a rate equal to the allowed overall cost of capital in the jurisdiction in which recovery is expected to be provided shall be used.</P>

                <P>2. If partial or no return is likely, the asset shall be amortized in a manner that will produce a constant return on the unamortized investment in the new asset equal to the rate at which the expected revenues were discounted.
                </P>
                <P>Due to the nonprofit environment in which electric cooperatives operate, full recovery of interest expense on plant related long-term debt equates to full recovery of the rate of return for an investor-owned utility. Therefore, if a cooperative is permitted full recovery of the interest expense incurred on the long-term debt borrowed to finance construction of an abandoned plant, no discounting of the asset is required nor is accrual of the carrying charge permitted.</P>
                <P>If, at the time the provisions of Statement No. 90 are first applied, the borrower elects to restate the financial statements, the financial statements for all periods presented shall be restated and the financial statements shall disclose the nature of the restatement and its effect on margins before extraordinary items, net margins, and patronage capital at the beginning of the earliest period presented. If the borrower elects not to restate the financial statements, the effect of applying Statement No. 90 shall be reported as a change in accounting principle and the financial statements shall disclose the nature of the change and the effect of applying Statement No. 90 on margins before extraordinary items and net margins.</P>

                <P>The specific accounts that shall be used to record transactions involving plant abandonments are as follows:
                </P>
                <P>1. In the year of the abandonment, the unrecoverable portion of the cost of abandoned plant included in construction work-in-progress shall be recognized as a loss by a charge to Account 426.5, Other Deductions, and a credit to Account 107, Construction Work-in-Progress.</P>
                <P>2. The balance of the cost remaining in the construction work-in-progress account shall be credited to Account 107 and charged to Account 182.2, Unrecovered Plant and Regulatory Study Costs.</P>
                <P>3. The difference between the charge to Account 182.2 and the present value of expected future revenues for recovery of the new asset, shall be recorded as a credit to Account 182.2 and a debit to Account 426.5. The credit to Account 182.2 shall be segregated from the amount charged to Account 182.2 by the use of a separate subaccount. Statement No. 90 does not require this segregation; however, it is necessary under the USoA to provide for the appropriate segregation of operating and nonoperating income.</P>
                <P>4. During the waiting period for recovery of the new asset to begin, carrying charges shall be accrued by a debit toAccount 182.2 with a concurrent credit to Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income. Debits to Account 182.2 shall be treated as reductions to the credit subaccount of Account 182.2.</P>
                <P>5. The borrower shall amortize the amount debited to Account 182.2 by charges to operating income, consistent with the way the amortized amounts are recovered through rates. These charges to income shall be recorded in Account 407, Amortization of Property Losses, Unrecovered Plant and Regulatory Study Costs.</P>

                <P>6. As the recoverable amount recorded in Account 182.2 is recovered through rates, the borrower shall accrue income by charges to Account 182.2 and credits to Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income. Accruals shall be computed by applying the same rate used to derive the present value of the asset established in Account 182.2, to the <PRTPAGE P="160"/>unamortized balance in that account. Accrued amounts charged to Account 182.2 shall be treated as reductions to the credit subaccount withinAccount 182.2.</P>
                <P>Prior to implementing the accounting prescribed above, the borrower shall submit the details of each plant abandonment to RUS for approval.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Disallowances of Costs of Recently Completed Plant</HD>

                <P>When it becomes probable that a portion of the cost of recently completed plant will be disallowed for rate making purposes and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made, the estimated amount of the probable disallowance shall be deducted from the reported cost of the plant and recognized as a loss. If a portion of the costs is explicitly, but indirectly disallowed, the equivalent amount of the cost shall be deducted from the reported cost of the plant and recognized as a loss. The specific accounts that shall be used to record transactions involving the disallowance of plant costs are as follows:
                </P>
                <P>1. Estimated disallowed plant costs which the borrower records as a credit to Account 101, Electric Plant-in-Service, shall be charged to Account 426.5, Other Deductions.</P>
                <P>2. If the loss qualifies as an extraordinary item under the criteria set forth in General Instruction No. 7 of the USoA, the borrower shall record the loss in Account 435, Extraordinary Deductions. To be considered extraordinary, an item shall be more than five percent of income computed before extraordinary items. If a borrower believes that a loss of less than five percent should be treated as an extraordinary item; the borrower shall, with commission approval, record the loss in Account 435 and report the loss as an extraordinary item. If the borrower is not subject to state commission jurisdiction, RUS approval is required.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">134 Utility Plant Phase-in Plans</HD>
                <P>In August 1987, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 92, Regulated Enterprises—Accounting for Phase-in Plans (Statement No. 92). This section provides an overview of the requirements outlined in Statement No. 92.</P>

                <P>The term phase-in plan is used to refer to any method of recognition of allowable costs in rates that meets all of the following criteria:
                </P>
                <P>1. The method was adopted by the regulator in connection with a major, newly completed plant of the regulated enterprise or one of its suppliers or a major plant scheduled for completion in the near future.</P>
                <P>2. The method defers the rates intended to recover allowable costs beyond the period in which those allowable costs would be charged to expense under generally accepted accounting principles applicable to enterprises in general.</P>

                <P>3. The method defers the rates intended to recover allowable costs beyond the period in which those rates would have been ordered under the rate-making methods routinely used prior to 1982 by that regulator for similar allowable costs of that regulated enterprise.
                </P>
                <P>If a phase-in plan is ordered by a regulator in connection with a plant on which no substantial physical construction had been performed before January 1, 1988, none of the allowable costs that are deferred for future recovery by the regulator under the plan for rate-making purposes, shall be capitalized for general-purpose financial reporting purposes (financial reporting).</P>

                <P>If a phase-in plan is ordered by a regulator in connection with a plant completed before January 1, 1988, or a plant on which substantial physical construction had been performed before January 1, 1988, the criteria specified below shall be applied to that plan. If the phase-in plan meets all of those criteria, all allowable costs that are deferred for future recovery by the regulator under the plan shall be capitalized for financial reporting purposes as a separate asset (a deferred charge). If any one of those criteria is not met, none of the allowable costs that are deferred for future recovery by the regulator under the plan shall be capitalized for financial reporting. The criteria for determining whether capitalization is appropriate are:
                </P>
                <P>1. The allowable costs in question are deferred pursuant to a formal plan that has been agreed to by the regulator;</P>
                <P>2. The plan specifies the timing of recovery of all allowable costs that will be deferred under the plan;</P>
                <P>3. All allowable costs deferred under the plan are scheduled for recovery within 10 years of the date when the deferral began; and</P>

                <P>4. The percentage increase in rates scheduled under the plan for each future year is no greater than the percentage increase in rates scheduled under the plan for each immediately preceding year. That is, the scheduled percentage increase in year two is no greater than the percentage increase granted in year one, the scheduled percentage increase in year three is no greater than the percentage increase in year two, etc.
                </P>

                <P>By definition, a phase-in plan approved prior to 1982 that contains provisions contrary to those detailed above is not subject to the provisions of Statement No. 92. This exemption, however, only relates to a specific utility and a specific regulator. For example, a utility cannot use a phase-in plan <PRTPAGE P="161"/>approved by its regulator for a different utility as justification for its phase-in plan exceeding the 10-year limit imposed by Statement No. 92.</P>
                <P>A phase-in plan is a method of rate making intended to moderate a sudden increase in rates while providing the regulated enterprise with recovery of its investment and a return on that investment during the recovery period. A disallowance is a rate-making action that prevents the regulated enterprise from recovering either some amount of its investment or some amount of return on its investment. Statement No. 90 specifies the accounting for disallowances of plant costs (see item 133 of this regulation). If a method of rate making that meets the criteria for a phase-in plan includes an indirect disallowance of plant costs, that disallowance shall be accounted for in accordance with Statement No. 90. Cumulative amounts capitalized under phase-in plans shall be reported as a separate asset in the balance sheet. The net amount capitalized in each period or the net amount of previously capitalized allowable costs recovered during each period shall be reported as a separate item of other income or expense in the income statement. Allowable costs capitalized shall not be reported as reductions of other expenses.</P>
                <P>The terms of any phase-in plan in effect during the year or ordered for future years shall be disclosed in the financial statements. Statement No. 92 does not permit capitalization for financial reporting of allowable costs deferred for future recovery by the regulator pursuant to a phase-in plan that does not meet the criteria or a phase-in plan related to plant on which substantial physical construction was not completed before January 1, 1988. Nevertheless, the financial statements shall include disclosures of the net amount deferred at the balance sheet date for rate-making purposes, and the net change in deferrals for rate-making purposes during the year for those plans.</P>
                <P>If the provisions of Statement No. 92 are applied retroactively, the financial statements of all periods presented shall be restated. In addition, the restated financial statements shall, in the year that Statement No. 92 is first applied, disclose the nature of any restatement and its effect on margins before extraordinary items, net margins, and on patronage capital at the beginning of the earliest period presented. If the financial statements for prior years are not restated, the effects of applying Statement No. 92 to existing phase-in plans shall be reported as a change in accounting principle and the financial statements shall disclose the effect of adopting Statement No. 92 on margins before extraordinary items and net margins.</P>

                <P>The application of Statement No. 92 to an existing phase-in plan shall be delayed if both of the following conditions are met:
                </P>
                <P>1. The enterprise has filed a rate application to have the plan amended to meet the criteria of Statement No. 92 or intends to do so as soon as practicable; and</P>

                <P>2. It is reasonably possible that the regulator will change the terms of the phase-in plan so that it will meet the criteria of Statement No. 92.
                </P>
                <P>If the above conditions are met, the provisions of Statement No. 92 shall be applied to the existing phase-in plan on the earlier of the date when one of the conditions ceases to be met or the date when the final rate order is received, amending or refusing to amend the phase-in plan. However, if the enterprise delays filing its application for the amendment or the regulator does not process the application in the normal period of time, the application of Statement No. 92 shall not be further delayed.</P>
                <P>In applying the criteria of Statement No. 92 to a plan that was in existence prior to the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 1987, and that was revised to meet that criteria, the 10-year criterion and the requirement concerning the percentage increase shall be measured from the date of the amendment rather than from the date of the first scheduled deferrals under the original plan. All phase-in plans must receive RUS approval prior to implementation.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">135 Accounting for Removal or Relocation of Electric Facilities Resulting from the Action of Others</HD>
                <P>Under arrangements with another party, a borrower agrees, or is obliged, to remove, relocate, rearrange, or otherwise make changes in utility property, other than for the purpose of rendering utility service to the other party, for which the utility is reimbursed for all or a portion of the costs incurred.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Plant Accounting</HD>

                <P>The relocation of the line shall be accounted for as follows:
                </P>
                <P>1. If all of the assemblies in the line are retired or completely removed and later reinstalled or if the line is constructed in a new location before the old line is removed, construction and retirement work orders shall be prepared except for the costs relating to special equipment items (transformers, oil circuit reclosers, etc.) which shall be charged to operations expense.</P>

                <P>2. If a line is moved in its entirety to a new location except for isolated retirement units (such as at the end of the line) or poles not suitable for resetting, the cost of moving the portion of line that is moved intact shall be charged to maintenance expense while the cost related to the change in isolated retirement units or the replacement of poles not suitable for resetting shall be accounted for <PRTPAGE P="162"/>through use of construction and retirement work orders.</P>
                <P>3. If a line is moved intact without any change in assemblies, the cost shall be charged to maintenance expense.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Reimbursement</HD>
                <P>If the borrower receives reimbursement for the costs related to the relocation of the line, the reimbursement shall be accounted for by crediting operation and maintenance expenses to the extent of actual expenses occasioned by the plant changes and crediting the remainder to the accumulated provision for depreciation, unless contractual terms definitely characterize residual or specific amounts as applicable to the cost of replacement. In the latter event, appropriate credits shall be entered in the plant accounts.</P>
                <P>Reimbursement received from a telephone company for adding a pole or replacing a present pole with a taller pole under joint use contracts falls within this latter category. In this instance, appropriate credits are charged against the plant accounts.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Financing</HD>
                <P>The total reimbursement, less any portion for operations and maintenance costs, shall be entered in the “Contributions in Aid of Construction” section at the bottom of the Construction Work Order. When the Inventory of Work Orders (RUS Form 219) is prepared, enter only enough of the contribution in column 9 to reduce to zero the amount in column 10, “Loan Funds Subject to Advance by RUS.” This entry is made although none of the reimbursement received is recorded in the accounting records as a contribution in aid of construction.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">136 Storm Damage</HD>
                <P>As a result of recent hurricane, flood, and ice storm damage, the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) has received several inquiries concerning the proper accounting for storm damage costs and the associated funds received from the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA).</P>
                <P>Storm damage costs should be accounted for under the work order procedure. Units of property destroyed or otherwise removed from service must be reflected on retirement work orders and units of property installed must be shown on construction work orders. To ensure that the accounting for construction and retirement costs is as accurate as possible, an effort should be made to accurately accumulate material, labor, and overhead costs. Even when extreme care has been exercised, however, it may still be necessary to use estimates to develop the appropriate cost figures.</P>
                <P>When a storm occurs, a utility typically incurs a large retirement loss, all or a part of which should be charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation. Storm damage costs over and above construction and retirement costs represent maintenance expense. Maintenance costs include the costs of resagging lines, straightening poles, and replacing minor items of property. When extensive damage has occurred, the need to restore the property to an operating condition without delay usually results in excessive costs being incurred. Standard property unit costs may be used as a guide in determining the amount to be capitalized. It should be noted, however, that when standard property unit costs are used, all excess costs are charged to maintenance expense.</P>
                <P>Because of the storm's destruction, property is retired prematurely and as a result, extraordinary retirement losses occur. When such extraordinary losses occur, they should be recorded in the year in which the losses are incurred. If the recording of such losses will materially distort the income statement, such losses may be charged to Account 435, Extraordinary Deductions. These costs may be deferred and amortized to future periods only if the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (Statement No. 71), are applied. Under the provisions of Statement No. 71, a utility may defer certain costs, provided such costs are included in the utility's rate base and recovered through future rates. If an RUS borrower elects to apply the provisions of Statement No. 71, RUS approval is required. To obtain RUS approval, a borrower must submit:</P>
                <P>a. A detailed description of the plan including the nature of the expense item, the amount of the deferral, the specific time period for rate recovery, and justifying support for the time period selected;</P>
                <P>b. The accounting journal entries being used by the cooperative to record the expense deferral and amortization of deferred costs; and</P>
                <P>c. A copy of the state Commission order authorizing recovery of the deferred costs through future rates, or in the absence of commission jurisdiction, a resolution from the cooperative's board of directors authorizing such recovery.</P>
                <P>To assist in the restoration of the damaged facilities, the Federal government often provides assistance through Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).</P>

                <P>Under current FEMA procedures, FEMA provides funds for the restoration of facilities based upon the cost estimates submitted by the entity requesting assistance. If the FEMA grant is for less than 100 percent of the cost estimates, and does not specify offset expenses, thereby providing the borrower with the maximum opportunity to utilize Rural Development Utilities Program loan funds to finance capitalizable costs. When <PRTPAGE P="163"/>the funds are received, they should be accounted for by first applying the funds received as a credit to maintenance expense and administrative and general costs. Any remaining funds should then be applied as a credit to construction and retirement costs.</P>

                <P>Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of (Statement No. 121), requires reporting entities to review all long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles that are to be held, used, or disposed of by that entity for impairment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying value of the asset, the entity must recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. The impairment loss is reported as a component of income from continuing operations before income taxes for entities presenting an income statement and in the statement of activities of not-for-profit organizations. Statement No. 121 does not apply to assets included in the scope of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 90, Regulated Enterprises—Accounting for Abandonments and Disallowances of Plant Costs.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Assets To Be Held or Used</HD>
                <P>Entities are required to review long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. For example:</P>
                <P>1. A significant decrease in the market value of an asset;</P>
                <P>2. A significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used;</P>
                <P>3. A significant physical change in an asset;<PRTPAGE P="168"/>
                </P>
                <P>4. A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset;</P>
                <P>5. An adverse action or assessment by a regulator;</P>
                <P>6. An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct an asset; and</P>
                <P>7. A current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continued losses associated with an asset used for the purpose of producing revenue.</P>
                <P>The impairment of the asset is measured by estimating the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its disposition. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. Future cash flows are those cash inflows that are expected to be generated by the asset less the cash outflows expected to be necessary to maintain those inflows. If the future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss must be recognized. If the expected future cash flows are greater than the carrying value of the asset, no impairment loss exists.</P>
                <P>The impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount (acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation) of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. The fair value of the asset is the amount for which the asset could be bought or sold in an arms-length transaction between willing parties. A quoted market price is the best evidence of fair value. If this information is not available, the fair value should be based upon the best information available. Consideration should be given to the price of similar assets and valuation techniques such as the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate representative of the risk involved, option-pricing models, matrix pricing, option-adjusted spread models, and fundamental analysis. All available information should be considered when using the above pricing techniques.</P>
                <P>If an impairment is recognized, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to the lower of its fair value or its carrying value and, if depreciable, depreciated over the remaining useful life. Previously recognized impairment losses cannot be restored. If the asset was acquired in a business combination and there is goodwill resulting from the transaction, the goodwill is included in the asset grouping and reduced or eliminated before any adjustment is made to the carrying value of the asset.</P>
                <P>The following financial statement disclosures are required in the period in which the impairment is recognized:</P>
                <P>1. A description of the impaired assets and the facts and circumstances surrounding the impairment;</P>
                <P>2. The amount of the impairment and how fair value was determined;</P>
                <P>3. The caption in the income statement or the statement of activities in which the impairment loss is aggregated if that loss has not been presented as a separate caption or reported parenthetically on the face of the statement; and</P>
                <P>4. If applicable, the business segment(s) affected.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Assets To Be Disposed</HD>
                <P>Statement No. 121 also applies to all long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for which management, having the authority to approve the action, has committed to a plan of disposal except those assets covered by APB No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations—Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. An asset to be disposed of is carried at the lower of its carrying amount (acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation) or its fair value less cost to sell.</P>
                <P>The fair value of the asset to be disposed of is computed in the same manner as that for an asset to be held or used by the entity. Selling costs include the incremental direct cost to transact the sale—broker commissions, legal fees, title transfer, and other closing costs that must be incurred before legal title can be transferred. Costs such as insurance, security service, and utilities are generally excluded unless these costs are part of a contractual agreement that obligates the entity to incur such costs in the future. If the asset's fair value is based upon current market price or the current selling price for a similar asset, the fair value is considered a current amount and is not discounted. If, however, the fair value is based upon discounted expected future cash flows and if the sale is to occur beyond one year, the cost to sell must also be discounted. Assets covered by this statement are not depreciated (amortized) while being held for disposal.</P>
                <P>Subsequent revisions in estimates of fair value less cost to sell are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount of the asset to be disposed of as long as the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed the original carrying amount.</P>
                <P>The following financial statement disclosures are required in the period in which the impairment is recognized:</P>

                <P>1. A description of the assets to be disposed of including the facts and circumstances leading to the expected disposal, the expected disposal date, and the carrying amount of those assets;<PRTPAGE P="169"/>
                </P>
                <P>2. If applicable, the business segment(s) in which the assets to be disposed of are held;</P>
                <P>3. The amount, if any, of the impairment loss resulting from the adoption of this statement;</P>
                <P>4. The gain or loss, if any, resulting from subsequent revisions in the estimates of fair value less cost to sell;</P>
                <P>5. The caption in the income statement or statement of activities in which the gains or losses are aggregated if those gains or losses have not been presented as a separate caption or reported parenthetically on the face of the statement; and</P>
                <P>6. The results of operations for assets to be disposed of to the extent that those results are included in the entity's results of operations for the period and can be identified.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD3">138 Automatic Meter Reading Systems—Turtles</HD>
                <P>Automatic meter reading systems were developed from technology called power line carrier communication systems. One such system, developed by Hunt Technologies, Inc., is called by its brand name, the Turtle system. In addition to its function as an automated reading device, the Turtle can provide outage detection, power failure counts, and other potential applications. The current Turtle system does not have the capability for applications such as collection of load survey or interval data. A Turtle system consists of:</P>
                <P>1. A meter reader mounted (retrofitted) inside the meter;</P>
                <P>2. A receiver located in each substation; and</P>
                <P>3. Monitoring and programming equipment (software and personal computer) usually located in the headquarters building.</P>
                <P>The system transmits continuous information one way from the meter to a receiver located in the substation. The receiver constantly monitors every Turtle meter served by the substation. The substation receiver can be sized to monitor up to 3,000 Turtle meter readers at the same time. The data is then transmitted to the headquarters monitoring equipment via telephone line or an equivalent communication system.</P>
                <P>The technical literature and other information provided by the manufacturer indicates that this system can only be used for remote meter reading, outage detection, power failure counts, and phase identification. At this time, there is no indication that the system supports other functions such as home security. Therefore, the accounting prescribed for the Turtle meter reading devices and support equipment relates only to electric utility operations.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Accounting Requirements</HD>

                <P>The function of the equipment is the primary factor in determining the account in which the equipment shall be recorded. The components of the Turtle automatic meter reading system shall be recorded in Account 370, Meters. The cost of the meter reader encoding device and retrofitting the meter with the meter reader unit shall be capitalized to the cost of the existing meter. Any associated operating expenses shall be <PRTPAGE P="170"/>charged to Account 586, Meter Expenses, with maintenance expenses charged to Account 597, Maintenance of Meters.</P>
                <P>Separate continuing property records shall be established for the meters, either fitted or retrofitted with the device; the receiver; the personal computer; and the system software. The meters, receivers, and personal computer shall be depreciated over the manufacturer's estimated useful service life. The system software shall be depreciated over the estimated useful service life of the program not to exceed 5 years.</P>

                <P>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a worldwide radio-navigation system formed from a network of 24 satellites and their ground stations. Utilities are using this advanced technology geographic data collection system to update and modernize their system maps. GPS uses a system of satellites orbiting the earth to establish plant locations with pinpoint accuracy. By triangulating from three satellites and using radio signals to measure distances and locate items, system-wide maps can be created of the utility's service area. A field inventory is then taken of the utility's plant and plotted onto the map. The GPS consists of base station equipment, remote station equipment, the GPS program, and mapping conversion software.</P>
                <P>All equipment associated with GPS is dedicated to the mapping effort. The base station is installed at a fixed location and ties satellite measurements into a solid local reference. The remote station is a portable receiver that is taken into the field to determine locations and is moved from site to site. The GPS program is the application software that operates the station equipment and is used by layout technicians to gather information of existing and new facilities in the field. The conversion software is used for converting the GPS and inventory information gathered in the field into a form usable by the mapping program.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD3">401 Computer Software Costs</HD>
                <P>Computer software consists of programs and routines (sets of computer instructions) which direct the operation of the computer. Software may refer to generalized routines useful in computer operations or to programs for specific applications such as payroll.</P>
                <P>The distinction between generalized software and application software is important. Generalized software provides operating support for individual applications. This would include programs for such tasks as making printouts of machine-readable records, sorting records, organizing and maintaining files, translating programs written in a symbolic language into machine-language instructions, and scheduling jobs through the computer. These programs are generally furnished by the manufacturer.</P>
                <P>Application software consists of a set of instructions for performing a particular data processing task. Application programs are generally written by the user installation, but are frequently obtained as prewritten packages from software vendors. Application software includes programs such as payroll, billing, general ledger, as well as engineering or managerial applications.</P>
                <P>Costs incurred with the purchase or development of computer software shall be accounted for as follows:</P>
                <P>1. Capitalize in a subaccount of Account 391, Office Furniture and Equipment, all costs for generalized software. Depreciate the cost over the service life (or remaining life) of the main hardware (i.e., containing central processor). If the purchase invoice does not break out or assign a cost to the “generalized software,” it is appropriate to include the full amount in hardware costs. Capitalize in a separate subaccount of Account 391, all costs for applications software determined to have a service life of over one year. Depreciate the cost over the estimated useful service life of the program. This depreciation period shall not exceed five (5) years. RUS realizes, however, that there may be circumstances that justify a useful life longer than 5 years. When this is the case and it is management's intent to utilize these programs over an extended period, written justification shall be submitted to RUS for approval.</P>
                <P>2. Expense in Account 921, Office Supplies and Expenses, in the period incurred, all costs associated with the maintenance, updating, and conversion of files or revision of all software, and all costs for software with a useful life of less than 1 year. Also expense in Account 921, the unamortized cost of all software determined, during the year, to be no longer used by or useful to the cooperative. Such costs that are clearly applicable to any category of operating expenses other than the administrative and general category, however, shall be included in the appropriate account in such category. In accordance with the USoA, no portion of such costs shall be capitalized to construction or retirement activities.</P>
                <P>In determining the total cost of purchased or internally developed software, the following items shall be included:</P>
                <P>a. Costs incurred for feasibility studies if they result in the purchase or development of software;</P>
                <P>b. All costs related to the actual purchase or development of the software. These costs must be specifically identifiable with the software and properly supported by time cards, invoices, or other documents; and</P>
                <P>c. All costs incurred in “testing and debugging” the software.</P>
                <P>Computer software costs are properly chargeable to Account 107, Construction Work in Progress, provided that the following criteria are met:</P>
                <P>1. The computer program is specifically dedicated to performing a construction related activity, and</P>
                <P>2. The cost of the software is itemized separate and apart from other hardware and software costs.</P>
                <P>The cost of software programs meeting the above requirements and having an estimated useful service life in excess of 1 year shall be recorded in Account 186, Miscellaneous Deferred Debits, and amortized to Account 107, Construction Work in Progress, over the estimated service life of the program not to exceed 5 years.</P>
                <P>All costs related to training personnel in the use of software shall be expensed as incurred.</P>
                <P>The accounting in this section is not intended to apply to immaterial amounts. When it is deemed that the costs of the recordkeeping necessary to amortize these costs outweigh the benefits to the members, software costs shall be expensed in the year incurred.</P>

                <P>1. Legal fees incurred in connection with a construction project, including the court costs directly related thereto, which can be identified and supported as such, shall be capitalized in Account 107, Construction Work-in-Progress, as a cost of construction.</P>
                <P>2. Legal fees specifically identified and properly supported as resulting from activities designed to obtain long-term debt, shall be deferred in Account 181, Unamortized Debt Expense.</P>

                <P>3. Legal fees for all other services and fees which cannot be properly identified will require expensing to either Account 417.1, Expenses of Nonutility Operations, or Account 923, Outside Services Employed, as appropriate.
                </P>
                <P>To properly support the capitalization or deferral of legal fees, the attorney shall provide an itemization of services performed and the corresponding costs.

                <P>4. The present value of the lease payments at the inception of the lease equals or exceeds 90 percent of the fair market value of the leased property.
                </P>
                <P>A lease agreement qualifying as a capital lease shall be recorded in either Account 101.1, Property Under Capital Leases;Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel Under Capital Leases; or Account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate, at the present value (at the beginning of the lease term) of the minimum lease payments. If, however, this amount exceeds the fair value of the leased property at the inception of the lease, the asset shall be recorded at its fair market value. An offsetting credit shall be recorded in Account 227, Obligations Under Capital Leases—Noncurrent, with the current portion recorded in Account 243, Obligations Under Capital Leases—Current. Assets recorded in Account 101.1 shall be classified separately according to the detailed accounts (301-399) provided for electric plant in service.</P>

                <P>1. An RUS borrower that is a subsidiary of another entity shall prepare and submit to RUS separate financial statements even though this financial information is presented in the parent's consolidated statements.</P>
                <P>2. In those cases in which an RUS borrower has a majority-ownership in a subsidiary, the borrower must prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with the requirements of Statement No. 94.

                <P>Although Statement No. 94 requires the consolidation of majority-owned subsidiaries, Forms 7 and 12 must be prepared on a basis consistent with the equity method of accounting for investments. For distribution borrowers, this requires that the investment be shown on Form 7 in Part C, Balance Sheet, on line 7, Investments in Subsidiary Companies, or line 9, Investments in Associated Organizations—Other—General Funds, as appropriate. The result of operation is shown in Part A, Statement of Operations, on line 23, Income (Loss) from Equity Investments. For generation and transmission borrowers, the investments should be shown on Form 12, in Section C, Balance Sheet, on Line 7, Investments in Subsidiary Companies, or Line 9, Investments in Associated Organizations—Other—General Funds, as appropriate.

                </P>
                <P>1. Determine the total amount to be assigned for the year (Account 201.2).</P>
                <P>2. Determine patronage from electric service, the total of consumers' billings (Accounts 440-447).</P>
                <P>3. Determine the percentage factor to be used in calculating patronage capital to be credited to each consumer account. Divide “1” by “2”.</P>

                <P>4. Determine the amount of capital to be credited to each consumer. Multiply the individual consumer's billings for the year by the percentage factor obtained in “3” above.
                </P>

                <P>The procedure for determining the amount of patronage capital assignable to the individual patron on a dollar basis, less the cost of power, is as follows:
                </P>
                <P>1. Determine the total amount to be assigned for the year.</P>
                <P>2. Determine the total amount of revenue received from each classification of customers.</P>
                <P>3. Determine the total cost of power for each classification of customers. (For example, use cost per kWh sold).</P>
                <P>4. For each classification of customers subtract the amount obtained in “3” from the amount obtained in “2,” to obtain the total amount received, less cost of power, by classification of customers.</P>
                <P>5. Add the amounts obtained in “4” to obtain the total amount of revenue, less cost of power.</P>
                <P>6. Divide the total amount received, less cost of power for each classification of customers (amounts obtained in “4”), by the total amount received, less cost of power for all customers (amount obtained in “5”) to obtain the prorata percentage for each classification of customers.</P>
                <P>7. Multiply the total amount to be allocated (amount obtained in “1”) by the prorata percentage for each classification of customers (obtained in “6”) to obtain the amount to be assigned each classification of customers.</P>
                <P>8. Divide the amount to be assigned each classification of customers (amount obtained in “7”) by the total amount received from the classification of customers (amount obtain in “2”) to obtain the percentage factor for each classification of customers.</P>

                <P>9. Determine the total amount received from each individual customer.<PRTPAGE P="175"/>
                </P>

                <P>10. Multiply the total amount received from each individual customer (amount obtained in “9”) by the percentage factor for his classification (amount obtained in “8”) to obtain the amount of capital to be assigned each individual customer.
                </P>
                <P>After calculating the patronage capital to be credited to each customer, there is usually a small balance remaining. This small balance shall remain in Account 201.2, Patronage Capital Assignable, and shall be added to the amount to be assigned in the following year.</P>
                <P>Proper records shall be maintained to support all capital credit transactions. As a minimum, these records shall show, for each patron, the amount of capital credited for each year as well as the amount and date retired for each year.</P>
                <P>The process of transferring capital credits from the Patronage Capital Assignable accounts to the Patrons' Capital Credits Assigned accounts or to the Patrons' Capital Credits accounts and the making of entries to individual patron's records constitutes an assignment of capital credits. This holds true for recordkeeping purposes as well as from a legal point of view. This assignment shall be followed by formal notification to patrons within a reasonable period of time.</P>
                <P>In the event that a distribution cooperative incurs a net loss, that loss shall not be allocated to its members (patrons). The loss shall be accumulated and offset by future nonoperating margins.</P>

                <P>If a capital credit check is returned due to an inability to locate the patron, it shall be held pending a recheck of available records to ascertain the correct address of the patron. If it is determined that the patron cannot be located, the check shall be cancelled and the amount of the check debited to Account 131.1, Cash—General, and credited to Account 217, Retired Capital Credits—Gain. If the state, however, has unclaimed property laws to which the amount is subject, the amount shall be credited to Account 253, Other Deferred Credits, until final disposition has been made.

                <P>If the records show that a number of former patrons have moved and left no forwarding address, it is not necessary to prepare a capital credit retirement check for these patrons when a general retirement of capital credits is made.

The balance in these accounts shall be accounted for as follows:
                </P>
                <P>1. The balance in Account 219.4, Other Margins and Equities—Prior Periods, shall be transferred, at year's end, to Account 219.1 or 219.2, as appropriate. Accounts 219.1 and 219.2 are then closed to Account 201.2, Patronage Capital Assignable, unless otherwise provided for in the bylaws.</P>
                <P>2. The balances in Account 434, Extraordinary Income, and Account 435, Extraordinary Deductions, shall be cleared to Account 219.2 at year's end.</P>

                <P>3. The balances in Account 219.3, Other Margins, and Account 218, Capital Gains and Losses, shall remain in these accounts unless they are allocated to patrons or used to absorb future losses as provided for in the bylaws of the cooperative.
                </P>
                <P>When a cooperative is engaged in a major merchandising activity, all costs properly chargeable to the merchandising activity shall be allocated as such to offset the associated revenue. Nonoperating margins generated from this source shall be prorated annually on a patronage basis and credited to those patrons accounts from whom such amounts were obtained. Merchandising activities of this nature may require a bylaw provision allowing for the allocation of margins generated by a major merchandising activity separate from other operating or nonoperating margins.</P>
                <P>If, at the time of the adoption of the bylaw provisions for the allocation of nonoperating margins, there are prior years' losses resulting in debit balances in Accounts 218, Capital Gains and Losses; 219.1, Operating Margins; 219.2, Nonoperating Margins; or 219.3, Other Margins; the credit balances in Accounts 218, 219.2, or 219.3 resulting from prior years' operations shall be transferred, to the extent necessary, to offset such deficits. If the board determines that amounts shall be allocated to prior years' patrons, the credit balances remaining in these accounts shall be transferred to Account 201.2, Patronage Capital Assignable.</P>
                <P>If there are current year's losses resulting in debit balances in either Account 219.1 or 219.2, credit balances in Accounts 219.2, 219.3, and 218 shall be transferred, to the extent necessary, to offset such deficits. Remaining credit balances allocable to patrons shall be transferred to Account 1.2.</P>

                <P>When a cooperative receives capital credits from a G&amp;T cooperative, the transaction shall be recorded by a debit to Account 123.1, Patronage Capital from Associated Cooperatives, and a credit to Account 423, Generation and Transmission Cooperative Capital Credits. This entry shall be made priorto the closing of the cooperative's books even though, in most cases, the notice of the G&amp;T allocation is not received until after the close of the year to which it relates. If precise information cannot be obtained from the G&amp;T within a reasonable time, capital credits shall be recorded on an estimated basis. The difference between the estimated amount and the actual shall be recognized in the following year unless the difference is material.</P>
                <P>A distribution cooperative shall not recognize its proportionate share of losses incurred by the G&amp;T. G&amp;T losses shall be accumulated and offset as provided for in the bylaws. Unlike distribution cooperatives, a G&amp;T has the option to offset accumulated losses with future operating and/or nonoperating margins.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">505 Patronage Capital Furnished by Other Cooperative Service Organizations</HD>

                <P>Utilities may obtain long-term and short-term loans, telephone or data processing services, or may purchase oil, gasoline, materials, insurance, and various items from cooperative or mutual enterprises. These enterprises often make patronage refunds or provide evidence that an amount equal to such a refund has been credited to the utility as an investment of capital. The refund may be in the form of cash in the year following the purchase or it may be deducted from the next invoice. The notice of patronage credited to the borrower's account may indicate that such capital may be retired at some future date upon certain conditions having been met. The following provides the accounting journal entries for these types of transactions:
                </P>
                <P>1. Insurance policy refunds from mutual companies, in cash or as credits against subsequent purchases, shall be credited to the appropriate expense account. If sufficient information is not available to credit the refunds to the appropriate expense accounts, they shall be credited to Account 165, Prepayments, and reduce premiums for the current year.</P>

                <P>2. Patronage capital allocations from cooperatives, other than mutual insurance companies, shall be credited, in the year that the allocation notice is received, to Account <PRTPAGE P="177"/>424, Other Capital Credits and Patronage Allocations, or to construction work-in-progress, as appropriate. The allocation of patronage capital credits between Account 424 and construction work-in-progress shall be made on an equitable basis. For example, patronage capital allocations received from a cooperative money lender are allocated between Account 424 and construction work-in-progress based upon the ratio of interest charged to construction for that particular lender to total interest expense incurred for that lender. Patronage capital allocations received from a material supplier are allocated based upon the ratio of materials charged to construction to total materials purchased.</P>
                <P>3. The face amount of patronage capital certificates received by the cooperative from the purchase of goods or services from cooperative money lenders (CFC), oil dealers, material suppliers, pole treating plants, communications services, and others shall be charged to either Account 123.1, Patronage Capital from Associated Cooperatives, or Account 124, Other Investments, as appropriate. Account 123.1 shall include investments in only those cooperatives, or enterprises, that are directly related to the electric utility industry and controlled by the electric cooperatives. These include statewide cooperatives, power cooperatives, and NRECA. Other investments in oil cooperatives and insurance companies shall be charged to Account 124.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">506 Forfeited Membership Fees</HD>
                <P>The bylaws of each cooperative prescribe certain rules and regulations concerning membership in the cooperative. Among these are provisions for forfeiture of membership fees. Some bylaws provide for application of membership fees against any unpaid accounts at the time of termination of service. Any remaining balance may be refunded to the member. Balances that cannot be refunded to the member due to an inability to locate the member or due to bylaw restriction, shall be credited to Account 208, Donated Capital, provided they do not escheat to the state. If disposition of the fees cannot be determined immediately, the amount involved shall be transferred to Account 253, Other Deferred Credits, until the determination is made.</P>

                <P>The costs of employees' fringe benefits (hospitalization, retirement, holiday, sick and vacation pay, etc.) shall be accumulated in an appropriate clearing account and allocated monthly on the basis of payroll. Vacation costs shall be accrued monthly by appropriate credits to an accrual account. These monthly accruals shall be allocated on the basis of direct payroll costs to construction, retirement, and the applicable operations, maintenance, and administrative expense accounts.</P>
                <P>Sick leave costs are not normally accrued unless the employee is entitled to be paid for accumulated sick leave at the termination of employment.

                <P>Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 43, Accounting for Compensated Absences (Statement No. 43), requires employers to accrue a liability as an employee earns the right to be paid for future absences. Four criteria were established for this accrual:</P>
                <P>1. The employer's obligation for payment for future absences is attributable to employees' services already performed.</P>
                <P>2. The obligation relates to employee rights which vest or accumulate. Vested rights are considered those for which the employer is obligated to make payment even if the employee terminates. Rights which accumulate are those earned but unused rights to compensated absences which may be carried forward to one or more periods, subsequent to the period in which they are earned.</P>
                <P>3. Payment of the compensation is probable.</P>
                <P>4. The amount can be reasonably estimated.</P>
                <P>A company's liability shall be estimated based upon payments it expects to make as a result of employees' work already performed. If a reasonable estimate cannot be made, the company shall disclose that fact in the financial statements.</P>
                <P>Statement No. 43 does not apply to severance or termination pay, postretirement benefits, deferred compensation, stock or stock options, group insurance, or other long-term fringe benefits.</P>

As a general rule the cost of these programs is borne partially by the cooperative and partially by its employees. The cooperative may pay the full cost in advance and recover the employee's share through payroll deductions. The accounting for these transactions is as follows:</P>
                <P>1. The cooperative's advanced payment of premiums on insurance and retirement agreements shall be charged to Account 165, Prepayments, for the employers portion, and Account 143, Other Accounts Receivable, for the employee's portion.</P>
                <P>2. The cost of the employer's portion of a retirement and group insurance program shall be charged to construction and retirement activities and the applicable operations, maintenance, and administrative expense accounts based upon a specific identification with employees' labor costs charged therein or, in the absence of specific employee identification, based upon direct labor dollars or direct labor hours depending upon which allocation technique provides the most equitable distribution of costs.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD3">606 Pension Costs</HD>
                <P>With the issuance of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions (Statement No. 87), there have been significant changes in the accounting and reporting requirements relating to pension costs. This section will highlight the accounting and reporting requirements for the major types of pension plans. It should be noted, however, that the definitions and accounting procedures outlined in this section relate to financial accounting and they may differ from those used for tax accounting.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Defined Benefit Pension Plans</HD>
                <P>A defined benefit pension plan is a plan that defines an amount of pension benefit to be provided, usually as a function of one or more factors such as age, years of service, or compensation. In a defined benefit plan, the employer promises to provide, in addition to current wages, retirement income payments in future years after the employee retires or terminates service. Generally, the amount of benefit to be paid depends upon a number of future events that are incorporated into the plan's benefit formula, after including how long the employee and any survivors live, how many years of service the employee renders, and the employee's compensation in the years immediately before retirement or termination.</P>
                <P>Under a defined benefit plan, the determination of pension costs, assets, liabilities, and the disclosures in the financial statements require many calculations and assumptions to be made. This section provides a general overview of the accounting and reporting requirements associated with a defined benefit pension plan. Consult Statement No. 87 for guidance in making the necessary calculations and assumption.</P>
                <P>The accounting and reporting requirements related to a defined benefit pension plan are as follows:</P>
                <P>1. The following components shall be included in the periodic recognition of net pension cost by an employer sponsoring a defined benefit pension plan:</P>
                <P>a. The service cost component recognized in a period shall be determined as the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the pension plan formula to employee service during that period. The measurement of the service cost component requires use of an attribution method and assumptions.</P>
                <P>b. The interest cost component recognized in a period shall be determined as the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time. Measuring the projected benefit obligation as a present value requires accrual of an interest cost at rates equal to the assumed discount rates.</P>
                <P>c. For a funded plan, the actual return on plan assets, if any, shall be determined based upon the fair value of plan assets at the beginning and the end of the period, adjusted for contributions and benefit payments.</P>

                <P>d. Plan amendments (including initiation of a plan) often include provisions that grant increased benefits based upon services rendered in prior period. Because plan amendments are granted with the expectation that the employer will realize economic benefits in future period, Statement No. 87 does not <PRTPAGE P="180"/>require the cost of providing such retroactive benefits (prior service cost) to be included in net periodic pension cost entirely in the year of the amendment but provides for recognition during the future service periods of those employees active at the date of the amendment who are expected to receive benefits under the plan.</P>
                <P>The cost of retroactive benefits (including benefits that are granted to retirees) is the increase in the projected benefit obligation at the date of the amendment. Except as noted below, prior service cost shall be amortized by assigning an equal amount to each future period of service of each employee active at the date of the amendments who is expected to receive benefits under the plan. If all or almost all of the plan's participants are inactive, the cost of retroactive plan amendments affecting benefits of inactive participants shall be amortized based upon the remaining life expectancy of those participants rather than the remaining service period.</P>
                <P>To reduce the complexity and detail of the computations required, consistent use of an alternative amortization approach that more rapidly reduces the unrecognized cost of retroactive amendments is acceptable. For example, a straight-line amortization of the cost over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plan is acceptable. The alternative method used shall be disclosed.</P>
                <P>In some situations, a history of regular plan amendments and other evidence may indicate that the period during which the employee expects to realize economic benefits from an amendment granting retroactive benefits is shorter than the entire remaining service period of the active employees. Identification of such situations requires an assessment of the individual circumstances and the substance of the particular plan situation. In those circumstances, the amortization of prior service cost shall be accelerated to reflect the more rapid expiration of the employer's economic benefits and to recognize the cost in the periods benefited.</P>
                <P>A plan amendment can reduce rather than increase the projected benefit obligation. Such a reduction shall be used to reduce an existing unrecognized prior service cost, and the excess, if any, shall be amortized on the same basis as the cost of benefit increases.</P>
                <P>e. Gains and losses are changes in the amount of either the projected benefit obligation or plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed and changes in assumptions. Gains and losses include amounts that have been realized. Because gains and losses may reflect refinements in estimates as well as real changes in economic values, and because some gains in one period may be offset by losses in another or vice versa, the recognition of gains and losses as components of net pension cost of the period in which they arise is not required.</P>
                <P>The expected return on plan assets shall be determined based upon the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the market-related value of plan assets. The market-related value of plan assets shall be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than 5 years. Different ways of calculating market-related value may be used for different classes of assets but the manner of determining market-related value shall be applied consistently from year to year for each asset class.</P>
                <P>Asset gains and losses are the differences between the actual return on assets during a period and the expected return on assets for that period. Assets gains and losses include both changes reflected in the market-related value of assets and changes not yet reflected in the market-related value (that is, the difference between the fair value of assets and the market-related value). Asset gains and losses not yet reflected in market-related values are not required to be amortized.</P>
                <P>As a minimum, amortization of an unrecognized gain or loss (excluding asset gains and losses not yet reflected in market-related value) shall be included as a component of net pension cost for a year if, as of the beginning of the year, that unrecognized net gain or loss exceeds 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. If amortization is required, the minimum amortization shall be that excess divided by the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. If all or almost all of a plan's participants are inactive, the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants shall be used instead of average remaining service life.</P>
                <P>Any systematic method of amortization of gains and losses may be used in lieu of the minimum specified in the previous paragraph provided that the minimum is used in any period in which the minimum is greater (i.e., reduces the net balance by more), the method is applied consistently, the method is applied similarly to both gains and losses, and the method is disclosed.</P>
                <P>The gain or loss component of net periodic pension cost shall consist of the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets and amortization of the unrecognized net gain or loss from previous periods.</P>

                <P>2. A liability (unfunded accrued pension cost) shall be recognized if the net periodic pension cost recognized pursuant to Statement No. 87 exceeds amounts the employer has contributed to the plan. An asset (prepaid pension cost) shall be recognized if the net periodic pension cost is less than the <PRTPAGE P="181"/>amounts the employer has contributed to the plan.</P>
                <P>If the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets, the employer shall recognize a liability (including unfunded accrued pension cost) that is at least equal to the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation. Recognition of an additional minimum liability is required if an unfunded accumulated benefit obligation exists and an asset has been recognized as a prepaid pension cost, the liability already recognized as unfunded accrued pension cost is less than the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation, or no accrued or prepaid pension cost has been recognized.</P>
                <P>If an additional minimum liability is recognized, an equal amount shall be recognized as an intangible asset, provided that the asset does not exceed the amount of unrecognized prior service cost. If an additional liability required to be recognized exceeds unrecognized prior service cost, the excess (which represents a net loss not yet recognized as a net periodic pension cost) shall be reported as a separate component (reduction) of equity.</P>
                <P>When a new determination of the amount of additional liability is made to prepare a balance sheet, the related intangible asset and separate component of equity shall be eliminated or adjusted, as necessary.</P>
                <P>3. An employer sponsoring a defined benefit pension plan shall disclose the following information:</P>
                <P>a. A description of the plan including employee groups covered, type of benefit formula, funding policy, types of assets held and significant nonbenefit liabilities, if any, and the nature and effect of significant matters affecting comparability of information for all period presented.</P>
                <P>b. The amount of net periodic pension cost for the period showing separately the service cost component, the interest cost component, the actual return on assets for the period, and the net total of other components.</P>
                <P>c. A schedule reconciling the funded status of the plan with amounts reported in the employer's balance sheet, showing separately, the fair value of plan assets, the projected benefit obligation identifying the accumulated benefit obligation and the vested benefit obligation, the amount of unrecognized prior service cost, the amount of unrecognized net gain or loss including asset gains and losses not yet reflected in market-related value), the amount of any remaining unrecognized net obligation or net asset existing at the date of initial application of Statement No. 87, the amount of any additional liability recognized, and the amount of net pension asset or liability recognized in the balance sheet (which is the net result of combining the previous six items).</P>
                <P>d. The weighted-average assumed discount rate and rate of compensation increase (if applicable) used to measure the projected benefit obligation and the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.</P>
                <P>e. If applicable, the amount and type of securities of the employer and related parties included in plan assets, and the approximate amount of annual benefits of employees and retirees covered by annuity contracts issued by the employer and related parties. Also, if applicable, the alternative amortization periods used.</P>
                <P>f. An employer that sponsors two or more separate defined benefit pension plans shall determine net periodic pension cost, liabilities, and assets by separately applying the provisions of Statement No. 87 to each plan. In particular, unless an employer clearly has a right to use the assets of one plan to pay benefits of another, a liability required to be recognized for one plan shall not be reduced or eliminated because another plan has assets in excess of its accumulated benefit obligation or because the employer has prepaid pension cost related to another plan.</P>
                <P>The required disclosures may be aggregated for all of an employer's single-employer defined benefit plans, or plans may be disaggregated into groups so as to provide the most useful information. Plans with assets in excess of the accumulated benefit obligation, however, shall not be aggregated with plans that have accumulated benefit obligations that exceed plan assets.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Annuity Contracts</HD>
                <P>An annuity contract is a contract in which an insurance company unconditionally undertakes a legal obligation to provide specified benefits to specific individuals in return for a fixed consideration or premium. An annuity contract is irrevocable and involves the transfer of significant risk from the employer to the insurance company. Some annuity contracts (participating annuity contracts) provide that the purchaser (either the plan or the employer) may participate in the experience of the insurance company. Under these contracts, the insurance company ordinarily pays dividends to the purchaser. If the substance of a participating contract is such that the employer remains subject to all or most of the risks and rewards associated with the benefit obligation covered and the assets transferred to the insurance company, that contract is not an annuity contract for purposes of Statement No. 87.</P>

                <P>To the extent that benefits currently earned are covered by annuity contracts, the cost of these benefits shall be the cost of purchasing the contracts, except as noted below. That is, if all benefits attributed by the plan's benefits formula to service in the current period are covered by nonparticipating annuity contracts, the cost of the contracts determines the service cost component of net pension cost for that period.<PRTPAGE P="182"/>
                </P>
                <P>Benefits provided by the pension benefit formula beyond benefits provided by annuity contracts (for example, benefits related to future compensation levels) shall be accounted for according to the provisions applicable to plans not involving insurance contracts.</P>
                <P>Benefits covered by annuity contracts shall be excluded from the projected benefit obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation. Except as noted below, annuity contracts shall be excluded from plan assets.</P>
                <P>Some annuity contracts provide that the purchaser (either the plan or the employer) may participate in the experience of the insurance company. Under these contracts, the insurance company ordinarily pays dividends to the purchaser, the effect of which is to reduce the cost of the plan. The purchase price of a participating annuity contract ordinarily is higher than the price of an equivalent contract without participation rights. The cost of the participation right shall be recognized, at the date of purchase, as an asset. In subsequent periods, the participation right shall be measured at its fair value if the contract is such that the fair value is reasonably estimable. Otherwise, the participation right shall be measured at its amortized cost (not in excess of its net realizable value), and the cost shall be amortized systematically over the expected dividend period under the contract.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Other Contracts with Insurance Companies</HD>
                <P>Insurance contracts that are, in substance, equivalent to the purchase of annuities shall be accounted for as such. Other contracts with insurance companies shall be accounted for as investments and measured at fair value. For some contracts, the best available evidence of fair value may be contract value. If a contract has a determinable cash surrender value or conversion value, that is presumed to be its fair value.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Defined Contribution Plans</HD>
                <P>A defined contribution pension plan is a plan that provides pension benefits in return for services rendered, provides an individual account for each participant, and has terms that specify how contributions to the individual's accounts are to be determined rather than the amount of pension benefits the individual is to receive. Under a defined contribution plan, the pension benefits a participant will receive depend only upon the amount contributed to the participant's account, the returns earned on investments of those contributions, and forfeitures of other participants' benefits that may be allocated to the participant's account.</P>
                <P>To the extent that a plan's defined contributions to an individual's account are to be made for periods in which that individual renders services, the net pension cost for a period shall be the contribution called for in that period. If a plan calls for contributions for periods after an individual retires or terminates, the estimated cost shall be accrued during the employee's service period.</P>
                <P>An employer that sponsors one or more defined contribution plans shall disclose the following separately from its defined benefit plan disclosures:</P>
                <P>1. A description of the plan(s) including employee groups covered, the basis for determining contributions, and the nature and effect of significant matters affecting comparability of information for all periods presented.</P>
                <P>2. The amount of cost recognized during the period.</P>
                <P>A pension plan having characteristics of both a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan requires careful analysis. If the substance of the plan is to provide a defined benefit, as may be the case with some “target benefit” plans, the accounting and disclosure requirements shall be determined in accordance with the provisions applicable to a defined benefit plan.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Multiemployer Plans</HD>
                <P>A multiemployer plan is a pension plan to which two or more unrelated employers contribute, usually pursuant to one or more collective-bargaining agreements. A characteristic of multiemployer plans is that assets contributed by one participating employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers since assets contributed by an employer are not segregated in a separate account or restricted to provide benefits only to employees of that employer.</P>
                <P>An employer participating in a multiemployer plan shall recognize as net pension cost, the required contribution for the period and shall recognize as a liability, any contributions due and unpaid. The required contribution includes both current costs and prior service costs. If an employer elects to fund prior service cost in full at the inception of the plan, the total payment becomes the employer's required contribution, and accordingly, its pension cost for the period.</P>
                <P>The following provisions are applicable to RUS borrowers participating in a multiemployer pension plan:</P>
                <P>1. An electric utility participating in a multiemployer plan may defer current period pension expenses if the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71 (Statement No. 71), Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, are applied.</P>

                <P>Under the provisions of Statement No. 71, pension costs may be deferred provided such costs are recovered through future rates.<PRTPAGE P="183"/>
                </P>
                <P>2. An electric utility instituting an amendment to the NRECA Retirement and Security plan enters into a contractual agreement to pay the costs incurred (prior service pension costs) for the amendment. In such cases, the agreement is noncancelable and payable regardless of continued participation in the plan.</P>
                <P>Since the utility is unconditionally committed to making these payments and such payments are not contingent upon the utility's continued participation in the plan, the recognition of that liability is appropriate. The costs associated with this liability shall be expensed, in their entirety, when the liability is recognized.</P>
                <P>The accounting journal entries required to record the transactions associated with a multiemployer pension plan are as follows:</P>

Because of this, power is sold at the standard rate at which the power cooperative sells to other distribution cooperatives who do not own their transmission lines, less a discount. The discount or reduction in rate is based upon the distribution cooperative's expense in operating and maintaining its transmission facilities. The contract between the power cooperative and the distribution cooperative must specifically state that the member shall receive a reduced rate or discount from the seller's rate to other member cooperatives.</P>

                <P>Some vendors from which electric cooperatives purchase plant materials and supplies and merchandise for resale are making purchase rebates based upon the quantity or dollar volume of purchases. These “quantity discounts” may be in the form of cash or credit memoranda, in the form of prepaid package travel arrangements, or a combination of such methods. The rebate shall be accounted for as a reduction in the cost of the material or appliances upon which it was based.</P>
                <P>In some instances, the rebate may be for material or appliances that are no longer in stock or cannot be identified. If the rebate is based upon the purchase of plant materials and operating supplies that are normally charged to Account 154, Plant Materials and Operating Supplies, a credit shall be made to Account 163, Stores Expense Undistributed. If the rebate is based upon appliances and equipment held for merchandising or contract work, the credit shall be spread over the items in Account 155, Merchandise. To avoid materially distorting the cost of the remaining appliances, if a portion of the items upon which the rebate was based are no longer in stock, a portion of the credit shall be prorated to Account 416, Cost and Expenses of Merchandising, Jobbing, and Contract Work, on the basis of the number of items sold to the quantity remaining in stock.</P>
                <P>If the rebate is in the form of a travel package or travel arrangements, the value of the rebate shall be estimated and recorded as a reduction of the cost of the material or appliances upon which it was based in a manner similar to that of the cash rebates discussed above. The beneficiary of the travel or travel allowance shall be designated by or in accordance with policy established by the board of directors. The contra charge to the reduction in cost shall be to an appropriate account depending upon the relationship of the recipient to the cooperative. For employees, this shall be Account 926, Employee Pensions and Benefits; for directors or patrons, Account 930.2, Miscellaneous General Expenses.</P>

                <P>The CFC Integrity Fund was established to assist borrowers in their attempts to stop takeover bids by investor-owned utilities. A borrower makes a contribution to the Integrity Fund in the form of cash or patronage capital refunds. CFC retains the contribution for a 5-year period during which time the borrower earns interest on the balance in its account. Each year, the borrower receives a statement indicating (both for the total fund and the individual borrower's share) the amount contributed, interest earned, disbursements made, and the ending balance. The disbursements from the fund are allocated to each contributing borrower's account based upon their individual account balances. At the end of the 5-year period, the balance in the account, if any, is refunded to the contributing borrower.</P>
                <P>Since the contributing borrower will receive a refund only if its funds are not totally disbursed, the contribution shall be charged to expense in Account 426.1, Donations. If any part of the contribution is returned at the end of the 5-year period, the refund shall be credited to Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">622 In-Substance Defeasance</HD>

                <P>An in-substance defeasance has been defined as the process whereby a debtor irrevocably places cash or other assets in a trust to be used solely for the purpose of satisfying <PRTPAGE P="187"/>scheduled payments of both principal and interest related to a specific debt obligation. Under the structural arrangements of an in-substance defeasance, the probability that the debtor will be required to make additional future debt payments is remote. In these specific circumstances, debt has been determined to be extinguished even though the debtor has not been legally released from his obligations under the debt instrument.</P>

                <P>The trust established in a defeasance transaction is restricted as to the nature of the assets held. The trust must be funded with monetary assets that are essentially risk free as to the amount, timing, and collection of interest and principal. For debt denominated in United States dollars, “risk free” assets are limited to:
                </P>
                <P>1. Direct obligations of the United States government;</P>
                <P>2. Obligations guaranteed by the United States government; and</P>

                <P>3. Securities that are backed by United States government obligations as collateral under an arrangement by which the interest and principal payments on the collateral, flow immediately through to the holder of the security.
                </P>
                <P>The monetary assets of the trust must provide cash flows sufficient to coincide with the scheduled interest and principal payments on the defeased debt. If the trust is expected to pay the costs associated with the defeasance, such as trustee fees, these costs must be considered in determining the amount of funds required by the trust.</P>
                <P>The principles of in-substance defeasance apply only to debt with specific maturities and fixed payment schedules and, as such, do not apply to debt with variable terms in which advance determination of debt service requirements is not possible.</P>
                <P>Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) address the extinguishment of debt in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 26, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 76, Extinguishment of Debt. In accordance with these two statements, debt which has been defeased remains recorded in the regulated books of account as do the assets placed in the irrevocable trust. They are not, however, recognized as an asset and liability for financial reporting purposes. The transaction, including the total amount of debt outstanding and the total amount of debt that is considered extinguished at the end of the period, must be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements as long as the debt remains outstanding.</P>
                <P>Debt is frequently extinguished before its scheduled maturity. Debt may be extinguished by the use of the borrower's general funds, or by the reacquisition of another debt issue at a different interest rate or varying terms. As these assets are expected to be revenue producing during those years, both the assets and the revenue they generate may be utilized to meet maturing debt payments. Therefore, in most instances, the dollar value of the assets initially placed in the trust do not equal the dollar value of the outstanding principal balance. The difference represents an “economic ” gain or loss to the borrower.</P>
                <P>To provide consistency in reporting among all RUS borrowers, any gain or loss that is recognized for financial statement purposes should be reported in accordance with the provisions of General Instruction No. 17 of this part. Therefore, the gain or loss should be amortized (for reporting purposes) in equal monthly amounts over the remaining life of the original debt issue or the remaining life of the new issue. The gain or loss may be reported in the current period only in those instances in which it is immaterial to the financial statements.</P>
                <P>The RUS Form 7, Financial and Statistical Report, and the RUS Form 12, Operating Report—Financial, must, however, reflect the actual amounts recorded in the books and records of the borrower.</P>

                <P>Many RUS borrowers have decided to redeem (prepay) their issues of long-term debt. As a result of this redemption, the borrower may incur a gain (discount) or a loss (penalty) on the early extinguishment of debt. The accounting for this gain or loss is highlighted in this section.</P>
                <P>If debt is redeemed without refunding (paid with general funds), the gain or loss incurred shall be recorded in Account 189, Unamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt, or Account 257, Unamortized Gain on Reacquired Debt, as appropriate. The borrower shall amortize the recorded deferral on a monthly basis over the remaining life of the old debt issue. Amounts so amortized shall be charged to Account 428.1, Amortization of Loss on Reacquired Debt, or credited to Account 429.1, Amortization of Gain on Reacquired Debt—Credit, as appropriate.</P>

                <P>If the debt is redeemed with refunding (refinanced), the gain or loss incurred shall be recorded in Account 189 or Account 257, as appropriate. The borrower may elect to account for the deferrals as follows:
                </P>
                <P>1. Write them off immediately when the amounts are insignificant;</P>
                <P>2. Amortize them by equal monthly amounts over the remaining life of the old debt issue; or</P>

                <P>3. Amortize them by equal monthly amounts over the life of the new debt issue.
                </P>
                <P>Once an election has been made, it shall be applied on a consistent basis. Regardless of the option selected, the amortization shall be charged to either Account 428.1 or 429.1, as appropriate.</P>

                <P>Where a regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the borrower specifically disallows the rate principle of amortizing gains or losses on the redemption of long-term debt without refunding, and does not apply the gain or loss to interest charges in computing the borrower's rates, the alternative method may be used to account for gains or losses relating to the redemption of long-term debt with or without refunding. The alternative method requires that gains or losses be recorded in Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or Account 426.5, Other Deductions, as incurred. When the alternative method is used, the borrower <PRTPAGE P="189"/>shall include a footnote to the financial statements stating the reason for using this method and its treatment for rate making purposes.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD3">627 Postretirement Benefits</HD>
                <P>Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions (Statement No. 106), requires reporting entities to accrue the expected cost of postretirement benefits during the years the employee provides service to the entity. For purposes of applying the provisions of Statement No. 106, members of the board of directors are considered to be employees of the cooperative. Prior to the issuance of Statement No. 106, most reporting entities accounted for postretirement benefit costs on a “pay-as-you-go” basis; that is, costs were recognized when paid, not when the employee provided service to the entity in exchange for the benefits.</P>
                <P>As defined in Statement No. 106, a postretirement benefit plan is a deferred compensation arrangement in which an employer promises to exchange future benefits for an employee's current services. Postretirement benefit plans may be funded or unfunded. Postretirement benefits include, but are not limited to, health care, life insurance, tuition assistance, day care, legal services, and housing subsidies provided outside of a pension plan.</P>
                <P>This statement applies to both written plans and to plans whose existence is implied from a practice of paying postretirement benefits. An employer's practice of providing postretirement benefits to selected employees under individual contracts with specified terms determined on an employee-by-employee basis does not, however, constitute a postretirement benefit plan under the provisions of this statement.</P>
                <P>Postretirement benefit plans generally fall into three categories: single-employer defined benefit plans, multi-employer plans, and multiple-employer plans.</P>
                <P>The accounting requirements set forth in this interpretation focus on single-and multiple-employer plans. The accounting requirements set forth in Statement No. 106 for multiemployer plans or defined contribution plans shall be adopted for borrowers electing those types of plans.</P>
                <P>Under the provisions of Statement No. 106, there are two components of the postretirement benefit cost: the current period cost and the transition obligation. The transition obligation is a one-time accrual of the costs resulting from services already provided. Statement No. 106 allows the transition obligation to be deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the active employees. If the average remaining service life of the employees is less than 20 years, a 20-year amortization period may be used.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Accounting Requirements</HD>
                <P>All RUS borrowers must adopt the accrual accounting provisions and reporting requirements set forth in Statement No. 106. The transition obligation and accrual of the current period cost must be based upon an actuarial study. This study must be updated to allow the borrower to comply with the measurement date requirements of Statement No. 106; however, the study must, at a minimum, be updated every five years. RUS will not allow electric borrowers to account for postretirement benefits on a “pay-as-you-go” basis.</P>

                <P>The deferral and amortization of the transition obligation does not require RUS approval provided that it complies with the provisions of Statement No. 106. If, however, a borrower elects to expense the transition obligation in the current period and subsequently defer this expense in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects <PRTPAGE P="191"/>of Certain Types of Regulation, the deferral must be approved by RUS. In those states in which the commission will not allow the recovery of the transition obligation through future rates, the transition obligation must be expensed, in its entirety, in the year in which Statement No. 106 is adopted. A portion of the transition obligation may be charged to construction and retirement activities provided such charges are properly supported.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Effective Date and Implementation</HD>
                <P>For plans outside the United States and for defined benefit plans of employers that (a) are nonpublic enterprises and (b) sponsor defined benefit postretirement plans with no more than 500 plan participants in the aggregate, Statement No. 106 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994. For all other plans, Statement No. 106 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1992.</P>
                <P>RUS borrowers must comply with the implementation dates set forth in Statement No. 106. At the time of the adoption of Statement No. 106, rates must be in place sufficient to recover the current period expense and any amortization of the transition obligation. A copy of a board resolution or commission order, as appropriate, indicating that the transition obligation and current period expense have been included in the borrower's rates must be submitted to RUS.</P>

If, therefore, the borrower elects to defer and amortize the transition obligation on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the active employees or 20 years in accordance with Statement No. 106, no entry is required. Instead, the transition obligation is recognized as a component of postretirement benefit cost as it is amortized.

Benefits may be provided in cash or in kind and may be paid upon cessation of active employment or over a specified period of time.</P>
                <P>The cost of providing postemployment benefits is considered to be a part of the compensation provided to an employee in exchange for current service and should, therefore, be accrued as the employee earns the right to be paid for future postemployment benefits. Applying the criteria set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 43, Accounting for Compensated Absences, a postemployment benefit obligation is accrued when all of the following conditions are met:</P>
                <P>1. The employer's obligation for payment for future absences is attributable to employees' services already performed;</P>
                <P>2. The obligation relates to employee rights that vest or accumulate. Vested rights are considered those rights for which the employer is obligated to make payment even if the employee terminates. Rights that accumulate are those earned, but unused rights to compensated absences that may be carried forward to one or more periods subsequent to the period in which they are earned;</P>
                <P>3. Payment of the compensation is probable; and</P>
                <P>4. The amount can be reasonably estimated.</P>
                <P>If all of these conditions are not met, the employer must account for its postemployment benefit obligation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (Statement No. 5) when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of that liability can be reasonably estimated.</P>
                <P>If an obligation for postemployment benefits is not accrued in accordance with the provisions of Statement No. 5 or Statement No. 43 only because the amount cannot be reasonably estimated, the financial statements should disclose that fact.</P>

                <P>Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities (Statement No. 115), establishes the standards of financial accounting and reporting for investments in debt securities and for investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values. Statement No. 115 does not apply to investments in equity securities accounted for under the equity method nor to investments in consolidated subsidiaries.</P>
                <P>At the time of acquisition, an entity must classify debt and equity securities into one of three categories: held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading. At the balance sheet date, the appropriateness of the classifications must be reassessed.</P>
                <P>Investments in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity and are measured at amortized cost in the balance sheet only if the reporting entity has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. Debt securities are not classified as held-to-maturity if the entity has the intent to hold the security only for an indefinite period; for example, if the security would become available for sale in response to changes in market interest rates and related changes in the security's prepayment risk, needs for liquidity, changes in the availability of and the yield on alternative investments, changes in funding sources and terms, and changes in foreign currency risk.</P>
                <P>Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity and equity securities that have readily determinable fair values are classified as either trading securities or available-for-sale securities and are measured at fair value in the balance sheet. Trading securities are those securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near future. Trading generally reflects active and frequent buying and selling and trading securities are generally used with the objective of generating profits on short-term differences in prices. Available-for-sale securities are those investments not classified as either trading securities or held-to-maturity securities.</P>
                <P>Statement No. 115 requires unrealized holding gains and losses for trading securities to be included in earnings in the current period. Unrealized holding gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings; however, they are reported as a net amount in a separate component of shareholders' equity until realized.</P>
                <P>For individual securities classified as either available-for sale or held-to-maturity, an entity must determine whether a decline in the security's fair value below the amortized cost is other than temporary. If the decline in fair value is determined to be permanent, that is, it is probable that the entity will not be able to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the security, the realized loss is accounted for in earnings of the current period. The new cost basis is not adjusted upward for subsequent recoveries in the fair value. Subsequent increases in the fair value of available-for-sale securities are included in the separate component of equity. Subsequent decreases are also included in the separate component of equity.</P>
                <P>All trading securities are reported as current assets in the balance sheet and individual held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities are classified as either current or noncurrent, as appropriate. Cash flows from the purchase, sale, or maturity of available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities are classified in the statement of cash flows as cash flows from investing activities and reported gross for each security classification.</P>

Unrealized holding gains or losses for available-for-sale securities held by the corporate entity are recognized as a component of stockholder's equity in Account 215.1, Unrealized Gains and Losses—Debt and Equity Securities. A contra account of the investment account shall be debited or credited accordingly. Unrealized gains and losses for <PRTPAGE P="194"/>available-for-sale securities held in a decommissioning fund shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, the reported value of the fund.</P>

                <P>The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association Split Dollar Life Insurance provides life insurance benefits to cooperative employees. The benefits provided under this policy consist of two components, the face value of the insurance policy and the accumulated cash surrender value. While the employee is the owner of the policy, the employee must sign a collateral assignment giving the cooperative absolute right to the cash surrender value of the policy. Under the terms of this collateral assignment, the employee must reimburse the cooperative for the premiums paid upon the employee's termination of employment or attainment of the age of 62 if the employee wishes to maintain the insurance coverage. If death occurs prior to either of these events, the premiums paid to date by the cooperative are deducted from the death benefits payable to the policy beneficiary.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Accounting Requirements</HD>
                <P>Financial Accounting Standards Board Technical Bulletin 85-4, Accounting for Purchase of Life Insurance (Bulletin 85-4), states that the amount that could be realized under an insurance contract as of the date of the financial statements should be reported as an asset. The change in the cash surrender or contract value of that asset during the period should be reported as an adjustment to the premiums paid in determining the expense or income to be recognized for the period. The cooperative shall, therefore, record the cash surrender value of the policy as an asset because of its absolute right to receive that value based upon the employee's collateral assignment. Any receivable that may occur as a result of the employee reimbursement for the premiums paid is contingent upon the employee electing to maintain the insurance coverage after termination of employment or reaching the age of 62 and is not recorded as an asset on the cooperative's records.</P>

                <P>The Special Early Retirement Plan (SERP) being offered through the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) constitutes an amendment to its Retirement and Security (R&amp;S) program. The SERP is often chosen as a vehicle through which the cooperative may reduce the size of its workforce or replace more highly paid employees with lower paid entry level employees. If an employee covered by an NRECA retirement plan chose to retire before his/her normal retirement date, that employee would receive an actuarially reduced benefit. However, when a cooperative elects to offer a SERP, no such reduction is required. The cooperative selects the criteria under which an employee will be eligible to participate such as age, years of service, or a combination of age and benefit service requirements. As with other amendments to the R&amp;S program, NRECA calculates the cost of the plan based upon the criteria selected by the cooperative and allows the cooperative to pay the cost immediately or on an installment basis.</P>

                <P>Under this plan, the employee receives full retirement benefits in the form of either an immediate lump-sum settlement or annuity payments. It is not unusual for the cooperative to add an incentive to encourage participation such as medical or life insurance, either in whole or in part, until age 65. The actuarial analysis provided by NRECA includes the cost of the SERP and the estimated reduction and/or increase in costs associated with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employer's Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (Statement No. 106).<PRTPAGE P="195"/>

                <P>At adoption, Statement No. 106 permitted the recognition of the transition obligation in one of two ways. The transition obligation was recognized over the longer of the average remaining service period of current plan participants or 20 years, or it may have been recognized immediately. If the delayed recognition option was chosen under Statement No. 106, this, too, was an off-balance sheet item that requires only a memorandum entry to reduce the amount of unrecognized transition obligation. However, if the immediate recognition option was chosen, the cooperative either recorded the expense in that year or, with RUS approval, deferred the expense under the provisions of Statement No. 71. If the expense were recorded, in total, in the year of adoption, no unrecognized transition obligation remains to reduce. If, however, the transition obligation was deferred in accordance with Statement No. 71, the journal entry required to effect the reduction in Statement No. 106 expense is as follows:

                <P>On December 21, 1987, Section 313, Cushion of Credits Payments Program, was added to the Rural Electrification Act. Cushion of <PRTPAGE P="196"/>credit regulations are located in The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 7 CFR part 1785. A cushion of credit payment is a voluntary unscheduled payment by a borrower in excess of amounts due and payable. A cushion of credit account is automatically established by Rural Development for each borrower who makes a payment after October 1, 1987, in excess of amounts then due on a Rural Development note. Payments received in the month in which an installment is due will be applied to the installment due. However, if the regular installment payment is received at a later date in the month, the first payment received will be applied retroactively to the cushion of credit account and the second will be applied to the installment due. By law, cushion of credit accounts earn five per cent interest annually, accrued daily and posted quarterly. Although the interest earned will appear as a reduction in the interest billed on the borrower's Rural Development notes and will be separately shown on Form 694, Statement of Interest and Principal Due, interest billed must be adjusted by adding back the interest earned while principal is reduced by the amount of the interest earned before recording the debt payment. Below is an example of the adjustment required:</P>

                  <TNOTE>* Includes reduction of $50 for interest earned on cushion of credit account.</TNOTE>
                </GPOTABLE>
                <P>Cushion of credit is intended to enable the borrower to deposit funds and have those funds available to make scheduled payments (or installments) only. A borrower may not have more cushion of credit funds, including accrued interest, than their entire Rural Development debt which includes loans made in Rural Electric and Telephone (RET) and Federal Financing Bank (FFB). If a borrower makes less than or no payment when their billing invoice is due, cushion of credit will automatically add to or make their payment systematically for them.</P>
                <P>Cushion of credit is not available to use for prepayment of loan accounts before maturity except for the following situations:</P>
                <P>1. The total amount of cushion of credit principal with accrued interest equals the borrower's total debt</P>
                <P>2. The borrower intends to prepay all remaining debt using a combination of payment with all cushion of credit funds available.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Accounting Requirements</HD>
                <P>All payments made to a cushion of credit account should be recorded as follows:</P>

                <FP SOURCE="FP-2"> Cr. 131.1, Cash—General</FP>
                <P>All interest earned on the balance of funds in the account should be recorded as follows:</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Reporting Requirements</HD>
                <P>Previously, Rural Development required that the balance in the cushion of credit account be reported, on the Form 7, Financial and Statistical Report, as a reduction of the Rural Development long-term debt balance. On January 15, 2003, Rural Development issued letter guidance permitting a proportionate share of the cushion of credit balance be reported as a reduction in Current Maturities Long-Term Debt. Additionally, beginning with calendar year 2006 submissions, Form 7 has been revised to include a separate line for cushion of credit balances within the long-term debt section of Part C.</P>
                <P>For purposes of the audited financial statements, presentation of the balance of the cushion of credit account as a long-term investment is an acceptable alternative to Rural Development.</P>

              <P>The media used to capture and store the data will play an important part of each Rural Development borrower. Each borrower has the flexibility to select its own storage media. The following are required:</P>
              <P>(a) The storage media shall have a life expectancy at least equal to the applicable retention period provided for in the master index of records, unless there is a quality transfer from one media to another with no loss of data. Each transfer of data from one media to another shall be verified for accuracy and documented.</P>
              <P>(b) Each borrower shall implement internal control procedures that assure the reliability of, and ready access to, data stored on machine-readable media. The borrower's internal control procedures shall be documented by a responsible supervisory official.</P>
              <P>(c) Records shall be indexed and retained in such a manner that they are easily accessible.</P>
              <P>(d) The borrower shall have the hardware and software available to locate, identify, and reproduce the records in readable form without loss of clarity.</P>
              <P>(e) At the expiration of the retention period, the borrower may use any appropriate method to destroy records.</P>
              <P>(f) When any records are lost or destroyed before the expiration of the retention period set forth in the master index, a certified statement shall be added to the master index listing, as far as may be determined, the records lost or destroyed and describing the circumstances of the premature loss or destruction.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Periods of retention.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Records of Rural Development borrowers of a kind not listed in the FERC regulations should be governed by those applicable to the closest similar records. Financial requirement and expenditure statements, which are not specifically covered by FERC regulations, are recommended to be kept for one year after the “as of date” of Rural Development's loan fund and accounting review.</P>
              <P>(b) Consumer accounts' records should be kept for those years for which patronage capital has not been allocated.</P>
              <P>(c) Records supporting construction financed by Rural Development shall be retained until audited and approved by Rural Development.</P>

              <P>(d) Records related to plant in service must be retained until the facilities are permanently removed from utility service, all removal and restoration activities are completed, and all costs are <PRTPAGE P="198"/>retired from the accounting records unless accounting adjustments resulting from reclassification and original costs studies have been approved by Rural Development or other regulatory body having jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(e) Life and mortality study data for depreciation purposes must be retained for 25 years or for 10 years after plant is retired, whichever is longer.</P>

There shall also be transfers to Construction or other Plant Specific Operations Expense accounts, as appropriate, from Account 6512, Provisioning Expense. With respect to these expenses, companies may establish such clearing accounts as they deem necessary to accomplish substantially the same results, provided that within thirty (30) days of the opening of such accounts, companies shall notify the FCC of the nature and purpose thereof. Additional clearing accounts affecting other expense areas may be established with prior approval of the FCC. Should companies elect, the initial incurred subsidiary record category identification may be carried through to the final accounts without FCC approval.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">101 Postretirement Benefits</HD>
              <P>A. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions (Statement No. 106), requires reporting entities to accrue the expected cost of postretirement benefits during the years the employee provides service to the entity. For purposes of applying the provisions of Statement No. 106, members of the board of directors are considered to be employees of the cooperative. Prior to the issuance of Statement No. 106, most reporting entities accounted for postretirement benefit costs on a “pay-as-you-go” basis; that is, costs were recognized when paid, not when the employee provided service to the entity in exchange for the benefits. (Statement 106 is available from the Financial Accounting Standards Board, 401 Merritt 7, P.O. Box 5116, Norwalk, CT. 06856-5116.)</P>

              <P>B. As defined in Statement No. 106, a postretirement benefit plan is a deferred compensation arrangement in which an employer promises to exchange future benefits for an employee's current services. Postretirement benefit plans may be funded or unfunded. Postretirement benefits include, but are not limited to, health care, life insurance, tuition assistance, day care, legal services, and housing subsidies provided outside of a pension plan.<PRTPAGE P="217"/>
              </P>
              <P>C. Statement No. 106 applies to both written plans and to plans whose existence is implied from a practice of paying postretirement benefits. An employer's practice of providing postretirement benefits to selected employees under individual contracts with specific terms determined on an employee-by-employee basis does not, however, constitute a postretirement benefit plan under the provisions of this statement.</P>
              <P>D. Postretirement benefit plans generally fall into three categories: single-employer defined benefit plans, multiemployer plans, and multiple-employer plans.</P>
              <P>E. A single-employer plan is a postretirement benefit plan that is maintained by one employer. The term may also be applied to a plan that is maintained by related parties such as a parent and its subsidiaries. A multiemployer plan is a postretirement benefit plan in which two or more unrelated employers contribute, usually pursuant to one or more collective-bargaining agreements. One characteristic of a multiemployer plan is that the assets contributed by one participating employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers since assets contributed by an employer are not segregated in a separate account or restricted to provide benefits only to employees of that employer.</P>
              <P>F. A multiple-employer plan is a postretirement benefit plan that is maintained by more than one employer but is not a multiemployer plan. A multiple-employer plan is generally not collectively bargained and is intended to allow participating employers to pool their plan assets for investment purposes and reduce the cost of plan administration. A multiple-employer plan maintains separate accounts for each employer so that contributions provide benefits only for employees of the contributing employer.</P>
              <P>G. The accounting requirements set forth in this interpretation focus on single- and multiple-employer plans. The accounting requirements set forth in Statement No. 106 for multiemployer plans or defined contribution plans shall be adopted for borrowers electing those types of plans.</P>
              <P>H. Under the provisions of Statement No. 106, there are two components of the postretirement benefit cost: the current period cost and the transition obligation. The transition obligation is a one-time accrual of the costs resulting from services already provided. Statement No. 106 allows the transition obligation to be deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the active employees. If the average remaining service period of the active employees is less than 20 years, a 20-year amortization period may be used.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. Accounting Requirements</HD>
              <P>A. All borrowers shall adopt the accrual accounting provisions and reporting requirements as set forth in Statement No. 106. The transition obligation and accrual of the current period cost must be based upon an actuarial study. This study must be updated to allow the borrower to comply with the measurement date requirements of Statement No. 106; however, the study must, at a minimum, be updated every five years. Borrowers may not account for postretirement benefits on a “pay-as-you-go” basis.</P>
              <P>B. Under the provisions of Statement No. 106, an entity may recognize the transition obligation, in its entirety, when Statement No. 106 is first adopted or the entity may elect to delay the recognition of the transition obligation. On December 26, 1991, however, the FCC issued 6 FCC Rcd 7560, which requires telecommunications carriers to recognize the transition obligation on a delayed basis. RUS reviewed this issuance and has determined that borrowers must comply with this ruling and recognize the transition obligation on a delayed basis.</P>
              <P>C. The deferral and amortization of the transition obligation on a delayed basis is considered to be an off balance sheet item. As a result, an accounting entry is not required at the time of adoption of Statement No. 106. Instead, the transition obligation is recognized as a component of postretirement benefit cost as it is amortized. The amount of the unamortized transition obligation must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.</P>
              <P>D. In accordance with the provisions of Responsible Accounting Officer (RAO) Letter 20, released by the FCC on April 24, 1992, Account 4310, Other Long-Term Liabilities, shall be used to record the liability accrued for postretirement benefits.

Borrowers shall credit this account for the net periodic cost of postretirement benefits for the current year and shall debit this account for any fund payments made during the current year.</P>
              <P>E. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost includes current period service cost, interest cost, return on plan assets, amortization of prior service cost, gains and losses, and amortization of the transition obligation. If fund payments create a debit balance in the postretirement benefits portion of Account 4310, the debit balance applicable to postretirement benefits shall be reported in Account 1410, Other Noncurrent Assets. Account 1410 shall also be used to record any prepaid postretirement benefit cost.</P>

              <P>F. The benefits portion of the expense matrix for the appropriate Part 32 expense accounts shall be used to record the current period service cost component of the current year's net periodic postretirement benefit cost. The interest cost component, return on plan assets, amortization of prior service cost, gains and losses, and amortization of <PRTPAGE P="218"/>the transition obligation shall be charged to the benefits portion of the expense matrix of Account 6728, Other General and Administrative.</P>

              <P>A. Many RUS borrowers have become involved in providing either satellite or cable television services to their members and others through subsidiaries, joint ventures, or as segments of their current operations.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Accounting Requirements</HD>

              <P>A. This section outlines the accounting to be followed when recording transactions involving satellite or cable television services.<PRTPAGE P="220"/>
              </P>
              <P>1. Separate Subsidiary. If a borrower provides satellite or cable television services through a separate subsidiary, the investment in the subsidiary shall be debited to Account 1401, Investments in Affiliated Companies. The net income or loss of the subsidiary shall be debited or credited to Account 1401, as appropriate, with an offsetting entry to Account 7360, Other Nonoperating Income.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Joint Venture.</E> i. If a borrower provides satellite or cable television services through a joint venture, the borrower's ownership interest dictates the accounting methodology. If the borrower has less than a 20 percent ownership interest in the joint venture, the investment is accounted for under the cost method of accounting in Account 1402, Investments in Nonaffiliated Companies. Under the cost method, the joint venture's net income or loss is not recorded in the borrower's records. Income is recognized only to the extent of any dividends declared by the joint venture. When a dividend is declared, the borrower shall debit Account 1210, Interest and Dividends Receivable, and credit Account 7310, Dividend Income. When the dividend is received in cash, the borrower shall debit Account 1130.1, Cash—General Fund, and credit Account 1210.</P>
              <P>ii. If a borrower has a 20-percent or more ownership interest in the joint venture, the investment is accounted for under the equity method in Account 1401, Investments in Affiliated Companies. The borrower's proportionate share of the joint venture's net income or loss shall be debited or credited to Account 1401, as appropriate, with an offsetting entry to Account 7360, Other Nonoperating Income.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Segment of Current Operations.</E> i. If a borrower provides satellite or cable television service as a segment of its current operations and there are no shared assets between this activity and the regulated telecommunications activities of the borrower, the investment shall be debited to Account 1406.1, Nonregulated Investments—Permanent Investment. The net income or loss from providing such service shall be debited or credited, as appropriate, to Account 1406.3, Nonregulated Investments—Current Net Income, with an offsetting entry to Account 7990, Nonregulated Net Income.</P>
              <P>ii. If a borrower provides satellite or cable television service as a segment of current operations and shares assets between this activity and the regulated telecommunications activities of the borrower, the franchise and application fees shall be debited to a subaccount of Account 2690, Intangibles. The cost of the satellite or cable television equipment shall be debited to a subaccount of Account 2231, Radio Systems. Revenues earned from providing satellite or cable service shall be credited to Account 5280, Nonregulated Operating Revenue, while the associated expenses shall be recorded in a subaccount of the applicable regulated expense accounts.</P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">Sale and Installation of Satellite or Cable Television Equipment.</E> i. If a borrower sells or installs satellite or cable television equipment as a segment of its current operations and there are no shared assets between this activity and the regulated telecommunications activities of the borrower, the purchase of the equipment shall be debited to Account 1406.1, Nonregulated Investments—Permanent Investment. The net income or loss from providing such services shall be debited or credited, as appropriate, to Account 1406.3, Nonregulated Investments—Current Net Income, with an offsetting entry to Account 7990, Nonregulated Net Income.</P>
              <P>ii. If a borrower sells or installs satellite or cable television equipment as a segment of its current operations and shares assets between this activity and the regulated telecommunications activities of the borrower, the purchase of the equipment shall be debited to Account 1220.2, Property Held for Sale or Lease. Revenues received for the sale or installation of the equipment shall be credited to Account 5280, Nonregulated Operating Revenue, while the associated expenses shall be debited to a subaccount of the applicable regulated expense accounts.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">106 Consolidated Financial Statements</HD>
              <P>A. In October 1987, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 94, Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries (Statement No. 94). (Statement 94 is available from the Financial Accounting Standards Board, 401 Merritt 7, P.O. Box 5116, Norwalk, CT 06856-5116.) For purposes of reporting to RUS, Statement No. 94 shall be applied as follows:</P>
              <P>1. A borrower that is a subsidiary of another entity shall prepare and submit to RUS separate financial statements even though this financial information is presented in the parent's consolidated statements.</P>
              <P>2. In those cases in which a borrower has a majority-ownership in a subsidiary, the borrower shall prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with the requirements of Statement No. 94. These consolidated statements must also include supplementary schedules presenting a Balance Sheet and Income Statement for each majority-owned subsidiary included in the consolidated statements.</P>

              <P>B. Although Statement No. 94 requires the consolidation of majority-owned subsidiaries, the RUS Form 479, Financial and Statistical Report for Telecommunications Borrowers, shall be prepared on an unconsolidated basis by all borrowers.<PRTPAGE P="221"/>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">107 Allowance for Funds Used During Construction</HD>
              <P>A. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 34, Capitalization of Interest Cost, established the standards for capitalizing interest cost as a part of the historical cost of acquiring certain assets. In order to capitalize interest, the asset must require a period of time to complete or to get it ready for its intended use. This standard applies to all entities that construct facilities for their own use and should be applied by RUS Telecommunications borrowers as follows:</P>
              <P>1. Only actual interest costs incurred on external borrowings qualify to be capitalized. The interest rate used to calculate the amount of interest to be capitalized is based on the companies external borrowings. If a construction project is associated with specific debt, the interest rate on that debt is used to calculate interest cost to be capitalized. If the project is not associated with a specific debt, a weighted average of the rates of all existing debt shall be applied to expenditures for the project. There is no materiality threshold for adoption of this standard (47 CFR 32.26).</P>
              <P>2. If a borrower is involved in a joint construction project, all determinations as to the amount of interest incurred and qualified for capitalization must be based on individual financing arrangements with regard to the Interest During Construction rules.</P>
              <P>3. The capitalization period shall end when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Disclosures</HD>
              <P>A. The following information with respect to interest cost shall be disclosed in the financial statements or related notes:</P>
              <P>1. For an accounting period in which no interest cost is capitalized, the amount of interest cost incurred and charged to expense during the period.</P>
              <P>2. For an accounting period in which some interest cost is capitalized, the total amount of interest cost incurred during the period and the amount thereof that has been capitalized.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">108 Reporting Comprehensive Income</HD>

              <P>A. In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. This statement requires that all items that meet the definition of the components of comprehensive income be reported in the financial statements for the period in which they are recognized. Statement 130 establishes a distinction between <E T="03">comprehensive income</E> and <E T="03">other comprehensive income.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Comprehensive income</E> is composed of net income and <E T="03">other comprehensive income.</E> The net income is the result of operations resulting from the aggregation of revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are not items that comprise other comprehensive income.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Other comprehensive income</E> is composed of the following:</P>
              <P>(a) Foreign currency items,</P>
              <P>(b) Minimum pension liability adjustments, and</P>
              <P>(c) Unrealized gains and losses on certain investments in debt and equity securities. Gains or losses on investment securities included in the net income of the current period that also had been included in other comprehensive income as unrealized holding gains or losses in a prior period must be adjusted (called reclassification adjustments) in the presentation of other comprehensive income in the current period.</P>
              <P>B. <E T="03">Comprehensive income</E> expressed as a formula would be:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Net Income ±items of <E T="03">other comprehensive income</E> = <E T="03">comprehensive income</E>
              </FP>
              
              <P>While Statement 130 requires that comprehensive income should be divided into two broad display classifications, net income and other comprehensive income, it does not prescribe a specific format for displaying comprehensive income in the financial statements.</P>

              <P>C. RUS Telecommunications borrowers that present a single Statement of Operations and Patronage Capital should present the components of <E T="03">other comprehensive income</E> below the total for net income and then present the reconciliation of patronage capital (Retained Earnings). Borrowers that present a separate Statement of Patronage Capital (or Retained Earnings) should display the beginning balance of patronage capital (or retained earnings), net income for the period, other items of comprehensive income and total comprehensive income before the presentation of other items of patronage capital (or retained earnings) for the period.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Nonpublic Entities</HD>
              <P>A. RUS commercial and cooperative type borrowers that meet the definition of a nonpublic entity, as previously defined, may elect to meet the following reduced disclosure requirements:</P>

              <P>11. If applicable, the amounts and types of securities of the employer and related parties included in plan assets, the approximate amount of future annual benefits of plan participants covered by insurance contracts issued by the employer or related parties, and any significant transactions between the employer or related parties and the plan during the period.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Multiemployer Plans</HD>
              <P>A. An RUS Telecommunications borrower shall disclose the amount of contributions to multiemployer plans during the period. The borrower may disclose total contributions to multiemployer plans without disaggregating the amounts attributable to pensions and other postretirement benefits. The disclosures shall include a description of the nature and effect of any changes affecting comparability, such as a change in the rate of employer contributions, a business combination, or a divestiture.</P>
              <P>B. In some cases, withdrawal from a multiemployer plan results in an obligation to the plan for a portion of the plan's unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. If it is either probable or reasonably possible that (a) an employer would withdraw from the plan under circumstances that would give rise to an obligation or (b) an employer's contribution to the fund would be increased during the remainder of the contract period to make up a shortfall in the funds necessary to maintain the negotiated level of benefit coverage, the employer shall apply the provisions of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) This part implements the standards for audits required by the loan and grant agreements of Rural Utilities Service (RUS) electric and telecommunications borrowers and grantees. The provisions require auditees to prepare and furnish to RUS, at least once during each 12-month period, a full and complete report of its financial condition, operations, and cash flows, in form and substance satisfactory to RUS, audited and certified by an independent auditor, satisfactory to RUS, and accompanied by a report of such <PRTPAGE P="225"/>audit, in form and substance satisfactory to RUS.</P>
              <P>(b) This part is based on the requirements of GAGAS in effect at the time of the audit and applicable RUS regulations and subpart F (Audit Requirements) of 2 CFR part 200 (Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards) (2 CFR 200.500-200.521).</P>
              <P>(c) This part further sets forth the criteria for selecting auditors satisfactory to RUS and certain audit procedures and audit documentation that must be performed and prepared before an audit report will be accepted by RUS.</P>
              <P>(d) Failure to provide an audit in compliance with this part is a serious violation of the RUS Security Agreement. RUS relies on audited financial statements in order to assess and monitor the financial condition of its borrowers and grantees and to fulfill its fiduciary responsibilities.</P>
              <P>(e) RUS reserves the right to suspend its acceptance of audits performed by auditors who, in the opinion of RUS, are not meeting the requirements of this part or with unresolved disputes or issues until such time that the matter can be resolved to RUS' satisfaction.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Annual audit.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each auditee must have its financial statements audited annually by an auditor selected by the auditee and approved by RUS as set forth in § 1773.4. All auditees must submit audited financial statements on a comparative basis covering two consecutive 12 month periods, unless the entity has not been in existence for two consecutive 12-month audit periods. Consolidated statements of the parent are not an acceptable replacement for an audit of the auditee.</P>

              <P>(b) Each auditee must establish an annual audit date within 12 months of the date of the first advance and must prepare annual financial statements for the audit date established. Each auditee must notify the AA-PARA of <PRTPAGE P="227"/>the audit date at least 90 days prior to the selected audit date.</P>
              <P>(c) Auditees must furnish a reporting package to RUS within 120 days of the audit date. (See § 1773.21). Until all loans made or guaranteed by RUS are repaid and unliquidated obligations rescinded, auditees that are borrowers must continue to provide annual audited financial statements. Auditees that are grantees must furnish annual audited financial statements in the year of the first advance and until all funds have been advanced or rescinded, and all financial compliance requirements have been fully satisfied.</P>
              <P>(d) In addition to the requirements of this part, certain auditees may be subject to the Single Audit Act. An auditee that is defined as a Non-Federal Entity as defined in 2 CFR 200.69 means a state, local government, Indian tribe, institution of higher education (IHE), or nonprofit organization that carries out a Federal award as a recipient or subrecipient and is required to meet the requirements of this part as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Borrowers and/or grantees expending the threshold established for the Single Audit Act (currently $750,000) or more in Federal awards during the year must have an audit performed in accordance with the Single Audit Act. See 2 CFR 200.502, Basis For Determining Federal Awards Expended, for guidance in determining annual expenditures. The audited financial statements must be submitted to RUS and to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.</P>
              <P>(2) For auditees expending less than the threshold for expenditure in Federal awards during the year, RUS reserves its right under 2 CFR 200.503, Relationship to other audit requirements, to arrange for an audit performed in accordance with this part.</P>
              <P>(3) Within 30 days of the audit date, auditees must notify the AA-PARA, in writing, of the total Federal awards expended during the year and must state whether the audit will be performed in accordance with the Single Audit Act, or this part.</P>
              <P>(i) An auditee electing to comply with this part must select an auditor that meets the qualifications set forth in § 1773.5.</P>
              <P>(ii) If an audit is performed in accordance with the Single Audit Act, the auditor's reporting on the financial statements that meet the requirements of the Single Audit Act, will be sufficient to satisfy the auditee's obligations under this part.</P>

              <P>(e) Subpart F of 2 CFR part 200 does not apply to audits of RUS electric and telecommunications cooperatives and for-profit telecommunications borrowers unless the borrower has contractually agreed with another Federal agency (<E T="03">e.g.</E> Federal Emergency Management Agency) to provide a financial audit performed in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart F. In no circumstance will an auditee be required to submit separate audits performed in accordance with this part and 2 CFR part 200, subpart F.</P>

              <P>(2) The auditor's experience in performing audits of utilities, related industries, or in the case of grantees, experience in auditing entities comparable to the grantee; and</P>
              <P>(3) The auditor's ability to complete the audit and submit the reporting package within 90 days of the audit date.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Board approval of selection.</E> The board's approval of an auditor must be recorded by a board resolution that states:</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Notification of selection.</E> When the initial selection or subsequent change of an auditor has been made, the auditee must notify the AA-PARA, in writing, at least 90 days prior to the audit date.</P>

              <P>(1) Within 30 days of the date of receipt of such notice, RUS will notify <PRTPAGE P="228"/>the auditee, in writing, if the selection or change in auditor is not satisfactory.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Audit engagement letter.</E> The auditee must enter into an audit agreement with the auditor that complies with § 1773.6 prior to the initiation of the audit.</P>

The detailed schedule of investments can be included in the notes to the financial statements or as a separate schedule as long as all information required is adequately disclosed. Samples of these schedules can be found in Appendices A-D, of RUS Bulletin 1773-1.</P>
              <P>(1) The schedule of deferred debits and deferred credits must include a description of the deferral and a notation as to whether the deferral has received written approval from RUS. If a determination is made that prior written approval is not required, cite the specific authority for the deferral.</P>

For all investments, the auditee must list the name of the entity, ownership percentage, and the principal business in which the entity is engaged. For investments recorded on the cost basis, the auditee must include the original investment, advances, dividends declared or paid in the current and prior years and the net investment. For investments recorded on the equity or consolidated basis, the auditee must include the ownership percentage, original investment, advances, dividends declared or paid in the current and prior years, and current and prior years' earnings and losses, including accumulated losses in excess of the original investment.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Scope limitations.</E> The auditee will not limit the scope of the audit to the extent that the auditor is unable to provide an unqualified opinion that the financial statements are presented fairly in conformity with GAAP due to the scope limitation.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Submission of reporting package.</E> The auditee must submit to RUS the required reporting package as set forth in § 1773.21.</P>
              <P>(1) A reporting package that fails to meet the requirements detailed in this part will be returned to the auditee with a written explanation of noncompliance.</P>
              <P>(2) The auditee must, within 30 days of the date of the letter or email detailing the noncompliance, submit a corrected reporting package to RUS.</P>
              <P>(3) If a corrected reporting package is not received within 30 days of the date of the letter or email detailing the noncompliance, RUS will take appropriate action, depending on the severity of the noncompliance.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Submission of a plan of corrective action.</E> If the auditor's report contains findings and recommendations but does not include the auditee's response, the auditee must submit written responses to RUS within 180 days of the audit date.

              <SUBJECT>Auditor communication.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) GAGAS and AICPA standards require that the auditor communicate with the auditee the auditor's understanding of the services to be performed and document that understanding through a written communication to those charged with governance.

This report must include the manual or printed signature of the auditor and must include the following items as appropriate:</P>
              <P>(1) Significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control;</P>

              <P>Grant funds may not be used to:</P>
              <P>(a) Duplicate current services or replace or substitute support normally provided by other means, such as those performed by an association's consultant in developing a project, including feasibility, design, and cost estimates.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(1) The Forest Service helps rural communities that are dependent upon national forest resources diversify existing industries and economies.

The Forest Service provides assistance to implement the action plans through grants, loans, cooperative agreements, or contracts.</P>
              <P>(2) To avoid duplicate assistance, applicants must contact the Forest Service to find out if any geographical areas or local areas in a State have received grants for technical assistance to an economically disadvantaged community. These areas are defined as national forest-dependent communities under 7 U.S.C. 6612.

              <P>(k) Any cash in the revolving loan fund from any source that is not needed for debt service, approved administrative costs, or reasonable reserves must be available for additional loans to loan recipients.</P>
              <P>(l) All reserves and other cash in the revolving loan fund not immediately needed for loans to loan recipients or other authorized uses must be deposited in accounts in banks or other financial institutions. Such accounts must be fully covered by Federal deposit insurance or fully collateralized with U.S. Government obligations, and must be interest bearing. Any interest earned thereon remains a part of the revolving loan fund.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Objective.</SUBJECT>

            <P>The objective of the ECWAG Program is to assist the residents of rural areas that have experienced a significant decline in quantity or quality of water, or in which such a decline is considered imminent, to obtain or maintain adequate quantities of water that meets the standards set by the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f <E T="03">et seq.</E>) (SDWA).</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1778.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Acute shortage.</E> An acute shortage is a situation in which the system either cannot deliver water at all through its distribution system or can only deliver water on a sporadic basis.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Emergency.</E> Occurrence of an incident such as, but not limited to, a drought; earthquake; flood; tornado; hurricane; disease outbreak; or chemical spill, leakage, or seepage.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Rural areas.</E> Includes any area not in a city or town with a population in excess of 10,000 inhabitants located in any of the fifty States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Western Pacific Territories, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of Palau, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The population figure is obtained from the most recent decennial Census of the United States (decennial Census). If the applicable population figure cannot be obtained from the most recent decennial Census, RD will determine the applicable population figure based on available population data.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Significant decline in quality.</E> A significant decline in quality of potable water occurs when the present community source or delivery system does not meet, as a result of an emergency, the current SDWA requirements. For a private source or delivery system a significant decline in quality occurs when the water is no longer potable as a result of an emergency. As used in this Subpart, the term significant decline in quality may also include a situation where a significant decline is likely to occur within one year from the date of the filing of an application.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Significant decline in quantity.</E> A significant decline in the quantity is caused by a disruption of the potable <PRTPAGE P="263"/>water supply by an emergency. The disruption in quantity of water prevents the present source or delivery system from supplying potable water needs to rural residents. This would not include a decline in excess water capacity. As used in this Subpart, the term significant decline in quantity may also include a situation where a significant decline is likely to occur within one year from the date of the filing of an application.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Statewide Nonmetropolitan Median Household Income (SNMHI).</E> Median household income of the State's nonmetropolitan counties and portions of metropolitan counties outside of cities, towns or places of 50,000 or more population.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Full faith and credit.</SUBJECT>

            <P>The Loan Note Guarantee constitutes an obligation supported by the full faith and credit of the United <PRTPAGE P="270"/>States and is not contestable except for fraud or misrepresentation (including negligent misrepresentation) of which the lender or holder has actual knowledge, participates in, or condones. A note which provides for the payment of interest on interest shall not be guaranteed and any Loan Note Guarantee or Assignment Guarantee Agreement attached to, or relating to, a note which provides for payment of interest on interest is void. The Loan Note Guarantee will not be enforceable by the lender to the extent any loss is occasioned by violation of usury laws, negligent servicing, or failure to obtain the required security regardless of the time at which the Agency acquires knowledge of the foregoing. Any losses occasioned will not be enforceable by the lender to the extent that loan funds are used for purposes other than those specifically approved by the Agency in its Conditional Commitment for Guarantee. Negligent servicing is defined as the failure to perform those services which a reasonably prudent lender would perform in servicing its own portfolio of loans that are not guaranteed. The term includes not only the concept of a failure to act, but also not acting in a timely manner, acting in a manner contrary to the manner in which a reasonably prudent lender would act up to the time of loan maturity, or until a final loss is paid. The Loan Note Guarantee or Assignment Guarantee Agreement in the hands of a holder shall not cover interest accruing 90 days after the holder has demanded repurchase by the lender, nor shall the Loan Note Guarantee or Assignment Guarantee Agreement in the hands of a holder cover interest accruing 90 days after the lender or Agency has requested the holder to surrender the evidence of debt for repurchase.</P>

            <P>(a) The entire loan will be secured by the same security with equal lien priority for the guaranteed and non-guaranteed portions of the loan. The non-guaranteed portion of the loan will not be paid first nor given any preference or priority over the guaranteed portion.</P>
            <P>(b) The lender will be responsible for servicing the entire loan and will remain mortgagee or secured party of record notwithstanding the fact that another party may hold a portion of the loan.</P>
            <P>(c) When a guaranteed portion of a loan is sold to a holder, the holder shall have all rights of the lender under the Loan Note Guarantee to the extent of the portion purchased. The lender will remain bound by all the obligations under the Loan Note Guarantee, Lender's Agreement, and Agency program regulations. If the Agency makes a payment to a holder, then the lender must reimburse the Agency.</P>
            <P>(d) A lender will receive all payments of principal and interest on the account of the entire loan and will promptly remit to each holder a pro rata share, less any lender servicing fee.</P>
            <P>(e) The lender may retain all of the unguaranteed portion of the loan or may sell part of the unguaranteed portion of the loan through participation. However, the lender is required to retain 5 percent of the loan amount from the unguaranteed portion in their portfolio.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Availability of credit from other sources.</E> The Agency must determine that the borrower is unable to obtain the required credit without the loan guarantee from private, commercial, or cooperative sources at reasonable rates and terms for loans for similar purposes and periods of time. The Agency must also determine if an outstanding judgment obtained by the United States in a Federal Court (other than the U.S. Tax Court) has been entered against the borrower or if the borrower has an outstanding delinquent debt with any Federal agency. Such judgment or delinquency shall cause the potential borrower to be ineligible to receive a loan guarantee until the judgment is paid in full or otherwise satisfied or the delinquency is cured.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Legal authority and responsibility.</E> (1) Each borrower must have, or will obtain, the legal authority necessary to construct, operate, and maintain the proposed facility and services. They must also have legal authority for obtaining, giving security for, and repaying the proposed loan.</P>
            <P>(2) The borrower shall be responsible for operating, maintaining, and managing the facility and services, and providing for the continued availability and use of the facility and services at reasonable rates and terms.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Applicant.</E> Eligible entities are:</P>
            <P>(1) A public body such as a municipality, county, district, authority, or other political subdivision of a State located in a rural area.</P>
            <P>(2) An organization operated on a not-for-profit basis, such as an association, cooperative, or private corporation. The organization must be an association controlled by a local public body or bodies, or have a broadly based ownership by or membership of people of the local community; or</P>
            <P>(3) Indian tribes on Federal and State reservations and other federally recognized Indian tribes.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Facility location.</E> Facilities must be located in rural areas, except: For utility services such as drinking water, sanitary sewer, solid waste disposal or storm drainage facilities serving both rural and non-rural areas. In such <PRTPAGE P="272"/>cases, Agency funds may be used to finance only that portion serving rural areas, regardless of facility location.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Facilities for public use.</E> All facilities financed under the provisions of this part shall be for public purposes.</P>
            <P>(1) Facilities will be installed to serve any user within the service area who desires service and can be feasibly and legally served.</P>
            <P>(2) In no case will boundaries for the proposed service area be chosen in such a way that any user or area will be excluded because of race, color, religion, sex, marital status, age, disability, or national origin.</P>
            <P>(3) The lender will determine that, when feasible and legally possible, inequities within the proposed project's service area for the same type service proposed will be remedied by the owner on, or before, completion of the project. Inequities are defined as unjustified variations in availability, adequacy, or quality of service. User rate schedules for portions of existing systems or facilities that were developed under different financing, rates, terms, or conditions do not necessarily constitute inequities.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Late payment fees.</E> Late payment charges will not be covered by the Loan Note Guarantee. Such charges may not be added to the principal and interest due under any guaranteed note. Late payment charges may be made only if:</P>
            <P>(1) They are routinely made by the lender in all types of loan transactions;</P>
            <P>(2) Payment has not been received within the customary timeframe allowed by the lender; or</P>
            <P>(3) The lender agrees with the borrower, in writing, that the rate or method of calculating the late payment charges will not be changed to increase charges while the Loan Note Guarantee is in effect.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Rates will be negotiated between the lender and the borrower. They may be either fixed or variable rates. Interest rates will be those rates customarily charged borrowers in similar circumstances in the ordinary course of business and are subject to Agency review and approval.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Variable rate publication.</E> A variable interest rate must be tied to a base rate published periodically in a recognized national or regional financial publication specifically agreed to by the lender and borrower. Such an agreement must be documented in the borrower or lender loan agreement.</P>
            <P>(1) Interest rate caps and incremental adjustment limitations will also be negotiated between the lender and the borrower. Notice of any interest rate change proposed by the lender should allow a sufficient time period for the borrower to obtain any required State or other regulatory approval and to implement any user rate adjustments necessary as a result of the interest rate change. The intervals between interest rate adjustments will be specified in the loan agreement (but not more often than quarterly).</P>
            <P>(2) The lender must incorporate within the variable rate note, the provision for adjustment of payments coincident with an interest rate adjustment. This will ensure the outstanding principal balance is properly amortized within the prescribed loan maturity and eliminate the possibility of a balloon payment at the end of the loan.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Changes.</E> Any change in the interest rate between the date of issuance of the Conditional Commitment for Guarantee and before the issuance of the Loan Note Guarantee must be approved by the Agency. Approval of such change will be shown as an amendment to the Conditional Commitment for Guarantee.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Different rates on guaranteed and unguaranteed portion of the loan.</E> It is permissible to have one interest rate on the guaranteed portion of the loan and another interest rate on the unguaranteed portion of the loan, provided the lender and borrower agree, and:</P>
            <P>(1) The rate on the unguaranteed portion does not exceed that currently being charged on loans for similar purposes to borrowers under similar circumstances; and</P>

            <P>(2) The rate on the guaranteed portion of the loan will not exceed the rate on the unguaranteed portion. This requirement does not apply when the <PRTPAGE P="275"/>unguaranteed rate is variable and the guaranteed portion is fixed.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Multi-rates.</E> When multi-rates are used, the lender will provide the Agency with the overall effective interest rate for the entire loan. Multi-rate loans may be either fixed, variable, or a combination of fixed and variable.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Terms of loan repayment.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Principal and interest on the loan will be due and payable as provided in the note except, any interest accrued as the result of the borrower's default on the guaranteed loan over and above that which would have accrued at the note rate on the guaranteed loan will not be guaranteed by the Agency. The lender will structure repayments as established in the loan agreement between the lender and borrower. Ordinarily, such installments will be scheduled for payment as agreed upon by the lender and borrower on terms that reasonably ensure repayment of the loan. However, the first installment to include a repayment of principal may be scheduled for payment after the project is operable and has begun to generate income. Such installment must be due and payable within 3 years from the date of the note and at least annually thereafter. Interest will be due at least annually from the date of the note. Monthly payments will be required except for borrowers with income limited to less frequent intervals.</P>

            <P>All projects financed under the provisions of this section must be based on taxes, assessments, revenues, fees, or other sources of revenues in an amount sufficient to provide for facility operation and maintenance, a reasonable reserve, and debt payment. The lender is responsible for determining the credit quality and economic feasibility of the proposed loan and must address all elements of the credit quality in a written financial feasibility analysis which includes adequacy of equity, cash flow, security, history, and management capabilities. Financial feasibility reports must take into consideration any interest rate adjustment which may be instituted under the terms of the note. The lender's financial credit analysis may also serve as the feasibility analysis when sufficient evidence is included to determine economic feasibility as well as financial viability. The borrower's consulting engineer may complete the financial feasibility analysis for WW systems. If the facility is used by businesses and the success or failure of the facility is dependent on individual businesses, then the economic viability of those businesses must be assessed.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> The Agency loan approval official may exempt the lender from the requirement for an independent financial feasibility report (when requested by the borrower and the lender) provided the approval official determines that the financial feasibility analysis prepared by the borrower fairly represents the financial feasibility of the facility and the financial feasibility analysis contains an accurate projection of the usage, revenues, and expenses of the facility.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Insufficient information.</E> When the lender or Agency has insufficient information to determine the borrower's repayment ability, an independent feasibility analysis is required.</P>

            <P>The Loan Note Guarantee will not be issued until:</P>
            <P>(a) The lender certifies that:</P>
            <P>(1) No changes have been made in the lender's loan conditions and requirements since the issuance of the Conditional Commitment for Guarantee except those approved in the interim by the Agency in writing.</P>
            <P>(2) All planned property acquisition has been completed and all development has been substantially completed in accordance with plans, specifications, and applicable building codes. No costs have exceeded the amounts approved by the lender and the Agency.</P>
            <P>(3) Required insurance is in effect.</P>
            <P>(4) The loan has been properly closed and the required security instruments have been obtained on any after-acquired property that cannot be covered initially under State statutory provisions.</P>
            <P>(5) The borrower has marketable title to the collateral then owned by the borrower, subject to the instrument securing the loan to be guaranteed and subject to any other exceptions approved, in writing, by the Agency.</P>
            <P>(6) When required, the entire amount of the loan for working capital has been disbursed except in cases where the Agency has approved disbursement over an extended time.</P>
            <P>(7) All other requirements of the Conditional Commitment for Guarantee have been met.</P>
            <P>(8) Lien priorities are consistent with requirements of the Conditional Commitment for Guarantee.</P>
            <P>(9) The loan proceeds have been disbursed for purposes and in amounts consistent with the Conditional Commitment for Guarantee and as specified on the application for the guaranteed loan. A copy of a detailed statement by the lender detailing the use of loan funds will be attached to support this certification.</P>
            <P>(10) There has been no substantive adverse change in the borrower's financial condition nor any other adverse change in the borrower during the period of time from the Agency's issuance of the Conditional Commitment for Guarantee to issuance of the Loan Note Guarantee. The lender's certification must address all adverse changes of the borrower and the guarantors. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(10), the term borrower includes any parent, affiliate, or subsidiary of the borrower.</P>
            <P>(11) All Federal, State, and local design and construction requirements have been met.</P>
            <P>(12) The lender understands and will meet the requirements of the Debt Collection Act (31 U.S.C. Chapter 37).</P>

            <P>(2) A title opinion or title insurance showing ownership of the land and all mortgages or other lien defects, restrictions, or encumbrances, if any. It is the responsibility of the lender to ensure that the borrower has obtained and recorded such releases, consents, or subordinations to such property rights from holders of outstanding liens or other instruments as may be necessary for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the facility and to provide the required security. For example, when a site is for major structures and the lender and borrower are able to obtain only a right-of-way or easement on such a site rather than a fee simple title, such a title opinion must be requested.</P>
            <P>(e) If the Loan Note Guarantee cannot be issued before the Conditional Commitment expires, the lender must submit a written request for an extension of the expiration date. The lender must document and certify to paragraph (a)(1) and (a)(11) of this section specifically identifying any modifications.</P>

Only when the Agency is satisfied that all conditions for the guarantee have been met will the Loan Note Guarantee be executed.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Lender responsibilities.</E> When a Loan Note Guarantee or Assignment Guarantee Agreement is lost, stolen, destroyed, mutilated, or defaced while in the custody of the lender or holder, the lender will coordinate the activities of the party who seeks the replacement documents and will submit the required documents to the Agency for processing. The requirements for replacement are as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) A certificate of loss properly notarized which includes:</P>
            <P>(i) Legal name and present address of either the lender or the holder who is requesting the replacement forms;</P>

            <P>(ii) Legal name and address of the lender of record;<PRTPAGE P="281"/>
            </P>
            <P>(iii) Capacity of person certifying;</P>
            <P>(iv) Full identification of the Loan Note Guarantee or Assignment Guarantee Agreement, including the name of the borrower, Agency case number, date of the Loan Note Guarantee, Assignment Guarantee Agreement, face amount of the evidence of debt purchased, date of evidence of debt, present balance of the loan, percentages of guarantee and, if Assignment Guarantee Agreement, the original named holder and the percentage of the guaranteed portion of the loan assigned to that holder. Any existing parts of the document to be replaced must be attached to the certificate;</P>
            <P>(v) A full statement of circumstances of the loss, theft, or destruction of the Loan Note Guarantee or Assignment Guarantee Agreement; and</P>
            <P>(vi) The holder shall present evidence demonstrating current ownership of the Loan Note Guarantee and Note or Assignment Guarantee Agreement. If the present holder is not the same as the original holder, a copy of the endorsement of each successive holder in the chain of transfer from the initial holder to present holder must be included. If copies of the endorsement cannot be obtained, best available records of transfer must be presented to the Agency (e.g., order confirmation, canceled checks).</P>
            <P>(2) An indemnity bond acceptable to the Agency shall accompany the request for replacement except when the holder is the United States, a Federal Reserve Bank, a Federal Government corporation, a State or Territory, or the District of Columbia.</P>
            <P>(3) All indemnity bonds must be issued and payable to the United States of America. The bond shall be in an amount not less than the unpaid principal and interest. The bond shall hold the Government harmless against any claim or demand which might arise or against any damage, loss, costs, or expenses which might be sustained or incurred by reasons of the loss or replacement of the instruments.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Defaults by borrower.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Lender notification to Agency.</E> The lender must notify the Agency when a borrower is 30 days past due on a payment, has not met its responsibilities of providing the required financial statements, or is otherwise in default. The lender will continue to keep the Agency informed on a bimonthly basis until such time as the loan is no longer in default. If a monetary default exceeds 60 days, the lender will arrange a meeting with the borrower to resolve the default. The lender will provide a summary of the meeting and any decisions or actions agreed upon.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Servicing options.</E> In considering servicing options, the prospects for providing a permanent cure without adversely affecting the risks to the Agency and the lender must be the paramount objective. Temporary curative actions (such as payment deferments or collateral subordination) must strengthen the loan and be in the best financial interest of the lender and the Agency. Some of these actions may require concurrence of the holder.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Multi-note.</E> If the loan was closed with the multi-note option, the lender may need to possess all notes to take some servicing actions. In those situations when the Agency is holder of some of the notes, the Agency may endorse the notes back to the lender, provided a proper receipt is received from the lender which defines the reason for the transfer. Under no circumstances will the Agency endorse the original Loan Note Guarantee to the lender.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Repurchase of loan.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Repurchase by lender.</E> The lender has the option to repurchase the loan from a holder within 30 days of written demand from the holder when the borrower is in default not less than 60 days on payment. The repurchase will be for an amount equal to the unpaid guaranteed portion of principal and accrued interest less the lender's servicing fee. The guarantee does not cover the note interest to the holder on the guaranteed loan accruing after 90 days from the date of the demand letter to the lender. The holder will concurrently send a copy of the demand to the Agency. The lender will accept an assignment without recourse from the holder <PRTPAGE P="282"/>upon repurchase. The lender is encouraged to repurchase the loan to facilitate the accounting of funds, resolve the problem, and permit the borrower to cure the default, where reasonable. The lender will notify the holder and the Agency of its decision within 30 days of receipt of demand from the holder.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Agency repurchase.</E> (1) If the lender does not repurchase as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the Agency will purchase from the holder the unpaid principal balance of the guaranteed portion together with accrued interest to date of repurchase (less the lender's servicing fee) within 30 days after a specific written demand directed to the Agency. The copy of the demand on the lender is not sufficient. The guarantee will not cover the note interest to the holder on the guaranteed loan accruing after 90 days from the date of the original demand letter. The lender shall not charge the Agency any servicing fees nor are any such fees collectible from the Agency.</P>
            <P>(2) The holder's demand to the Agency must include a copy of the written demand made upon the lender. The holder or duly authorized agent must also include evidence of the right to require payment from the Agency. Such evidence will consist of either the original of the Loan Note Guarantee properly endorsed to the Agency or the original of the Assignment Guarantee Agreement properly assigned to the Agency without recourse including all rights, title, and interest in the loan. The Agency will be subrogated to all rights of the holder. The holder must include in the demand the amount due including unpaid principal, unpaid interest to date of demand, and interest subsequently accruing from the date of demand to the proposed payment date. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Agency, such proposed payment will not be later than 30 days from the date of demand.</P>
            <P>(3) The lender must promptly provide the Agency with the information necessary for the Agency's determination of the appropriate amount due the holder upon the Agency's notification to the lender of the holder's demand for payment. This information must be certified by an authorized officer of the lender. Any discrepancy between the amount claimed by the holder and the information submitted by the lender must be resolved before payment will be approved. The Agency will notify both parties and such conflict will suspend the running of the 30-day payment requirement.</P>
            <P>(4) Any purchase by the Agency does not change, alter, or modify any of the lender's obligations to the Agency arising from the loan or guarantee nor does it waive any of the Agency's rights against the lender. The Agency may set off against the lender all rights inuring to the Agency as the holder of the instrument against the Agency's obligation to the lender under the Loan Note Guarantee.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Repurchase for servicing.</E> When the lender determines that repurchase of the guaranteed portion of the loan is necessary to service the loan, the holder must sell the guaranteed portion to the lender for the unpaid principal and interest balance (less the lender's servicing fee). The guarantee does not cover interest accruing after 90 days from the date the lender's or Agency's letter requesting the holder to tender its guaranteed portion. The lender must not repurchase from the holder for arbitrage purposes to further its own financial gain. Any repurchase must be made only after the lender obtains the Agency written approval. If the lender does not repurchase the portion from the holder, the Agency may, at its option, purchase such guaranteed portion for servicing purposes.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Interest rate changes after loan closing.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Subject to the restrictions below, the borrower, lender, and holder (if any) may collectively effect a permanent reduction in the interest rate on the guaranteed loan at any time during the life of the loan on written agreement by all of the applicable parties. After such a permanent reduction, the Loan Note Guarantee will only cover losses of interest at the reduced interest rate. The Agency must be notified by the lender, in writing, within 10 calendar days of the change. When the Agency is a holder, it will <PRTPAGE P="283"/>concur only when it is demonstrated that the change is more viable than liquidation and that the Government's financial interests are not adversely affected. Factors which will be considered in making such determination are the Government's cost of borrowing money and the project's enhancement of rural development. The monetary recovery must be greater than the liquidation recovery, and a financial feasibility analysis must show the project's continued viability.</P>
            <P>(1) Fixed rates cannot be changed to variable rates to reduce the interest rate to the borrower unless the variable rate has a ceiling which is less than the original fixed rate.</P>
            <P>(2) Variable rates can be changed to a lower fixed rate. In a final loss settlement when qualifying rate changes are made with the required written agreements and notification, the interest will be calculated for the periods the given rates were in effect. The lender must maintain records which adequately document the accrued interest claimed.</P>
            <P>(3) The lender is responsible for the legal documentation of interest rate changes. However, the lender may not issue a new note.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Increases.</E> No increases in interest rates will be permitted under the loan guarantee except the normal fluctuations in approved variable interest rate loans.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Liquidation.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Liquidation will occur when the lender concludes that liquidation of the guaranteed loan is necessary because of default or third party actions that the borrower cannot, or will not, cure or eliminate within a reasonable period of time and the Agency concurs with the lender; or the Agency, at any time, independently concludes that liquidation is necessary. The lender will proceed as expeditiously as possible, including giving any notices or taking any legal actions required by the security instruments.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> If a lender has made a loan guaranteed by the Agency under previous regulations, the lender has the option to liquidate the loan under the provisions of this part or under the provisions of previous regulations. The lender will notify the Agency in writing within 10 days after its decision to liquidate, which regulatory provisions it chooses to use. The lender may not choose some provisions of one regulation and other provisions of the other regulation.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Acquiring property titles.</E> If a lender acquires title to property, the Agency may elect to permit the lender the option of calculating the final loss settlement using the net proceeds received at the time of the ultimate disposition of the property. The lender must submit to the Agency a written request to use this option within 15 days of acquiring title and the Agency must agree, in writing, prior to the lender submitting any request for estimated loss payment.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Liquidation plan.</E> The lender will (within 30 days after a decision to liquidate) submit to the Agency, in writing, a proposed, detailed liquidation plan. Upon approval by the Agency of the liquidation plan, the lender will commence liquidation. The lender's liquidation plan must include, but is not limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Such proof as the Agency requires to establish the lender's ownership of the guaranteed loan notes and related security instruments, a copy of the payment ledger or other documentation which reflects the outstanding loan balance and accrued interest to date, and the method of computing the interest;</P>
            <P>(2) A complete list of collateral;</P>
            <P>(3) The recommended liquidation methods for making the maximum collection possible on the indebtedness and the justification for such methods, including the recommended action for acquiring and disposing of all collateral;</P>
            <P>(4) Necessary steps for preservation of the collateral;</P>
            <P>(5) Copies of the borrower's latest available financial statements;</P>
            <P>(6) An itemized list of estimated liquidation expenses expected to be incurred and justification for each expense;</P>
            <P>(7) A schedule to periodically report to the Agency on the progress of the liquidation;</P>

            <P>(8) Estimated protective advance amounts with justification;<PRTPAGE P="284"/>
            </P>
            <P>(9) Proposed protective bid amounts on collateral to be sold at auction and a discussion of how the amounts were determined;</P>
            <P>(10) If a voluntary conveyance is considered, the proposed amount to be credited to the guaranteed debt;</P>
            <P>(11) Legal opinions, as needed; and</P>
            <P>(12) If the outstanding balance of principal and interest is less than $250,000, the lender will obtain an estimate of fair market and potential liquidation value of the collateral. If the outstanding balance of principal and interest is $250,000 or more, the lender will obtain an independent appraisal report on all collateral securing the loan which will reflect the fair market value and potential liquidation value. The independent appraiser's fee will be shared equally by the Agency and the lender.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Partial liquidation plan.</E> If actions are necessary to immediately preserve and protect the collateral, a partial liquidation plan may be submitted and, when approved, must be followed by a complete liquidation plan prepared by the lender.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Disposition of collateral.</E> Disposition of collateral acquired by the lender must be approved, in writing, by the Agency when:</P>
            <P>(1) The lender's cost to acquire the collateral of a borrower exceeds the potential recovery value of the security and the lender proposes abandoning the collateral in lieu of liquidation; or</P>
            <P>(2) The acquired collateral is to be sold to the borrower, borrower's stockholders or officers, or the lender or lender's stockholders or officers.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Agency liquidation.</E> The Agency will liquidate at its option only when it is a holder and there is reason to believe the lender is not likely to initiate liquidation efforts that will result in maximum recovery. When the Agency liquidates, proceeds derived from the sale of the collateral will be applied first to reasonable liquidation expenses and second to the guaranteed portion of the loan.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Final loss payment.</E> Final loss payments will be made only after all collateral has been properly accounted for and liquidation expenses are determined to be reasonable and within approved limits. Any estimated loss payments made to the lender will be credited against the final loss on the guaranteed loan. The amount of an estimated loss payment must be credited as a deduction from the principal balance of the loan.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Protective advances.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Protective advances can only be added to the loan account for purposes of requirements to preserve the value of the security. Protective advances constitute an indebtedness of the borrower to the lender and must be secured by collateral to the same extent as principal and interest. Protective advances include, but are not limited to, advances made for taxes, annual assessments, ground rent, hazard and flood insurance premiums affecting the collateral (including any other expenses necessary to protect the collateral). Attorney fees are not a protective advance.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Agency approval.</E> The Agency must approve, in writing, all protective advances on loans within its loan approval authority which exceed a total cumulative advance amount of $5,000 to the same borrower. Protective advances must be reasonable when associated with the value of the collateral being preserved.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Preserving collateral.</E> When considering protective advances, sound judgment must be exercised in determining that the additional funds advanced will actually preserve collateral and recovery is actually enhanced by making the advance.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Lender responsibility.</E> The lender is responsible for protecting the guaranteed loan debt and all the collateral securing it in bankruptcy proceedings. These responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Filing a proof of claim, where necessary, and all necessary papers and pleadings;</P>
            <P>(2) Attending and, where necessary, participating in meetings of the creditors and all court proceedings;</P>
            <P>(3) Immediately seeking adequate protection of the collateral if it is subject to being used by the trustee in bankruptcy or the debtor in possession;</P>
            <P>(4) Where appropriate, seeking involuntary conversion of a pending chapter 11 case to a liquidation proceeding or seeking dismissal of the proceedings; and</P>
            <P>(5) Keeping the Agency adequately and regularly informed, in writing, of all aspects of the proceedings.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Appraisals.</E> In a chapter 9 or chapter 11 reorganization, the lender must obtain an independent appraisal of the collateral if the Agency believes an independent appraisal is necessary. The Agency and the lender will share the appraisal fee equally.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Liquidation expenses.</E> Only expenses authorized by the court of chapter 9 plans or chapter 11 reorganizations, or chapters 11 or 7 liquidation (unless the liquidation is by the lender), may be deducted from the collateral proceeds.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Repurchase from the holder.</E> The Agency or the lender, with the approval of the Agency, may initiate the repurchase of the unpaid guaranteed portion of the loan from the holder. If the lender is the holder, an estimated loss payment may be filed at the initiation of a chapter 7 proceeding or after a chapter 9 or chapter 11 proceeding becomes a liquidation proceeding. Any loss payment on loans in bankruptcy must be approved by the Agency.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</E> If a borrower has filed for protection under chapters 9 or 11 of the United States Code for a reorganization (but not chapter 13) and all or a portion of the debt has been discharged, the lender may request an estimated loss payment of the guaranteed portion of the accrued interest and principal discharged by the court. If the court approves revisions to the chapter 9 plan or chapter 11 reorganization plan, subsequent estimated loss payments may be requested in accordance with the court approved changes. Once the reorganization plan has been satisfactorily completed, the lender is responsible for submitting the documentation necessary for the Agency to review and adjust the estimated loss claim to reflect any actual discharge of principal and interest and to reimburse the lender for any court ordered interest-rate reduction under the terms of the reorganization plan.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Agency approval of estimated liquidation expenses.</E> The Agency must approve, in advance and in writing, the lender's estimated liquidation expenses of collateral in a liquidation if the liquidation is performed by the lender. These expenses must be reasonable and customary and not include in-house expenses of the lender.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Reconciliation.</E> In the event that the estimated loss payment exceeds the actual loss, the lender will reimburse the Agency the amount in excess of the actual loss plus interest at the note rate from the date of the estimated loss payment.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Transfers and assumptions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> For all transfers and assumptions, the lender must concur in the plans for disposition of funds in the transferor's debt service, reserve, and operation and maintenance account. The Agency will approve, in writing, transfers and assumptions of loans to transferees who will continue the original purpose of the guaranteed loan subject to the following applicable provisions:</P>
            <P>(1) When the transaction is to a member of the borrower's organization, it will be at an amount which will not result in a loss to the lender.</P>
            <P>(2) Transfers to eligible borrowers will receive preference if recovery to the lender from the sale price is not less than it would be if the transfer was to an ineligible borrower.</P>

            <P>(3) The present borrower is unable or unwilling to accomplish the objectives <PRTPAGE P="286"/>of the guaranteed loan, and the transfer will be to the lender's and Agency's advantage.</P>
            <P>(4) The transferee will assume an amount at least equal to either the present market value or the debt, whichever is less.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Transfers to an eligible borrower.</E> (1) The total indebtedness may be transferred to an eligible borrower on the same terms.</P>
            <P>(2) The total indebtedness may be transferred to another eligible borrower on different terms not to exceed those terms for which an initial guaranteed loan can be made.</P>
            <P>(3) Less than the total indebtedness may be transferred to another eligible borrower on the same or different terms and the pro rata share of any eligible loss paid to the lender.</P>
            <P>(4) A guaranteed loan for which the transferee is eligible may be made in connection with a transfer subject to the policies and procedures governing the type of loan being made.</P>
            <P>(5) If the transferor is to receive a payment for the equity, the total debt must be assumed.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Ineligible borrower.</E> Transfers to ineligible borrowers are considered only when needed as a method for servicing problem cases when an eligible transferee is not available. Transfers should not be considered as a means by which members can obtain equity or as a method of providing a source of easy credit for purchasers. Transfers must meet the following requirements:</P>
            <P>(1) All transfers to ineligible borrowers will include a one-time nonrefundable transfer fee to the Agency of no more than 1 percent. Transfer fees will be collected, and payments applied, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) For all loans covered by this part, the Agency may approve a transfer of indebtedness to, and assumption of, a loan by a transferee who does not meet the eligibility requirements for the kind of loan being assumed when the ineligible borrower will:</P>
            <P>(i) Make a significant down payment, and</P>
            <P>(ii) Agree to pay the remaining balance within not more than 15 years. Installments will be at least equal to the amount amortized over a period not greater than the remaining life of the debt being transferred, and the balance will be due the fifteenth year.</P>
            <P>(3) Interest rates to ineligible transferees will be the rate specified in the note of the transferor or the rates customarily charged borrowers in similar circumstances in the ordinary course of business and are subject to Agency review and approval. The rates may be either fixed or variable.</P>
            <P>(i) Transferees must have the ability to repay as determined by the lender the debt according to the Assumption Agreement and must have the legal authority to enter into the contract. The transferee will submit a current balance sheet to the lender. The lender will obtain and analyze the credit history of the transferee.</P>
            <P>(ii) The transferor may receive equity payments only when the full amount of the debt is assumed. However, equity payments will not be made on more favorable terms than those on which the balance of the debt will be paid.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Transfer fees.</E> Transfer fees are a one-time nonrefundable cost to be collected by the lender at the time of application or proposal.</P>
            <P>(1) The transfer fees will be a standard fee plus the cost of the appraisal.</P>
            <P>(2) The lender will collect and submit the fee to the Agency.</P>
            <P>(3) The Agency may waive the transfer fee if it determines that such waiver is in the best interest of the Agency.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Processing transfers and assumptions.</E> (1) In any transfer and assumption case, the transferor (including any guarantor) may be released from liability by the lender only with prior Agency written concurrence and only when the value of the collateral being transferred is at least equal to the amount of the loan, or part of the loan, being assumed. If the transfer is for less than the entire debt:</P>
            <P>(i) The Agency must determine that the transferor and any guarantor have no reasonable debt-paying ability considering their assets and income at the time of transfer, and</P>

            <P>(ii) The lender must certify that the transferor has cooperated in good faith, used due diligence to maintain the collateral against loss, and has otherwise fulfilled all of the regulations of this <PRTPAGE P="287"/>part to the best of the borrower's ability.</P>
            <P>(2) The lender will make, in all cases, a complete credit analysis to determine viability of the project (subject to the Agency review and approval) including any requirement for deposit in an escrow account as security to meet the determined equity requirements for the project.</P>
            <P>(3) The lender will confirm that the transaction can be properly transferred and the conveyance instruments will be filed, registered, or recorded as appropriate and legally permissible.</P>
            <P>(4) The assumption will be made on the lender's form of Assumption Agreement and will contain the Agency case number of the transferor and transferee.</P>
            <P>(5) Loan terms cannot be changed by the Assumption Agreement unless previously approved in writing by the Agency with the concurrence of holder and the transferor (including guarantor if it has not been released from personal liability). Any new loan terms cannot exceed those authorized in this part. The lender's request will be supported by:</P>
            <P>(i) An explanation of the reasons for the proposed change in the loan terms, and</P>
            <P>(ii) Certification that the lien position securing the guaranteed loan will be maintained or improved, and proper hazard insurance will be continued in effect.</P>
            <P>(6) In the case of a transfer and assumption, it is the lender's responsibility to see that all such transfers and assumptions will be noted on all originals of the Loan Note Guarantee. The lender will provide the Agency a copy of the Transfer and Assumption Agreement.</P>
            <P>(7) If a loss should occur upon a complete transfer of assets and assumption for less than the full amount of the debt and the transferor-debtor (including personal guarantor) is released from personal liability (as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section), the lender (if holding the guaranteed portion) may file an estimated Report of Loss to recover their pro rata share of the actual loss at that time. Approved protective advances and accrued interest made during the arrangement of a transfer and assumption, if not assumed by the transferee, will be entered on the estimated Report of Loss.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Mergers.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Agency may approve mergers or consolidations (herein referred to as “mergers”) when the resulting organization will be eligible for an Agency guaranteed loan and assumes all the liabilities and acquires all the assets of the merged borrower. Mergers may be approved when:</P>
            <P>(1) The merger is in the best interest of the Government and the merging borrower;</P>
            <P>(2) The resulting borrower can meet all required conditions as contained in specific loan note agreements; and</P>
            <P>(3) All property can be legally transferred to the resulting borrower.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Distinguishing mergers from transfers and assumptions.</E> Mergers occur when one entity combines with another entity in such a way that the first entity ceases to exist as a separate entity while the other continues. In a consolidation, two or more entities combine to form a new, consolidated entity with the original entity ceasing to exist. Such transactions must be distinguished from transfers and assumptions in which a transferor will not necessarily go out of existence, and the transferee will not always take all the transferor's assets nor assume all the transferor's liabilities.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Disposition of acquired property.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> When the lender acquires title to the collateral and the final loss claim is not paid until final disposition, the lender must proceed as quickly as possible to develop a plan to fully protect the collateral, and the lender must dispose of the collateral without delay.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Re-title collateral.</E> Any collateral accepted by the lender must not be titled in the Agency's name in whole or in part. The Agency's position is that of a guarantor relating to losses, not a lender.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Collateral preservation.</E> After acquiring the collateral, the lender must protect the collateral from deterioration (weather, vandalism, etc.). Hazard insurance in an amount necessary to <PRTPAGE P="288"/>cover the fair market value of the collateral must be maintained.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Collateral sale.</E> (1) The lender will prepare and submit to the Agency a plan on the best method of sale, keeping in mind any prospective purchasers. The Agency must approve the plan in writing. If an existing approved liquidation plan addresses the disposition of acquired property, no further review is required unless modification of the plan is needed.</P>
            <P>(2) Anytime there is a case when the conversion of collateral to cash can reasonably be expected to result in a negative net recovery amount, abandonment of the collateral should be considered. The Agency must approve abandonment in writing.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Determination and payment of loss.</SUBJECT>
            <P>In all liquidation cases, final settlement will be made with the lender after the collateral is liquidated. The Agency will have the right to recover losses paid under the guarantee from any liable party.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> If the lender takes title to collateral, any loss will be based on the collateral value at the time the lender obtains title.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Loss calculations.</E> The Report of Loss form (available in any Agency office) will be used for calculations of all estimated and final loss determinations. Estimated loss payments may only be approved after the lender has submitted a liquidation plan approved by the Agency.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Estimated loss payments.</E> When the lender is conducting the liquidation and owns any of the guaranteed portion of the loan, it may request an estimated loss payment by submitting an estimate of loss that will occur in connection with liquidation of the loan. An estimated loss payment may be approved after the Agency has approved the liquidation plan.</P>
            <P>(1) The lender will prepare and submit a Report of Loss using the appraised value in lieu of amount received from sale of collateral.</P>
            <P>(2) The estimated loss payment shall be calculated as of the date of such payment. The total amount of the loss payment remitted by the Agency will be applied by the lender on the guaranteed portion of the loan debt. Such application does not release the borrower from liability. At the time of final loss settlement, the lender may notify the borrower that the loss payment has been so applied.</P>
            <P>(3) After liquidation has been completed, a final Report of Loss will be submitted by the lender to the Agency.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Final report of loss.</E> In all cases, a final Report of Loss must be submitted to the Agency. Before Agency approval of any final loss report, the lender must account for all funds obtained, disposition of the collateral, all costs incurred, and any other information necessary for the successful completion of liquidation. Upon receipt of the final accounting and Report of Loss, the Agency may conduct an audit and will determine the final loss. The lender will make its records available to, and otherwise assist, the Agency in making any audit it requires of the Report of Loss. The documentation accompanying the Report of Loss must support the loss claimed.</P>
            <P>(1) The lender must document and show that all of the collateral has been accounted for and properly liquidated and that liquidation proceeds have been properly accounted for and applied correctly on the loan. The Agency must be satisfied that the lender has accomplished this in the manner contained herein and that the lender has maximized the collections in conducting the liquidation.</P>
            <P>(2) The lender must show a breakdown on any protective advance amount as to the payee, purpose of the expenditure, date paid, evidence that the amount expended was proper, and that the amount was actually paid.</P>
            <P>(3) The lender must show a breakdown of liquidation expenses as to the payee, purpose of the expenditure, date paid, evidence that the amount expended was proper, and that the amount was actually paid.</P>

            <P>(4) Accrued interest should be supported by attachments showing how the amount was accrued by the lender. A copy of the promissory note and ledger will be attached. If the interest rate was a variable rate, the lender must include documentation of <PRTPAGE P="289"/>changes in the selected base rate and when the changes in the loan rate became effective.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Liquidation income.</E> Any net rental or other income that has been received by the lender from the collateral will be applied on the guaranteed loan debt.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Liquidation costs.</E> Certain reasonable liquidation costs will be allowed during the liquidation process. The liquidation costs must be submitted as a part of the liquidation plan. Such costs will be deducted from gross proceeds received from the disposition of collateral unless the costs have been previously determined by the lender (with Agency concurrence) to be protective advances. If changed circumstances after submission of the liquidation plan require a revision of liquidation costs, the lender will obtain the Agency's written concurrence prior to proceeding with the proposed changes. No in-house expenses of the lender will be allowed.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Protective advance losses.</E> In those instances where the lender made authorized protective advances, the lender may claim recovery for the guaranteed portion of any loss of monies advanced as well as interest resulting from such protective advances. These claims shall be included in the final Report of Loss.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Final loss approval.</E> After the final Report of Loss has been tentatively approved:</P>
            <P>(1) If the actual loss is greater than any estimated loss payment, such loss will be paid by the Agency;</P>
            <P>(2) If the actual loss is less than any estimated loss payment, the lender will reimburse the Agency;</P>
            <P>(3) If the Agency conducted the liquidation, it will provide an accounting to the lender and will pay the lender in accordance with the Loan Note Guarantee.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Loss limits.</E> The amount payable by the Agency to the lender cannot exceed the limits contained in the Loan Note Guarantee. If the Agency conducts the liquidation, loss occasioned by accruing interest will be covered by the guarantee only to the date the Agency accepts this responsibility. When the liquidation is conducted by the lender, loss occasioned by accruing interest will be covered to the extent of the guarantee to the date of final settlement provided the lender proceeds expeditiously with the liquidation plan approved by the Agency.</P>

            <P>After a loan has been liquidated and a final loss has been paid by the Agency, any future funds which may be recovered by the lender will be pro-rated between the Agency and the lender in accordance with the guaranteed percentage even if the Loan Note Guarantee has been terminated.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This part outlines the policies and procedures for making and processing direct loans and grants for water and waste projects. The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) shall cooperate fully with State and local agencies in making loans and grants to assure maximum support to the State strategy for rural development. Agency officials and their staffs shall maintain coordination and liaison with State agency and substate planning districts.</P>

              <P>(b) The income data used in this part to determine median household income must be that which most accurately reflects the income of the service area. The median household income of the service area and the nonmetropolitan median household income of the State will be determined from income data from 5-year income data from the American Community Survey (ACS) or, if needed, other Census Bureau data. If there is reason to believe that the ACS or other Census Bureau data does not accurately represent the median household income within the area to be served, the reasons will be documented <PRTPAGE P="291"/>and the applicant may furnish, or RD may obtain, additional information regarding such median household income data. Information must consist of reliable data from local, regional, State or Federal sources or from a survey conducted by a reliable impartial source. The nonmetropolitan median household income of the State may only be updated on a national basis by the RUS National Office. This will be done only when median household income data for the same year for all Bureau of the Census areas is available from the Bureau of the Census or other reliable sources. Bureau of the Census areas would include areas such as: Counties, County Subdivisions, Cities, Towns, Townships, Boroughs, and other places.</P>
              <P>(c) RUS debt instruments will require an agreement that if at any time it shall appear to the Government that the borrower is able to refinance the amount of the indebtedness to the Government then outstanding, in whole or in part, by obtaining a loan for such purposes from responsible cooperative or private credit sources, at reasonable rates and terms for loans for similar purposes and periods of time, the borrower will, upon request of the Government, apply for and accept such loan in sufficient amount to repay the Government and will take all such actions as may be required in connection with such loan.</P>
              <P>(d) Funds allocated for use under this part are also for the use of Indian tribes within the State, regardless of whether State development strategies include Indian reservations within the State's boundaries. Native Americans residing on such reservations must have equal opportunity to participate in the benefits of these programs as compared with other residents of the State. Such tribes might not be subject to State and local laws or jurisdiction. However, any requirements of this part that affect applicant eligibility, the adequacy of RUS's security, or the adequacy of service to users of the facility and all other requirements of this part must be met.</P>
              <P>(e) RUS financial programs must be extended without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, marital status, age, or physical or mental handicap.</P>
              <P>(f) Any processing or servicing activity conducted pursuant to this part involving authorized assistance to Agency employees, members of their families, known close relatives, or business or close personal associates, is subject to the provisions of subpart D of part 1900 of this title. Applicants for assistance are required to identify any known relationship or association with a RUS employee.</P>

              <P>(a) All facilities financed under the provisions of this part shall be for public use. The facilities will be installed so as to serve any potential user within the service area who desires service and can be feasibly and legally served. This does not preclude:</P>
              <P>(1) Financing or constructing projects in phases when it is not practical to finance or construct the entire project at one time; and</P>

              <P>(2) Financing or constructing facilities where it is not economically feasible to serve the entire area, provided economic feasibility is determined on the basis of the entire system and not by considering the cost of separate extensions to or parts thereof; the applicant publicly announces a plan for extending service to areas not initially receiving service from the system; and potential users located in the areas not to be initially served receive written notice from the applicant that service <PRTPAGE P="297"/>will not be provided until such time as it is economically feasible to do so.</P>
              <P>(b) Should the Agency determine that inequities exist within the applicants service area for the same type service proposed (i.e., water or waste disposal) such inequities will be remedied by the applicant prior to loan or grant approval or included as part of the project. Inequities are defined as unjustified variations in availability, adequacy or quality of service. User rate schedules for portions of existing systems that were developed under different financing, rates, terms or conditions do not necessarily constitute inequities.</P>
              <P>(c) Developers are normally expected to provide utility-type facilities in new or developing areas in compliance with appropriate State statutes. RUS financing will be considered to an eligible applicant only in such cases when failure to complete development would result in an adverse economic condition for the rural area (not the community being developed); the proposal is necessary to the success of a current area development plan; and loan repayment can be assured by:</P>
              <P>(1) The applicant already having sufficient assured revenues to repay the loan; or</P>
              <P>(2) Developers providing a bond or escrowed security deposit as a guarantee sufficient to meet expenses attributable to the area in question until a sufficient number of the building sites are occupied and connected to the facility to provide enough revenues to meet operating, maintenance, debt service, and reserve requirements. Such guarantees from developers will meet the requirements in § 1780.39(c)(4)(ii); or</P>
              <P>(3) Developers paying cash for the increased capital cost and any increased operating expenses until the developing area will support the increased costs; or</P>

              <P>(5) The loan is to a public body evidenced by a pledge of tax revenue or assessments; or</P>
              <P>(6) The user charges can become a lien upon the property being served and income from such lien can be collected in sufficient time to be used for its intended purposes.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Rates and terms.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Each loan will bear interest at the rate prescribed in RD Instruction 440.1, exhibit B. The interest rates will be set by the Agency for each quarter of the fiscal year. All rates will be adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of one per centum. The rate will be the lower of the rate in effect at the time of loan approval or the rate in effect at the time of loan closing unless the applicant otherwise chooses.</P>
              <P>(2) If the interest rate is to be that in effect at loan closing on a loan involving multiple advances of RUS funds using temporary debt instruments, the interest rate charged shall be that in effect on the date when the first temporary debt instrument is issued.</P>
              <P>(3) For a loan for a specific project that has been approved, but not closed on or before May 22, 2008, the rate structure in effect at that time will determine the interest rates. For loans approved on or after May 23, 2008, a percentage of the market rate will be used to determine the poverty and intermediate interest rates.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Poverty rate.</E> The poverty interest rate will not exceed 5 per centum per annum. Loans approved on or after May 23, 2008, will have the poverty interest rate set at 60 percent of the market rate. All poverty rate loans must comply with the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) The primary purpose of the loan is to upgrade existing facilities or construct new facilities required to meet applicable health or sanitary standards; and</P>
              <P>(2) The median household income of the service area is below the higher of the poverty line, or 80 percent of the Statewide nonmetropolitan median household income.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Intermediate rate.</E> The intermediate interest rate will not exceed 7 percent per annum. For a loan for a specific project that has been approved, but not closed on or before May 22, 2008, the intermediate rate is the poverty rate plus one-half of the difference between the poverty rate and the market rate, not to exceed 7 percent per <PRTPAGE P="298"/>annum. Loans approved on or after May 23, 2008, will have the intermediate interest rate set at 80 percent of the market rate. The intermediate interest rate will apply to loans that do not meet the requirements for the poverty rate and for which the median household income of the service area is not more than 100 percent of the nonmetropolitan median household income of the State.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Market rate.</E> The market interest rate will be set using as guidance the average of the Bond Buyer Index (available in any Agency office or the program's Web site) for the four weeks prior to the first Friday of the last month before the beginning of the quarter. The market rate will apply to all loans that do not qualify for a different rate under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Repayment terms.</E> The loan repayment period shall not exceed the useful life of the facility, State statute or 40 years from the date of the note or bond, whichever is less. Where RUS grant funds are used in connection with an RUS loan, the loan will be for the maximum term permitted by this part, State statute, or the useful life of the facility, whichever is less, unless there is an exceptional case where circumstances justify making an RUS loan for less than the maximum term permitted. In such cases, the reasons must be fully documented.</P>
              <P>(1) Principal payments may be deferred in whole or in part for a period not to exceed 36 months following the date the first interest installment is due. If for any reason it appears necessary to permit a longer period of deferment, the Agency may authorize such deferment. Deferments of principal will not be used to:</P>
              <P>(i) Postpone the levying of taxes or assessments;</P>
              <P>(ii) Delay collection of the full rates which the borrower has agreed to charge users for its services as soon as those services become available;</P>
              <P>(iii) Create reserves for normal operation and maintenance;</P>
              <P>(iv) Make any capital improvements except those approved by the Agency which are determined to be essential to the repayment of the loan or to maintain adequate security; and</P>
              <P>(v) Make payment on other debt.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Payment date.</E> Loan payments will be scheduled to coincide with income availability and be in accordance with State law. If State law only permits principal plus interest (P&amp;I) type bonds, annual or semiannual payments will be used. Insofar as practical monthly payments will be scheduled one full month following the date of loan closing; or semiannual or annual payments will be scheduled six or twelve full months, respectively, following the date of loan closing or any deferment period. Due dates falling on the 29th, 30th or 31st day of the month will be avoided.</P>
              <P>(3) In all cases, including those in which RUS is jointly financing with another lender, the RUS payments of principal and interest should approximate amortized installments.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Security.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Loans will be secured by the best security position practicable in a manner which will adequately protect the interest of RUS during the repayment period of the loan. Specific security requirements for each loan will be included in a letter of conditions.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Public bodies.</E> Loans to such borrowers, including Federally recognized Indian tribes as appropriate, will be evidenced by notes, bonds, warrants, or other contractual obligations as may be authorized by relevant laws and by borrower's documents, resolutions, and ordinances. Security, in the following order of preference, will consist of:</P>
              <P>(1) The full faith and credit of the borrower when the debt is evidenced by general obligation bonds; and/or</P>
              <P>(2) Pledges of taxes or assessments; and/or</P>

              <P>(3) Pledges of facility revenue and, when it is the customary financial practice in the State, liens will be taken on the interest of the applicant in all land, easements, rights-of-way, water rights, water purchase contracts, water sales contracts, sewage treatment contracts, and similar property rights, including leasehold interests, used or to be used in connection with the facility whether owned at the time <PRTPAGE P="299"/>the loan is approved or acquired with loan funds.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Other-than-public bodies.</E> Loans to other-than-public body applicants and Federally recognized Indian tribes, as appropriate, will be secured in the following order of preference:</P>
              <P>(1) Assignments of borrower income will be taken and perfected by filing, if legally permissible; and</P>
              <P>(2) A lien will be taken on the interest of the applicant in all land, easements, rights-of-way, water rights, water purchase contracts, water sales contracts, sewage treatment contracts and similar property rights, including leasehold interest, used, or to be used in connection with the facility whether owned at the time the loan is approved or acquired with loan funds. In unusual circumstances where it is not legally permissible or feasible to obtain a lien on such land (such as land rights obtained from Federal or local government agencies, and from railroads) and the approval official determines that the interest of RUS is otherwise adequately secured, the lien requirement may be omitted as to such land rights. For existing borrowers where the Agency already has a security position on real property, the approval official may determine that the interest of the Government is adequately secured and not require additional liens on such land rights. When the subsequent loan is approved or the acquisition of real property is subject to an outstanding lien indebtedness, the next highest priority lien obtainable will be taken if the approval official determines that the loan is adequately secured.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Joint financing security.</E> For projects utilizing joint financing, when adequate security of more than one type is available, the other lender may take one type of security with RUS taking another type. For projects utilizing joint financing with the same security to be shared by RUS and another lender, RUS will obtain at least a parity position with the other lender. A parity position is to ensure that with joint security, in the event of default, each lender will be affected on a proportionate basis. A parity position will conform with the following unless an exception is granted by the approval official:</P>
              <P>(1) It is not necessary for loans to have the same repayment terms. Loans made by other lenders involved in joint financing with RUS should be scheduled for repayment on terms similar to those customarily used in the State for financing such facilities.</P>
              <P>(2) The use of a trustee or other similar paying agent by the other lender in a joint financing arrangement is acceptable to RUS. A trustee or other similar paying agent will not normally be used for the RUS portion of the funding unless required to comply with State law. The responsibilities and authorities of any trustee or other similar paying agent on projects that include RUS funds must be clearly specified by written agreement and approved by the State program official and the Office of the General Counsel (OGC). RUS must be able to deal directly with the borrower to enforce the provisions of loan and grant agreements and perform necessary servicing actions.</P>
              <P>(3) In the event adequate funds are not available to meet regular installments on parity loans, the funds available will be apportioned to the lenders based on the respective current installments of principal and interest due.</P>
              <P>(4) Funds obtained from the sale or liquidation of secured property or fixed assets will be apportioned to the lenders on the basis of the pro rata amount outstanding; provided, however, funds obtained from such sale or liquidation for a project that included RUS grant funds will be apportioned as required by the grant agreement.</P>
              <P>(5) Protective advances must be charged to the borrower's account and be secured by a lien on the security property. To the extent consistent with State law and customary lending practices in the area, repayment of protective advances made by either lender, for the mutual protection of both lenders, should receive first priority in apportionment of funds between the lenders. To ensure agreement between lenders, efforts should be made to obtain the concurrence of both lenders before one lender makes a protective advance.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Health priorities.</E> The proposed project is:</P>
              <P>(1) Needed to alleviate an emergency situation, correct unanticipated diminution or deterioration of a water supply, or to meet Safe Drinking Water Act requirements which pertain to a water system—25 points;</P>
              <P>(2) Required to correct inadequacies of a wastewater disposal system, or to meet health standards which pertain to a wastewater disposal system—25 points;</P>
              <P>(3) Required to meet administrative orders issued to correct local, State, or Federal solid waste violations—15 points.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Median household income priorities.</E> The median household income of the population to be served by the proposed project is:</P>
              <P>(1) Less than the poverty line if the poverty line is less than 80% of the statewide nonmetropolitan median household income—30 points;</P>

              <P>(e) In certain cases the State program official may assign up to 15 points to a project. The points may be awarded to projects in order to improve compatibility and coordination between RUS's and other agencies' selection systems, to ensure effective RUS fund utilization, and to assist those projects that are the most cost effective. A written justification must be prepared and placed in the project file each time these points are assigned.<PRTPAGE P="301"/>
              </P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Cost overruns.</E> An application may receive consideration for funding before others at the State or National Office level when it is a subsequent request for a previously approved project which has encountered construction cost overruns. The cost overruns must be due to high bids or unexpected construction problems that cannot be reduced by negotiations, redesign, use of bid alternatives, rebidding or other means. Cost overruns exceeding 20% of the development cost at time of loan or grant approval or where the scope of the original purpose has changed will not be considered under this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">National office priorities.</E> In selecting projects for funding at the National Office level State program official points may or may not be considered. The Administrator may assign up to 15 additional points to account for items such as geographic distribution of funds, the highest priority projects within a state, and emergency conditions caused by economic problems or natural disasters. The Administrator may delegate the authority to assign the 15 points to appropriate National Office staff.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Allocation of program funds.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) The purpose of this part is to set forth the methodology and formulas by which the Administrator of the RUS allocates program funds to the States. (The term “State” means any of the States of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, or the Western Pacific Areas.)</P>
              <P>(2) The formulas in this part are used to allocate program loan and grant funds to Rural Development State offices so that the overall mission of the Agency can be carried out. Considerations used when developing the formulas include enabling legislation, congressional direction, and administration policies. Allocation formulas ensure that program resources are available on an equal basis to all eligible individuals and organizations.</P>
              <P>(3) The actual amounts of funds, as computed by the methodology and formulas contained herein, allocated to a State for a funding period, are distributed to each State office. The allocated amounts are available for review in any Rural Development State office.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Amount available for allocations.</E> Funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the Agency for use in authorized programs. On occasion, the allocation of funds to States may not be practical for a particular program due to funding or administrative constraints. In these cases, funds will be controlled by the National Office.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Basic formula criteria, data source and weight.</E> Basic formulas are used to calculate a basic State factor as a part of the methodology for allocating funds to the States. The formulas take a number of criteria that reflect the funding needs for a particular program and through a normalization and weighting process for each of the criteria calculate the basic State factor (SF). The data sources used for each criteria are believed to be the most current and reliable information that adequately quantifies the criterion. The weight, expressed as a percentage, gives a relative value to the importance of each of the criteria.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Basic formula allocation.</E> The result of multiplying the amount available for allocation less the total of any amounts held in reserve or distributed by base or administrative allocation times the basic State factor for each State. The basic formula allocation (BFA) for an individual State is equal to:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">BFA = (Amount available for allocation − NO reserve − total base and administrative allocations) × SF.</FP>
              
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Transition formula.</E> (i) A formula based on a proportional amount of previous year allocation used to maintain program continuity by preventing large fluctuations in individual State allocations. The transition formula limits allocation shifts to any particular State in the event of changes from year to year of the basic formula, the basic criteria, or the weights given the criteria. The transition formula first checks whether the current year's basic formula allocation is within the transition range (plus or minus 20 percentage points of the proportional amount of the previous year's BFA). The formula follows:</P>

              <P>(ii) If the current year's State BFA is not within the transition range in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, the State formula allocation is changed to the amount of the transition range limit closest to the BFA amount. After having performed this transition adjustment for each State, the sum of the funds allocated to all States will differ from the amount of funds available for BFA. This difference, whether a positive or negative amount, is distributed to all States receiving a formula allocation by multiplying the difference by the SF. The end result is the transition formula allocation. The transition range will not exceed 40% (plus or minus 20%), but when a smaller range is used it will be stated in the individual program section.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Base allocation.</E> An amount that may be allocated to each State dependent upon the particular program to provide the opportunity for funding at least one typical loan or grant in each Rural Development State office. The amount of the base allocation may be determined by criteria other than that used in the basic formula allocation such as Agency historic data.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Administrative allocations.</E> Allocations made by the Administrator in cases where basic formula criteria information is not available. This form of allocation may be used when the Administrator determines the program objectives cannot be adequately met with a formula allocation.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Reserve.</E> An amount retained under the National Office control for each loan and grant program to provide flexibility in meeting situations of unexpected or justifiable need occurring during the fiscal year. The Administrator may make distributions from this reserve to any State when it is determined necessary to meet a program need or Agency objective. The Administrator may retain additional amounts to fund authorized demonstration programs.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Pooling of funds.</E> A technique used to ensure that available funds are used in an effective, timely and efficient manner. At the time of pooling those funds within a State's allocation for the fiscal year or portion of the fiscal year, depending on the type of pooling, that have not been obligated by the State are placed in the National Office reserve. The Administrator will establish the pooling dates for each affected program.</P>
              <P>(i) Mid-year: Mid-year pooling occurs near the midpoint of the fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(ii) Year-end: Year-end pooling usually occurs near the first of August.</P>
              <P>(iii) Emergency: The Administrator may pool funds at any time that it is determined the conditions upon the initial allocation was based have changed to such a degree that it is necessary to pool funds in order to efficiently carry out the Agency mission.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Availability of the allocation.</E> Program funds are made available to the Agency on a quarterly basis.</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Suballocation by the Rural Development State Director.</E> The State Director may be directed or given the option of suballocating the State allocation to processing offices. When suballocating the State Director may retain a portion of the funds in a State office reserve to provide flexibility in situations of unexpected or justified need. When performing a suballocation the State Director will use the same formula, criteria and weights as used by the National Office.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Water and waste disposal loans and grants</E>—(1) <E T="03">Amount available for allocations.</E> See paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Basic formula criteria, data source and weight.</E> See paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) The criteria used in the basic formula are:</P>
              <P>(A) State's percentage of national rural population will be 50 percent.</P>
              <P>(B) State's percentage of national rural population with incomes below the poverty level will be 25 percent.</P>

              <P>(C) State's percentage of national nonmetropolitan unemployment will be 25 percent.<PRTPAGE P="303"/>
              </P>

              <P>(ii) The data sources for each criterion identified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section are specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section. Each criterion is assigned a specific weight according to its relevance in determining need. The percentage representing each criterion is multiplied by the weight factor and summed to arrive at a State factor (SF). The SF cannot exceed 0.05, as follows:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">SF = (criterion in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section × 50 percent) + (criterion in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) × 25 percent) + (criterion in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section × 25 percent)</FP>
              
              <P>(A) For the criterion specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the most recent decennial Census data.</P>
              <P>(B) For the criterion specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, 5-year income data from the American Community Survey (ACS) or, if needed, other Census Bureau data.</P>
              <P>(C) For the criterion specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section, the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Basic formula allocation.</E> See paragraph (b)(3) of this section. States receiving administrative allocations do not receive formula allocations.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Transition formula.</E> See paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The percentage range for the transition formula equals 30 percent (plus or minus 15%).</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Base allocation.</E> See paragraph (b)(5) of this section. States receiving administrative allocations do not receive base allocations.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Administrative allocation.</E> See paragraph (b)(6) of this section. States participating in the formula and base allocation procedures do not receive administrative allocations.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Reserve.</E> See paragraph (b)(7) of this section. Any State may request reserve funds by forwarding a request to the National Office. Generally, a request for additional funds will not be honored unless the State has insufficient funds to obligate the loan requested.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Pooling of funds.</E> See paragraph (b)(8) of this section. Funds are generally pooled at mid-year and year-end. Pooled funds will be placed in the National Office reserve and will be made available administratively.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Availability of the allocation.</E> See paragraph (b)(9) of this section. The allocation of funds is made available for States to obligate on an annual basis although the Office of Management and Budget apportions it to the Agency on a quarterly basis.</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Suballocation by the State Director.</E> See paragraph (b)(10) of this section. The State Director has the option to suballocate funds to processing offices.</P>

              <P>(a) Applicants are encouraged to contact the Agency processing office early in the planning stages of their project. Agency personnel are available to provide general advice and assistance regarding RUS programs, other funding sources, and types of systems or improvements appropriate for the applicants needs. The Agency can also provide access to technical assistance and other information resources for other project development issues such as public information, income surveys, developing rate schedules, system operation and maintenance, and environmental compliance requirements. Throughout the planning, application processing and construction of the project, Agency personnel will work closely and cooperatively with the applicant and their representatives, other State and Federal agencies and technical assistance providers.</P>
              <P>(b) The processing office will handle initial inquiries and provide basic information about the program. They are to provide the application, SF 424.2, “Application for Federal Assistance (For Construction),” assist applicants as needed in completing SF 424.2, and in filing a request for intergovernmental review. Federally recognized Indian tribes are exempt from intergovernmental review. The processing office will explain eligibility requirements and meet with the applicant whenever necessary to discuss application processing.</P>
              <P>(c) Applicants can make a written request for an eligibility determination in lieu of filing an SF 424.2 along with the information required by § 1780.33. Applicants seeking only an eligibility determination, should contact the processing office to obtain a list of the items needed to make this determination. An eligibility determination for loan or grant assistance will not give an applicant priority for funding as set forth in § 1780.17.</P>
              <P>(d) Applications that are not developed in a reasonable period of time taking into account the size and complexity of the proposed project may be removed from the State's active file. Applicants will be consulted prior to taking such action.</P>
              <P>(e) During the earliest discussion with prospective applicants, the Agency will advise prospective applicants on environmental review requirements and evaluation of potential environmental impacts of the proposal. In accordance with 7 CFR part 1970, environmental review requirements shall be performed by the applicant simultaneously and concurrently with the proposal's engineering planning and design.</P>

              <P>Review of the application will usually include the following:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Nondiscrimination.</E> Boundaries for the proposed service area must not be chosen in such a way that any user or area will be excluded because of race, color, religion, sex, marital status, age, handicap, or national origin. This does not preclude construction of the project in phases as noted in § 1780.11 as long as it is not done in a discriminatory manner.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Grant determination.</E> Grants will be determined by the processing office in accordance with the following provisions and will not result in EDU costs below similar system user cost.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Maximum grant.</E> Grants may not exceed the percentages in § 1780.10(c) of the eligible RUS project development costs listed in § 1780.9.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Debt service.</E> Applicants will be considered for grant assistance when the debt service portion of the average annual EDU cost, for users in the applicant's service area, exceeds the following percentages of median household income:</P>
              <P>(i) 0.5 percent when the median household income of the service area is equal to or below 80% of the statewide nonmetropolitan median income.</P>
              <P>(ii) 1.0 percent when the median household income of the service area exceeds the 0.5 percent requirement but is not more than 100 percent the statewide nonmetropolitan household income.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Similar system cost.</E> If the grant determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section results in an annual EDU cost that is not comparable with similar systems, the Agency will determine a grant amount based on achieving EDU costs that are not below similar system user costs.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Wholesale service.</E> When an applicant provides wholesale sales or services on a contract basis to another system or entity, similar wholesale system cost will be used in determining the amount of grant needed to achieve a reasonable wholesale user cost.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Subsidized cost.</E> When annual cost to the applicant for delivery of service is subsidized by either the state, commonwealth, or territory, and uniform flat user charges regardless of usage are imposed for similar classes of service throughout the service area, the Agency may proceed with a grant in an amount necessary to reduce such delivery cost to a reasonable level.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">User charges.</E> The user charges should be reasonable and produce enough revenue to provide for all costs of the facility after the project is complete. The planned revenue should be sufficient to provide for all debt service, debt reserve, operation and maintenance, and, if appropriate, additional revenue for facility replacement of short-lived assets without building a substantial surplus. Ordinarily, the total debt service reserve will be equal to one average annual loan installment which will accumulate at the rate of one-tenth of the total each year.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Lower scoring projects.</E> (1) In cases where preliminary cost estimates indicate that an eligible, high scoring application is unfeasible or would require an amount of funding from RUS that exceeds either 25 percent of a State's current annual allocation or an amount greater than that remaining in the State's allocation, the approval official may instead select the next lower scoring application for further processing provided the high scoring applicant is notified of this action and given an opportunity to revise the proposal and resubmit it.</P>
              <P>(2) If it is found that there is no effective way to reduce costs or no other funding sources, the approval official, after consultation with applicant, may submit a request for an additional allocation of funds for the proposed project to the National Office. The request should be submitted during the fiscal year in which obligation is anticipated. Such request will be considered along with all others on hand.

              <P>(ii) When project design services are procured separately, the selection of the engineer or architect shall be done by requesting qualification-based proposals and in accordance with this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) Applicants may procure engineering and architectural services in accordance with applicable State statutes or local requirements provided the State Director determines that such procurement meets the intent of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Other professional services.</E> Professional services of the following may be <PRTPAGE P="308"/>necessary: Attorney, bond counsel, accountant, auditor, appraiser, environmental professionals, and financial advisory or fiscal agent (if desired by applicant). Guidance on entering into an agreement for legal services is available from the Agency.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Bond counsel.</E> Unless otherwise provided by subpart D of this part, public bodies are required to obtain the service of recognized bond counsel in the preparation of evidence of indebtedness.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Contracts for other services.</E> Contracts or other forms of agreements for other services including management, operation, and maintenance will be developed by the applicant and presented to the Agency for review and concurrence. Guidance on entering into a management agreement is available from the Agency.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">User estimates.</E> Applicants dependent on users fees for debt payment or operation and maintenance expenses shall base their income and expense forecast on realistic user estimates. For users presently not receiving service, consideration must be given to the following:</P>
              <P>(1) An estimated number of maximum users should not be used when setting user fees and rates since it may be several years before all residents will need service by the system. In establishing rates a realistic number of users should be employed.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">New user cash contributions.</E> The amount of cash contributions required will be set by the applicant and concurred in by the approval official. Contributions should be an amount high enough to indicate sincere interest on the part of the potential user, but not so high as to preclude service to low income families. Contributions ordinarily should be an amount approximating one year's minimum user fee, and shall be paid in full before loan closing or commencement of construction, whichever occurs first. Once economic feasibility is ascertained based on a demonstration of potential user cash contributions, the contribution, membership fee or other fees that may be imposed are not a loan requirement under this section. A new user cash contribution is not required when:</P>
              <P>(i) The Agency determines that the potential users as a whole in the applicant's service area cannot make cash contributions; or</P>
              <P>(ii) State statutes or local ordinances require mandatory use of the system and the applicant or legal entity having such authority agrees in writing to enforce such statutes, or ordinances.</P>
              <P>(3) An enforceable user agreement with a penalty clause is required (RUS Bulletin 1780-9 can be used) except:</P>
              <P>(i) For users presently receiving service; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Where mandatory use of the system is required.</P>
              <P>(4) Individual vacant property owners will not be considered when determining project feasibility unless:</P>
              <P>(i) The owner has plans to develop the property in a reasonable period of time and become a user of the facility; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The owner agrees in writing to make a monthly payment at least equal to the proportionate share of debt service attributable to the vacant property until the property is developed and the facility is utilized on a regular basis. A bond or escrowed security deposit must be provided to guarantee this monthly payment and to guarantee an amount at least equal to the owner's proportionate share of construction costs. If a bond is provided, it must be executed by a surety company that appears on the Treasury Department's most current list (Circular 570, as amended) and be authorized to transact business in the State where the project is located. The guarantee shall be payable jointly to the borrower and the United States of America.</P>
              <P>(5) Applicants must provide a positive program to encourage connection by all users as soon as service is available. The program will be available for review and concurrence by the processing office before loan closing or commencement of construction, whichever occurs first. Such a program shall include:</P>

              <P>(i) An aggressive information program to be carried out during the construction period. The applicant should send written notification to all signed users in advance of the date service will be available, stating the date users <PRTPAGE P="309"/>will be expected to have their connections completed, and the date user charges will begin;</P>
              <P>(ii) Positive steps to assure that installation services will be available. These may be provided by the contractor installing the system, local plumbing companies, or local contractors;</P>
              <P>(iii) Aggressive action to see that all signed users can finance their connections.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Interim financing.</E> For all loans exceeding $500,000, where funds can be borrowed at reasonable interest rates on an interim basis from commercial sources for the construction period, such interim financing may be obtained so as to preclude the necessity for multiple advances of RUS loan funds. However, the approval official may make an exception when interim financing is cost prohibitive or unavailable. Guidance on informing the private lender of RUS's commitment is available from the Agency. When interim commercial financing is used, the application will be processed, including obtaining construction bids, to the stage where the RUS loan would normally be closed, that is immediately prior to the start of construction. The RUS loan should be closed as soon as possible after the disbursal of all interim funds.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Reserve requirements.</E> Provision for the accumulation of necessary reserves over a reasonable period of time will be included in the loan documents.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">General obligation or special assessment bonds.</E> Ordinarily, the requirements for reserves will be considered to have been met if general obligation or other bonds which pledge the full faith and credit of the political subdivision are used, or special assessment bonds are used, and if such bonds provide for the annual collection of sufficient taxes or assessments to cover debt service.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Other than general obligation or special assessment bonds.</E> Each borrower will be required to establish and maintain reserves sufficient to assure that loan installments will be paid on time, for emergency maintenance, for extensions to facilities, and for replacement of short-lived assets which have a useful life significantly less than the repayment period of the loan. Borrowers issuing bonds or other evidences of debt pledging facility revenues as security will plan their debt reserve to provide for at least one average annual loan installment. The debt reserve will accumulate at the rate of one-tenth of an average annual loan installment each year unless prohibited by state law.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Membership authorization.</E> For organizations other than public bodies, the membership will authorize the project and its financing. Form RD 1942-8, “Resolution of Members or Stockholders,” may be used for this authorization. The approval official may accept RUS Bulletin 1780-28, “Loan Resolution Security Agreement,” without such membership authorization when State statutes and the organization's charter and bylaws do not require such authorization; and</P>
              <P>(1) The organization is well established and is operating with a sound financial base; or</P>
              <P>(2) The members of the organization have all signed an enforceable user agreement with a penalty clause and have made the required meaningful user cash contribution.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Insurance.</E> The purpose of RUS's insurance requirements is to protect the government's financial interest based on the facility financed with loan funds. It is the responsibility of the applicant and not that of RUS to assure that adequate insurance and fidelity or employee dishonesty bond coverage is maintained. The requirements below apply to all types of coverage determined necessary. The approval official may grant exceptions to normal requirements when appropriate justification is provided establishing that it is in the best interest of the applicant and will not adversely affect the government's interest.</P>

              <P>(1) Insurance requirements proposed by the applicant will be accepted if the processing office determines that proposed coverage is adequate to protect the government's financial interest. Applicants are encouraged to have their attorney, consulting engineer, and/or insurance provider(s) review proposed types and amounts of coverage, including any deductible provisions.<PRTPAGE P="310"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The use of deductibles may be allowed by RUS providing the applicant has financial resources which would likely be adequate to cover potential claims requiring payment of the deductible.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Fidelity or employee dishonesty bonds.</E> Applicants will provide coverage for all persons who have access to funds, including persons working under a contract or management agreement. Coverage may be provided either for all individual positions or persons, or through “blanket” coverage providing protection for all appropriate employees. An exception may be granted by the approval official when funds relating to the facility financed are handled by another entity and it is determined that the entity has adequate coverage or the government's interest would otherwise be adequately protected. The amount of coverage required by RUS will normally approximate the total annual debt service requirements for the RUS loans.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Property insurance.</E> Fire and extended coverage will normally be maintained on all structures except as noted below. Ordinarily, RUS should be listed as mortgagee on the policy when RUS has a lien on the property. Normally, major items of equipment or machinery located in the insured structures must also be covered. Exceptions:</P>
              <P>(i) Reservoirs, pipelines and other structures if such structures are not normally insured;</P>
              <P>(ii) Subsurface lift stations except for the value of electrical and pumping equipment therein.</P>
              <P>(5) General liability insurance, including vehicular coverage.</P>
              <P>(6) Flood insurance required for facilities located in special flood-and mudslide-prone areas.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Worker's compensation.</E> The borrower will carry worker's compensation insurance for employees in accordance with State laws.</P>
              <P>(h) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(i) The processing office will assure that appropriate forms and documents listed in RUS Bulletin 1780-6 are complete. Letters of conditions will not be issued unless funds are available.</P>

              <P>(a) Applicants must provide evidence of adequate insurance and fidelity or employee dishonesty bond coverage.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Verification of users and other funds.</E> In connection with a project <PRTPAGE P="311"/>that involves new users and will be secured by a pledge of user fees or revenues, the processing office will authenticate the number of users. Ordinarily each signed user agreement will be reviewed and checked for evidence of cash contributions. If during the review any indication is received that all signed users may not connect to the system, there will be such additional investigation made as deemed necessary to determine the number of users who will connect to the system.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Initial compliance review.</E> An initial compliance review should be completed under subpart E of part 1901 of this title.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Applicant contribution.</E> An applicant contributing funds toward the project cost shall deposit these funds in its project account before start of construction. Project costs paid with applicant funds prior to the required deposit time shall be appropriately accounted for.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Excess RUS loan and grant funds.</E> If there is a significant reduction in project cost, the applicant's funding needs will be reassessed. Decreases in RUS funds will be based on revised project costs and current number of users, however, other factors including RUS regulations used at the time of loan or grant approval will remain the same. Obligated loan or grant funds not needed to complete the proposed project will be deobligated. Any reduction will be applied to grant funds first. In such cases, applicable forms, the letter of conditions, and other items will be revised.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Evidence of and disbursement of other funds.</E> Applicants expecting funds from other sources for use in completing projects being partially financed with RUS funds will present evidence of the commitment of these funds from such other sources. An agreement should be reached with all funding sources on how funds are to be disbursed before the start of construction. RUS funds will not be used to pre-finance funds committed to the project from other sources.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Acquisition of land, easements, water rights, and existing facilities.</E> Applicants are responsible for acquisition of all property rights necessary for the project and will determine that prices paid are reasonable and fair. RUS may require an appraisal by an independent appraiser or Agency employee.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Rights-of-way and easements.</E> Applicants will obtain valid, continuous and adequate rights-of-way and easements needed for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the facility.</P>
              <P>(i) The applicant must provide a legal opinion relative to the title to rights-of-way and easements. Form RD 442-22, “Opinion of Counsel Relative to Rights-of-Way,” may be used. When a site is for major structures such as a reservoir or pumping station and the applicant is able to obtain only a right-of-way or easement on such a site rather than a fee simple title, the applicant will furnish a title report thereon by the applicant's attorney showing ownership of the land and all mortgages or other lien defects, restrictions, or encumbrances, if any.</P>
              <P>(ii) For user connections funded by RUS, applicants will obtain adequate rights to construct and maintain the connection line or other facilities located on the user's property. This right may be obtained through formal easement or user agreements.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Title for land or existing facilities.</E> Title to land essential to the successful operation of facilities or title to facilities being purchased, must not contain any restrictions that will adversely affect the suitability, successful operation, security value, or transferability of the facility. Preliminary and final title opinions must be provided by the applicant's attorney. The opinions must be in sufficient detail to assess marketability of the property. Form RD 1927-9, “Preliminary Title Opinion,” and Form RD 1927-10, “Final Title Opinion,” may be used to provide the required title opinions.</P>

              <P>(i) In lieu of receiving title opinions from the applicant's attorney, the applicant may use a title insurance company. If a title insurance company is used, the applicant must provide the Agency a title insurance binder, disclosing all title defects or restrictions, and include a commitment to issue a title insurance policy. The policy should be in an amount at least equal to the market value of the property as improved. The title insurance binder and commitment should be provided to <PRTPAGE P="312"/>the Agency prior to requesting closing instructions. The Agency will be provided a title insurance policy which will insure RUS's interest in the property without any title defects or restrictions which have not been waived by the Agency.</P>
              <P>(ii) The approval official may waive title defects or restrictions, such as utility easements, that do not adversely affect the suitability, successful operation, security value, or transferability of the facility.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Water rights.</E> The following will be furnished as applicable:</P>
              <P>(i) A statement by the applicant's attorney regarding the nature of the water rights owned or to be acquired by the applicant (such as conveyance of title, appropriation and decree, application and permit, public notice and appropriation and use).</P>
              <P>(ii) A copy of a contract with another company or municipality to supply water; or stock certificates in another company which represents the right to receive water.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Lease agreements.</E> Where the right of use or control of real property not owned by the applicant is essential to the successful operation of the facility during the life of the loan, such right will be evidenced by written agreements or contracts between the owner of the property and the applicant. Lease agreements shall not contain provisions for restricted use of the site of facility, forfeiture or summary cancellation clauses. Lease agreements shall provide for the right to transfer, encumber, assign and sub-lease without restriction. Lease agreements will ordinarily be written for a term at least equal to the term of the loan. Such lease contracts or agreements will be approved by the approval official with the advice and counsel of OGC, as necessary.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Obtaining loan closing instructions.</E> The information required by OGC will be transmitted to OGC with request for closing instructions. Upon receipt of closing instructions, the processing office will discuss with the applicant and its engineer, attorney, and other appropriate representatives, the requirements contained therein and any actions necessary to proceed with closing. State program officials have the option to work with OGC to obtain waivers for closing instructions in certain cases. Closing instructions are not required for grants.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Loan and grant closing and delivery of funds.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Loan closing.</E> Notes and bonds will be completed on the date of loan closing except for the entry of subsequent RUS multiple advances where applicable. The amount of each note will be in multiples of not less than $100. The amount of each bond will ordinarily be in multiples of not less than $1,000.</P>
              <P>(1) Form RD 440-22, “Promissory Note (Association or Organization),” will ordinarily be used for loans to nonpublic bodies.</P>
              <P>(2) RUS Bulletins 1780-27, “Loan Resolution (Public Bodies),” or 1780-28, “Loan Resolution Security Agreement,” will be adopted by public and other-than-public bodies. These resolutions supplement other provisions in this part.</P>
              <P>(3) Subpart D of this part contains instructions for preparation of notes and bonds evidencing indebtedness of public bodies.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Loan disbursement.</E> (1) Multiple advances. Multiple advances will be used only for loans in excess of $100,000. Advances will be made only as needed to cover disbursements required by the borrower over a 30-day period.</P>
              <P>(i) Subpart D of this part contains instructions for making multiple advances to public bodies.</P>
              <P>(ii) Advances will be requested by the borrower in writing. The request should be in sufficient amounts to pay cost of construction, rights-of-way and land, legal, engineering, interest, and other expenses as needed. The borrower may use Form RD 440-11, “Estimate of Funds Needed for 30 Day Period Commencing XXX,” to show the amount of funds needed during the 30-day period.</P>

              <P>(2) RUS loan funds obligated for a specific purpose, such as the paying of interest, but not needed at the time of loan closing will remain in the Finance Office until needed unless State statutes require all funds to be delivered to the borrower at the time of closing. Loan funds may be advanced to prepay costs under § 1780.9 (e)(2)(iv). If all funds must be delivered to the borrower at <PRTPAGE P="313"/>the time of closing to comply with State statutes, funds not needed at loan closing will be handled as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Deposited in an appropriate borrower account, such as debt service or construction accounts; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Deposited in a joint bank account under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Grant closing.</E> RUS Bulletin 1780-12 “Water or Waste System Grant Agreement” of this part will be completed and executed in accordance with the requirements of grant approval. The grant will be considered closed when RUS Bulletin 1780-12 has been properly executed. Processing or approval officials are authorized to sign the grant agreement on behalf of RUS. For grants that supplement RUS loan funds, the grant should be closed simultaneously with the closing of the loan. However, when grant funds will be disbursed before loan closing, as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the grant will be closed not later than the delivery date of the first advance of grant funds.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Grant disbursements.</E> RUS policy is not to disburse grant funds from the Treasury until they are actually needed by the applicant. Applicant funds will be disbursed before the disbursal of any RUS grant funds. RUS loan funds will be disbursed before the disbursal of any RUS grant funds except when:</P>
              <P>(1) Interim financing of the total estimated amount of loan funds needed during construction is arranged; and</P>
              <P>(2) All interim funds have been disbursed; and</P>
              <P>(3) RUS grant funds are needed before the RUS loan can be closed.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Use and accountability of funds.</E> (1) Arrangements will be agreed upon for the prior concurrence by the Agency of the bills or vouchers upon which warrants will be drawn. Form RD 402-2, “Statement of Deposits and Withdrawals,” or similar form will be used by the Agency to monitor funds. Periodic reviews of these accounts shall be made by the Agency.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Pledge of collateral for grants to nonprofit organizations.</E> Grant funds must be deposited in a bank with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance coverage. Also, if the balance in the account containing grant funds exceeds the FDIC insurance coverage, the excess amount must be collaterally secured. The pledge of collateral for the excess will be in accordance with Treasury Circular 176.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Joint RUS/borrower bank account.</E> RUS funds and any funds furnished by the borrower including contributions to purchase major items of equipment, machinery, and furnishings will be deposited in a joint RUS/borrower bank account if determined necessary by the approval official. When RUS has a Memorandum of Understanding with another agency that provides for the use of joint RUS/borrower accounts, or when RUS is the primary source of funds for a project and has determined that the use of a joint RUS/borrower bank account is necessary, project funds from other sources may also be deposited in the joint bank account. RUS shall not be accountable to the source of the other funds nor shall RUS undertake responsibility to administer the funding program of the other entity. Joint RUS/borrower bank accounts should not be used for funds advanced by an interim lender. When funds exceeds the FDIC insurance coverage, the excess must have a pledge of collateral in accordance with Treasury Circular 176.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Payment for project costs.</E> Project costs will be monitored by the RUS processing office. Invoices will be approved by the borrower and their engineer, as appropriate, and submitted to the processing office for concurrence. The review and acceptance of project costs, including construction pay estimates, by RUS does not attest to the correctness of the amounts, the quantities shown or that the work has been performed under the terms of the agreements or contracts.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Use of remaining funds.</E> Funds remaining after all costs incident to the basic project have been paid or provided for will not include applicant contributions. Funds remaining, may be considered in direct proportion to the amounts obtained from each source. Remaining funds will be handled as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) Remaining funds may be used for eligible loan or grant purposes, provided the use will not result in major <PRTPAGE P="314"/>changes to the facility(s) and the purpose of the loan and grant remains the same;</P>
              <P>(2) RUS loan funds that are not needed will be applied as an extra payment on the RUS indebtedness unless other disposition is required by the bond ordinance, resolution, or State statute; and</P>
              <P>(3) Grant funds not expended under paragraph (f)(1) of this section will be canceled. Prior to the actual cancellation, the borrower, its attorney and its engineer will be notified of RUS's intent to cancel the remaining funds.

              <SUBJECT>Borrower accounting methods, management reporting and audits.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Borrowers are required to provide RUS an annual audit or financial statements.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Method of accounting and preparation of financial statements.</E> Annual organization-wide financial statements must be prepared on the accrual basis of accounting, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), unless State statutes or regulatory agencies provide otherwise, or an exception is granted by the Agency. An organization may maintain its accounting records on a basis other than accrual accounting, and make the necessary adjustments so that annual financial statements are presented on the accrual basis.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Record retention.</E> Each borrower shall retain all records, books, and supporting material for 3 years after the issuance of the audit or management reports. Upon request, this material will be made available to RUS, Office of the Inspector General (OIG), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Comptroller General, or to their assignees.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Audits.</E> All audits are to be performed in accordance with the latest revision of the generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS), issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. In addition, the audits are also to be performed in accordance with subpart F of 2 CFR part 200, as adopted by USDA through 2 CFR part 400. The type of audit each borrower is required to submit will be designated by RUS. Further guidance on preparing an acceptable audit can be obtained from RUS. It is not intended that audits required by this part be separate and apart from audits performed in accordance with State and local laws. To the extent feasible, the audit work should be done in conjunction with those audits. Audits must be performed annually except as allowed under the provisions for biennial audits provided in subpart F of 2 CFR part 200. Audits are to be submitted to the processing office as soon as possible after receipt of the auditor's report but no later than nine months after the end of the audit period</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Borrowers exempt from audits.</E> All borrowers who are exempt from audits, will, within 60 days following the end of each fiscal year, furnish the RUS with annual financial statements, consisting of a verification of the organization's balance sheet and statement of income and expense by an appropriate official of the organization. Forms RD 442-2, “Statement of Budget, Income and Equity,” and 442-3 may be used.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Management reports.</E> These reports will furnish management with a means of evaluating prior decisions and serve as a basis for planning future operations and financial strategies. In those cases where revenues from multiple sources are pledged as security for an RUS loan, two reports will be required; one for the project being financed by RUS and one combining the entire operation of the borrower. In those cases where RUS loans are secured by general obligation bonds or assessments and the borrower combines revenues from all sources, one management report combining all such revenues is acceptable. The following management data will be submitted by the borrower to the processing office. <PRTPAGE P="315"/>These reports at a minimum will include a balance sheet and income and expense statement.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Quarterly reports.</E> A quarterly management report will be required for the first year for new borrowers and for all borrowers experiencing financial or management problems for one year from the date problems were noted. If the borrower's account is current at the end of the year, the processing office may waive the required reports.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Annual management reports.</E> Prior to the beginning of each fiscal year the following will be submitted to the processing office. (If Form RD 442-2 is used as the annual management report, enter data in column three only of Schedule 1, and complete all of Schedule 2.)</P>
              <P>(i) Two copies of the management reports and proposed “Annual Budget”.</P>
              <P>(ii) Financial information may be reported on Form RD 442-2 which includes Schedule 1, “Statement of Budget, Income and Equity” and Schedule 2, “Projected Cash Flow” or information in similar format.</P>
              <P>(iii) A copy of the rate schedule in effect at the time of submission.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Substitute for management reports.</E> When RUS loans are secured by the general obligation of the public body or tax assessments which total 100 percent of the debt service requirements, the State program official may authorize an annual audit to substitute for other management reports if the audit is received within nine months after the end of the audit period.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Regional commission grants.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Grants are sometimes made by regional commissions for projects eligible for RUS assistance. RUS has agreed to administer such funds in a manner similar to administering RUS assistance.</P>
              <P>(a) When RUS has funds in the project, no charge will be made for administering regional commission funds.</P>
              <P>(b) When RUS has no loan or grant funds in the project, an administrative charge will be made pursuant to the Economy Act of 1932 (31 U.C.S. 1535). A fee of 5 percent of the first $100,000 of a regional commission grant and 1 percent of any amount over $100,000 will be paid to RUS by the commission.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC).</E> RUS Bulletin 1780-23 will be followed in determining the responsibilities of RUS. The ARC Federal Co-chairman and the State program official will provide each other with the necessary notification and certification.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Other regional commissions.</E> Title V of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3121 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) authorizes other commissions similar to ARC. RUS Bulletin 1780-23 will be used to develop a separate project management agreement between RUS and the commission for each project. The agreement should be prepared by the State program official as soon as notification is received that a commission grant will be made and the amount is confirmed.</P>
              <P>(c) Regional commission grants should be obligated as soon as possible in accordance with § 1780.41, except that the announcement procedure referred to in RUS Staff Instruction 1780-2 is not applicable. Regional commission grants will be disbursed from the Finance Office in the same manner as RUS funds.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Utility purchase contracts.</SUBJECT>

              <P>Applicants proposing to purchase water or other utility service from private or public sources shall have written contracts for supply or service which are reviewed and concurred in by the Agency. To the extent practical, the Agency review and concurrence of such contracts should take place prior to their execution by the owner. OGC advice and guidance may be requested. Form RD 442-30, “Water Purchase Contract,” may be used when appropriate. If the Agency loan will be repaid from system revenues, the contract will be <PRTPAGE P="318"/>pledged to the Agency as part of the security for the loan. Such contracts will:</P>
              <P>(a) Include a commitment by the supplier to furnish, at a specified point, an adequate quantity of water or other service and provide that, in case of shortages, all of the supplier's users will proportionately share shortages.</P>
              <P>(b) Set out the ownership and maintenance responsibilities of the respective parties including the master meter if a meter is installed at the point of delivery.</P>
              <P>(c) Specify the initial rates and provide a type of escalator clause which will permit rates for the association to be raised or lowered proportionately as certain specified rates for the supplier's regular customers are raised or lowered. Provisions may be made for altering rates in accordance with the decisions of the appropriate State agency which may have regulatory authority.</P>
              <P>(d) Cover period of time which is at least equal to the repayment period of the loan. State program officials may approve contracts for shorter periods of time if the supplier cannot legally contract for such period, or if the owner and supplier find it impossible or impractical to negotiate a contract for the maximum period permissible under State law, provided:</P>
              <P>(1) The supplier is subject to regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or other Federal or State agency whose jurisdiction can be expected to prevent unwarranted curtailment of supply; or</P>
              <P>(2) The contract contains adequate provisions for renewal; or</P>
              <P>(3) A determination is made that in the event the contract is terminated, there are or will be other adequate sources available to the owner that can feasibly be developed or purchased.</P>
              <P>(e) Set out in detail the amount of connection or demand charges, if any, to be made by the supplier as a condition to making the service available to the owner. However, the payment of such charges from loan funds shall not be approved unless the Agency determines that it is more feasible and economical for the owner to pay such a connection charge than it is for the owner to provide the necessary supply by other means.</P>
              <P>(f) Provide for a pledge of the contract to the Agency as part of the security for the loan.</P>
              <P>(g) Not contain provisions for:</P>
              <P>(1) Construction of facilities which will be owned by the supplier. This does not preclude the use of money paid as a connection charge for construction to be done by the supplier.</P>
              <P>(2) Options for the future sale or transfer. This does not preclude an agreement recognizing that the supplier and owner may at some future date agree to a sale of all or a portion of the facility.</P>
              <P>(h) If it is impossible to obtain a firm commitment for either an adequate quantity or sharing shortages proportionately, a contract may be executed and concurred in provided adequate evidence is furnished to enable the Agency to make a determination that the supplier has adequate supply and/or treatment facilities to furnish its other users and the applicant for the foreseeable future; and:</P>
              <P>(1) The supplier is subject to regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or other Federal or State agency whose jurisdiction can be expected to prevent unwarranted curtailment of supply; or</P>
              <P>(2) A suitable alternative supply could be arranged within the repayment ability of the borrower if it should become necessary; or</P>
              <P>(3) Concurrence in the proposed contract is obtained from the National Office.</P>

              <P>Owner's procurement requirements must comply with the following standards:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Code of conduct.</E> Owners shall maintain a written code or standards of conduct which shall govern the performance of their officers, employees or agents engaged in the award and administration of contracts supported by Agency funds. No employee, officer or agent of the owner shall participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by Agency funds if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be involved. Examples of such conflicts would arise when: the employee, officer or agent; any member of their immediate family; their partner; or an organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of the above; has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for the award.</P>
              <P>(1) The owner's officers, employees or agents shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to subagreements.</P>
              <P>(2) To the extent permitted by State or local law or regulations, the owner's standards of conduct shall provide for penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of such standards by the owner's officers, employees, agents, or by contractors or their agents.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Maximum open and free competition.</E> All procurement transactions, regardless of whether by sealed bids or by negotiation and without regard to dollar value, shall be conducted in a manner that provides maximum open and free competition. Procurement procedures shall not restrict or eliminate competition. Examples of what are considered to be restrictive of competition include, but are not limited to: placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to qualify to do business; noncompetitive practices between firms; organizational conflicts of interest; and unnecessary experience and bonding requirements. In specifying materials, the owner and its consultant will consider all materials normally suitable for the project commensurate with sound engineering practices and project requirements. The Agency shall consider fully any recommendation made by the owner concerning the technical design and choice of materials to be used for a facility. If the Agency determines that a design or material, other than those that were recommended should be considered by including them in the procurement process as an acceptable design or material in the water or waste disposal facility, the Agency shall provide such owner with a comprehensive justification for such a determination. The justification will be documented in writing.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Owner's review.</E> Proposed procurement actions shall be reviewed by the owner's officials to avoid the purchase of unnecessary or duplicate items. Consideration should be given to consolidation or separation of procurement items to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an analysis shall be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any other appropriate analysis to determine which approach <PRTPAGE P="320"/>would be the most economical. To foster greater economy and efficiency, owners are encouraged to enter into State and local intergovernmental agreements for procurement or use of common goods and services.</P>

Work in excess of the standard work week is permissible provided that the worker is compensated at a rate of not less than one and a half times the basic rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in the work week. The requirements of 40 U.S.C. 3704 are applicable to construction work and provide that no laborer or mechanic must be required to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous. These requirements do not apply to the purchases of supplies or materials or articles ordinarily available on the open market.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Debarment and suspension.</E> A contract award (see 2 CFR 180.220) must not be made to parties listed on the governmentwide exclusions in the System for Award Management (SAM), in accordance with the OMB guidelines at 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by 2 CFR part 417, “Debarment and Suspension.” SAM exclusion records contain the names of parties debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded by agencies, as well as parties declared ineligible under statutory or regulatory authority other than Executive Order 12549.</P>

Each tier certifies to the tier above that it will not and has not used Federal appropriated funds to pay any person or organization for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a member of Congress, officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress in connection with obtaining any Federal contract, grant or any other award covered by 31 U.S.C. 1352. Each tier must also disclose any lobbying with non-Federal funds that takes place in connection with obtaining any Federal award. Such disclosures are forwarded from tier to tier up to the non-Federal award.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Permanent instruments for Agency loans.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Agency loans will be evidenced by an instrument determined legally sufficient and in accordance with the following order of preference:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">First preference—Form RD 440-22, “Promissory Note”.</E> Refer to paragraph (b) of this section for methods of various frequency payment calculations.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Second preference—single instruments with amortized installments.</E> A single instrument providing for amortized installments which follows Form RD 440-22 as closely as possible. The full amount of the loan must show on the face of the instrument, and there must be provisions for entering the date and amount of each advance on the reverse or an attachment. When principal payments are deferred, the instrument will show that “interest only” is due on interest-only installment dates, rather than specific dollar amounts. The payment period including the “interest only” installment cannot exceed 40 years, the useful life of the facility, or State statute limitations, whichever occurs first. The amortized installment, computed as follows, will be shown as due on installment dates thereafter.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Monthly payments.</E> Multiply by twelve the number of years between the due date of the last interest-only installment and the final installment to determine the number of monthly payments. When there are no interest-only installments, multiply by twelve the number of years over which the loan is amortized. Then multiply the loan amount by the amortization factor and round to the next higher dollar.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Semiannual payments.</E> Multiply by two the number of years between the due date of the last interest-only installment and the due date of the final installment to determine the correct number of semiannual periods. When there are no interest-only installments, multiply by two the number of years over which the loan is amortized. Then multiply the loan amount by the applicable amortization factor.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Annual payments.</E> Subtract the due date of the last interest-only installment from the due date of the final installment to determine the number of annual payments. When there are no interest-only installments, the number of annual payments will equal the number of years over which the loan is amortized. Then multiply the loan amount by the applicable amortization factor and round to the next higher dollar.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Third preference—single instruments with installments of principal plus interest.</E> If a single instrument with amortized installments is not legally permissible, use a single instrument providing for installments of principal plus interest accrued on the principal balance. For bonds with semiannual interest and annual principal, the interest is calculated by multiplying the principal balance times the interest rate and dividing this figure by two. <PRTPAGE P="326"/>Principal installments are to be scheduled so that total combined interest and principal payments closely approximate amortized payments.</P>
              <P>(1) The repayment terms concerning interest only installments described in paragraph (b) of this section apply.</P>
              <P>(2) The instrument shall contain in substance provisions indicating:</P>
              <P>(i) Principal maturities and due dates;</P>
              <P>(ii) Regular payments shall be applied first to interest due through the next principal and interest installment due date and then to principal due in chronological order stipulated in the bond; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Payments on delinquent accounts will be applied in the following sequence:</P>
              <P>(A) Billed delinquent interest;</P>
              <P>(B) Past due interest installments;</P>
              <P>(C) Past due principal installments;</P>
              <P>(D) Interest installment due; and</P>
              <P>(E) Principal installment due.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Fourth preference—serial bonds with installments of principal plus interest.</E> If instruments described under the first, second, and third preferences are not legally permissible, use serial bonds with a bond or bonds delivered in the amount of each advance. Bonds will be numbered consecutively and delivered in chronological order. Such bonds will conform to the minimum requirements of § 1780.94. Provisions for application of payments will be the same as those set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Coupon bonds.</E> Coupon bonds will not be used unless required by State statute. Such bonds will conform to the minimum requirements of § 1780.94.</P>

              <P>When none of the instruments described in § 1780.87 are legally permissible or practical, a bond anticipation note or similar temporary debt instrument may be used. The debt instrument will provide for multiple advances of Agency funds and will be for the full amount of the Agency loan. The instrument will be prepared by bond counsel, or local counsel if bond counsel is not involved, and approved by the State program official and OGC. At the same time the Agency delivers the last advance, the borrower will deliver the permanent bond instrument and the canceled temporary instrument will be returned to the borrower. The approved debt instrument will show at least the following:</P>
              <P>(a) The date from which each advance will bear interest;</P>
              <P>(b) The interest rate as determined by § 1780.13;</P>
              <P>(c) A payment schedule providing for interest on outstanding principal at least annually; and</P>
              <P>(d) A maturity date which shall be no earlier than the anticipated issuance date of the permanent instruments and no longer than the 40-year statutory limit.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Minimum bond specifications.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The provisions of this section are minimum specifications only and must be followed to the extent legally permissible.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Type and denominations.</E> Bond resolutions or ordinances will provide that the instruments be either a bond representing the total amount of the indebtedness or serial bonds in denominations customarily accepted in municipal financing (ordinarily in multiples of not less than $1,000). Single bonds may provide for repayment of principal plus interest or amortized installments. Amortized installments are preferred by the Agency.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Bond registration.</E> Bonds will contain provisions permitting registration for both principal and interest. Bonds <PRTPAGE P="327"/>purchased by the Agency will be registered in the name of “United States of America” and will remain so registered at all times while the bonds are held or insured by the Government. The Agency address for registration purposes will be that of the Finance Office.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Size and quality.</E> Size of bonds and coupons should conform to standard practice. Paper must be of sufficient quality to prevent deterioration through ordinary handling over the life of the loan.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Date of bond.</E> Bonds will normally be dated as of the day of delivery. However, the borrower may use another date if approved by the Agency. Loan closing is the date of delivery of the bonds or the date of delivery of the first bond when utilizing serial bonds, regardless of the date of delivery of the funds. The date of delivery will be stated in the bond if different from the date of the bond. In all cases, interest will accrue from the date of delivery of the funds.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Payment date.</E> Loan payments will be scheduled to coincide with income availability and be in accordance with State law.</P>
              <P>(1) If income is available monthly, monthly payments are recommended unless precluded by State law. If income is available quarterly or otherwise more frequently than annually, payments must be scheduled on such basis. However, if State law only permits principal plus interest (P&amp;I) type bonds, annual or semiannual payments will be used.</P>
              <P>(2) The payment schedule will be enumerated in the evidence of debt, or if that is not feasible, in a supplemental agreement.</P>
              <P>(3) If feasible, the first payment will be scheduled one full month, or other period, as appropriate, from the date of loan closing or any deferment period. Due dates falling on the 29th, 30th, and 31st day of the month will be avoided. When principal payments are deferred, interest-only payments will be scheduled at least annually.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Extra payments.</E> Extra payments are derived from the sale of basic chattel or real estate security, refund of unused loan funds, cash proceeds of property insurance and similar actions which reduce the value of basic security. At the option of the borrower, regular facility revenue may also be used as extra payments when regular payments are current. Unless otherwise established in the note or bond, extra payments will be applied as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) For loans with amortized debt instruments, extra payments will be applied first to interest accrued to the date of receipt of the payment and second to principal.</P>
              <P>(2) For loans with debt instruments with P&amp;I installments, the extra payment will be applied to the final unpaid principal installment.</P>
              <P>(3) For borrowers with more than one loan, the extra payment will be applied to the account secured by the lowest priority of lien on the property from which the extra payments was obtained. Any balance will be applied to other Agency loans secured by the property from which the extra payment was obtained.</P>
              <P>(4) For assessment bonds, see paragraph (k) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) The place of payments on bonds purchased by the Agency will be determined by the Agency.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Redemptions.</E> Bonds will normally contain customary redemption provisions. However, no premium will be charged for early redemption on any bonds held by the Government.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Additional revenue bonds.</E> Parity bonds may be issued to complete the project. Otherwise, parity bonds may not be issued unless acceptable documentation is provided establishing that net revenues for the fiscal year following the year in which such bonds are to be issued will be at least 120 percent of the average annual debt serviced requirements on all bonds outstanding, including the newly-issued bonds. For purposes of this section, net revenues are, unless otherwise defined by State statute, gross revenues less essential operation and maintenance expenses. This limitation may be waived or modified by the written consent of bondholders representing 75 percent of the then-outstanding principal indebtedness. Junior and subordinate bonds may be issued in accordance with the loan resolution.<PRTPAGE P="328"/>
              </P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Precautions.</E> The following types of provisions in debt instruments should be avoided:</P>
              <P>(1) Provisions for the holder to manually post each payment to the instrument.</P>
              <P>(2) Provisions for returning the permanent or temporary debt instrument to the borrower in order that it, rather than the Agency, may post the date and amount of each advance or repayment on the instrument.</P>
              <P>(3) Provisions that amend covenants contained in RUS Bulletins 1780-27 or 1780-28.</P>
              <P>(4) Defeasance provisions in loan or bond resolutions. When a bond issue is defeased, a new issue is sold which supersedes the contractual provisions of the prior issue, including the refinancing requirement and any lien on revenues. Since defeasance in effect precludes the Agency from requiring refinancing before the final maturity date, it represents a violation of the statutory refinancing requirement; therefore, it is disallowed. No loan documents shall include a provision of defeasance.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Assessment bonds.</E> When security includes special assessment to be collected over the life of the loan, the instrument should address the method of applying any payments made before they are due. It may be desirable for such payments to be distributed over remaining payments due, rather than to be applied in accordance with normal procedures governing extra payments, so that the account does not become delinquent.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Multiple debt instruments.</E> The following will be adhered to when preparing debt instruments:</P>
              <P>(1) When more than one loan type is used in financing a project, each type of loan will be evidenced by a separate debt instrument or series of debt instruments;</P>
              <P>(2) Loans obligated in different fiscal years and those obligated with different terms in the same fiscal year will be evidenced by separate debt instruments;</P>
              <P>(3) Loans obligated for the same loan type in the same fiscal year with the same term may be combined in the same debt instrument;</P>
              <P>(4) Loans obligated in the same fiscal year with different interest rates that will be closed at the same interest rate may be combined in the same debt instrument.</P>

            <P>(a) Rural Utilities Service (RUS), is an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture established pursuant to section 232 of the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-354, 108 Stat. 3178). Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), is an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture established pursuant to section 232 of the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-354, 108 Stat. 3178), successor to the Soil Conservation Service. RUS will make WS and RCD loans available to sponsoring local public bodies, agencies, and nonprofit organizations to assist them in obtaining the local cost of WS works of improvement and RCD measures. Any processing or servicing activity conducted pursuant to this part involving authorized assistance to RUS employees, members of their families, known close relatives, or business or close personal associates, is subject to the provisions of subpart D of part 1900 of this title. Applicants for this assistance are required to identify any known relationship or association with an RUS employee. RUS will assist the local sponsors and the NRCS in making loans from NRCS construction funds as WS advances when needed for the development of future water supplies or for site preservation.</P>
            <P>(b) Rural Development State and local offices will administer these programs on behalf of RUS and will coordinate application processing with the NRCS and other appropriate State and Federal agencies.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Authorities, responsibilities, and delegation of authority.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) NRCS provides technical and financial assistance to sponsoring local organizations for developing WS and RCD area plans and for individual RCD measures or projects and watershed works of improvement. The watershed work plan for developing, operating, and maintaining watershed works of improvement must be agreed upon by sponsoring local organizations and NRCS. When approved, it is the basis for extending technical and cost sharing assistance from watershed funds. The RCD area plan is prepared for the development of the RCD area by sponsoring local organizations with assistance from NRCS and other agencies, endorsed by the Governor or by the agency designated by the Governor, and accepted by the Secretary of Agriculture or his delegate. It includes objectives, planned courses of action, and RCD measures or projects to be developed. It is amended as necessary to include continuing activities and needs in the RCD area.</P>

            <P>(b) RUS receives and processes applications for WS loans and NRCS WS advances and RCD loans and makes and services such loan and advances. WS loans are made by RUS from either Public Law 534 (78th Cong.) funds authorized in the Flood Control Act of 1944 (33 U.S.C. 701 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) or Public Law 566 (83rd Cong.) funds authorized in the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act of 1954 (68 Stat. 666) to cover a part or all of the local cost for a watershed work of improvement.</P>
            <P>(c) WS loans and WS advances may be made to project sponsors in watershed project areas for which:</P>
            <P>(1) A watershed work plan has been approved administratively or by resolutions adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry of the Senate and by the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives; and</P>

            <P>(2) Federal assistance has been authorized for the installation of works of improvement by the Administrator of NRCS.<PRTPAGE P="330"/>
            </P>
            <P>(d) RCD loans may be made in areas authorized for RCD program assistance by the Secretary of Agriculture and for which an RCD plan design or area plan has been accepted by the State NRCS Conservationist.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Delegation of authority.</E> The Rural Development State Director is authorized to approve WS and RCD loans subject to limitations in RUS Staff Instruction 1780-1 and conditions of this part. The Rural Development State Director is authorized to relegate authority in accordance with this part to the Chief, Community Programs; or other members of the State Office staff.</P>
            <P>(f) NRCS is responsible for providing technical and financial assistance to sponsoring local organizations for planning and developing WS and RCD areas. This includes development of WS and RCD plans and WS works of improvement and RCD measures or projects.</P>
            <P>(g) RUS is responsible for making and servicing WS loans and advances and RCD loans.</P>
            <P>(h) The NRCS-RUS Agreements in RUS Bulletin's 1781 and 1781-2 include further responsibilities and functions of NRCS and RUS in WS and RCD areas.</P>

            <P>(i) Interest will begin for a future water supply as required by State law, or when water is first used from the future storage capacity or 10 years from the scheduled date of completion of the facility, whichever occurs first.</P>
            <P>(ii) If State law requires that interest be charged and repaid before water is first used or earlier than 10 years from completion date of the structure, interest payments will be scheduled to comply with State law even though payments of principal may be deferred.</P>
            <P>(iii) The borrower should be encouraged to begin repayments as soon as practicable after the reservoir is built even though this liberal deferment policy exists.</P>
            <P>(iv) WS advances for preservation of sites must be fully repaid before beginning construction of the works of improvement for which such sites were acquired.</P>
            <P>(A) Unless a WS advance is to be repaid with a WS loan, installments will be scheduled at the earliest possible date following the date of closing the advance. The date and amount of each such installment will be fixed to coincide with the receipt of income from taxes or other revenues.</P>
            <P>(B) Payments for both principal and interest on a WS advance for preservation of sites may be scheduled for payment in one installment to be paid on the date of the closing of a WS loan which includes funds for the repayment of the WS advance.</P>
            <P>(C) Interest on a WS advance for preservation of sites will begin on the date the WS advance is closed.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Payment amortization and application.</E> (1) A borrower may make prepayments on WS loans, WS advances or RCD loans in any amount at any time.</P>
            <P>(2) Payments will be applied first to interest accrued to the date of the receipt of payment, and second to the principal balance. If the regular payments plus any prepayments exceed the cumulative amount due, the excess payments will be applied on the next installment first to interest, then principal. Loan refunds and proceeds from the sale of security property, however, will be applied on the final unpaid installment.</P>
            <P>(3) Payments will be scheduled annually beginning one year following the date of loan closing or one year following the end of any approved deferment period, unless another annual due date is required by State statute or upon prior written authorization from the National Office. In those cases where loans are being made under statutes requiring a repayment date other than this, the Rural Development State Director will send a copy of the Regional Attorney's opinion that such is required, to the Finance Office.</P>

            <P>(4) When a single obligation instrument is used, amortized installments will be required. When this cannot be done because of state law, serial bonds or a single bond having installments of principal plus interest, stated separately, will be used. In cases where the payment of interest has been deferred, all collections will be applied to interest until such interest has been paid. Also, when a full installment is not <PRTPAGE P="338"/>paid when due, the payment made will be applied first to accrued interest.</P>
            <P>(5) In cases where the indebtedness will be represented by serial bonds or a single bond having installments of principal plus interest, stated separately, annual payments of principal and interest will be scheduled to permit them to be paid in amounts approximately equal to the amounts that would be required for annual amortized installments.</P>
            <P>(6) If the borrower will be retiring other debts represented by bonds or notes, the payment on such bonds may be considered in developing the payment schedule for the RUS loan. In some cases, it may be desirable to reduce the amount of payments to RUS in the early years of the loan in order to preclude the necessity for refinancing the outstanding debt. When such payment schedules are proposed, National Office authorization will be obtained prior to loan approval.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Payment date.</E> Insofar as loan payments are consistent with income availability, applicable State statutes, and commercial customs in the preparation of bonds or other evidence of indebtedness, they should be scheduled on a monthly basis either in the bond or other evidence of indebtedness or through the use of a supplemental agreement. Such requirements will be accomplished not later than the time of loan closing. When monthly payments are required, such payments will be scheduled beginning one full month following the date of loan closing or the end of any approved deferment period. Subsequent monthly payments will be scheduled each full month thereafter. In those cases where evidence of indebtedness calls for annual or semiannual payments, they will be scheduled beginning six or twelve full months, respectively following the date of loan closing or the end of any approved deferment period. Subsequent payments will be scheduled each sixth or twelfth full month respectively, thereafter. When the evidence of indebtedness is dated the 29th, 30th, or 31st day of a month, the payment date will be scheduled the 28th day of the month.</P>

            <P>(e) <E T="03">National flood insurance.</E> The requirements of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4001 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) as amended by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. 4003 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) will be complied with in accordance with applicable provisions of RD Instruction 1901-L. Also see § 1780.39(g) of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Borrower contracts and bonds.</E> See subpart C of part 1780 of this chapter for applicable provisions.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Title requirements.</E> (1) Title evidence for land, easements, and rights-of-way to be acquired with proceeds of loans or advances will be furnished by the sponsoring local organization in accordance with NRCS policies and procedures.</P>

            <P>(2) RUS will specify and approve the form and content of instruments for conveying title to or interest in real estate on which a lien will be taken to secure a WS loan, WS advance, or RCD loan. These should be consistent with the applicable provisions of § 1780.14 of this chapter. The Rural Development State Director will make his decision after consultation with the Regional Attorney and the State Conservationist. He will notify NRCS in writing <PRTPAGE P="339"/>of his decision. Thereafter, title clearance will be completed under NRCS regulations except that a marketable title must be obtained on any tract of land, a part of which will be sold as excess land in accordance with § 1781.6(a)(9). In addition to the title evidence required by NRCS, applicants will furnish an opinion of legal counsel on all land and interest in land acquired with loan or advance funds.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Purchasing lands, rights and facilities.</E> The amounts paid for lands, rights, and facilities with loan funds will be not more than that determined to be reasonable and fair by the loan approval official based upon an appraisal of the current market value made by an Rural Development employee or an independent appraiser.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Water rights.</E> Applicants will be required to comply with applicable State and local laws and regulations governing appropriating, diverting, storing and using water, changing the place and manner of use of water, and in disposing of water. All of the rights of any landowner, appropriator, or user of water from any source will be fully honored in all respects as they may be affected by facilities installed with WS loans and advances and RCD loans. If, under the provisions of State law, notice of the proposed diversion or storage of water by the applicant may be filed, the applicant will be required to file such a notice. An applicant must furnish evidence to provide reasonable assurance that its water rights will be or have been properly established, will not interfere with prior vested rights, will likely not be contested or enjoined by other water users or riparian owners, and will be within the provisions of any applicable interstate compact.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Other considerations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Technical assistance.</E> When pipelines from reservoirs to treatment plants are included in watershed work plans, NRCS will not furnish engineering services for their design or installation. When such pipelines are to be financed by WS or RCD loans, RUS will supervise the activities of the private engineers retained for the purpose. Such RUS supervision will include, among other things, approval of private engineer's contracts, approval of plans and specifications, authorization of contract awards, spot checks of engineering inspection, and final inspection and acceptance.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Professional services.</E> Applicants will be responsible for providing the services necessary to plan projects including design of facilities, preparation of cost and income estimates, development of proposals for organization and financing, and overall operation and maintenance of the facility. Necessary professional services may include such as that of an engineer, architect, attorney, bond counsel, accountant, auditor, and financial advisor or fiscal agent. Form RD 442-19, “Agreement for Engineering Services,” may be used when appropriate. RUS Bulletin 1780-7, “Legal Service Agreement” may be used to prepare the agreement for legal services.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Other services.</E> Contracts for other services such as management, operation, and maintenance will be developed by the applicant and presented to the RUS official developing the docket for review and approval.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Fees for services.</E> Fees provided for in contracts, agreements or services will not be more than those ordinarily charged by the profession for similar work when RUS financing is not involved.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">State pollution control or Environmental Protection Agency standards.</E> Facilities will be designed, installed and operated to prevent pollution of water in excess of established standards. Effluent disposal will conform with appropriate State and Federal Water Pollution Control Standards.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Water pollution.</E> When repayment of a WS loan, WS advance, or RCD loan will be dependent upon income from the use or sale of water, RUS approval will be contingent upon a determination that the proposed use of stored water for recreation or municipal supply might not be permitted by a State health department because the water is being polluted from an upstream or other source.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Environmental review requirements.</E> Actions will be taken to comply with the environmental review requirements in accordance with 7 CFR part <PRTPAGE P="340"/>1970. When environmental assessments and environmental impact statements have been prepared on WS plans or RCD area plans by NRCS, a separate environmental impact statement or assessment on WS works of improvement or RCD measures for which a WS loan, WS advance, or RCD loan is requested will not be necessary unless the NRCS environmental review fails to meet the requirements of 7 CFR part 1970. If the environmental impact statement or environmental assessment is satisfactory, the Agency should formally adopt the document in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970. If a determination is made that further analysis of the environmental impact is needed, the Agency will make necessary arrangements with the NRCS State Conservationist for such action to be taken before a loan is made.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">National Historic Preservation Act.</E> All projects will comply with the provisions of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) in accordance with RD Instruction 1901-F.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Civil Rights Act of 1964.</E> Recipients of WS loans, WS advances, or RCD loans are subject to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d <E T="03">et seq.</E>), which prohibits discrimination because of race, color, or national origin. Borrowers must agree not to discriminate in their operations by signing Form RD 400-4, “Nondiscrimination Agreement,” before loan closing. This requirement should be discussed with the applicant as early in the negotiations as possible. Necessary actions will be taken in accordance with RD Instruction 1901-E.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Appraisals.</E> When required by the Rural Development State Director, appraisals will be made by an Rural Development official designated or an independent appraiser. Form RD 442-10, “Appraisal Report—Water and Waste Disposal Systems,” with appropriate supplements, may be modified as needed for use with the type of facilities being appraised.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Architectural Barriers Act of 1968.</E> All facilities financed with RUS loans and grants which are accessible to the public or in which physically handicapped persons may be employed or reside must be developed in compliance with this act (42 U.S.C. 4151 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">WS and RCD loans</E>—(1) <E T="03">Preapplications.</E> (i) The processing office or other person designated by the Rural Development State Director may assist the applicant in completing SF 424.1, “Application for Federal Assistance (For Non-construction),” and will forward one of SF 424.1 to the Rural Development State Director.</P>
            <P>(ii) The Rural Development State Director will review SF 424.1 along with other necessary information and will coordinate selection of preapplications to be processed with NRCS. He will consult with NRCS State Conservationist concerning the status of the WS plan or RCD measure plan, the estimated time schedule for construction and cost of the proposed works to be installed with the loan, cost sharing funds to be made available to the applicant, and other pertinent information.</P>
            <P>(iii) Form AD-622, “Notice of Preapplication Review Action,” will be prepared and signed by the Rural Development State Director within forty-five (45) days from receipt of the preapplication in the processing office stating the results of the review action. An original and one copy of Form AD-622 will be sent to the processing office who will deliver the original to the applicant.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Applications.</E> (i) The application includes applicable forms and information indicated in RUS Instruction 1780. When the Rural Development State Director determines that an application will be further processed and Form AD-622 is delivered, he will designate a community program specialist (field), or a member of the community program staff to assist the processing office and the applicant with assembling and processing the application.</P>

            <P>(ii) The processing office should arrange needed conferences with the applicant and its legal and engineering consultants, and when necessary, arrange for review of other Rural Development officials, and provide bulletins, <PRTPAGE P="341"/>forms, instructions and other assistance with assembling and processing the application. A processing checklist and time schedule will be established by using Form RD 1942-40, “Processing Check List (Public Bodies),” or Form RD 1942-39, “Processing Check List (Other than Public Bodies).” The processing office will send a letter and a copy of the processing checklist to the applicant to confirm decisions reached at the conference. The original and a copy of the processing checklist will be kept in the processing office and will be posted current as application processing actions are taken. The copy will be circulated from the processing office to the State Office for use in updating copies of the forms retained, after which it will be returned from the State Office to the processing office.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Dockets.</E> WS loan, WS advance, and RCD loan dockets will be developed and assembled in accordance with applicable RUS Instruction 1780.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Watershed advances.</E> Applications for WS advances will be developed and processed with NRCS assistance as necessary.</P>
            <P>(1) The Rural Development State Director will arrange with the NRCS State Conservationist to be advised when a local sponsoring organization applies to NRCS for a WS advance.</P>
            <P>(2) The Rural Development State Director will request the NRCS State Conservationist to provide information justifying the WS advance along with a written recommendation that it be made. This will include:</P>
            <P>(i) Economic feasibility of the proposed WS advance.</P>
            <P>(ii) Evidence of the legal authority of the sponsoring local organization to incur the obligation and make required payments.</P>
            <P>(iii) Any limitations on the issuance of additional bonds or notes which may be imposed by the provisions of bond ordinances or on resolutions which authorize the issuance of any outstanding obligation of the sponsoring local organization.</P>
            <P>(iv) The amount of WS advance funds to be provided, purpose for which funds will be used, and date funds will be needed.</P>
            <P>(3) When the above information has been made available to the Rural Development State Director, he will send written recommendations concerning further action on the WS advance request to the NRCS State Conservationist including actions to be taken in the preparation of the WS advance docket.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Combination WS loans and WS advances.</E> If an applicant requests both a WS loan and WS advance, the application for the WS loan should indicate the amount of the WS advance needed and whether a request for it has been made to NRCS. The Rural Development State Director and the NRCS State Conservationist will coordinate applicable processing actions of such applications. When the Rural Development State Director determines that favorable consideration will be given to an application for a loan or advance, he will provide instructions to the processing office for completing and processing the appropriate docket. Any questions concerning eligibility or other legal matters should be cleared with the Regional Attorney.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Review of decision.</E> When it is determined that the preapplication or application cannot be given favorable consideration, the Rural Development State Director will return it to the processing office along with written reasons. When the processing office receives this information, it will notify the applicant in writing of the reasons why the request was not favorably considered. The notification to the applicant will state that the RUS Administrator may be requested to review the decision. This action will be taken in accordance with § 1780.37 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(1) Upon receipt of the State Office copy of a review request from the applicant, the Rural Development State Director will furnish a report on the matter to the Administrator.</P>
            <P>(2) The Administrator will notify the applicant and the Rural Development State Director in writing of his decision and the reasons therefore.</P>

            <P>(a) WS and RCD area plans are developed by sponsoring local agencies and <PRTPAGE P="342"/>organizations with technical assistance from NRCS and other Federal and State agencies. These plans include WS works of improvement and RCD measures to be developed or constructed for which NRCS construction funds may be made available on a cost share basis along with funds provided by the sponsoring local organization, a portion or all of which may be obtained by a WS loan and/or WS advance or a RCD loan.</P>
            <P>(b) Current information on the availability of cost share funds and purposes for which they may be used is provided by NRCS. The amount of NRCS cost share funds and the amount of funds to be provided by the sponsoring local organizations will be indicated in each plan. The estimated amount of WS loan, WS advance or RCD loan anticipated by the sponsoring local organization should also be included.</P>
            <P>(c) Plans for the development or construction of individual WS works of improvement and RCD measures will normally be developed with NRCS technical assistance. In every case they will be approved by both the NRCS State conservationist and the Rural Development State Director or their designated agent when a WS loan, WS advance or RCD loan is made.</P>
            <P>(d) Options and appraisals related to the purchase of real estate for which a WS loan, WS advance, or RCD loan is made must be developed in accordance with NRCS and RUS requirements and approved by RUS. The determination of present market value will be made in accordance with § 1780.44(g) of this chapter.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Loan dockets.</E> Dockets for WS loans, WS advances and RCD loans will be prepared in accordance with the applicable provisions of part 1780 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Time for preparation of docket.</E> Docket preparation may begin as soon as a preliminary draft of the watershed plan or RCD area plan, together with an estimate of costs and benefits, have been prepared with the assistance of NRCS and approved by the sponsoring local organization applicant. However, the applicant must understand that approval of the WS loan, WS advance, or RCD loan will not be determined until the work plan has been authorized for assistance by NRCS. To the extent practicable, docket preparation may be completed by that time to facilitate the availability of funds when needed.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Instructions for preparation of docket.</E> When the Rural Development State Director has determined that plans and other requirements are completed to the extent that preparation of the loan docket may begin, he will send the processing office a memorandum giving complete instructions for docket preparation, with a list of documents to be included in the docket.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Objectives of the docket.</E> The docket should include information for use in determining that:</P>
            <P>(i) The sponsoring local organization:</P>
            <P>(A) Has legal authority to construct and operate the proposed facility, borrow money, give security, incur debt, and generate revenue needed for operation, maintenance, reserves, debt payment, and other cash requirements.</P>
            <P>(B) Is a sponsor or cosponsor of the WS plan or RCD work plan and is otherwise eligible for assistance.</P>
            <P>(ii) Funds will be used for authorized purposes.</P>
            <P>(iii) The source of income to be pledged for debt payment and the security proposed is adequate.</P>
            <P>(iv) Actions required for loan closing are administratively satisfactory, legally sufficient and properly documented in accordance with Agency regulations.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Assembly of the docket.</E> The docket will be assembled in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section and will include the following:</P>
            <P>(i) A copy of the WS works of improvement agreement or RCD measure agreement.</P>

            <P>(ii) A copy of the Operation and Maintenance Agreement between NRCS and the WS or RCD sponsoring <PRTPAGE P="343"/>local organization for the WS works of improvement or the RCD measure.</P>
            <P>(iii) A statement from the NRCS State Conservationist concurring in the feasibility of the WS work of improvement or RCD measure and that NRCS is providing financial and/or technical assistance in accordance with applicable WS or RCD authorities.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Narrative by processing office.</E> This should be included in or attached to the Project Summary. It should relate project costs to benefits of the WS or RCD loan or WS advance. Minimum and average individual charges, tax levies or assessments should be given where applicable. Where taxes or assessments on land will be levied, acres should be indicated and average cost per acre should be given. Analyses of income from recreational facilities should be based on the best information available from local, State, and Federal agencies concerned with such recreation facilities. Determination of water rates, schedules, and estimated consumption of water should be made by the same methods as for loans for domestic water and irrigation.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Estimates of right-of-way Costs.</E> The docket should include, as part of the Project Summary, current estimated costs of easements, rights-of-way, and other land rights which must be acquired. The amount estimated for such purposes in the WS or RCD plan should reflect current conditions.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Loan processing by State Office</E>—(1) <E T="03">Review of the docket.</E> The processing office will check the docket for accuracy and completeness and forward it to the State Office with their recommendations. The Rural Development State Director will review the docket to determine that:</P>
            <P>(i) All documents are accurate and complete.</P>
            <P>(ii) The proposed loan complies with WS and RCD program policies and procedures of both RUS and NRCS.</P>
            <P>(iii) Security is adequate and the repayment plan is sound.</P>
            <P>(iv) Funds requested are for authorized purposes.</P>
            <P>(v) Actions are in compliance with requirements of applicable Federal and State laws.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Letter of conditions.</E> When the Rural Development State Director determines that the docket is complete and the proposed activity is feasible, he will prepare a proposed letter of conditions under which the application may be further processed. The letter will be delivered to and discussed with the applicant. Upon acceptance of the conditions the applicant will indicate intentions to meet the conditions by a letter of interest and the application will be further processed.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Legal review.</E> The complete docket and proposed letter of conditions will be forwarded to the Regional Attorney, OGC for review and preparation of closing instructions. If it is not possible to issue closing instructions at that time, the Regional Attorney, will issue a preliminary legal opinion commenting upon the applicants legal existence, authority to incur debt and give security for the WS loan, WS advance, or RCD loan requested and actions to be taken before closing instructions may be issued.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Authorization for approval.</E> When the Rural Development State Director receives closing instructions or a preliminary legal opinion for a WS loan, WS advance, or RCD loan that is not within his approval authority he will send this information along with the docket, the proposed letter of conditions, and a memorandum recommending approval to the National Office.

            <P>(a) WS and RCD loan funds will be disbursed by the processing office in accordance with the applicable provisions of § 1780.45 of this chapter and RUS Bulletin 1781-1, paragraph (5). Funds will be made available to the borrower as needed for payment of development or other costs for which the loan is made. The processing office must determine that the payment is for an authorized purpose and is for benefits accrued to the borrower. This will require evidence from NRCS in accordance with the applicable provisions of RUS Bulletin 1781-1, “Memorandum of Understanding Between RUS and NRCS.”</P>
            <P>(b) WS advance funds may be disbursed in the same manner as WS loan funds if such funds are transferred to RUS by NRCS for disbursement or they may be disbursed by NRCS. When WS advance funds are disbursed by NRCS, payments from advance of funds will be reported to the Rural Development State Director each month to be reported to the Finance Office and charged to the borrower's account. This action will be taken in accordance with the applicable provisions of RUS Bulletin 1781-1 or RUS Bulletin 1781-2 and agreement between the NRCS State Conservationist and Rural Development State Director as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) When a future water supply is being developed with NRCS, WS advance funds, the NRCS State Conservationist will send the Rural Development State Director a monthly report of funds disbursed.

When the works of improvement, for which WS advance funds are used is completed the final report will, in addition to the above, show the date that construction was completed and the total amount of WS advance funds used.</P>
            <P>(2) WS advances for construction costs will be set out each month on Form NRCS-49a. The Rural Development State Director should make arrangements with the NRCS State Conservationist to be supplied each month with a copy of Form NRCS 49a when advance funds are included together with an official statement from the NRCS State Administrative Officer giving the date of the check and the exact amount of each advance of funds made under the advance provisions of the project agreement or of any engineering services agreement or other supplementary agreement which further implements the proposal for the advance in the project agreement. The original will be sent immediately to the Finance Office and a copy provided for the processing office file.</P>
            <P>(3) When WS advance funds are used to acquire property for site preservation the same reporting procedure as for a future water supply will be used except that Form NRCS-AS-49a and 49b if used, should be adopted to indicate fund use. As payments are made on land on which a mortgage or other security instrument is required, such instruments will be executed in accordance with instructions from the Regional Attorney, OGC.</P>
            <P>(4) The Rural Development State Director must send the bond or note evidencing WS advance indebtedness of the borrower to the Finance Office along with reports of payments from advance funds disbursed by NRCS. A copy of the bond or note and copy of each report of payment will be sent to the processing office.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Approval conditions.</E> Approval may be given when the servicing official determines that:</P>
            <P>(1) The consideration is for the full amount of the debt or the present fair market value as determined by an appraisal completed by a qualified Rural Development employee or an independent appraiser as determined appropriate by the approval official;</P>

            <P>(4) If the property to be sold or exchanged will be used for similar purposes that the loan was made, the purchaser will:</P>
            <P>(i) Execute Form RD 400-4, “Assurance Agreement.” The instrument of conveyance will contain the civil rights covenant referenced in 7 CFR 1901.202(e); and</P>

            <SUBJECT>Transfer of security and assumption of loans.</SUBJECT>
            <P>It is the Agency's policy to approve transfers and assumptions to transferees that will continue the original purpose of the loan. Assistant Administrator written concurrence is required when the transfer exceeds the State Director's loan approval authority. The transfer will be approved in accordance with the following requirements:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements for transferees.</E> The fulfillment of the following requirements for transfers will be determined by the approval official, in his or her discretion:</P>
            <P>(1) The transferees must meet the eligibility requirements of 7 CFR part 1780 and provide the same information required in 7 CFR part 1780, subpart B, for application processing.</P>
            <P>(2) The transfer will not be disadvantageous to the Government as determined by the approval official.</P>
            <P>(3) If the Agency debt(s) exceeds the present market value of the security as determined by an appraisal, the transferee will assume an amount at least equal to the present market value.</P>
            <P>(4) The Agency must concur in plans for disposition of funds in any reserve account, including project construction bank accounts. A reserve account may be considered as a transferable asset.</P>
            <P>(5) The transferee will assume all of the borrower's responsibilities regarding loans. The transferee will also agree to accept the original loan conditions plus any conditions set forth by the Agency with regard to the transfer.</P>
            <P>(6) A current appraisal will be completed to establish the present market value of the security when the full debt is not being assumed.</P>
            <P>(7) There must be no lien, judgement, or similar claims of other parties against the Agency security being transferred unless the transferee is willing to accept such claims. The Agency must also determine that the claims will not prevent the transferee from repaying the Agency debt, meeting all operating and maintenance costs, and maintaining required reserves. The written consent of any other lienholder will be obtained where required.</P>
            <P>(8) A letter of conditions establishing requirements to be met in connection with the transfer will be issued, and the transferee will be required to execute Form RD 1942-46, “Letter of Intent to Meet Conditions,” prior to closing of the transfer.</P>
            <P>(9) The transferee will obtain insurance according to Agency requirements.</P>
            <P>(10) The effective date of the transfer is the date the transfer is closed, which is the same date Form RD 1951-15, “Community Programs Assumption Agreement,” or other appropriate assumption agreement which is executed and delivered by all necessary parties.</P>

            <P>(11) Title to all assets will be conveyed from the transferor to the transferee unless all parties concerned, including the Agency, agree upon other arrangements. All instruments of conveyance will contain the necessary nondiscrimination covenant as referred to in § 1782.5.<PRTPAGE P="350"/>
            </P>
            <P>(12) If the transfer and assumption is to one or more members of the borrower's organization, there must not be a loss to the Government.</P>
            <P>(13) The State Director is authorized to approve transfers to eligible transferees at the same interest rate as on the borrower's note(s) or bond(s). The maturity of the debt instrument for the assumed debt may not exceed the lesser of the repayment period authorized in 7 CFR part 1780 for a “new” loan or the expected life of the facility.</P>
            <P>(14) Agency National Office concurrence is required for transfers not in compliance with paragraphs (a)(1) through (13) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Loan requirements for eligible transferees.</E> If a loan is evidenced and secured by a note and lien on real or chattel property, Form RD 1951-15, or other appropriate assumption agreement will be executed by the transferee. If a bond secures a loan, transfer documents will be developed by bond counsel and approved by the Office of the General Counsel (OGC), USDA.</P>
            <P>(1) Loans being transferred and assumed may be combined when the security is the same, new terms are being provided, a new debt instrument will be issued, and the loans have the same interest rate and are for the same purpose. If applicable, 7 CFR part 1780 will govern the preparation of any new debt instruments required.</P>
            <P>(2) A loan may be made in connection with a transfer if the transferee meets all eligibility and other requirements for the kind of loan being made. Such a loan will be considered as a separate loan and must be evidenced by a separate debt instrument. However, it is permissible to have one authorizing loan resolution or ordinance if permitted by State statutes.</P>
            <P>(3) Any development funds remaining in a bank account that are not refunded to the Agency will be transferred to a bank account for the transferee. This will occur simultaneously with the closing of the transfer, and the funds will be used in completing planned development.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Release from liability.</E> Transferors may be released from liability when their debt is paid in full or when the debt is settled in accordance with § 1782.20 of this part.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Transfer of facility financed with Agency grants.</E> The requirements for the sale or disposition of assets financed with Agency grants are determined by the terms of the grant agreement, 7 CFR parts 3015, 3016, and 3019, and E.O. 12803, as applicable.</P>

            <P>(a) 7 U.S.C. 1926(b) was enacted to protect the service area of Agency borrowers with outstanding loans, or those loans sold in the sale of assets authorized by the “Joint Resolution Making Continuing Appropriations for the Fiscal Year 1987, Pub. L. 99-591, 100 Stat. 3341 (1986),” from loss of users due to actions or activities of other entities in the service area of the Agency financed system. Without this protection, other entities could extend service to users within the service area, and thereby undermine the purpose of the congressionally mandated water and waste loan and grant programs and jeopardize the borrower's ability to repay its Agency debt.</P>
            <P>(b) Responsibility for initiating action in response to those actions prohibited by 7 U.S.C. 1926(b) rests with the borrower.</P>

Mergers occur when two or more entities combine in such a manner that only one remains in existence. Consolidations occur when two or more entities combine to form a new consolidated entity, and the original entities cease to exist. In both mergers and consolidations, the surviving or emerging entity acquires the assets and assumes the liabilities of the entity or entities that ceased to exist.</P>

            <P>In order for the Agency to agree to a parity lien position, the borrower must submit a written request to the servicing office.</P>
            <P>(a) The written request for parity must contain the following items:</P>
            <P>(1) An explanation of the purpose of the request for parity; amount of loan for which parity is requested; description of security property; type of security instrument; name and address of financial institution requesting the transaction; and other information determined necessary by the servicing official to evaluate the request.</P>
            <P>(2) Current financial statements or an audit, if available or determined necessary by the servicing official.</P>
            <P>(3) An annual operating budget which projects income and expenses for a typical year's operation. If construction is involved, the budget must be projected through the first full year of operation following completion of the planned improvements.</P>
            <P>(4) A copy of the proposed security instrument.</P>
            <P>(5) A certification from the borrower that the Agency debt cannot be refinanced at reasonable rates and terms.</P>
            <P>(6) An appraisal, when the primary security is real estate or determined necessary by the servicing official in order to determine the adequacy of loan security or repayment ability.</P>
            <P>(7) A certification that any development work will comply with subpart C of part 1780 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(b) Requests for parity must comply with requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, requirements as specified in the bond or loan documents, the requirements as specified in 7 CFR part 1780, subpart D, and as provided in applicable State law.</P>
            <P>(c) If the borrower has met all of the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the proposal is determined to be in the Government's interest, the Agency will then grant approval of the borrower's request for parity. The following factors will be considered in assessing whether the request is in the Government's interest:</P>
            <P>(1) The value of the added assets compared with the amount of new debt to be secured;</P>
            <P>(2) The value of the assets already pledged under the security documents, and any effects of the proposed transaction on the value of those assets;</P>
            <P>(3) The ratio of the total outstanding debt secured under the security documents to the value of all assets pledged as security under the security documents;</P>
            <P>(4) The borrower's ability to repay its debt owed to the Government;</P>
            <P>(5) The overall financial viability of the borrower;</P>
            <P>(6) The borrower's current relationship with the Agency (i.e. no defaults under the loan documents);</P>
            <P>(7) Such other factors that may be relevant in individual cases, as determined by the Agency.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Debt Settlement.</SUBJECT>

            <P>Pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 1981, this section prescribes policies for debt settlement of Water and Waste Disposal loans; Watershed loans and advances; Resource Conservation and Development loans; and 306 (c) Water and Waste Facility loans. Within the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-134) is the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996. This law provides that any non-tax debt or claim owed to the United States that has been delinquent for a period of 180 days shall be turned over to the Secretary of the Treasury for appropriate action to collect or terminate collection actions on the debt or claim. Debt that is in litigation or foreclosure, with a collection agency or <PRTPAGE P="352"/>designated Federal debt collection center, or that will be disposed of under an asset sales program, is exempt from transfer to the Secretary.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements for debt settlement.</E> (1) The debt or any extension thereof on which settlement is requested must be due and payable. The debt will be due and payable either under the terms of the note or other instrument, or by acceleration, unless the debt is to be cancelled without application under paragraph (e)(2) of this section or charged off under paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) Normally, all security will be disposed of prior to the date of application for debt settlement unless it is necessary to abandon security through the debt settlement process. In such cases, debt settlement may proceed if the servicing official determines that further collection efforts would be ineffective, uneconomical, and not in the best interests of the Government.</P>
            <P>(3) Debtors will not be permitted to sell security and use the proceeds as part or all of a compromise/adjustment debt settlement offer.</P>
            <P>(4) Requests for debt settlement will consist of Form RD 1956-1 “Application For Settlement of Indebtedness,” current financial information, description and estimated market value of collateral, and status of operation (i.e., number of users, compliance with environmental issues, etc.).</P>
            <P>(5) Office of General Counsel (OGC) advice on compliance with State or Federal statutes that may affect the debt settlement action must be requested.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Debts ineligible for settlement.</E> Debts will not be settled if:</P>
            <P>(1) Referral to the Office of Inspector General and/or to OGC is contemplated or pending because of suspected criminal violation,</P>
            <P>(2) Civil action to protect the interest of the Government is contemplated or pending,</P>
            <P>(3) An investigation for suspected fiscal irregularity is contemplated or pending, or</P>
            <P>(4) The debtor requests settlement of a claim that has been referred to or a judgment obtained by the United States Attorney. The settlement offer and any related payment must be submitted directly to the United States Attorney for consideration.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Types of debt settlement.</E> Typically, debt settlement will be accomplished through compromise/adjustment, charge-off, or cancellation. Any debt remaining after the security has been liquidated, by sale or transfer, will be cancelled if there are no other assets from which to collect the debt. The servicing official will proceed with advice from OGC and the National Office, as required.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Compromise and adjustment.</E> Debts may be compromised or adjusted and security retained by the debtor, provided:</P>
            <P>(1) The debtor is unable to pay the indebtedness in full,</P>
            <P>(2) The debtor has offered an amount equal to the present fair market value of all security or facility financed, and</P>
            <P>(3) The debtor has offered any additional amount that the debtor is able to pay.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Cancellation.</E> Non-judgment debts, regardless of the amount, may be cancelled with or without application by the debtor.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">With application by the debtor.</E> Debts may be cancelled upon application of the debtor, subject to the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(i) The servicing official furnishes a favorable recommendation concerning the cancellation;</P>
            <P>(ii) There is no known security for the debt and the debtor has no other assets from which the debt could be collected;</P>
            <P>(iii) The debtor is unable to pay any part of the debt, and has no reasonable prospect of being able to do so; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The debt or any extension thereof is due and payable under the terms of the note or other instrument or due to acceleration by written notice prior to the date of application.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Without application by debtor.</E> Debts may be cancelled upon a favorable recommendation of the servicing official in the following instances:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Debtors discharged in bankruptcy.</E> If there is no security for the debt, debts discharged in bankruptcy shall be cancelled by the use of Form RD 1956-1. A copy of the Bankruptcy Court's Discharge Order must be attached.<PRTPAGE P="353"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Impractical to obtain debtor's signature.</E> Debts may be cancelled if it is impractical to obtain a signed application and the requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) of this section are met. Form RD 1956-1 will document the specific reason(s) why it was impossible or impracticable to obtain the signature of the debtor. If the debtor refused to sign the application, the reason(s) should be documented.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Charge-off</E>—(1) <E T="03">Judgment debts.</E> Judgment debts, regardless of the amount, may be charged off without the debtor's signature upon a favorable recommendation of the servicing official provided:</P>
            <P>(i) The United States Attorney's file is closed, and</P>
            <P>(ii) The requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, if applicable, have been met, or 2 years have elapsed since any collections were made on the judgment. The debtor must also have no equity in the property subject to the lien or upon which a lien can be obtained.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Non-judgment debts.</E> Debts that cannot be settled under other sections of this part may be charged off without the debtor's signature upon a favorable recommendation of the servicing official in the following instances:</P>
            <P>(i) When OGC advises in writing that the claim is legally without merit or that evidence necessary to prove the claim in court cannot be provided; or</P>
            <P>(ii) When there is no known security for the debt, the debtor has no other assets from which the debt could be collected, and the debtor:</P>
            <P>(A) Is unable to pay any part of the debt and has no reasonable prospect of being able to do so; or</P>
            <P>(B) Is able to pay part or all of the debt but refuses to do so, and OGC provides an opinion to the effect that the Government cannot enforce collection of a significant amount from assets or income.</P>

            <P>(a) If, after making a loan or a grant, the Administrator determines that the circumstances under which the loan or grant was made have sufficiently changed to make the project or activity for which the loan or grant was made available no longer appropriate, the Administrator may allow the borrower or grantee to use property (real and personal) purchased or improved with the loan or grant funds, or proceeds from the sale of property (real and personal) purchased with such funds, for another project or activity that:</P>
            <P>(1) Will be carried out in the same area as the original project or activity;</P>
            <P>(2) Meets the criteria for a loan or grant described in section 381E(d) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (Pub. L. 87-128), as amended; and</P>
            <P>(3) Satisfies such additional requirements as are established by the Administrator.</P>
            <P>(b) If the new use of the property is under the authority of another USDA Agency Administrator, the other Administrator will be consulted on whether the new use will meet the criteria of the other program. Since the new project or activity must be carried out in the same area as the original project or activity, a new rural area determination will not be necessary.</P>

            <P>(c) Borrowers and grantees that wish to use the proceeds for other purposes may make their request through the appropriate Rural Development State Office. Permission to use this option will be exercised on a case-by-case-basis on applications submitted <PRTPAGE P="354"/>through the State Office to the Administrator for consideration. If the proposal is approved, the Administrator will issue a memorandum to the State Director outlining the conditions necessary to complete the transaction.</P>

              <P>(a) DEC and ANTHC utilize the National Indian Health Service, Sanitation Deficiency System (SDS) database as a comprehensive source of rural sanitation needs in Alaska. The database provides an inventory of the sanitation deficiencies including water, sewer, and solid waste facilities for existing homes. The sanitation deficiencies data are updated annually by DEC and ANTHC in consultation with the respective rural or native villages. The SDS system is utilized in the RAVG program to help prioritize applications under the Village Safe Water Program.</P>
              <P>(b) A prioritized list of projects will be developed each year by RUS, DEC, and ANTHC applying prioritization criteria to the sanitation needs database. Prioritization criteria established by the RUS, DEC, ANTHC, and IHS will be based, at a minimum, on relative health impacts, drinking water and wastewater regulatory requirements, the sanitation conditions in each community and project readiness. The VSW Program process and associated prioritization criteria will be used to prioritize projects and place them on a priority list. The process will be reviewed and approved by RUS, DEC, ANTHC, and IHS. Projects will be funded from the priority list as they meet established planning, design, and construction requirements, subject to available funding.</P>

              <P>(m) Floodplains. The agencies follow the eight-step decision-making process referenced in Section 2(a) of Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management, when undertaking actions located in floodplains. Pursuant to E. O. 11988, the IHS uses a Class Review process to exclude certain actions from further review under the eight-step process. For all actions that do not qualify for IHS Class Review, the eight-step process shall be completed. All practicable measures to minimize development in floodplains and reduce the risk to human safety, health, and welfare shall be followed, including elevating a new water or wastewater facility at least one foot above the base flood elevation as determined by the Army Corp of Engineers, other qualified survey, or best available data. Since they are considered “critical facilities” as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), water and wastewater facilities may be subject to more stringent standards such as relocation out of the floodplain, higher elevation, or other flood proofing measures. If an area has been designated a floodplain by FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) coverage, flood insurance shall be required for facilities located in flood plains. If an area has no FEMA FIRM coverage the requirement to obtain flood insurance does not apply. If a community is located within a mapped FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) 100-year floodplain, but is not a participating National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) community member, then RUS may not fund the project according to 7 CFR 1806 Subpart B.</P>
              <P>(n) Project planning, including engineering reports and environmental review documentation, to the maximum extent feasible, must address all water or waste disposal needs for a community in a coordinated manner with other community development projects and take into consideration information presented in available community strategic and comprehensive plans. Any reports or designs completed with funds must be consistent with sound engineering practices and USDA regulations, including 7 CFR part 1970.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(b) All environmental findings and determinations made by the lead agency represent those of the cooperating agencies and will be completed in accordance with the procedures outlined in this section.</P>
              <P>(c) RUS will, to the extent possible and in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.2 and 7 CFR part 1970, participate with DEC, IHS, and ANTHC to cooperatively or jointly prepare environmental review documents so that one document will comply with all applicable laws.</P>
              <P>(d) For projects administered by DEC and ANTHC, RUS agrees to participate as a cooperating agency in accordance with 40 CFR 1501.6 and 7 CFR part 1970, and relies upon those agencies' procedures for implementing NEPA as further described below.</P>
              <P>(e) The lead agency will indicate that RUS is a cooperating agency in all NEPA-related notices published for the proposed action.</P>
              <P>(f) A construction grant may not be approved until all environmental findings and determinations have been made according to the following:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Rural Utilities Service Lead Agency.</E> If RUS is the lead agency, the environmental review process, including all findings and determinations, will be completed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03"> DEC Lead Agency.</E> In the event DEC is the lead agency, the environmental review process, including all findings and determinations will be completed in accordance with the environmental review process outlined in Appendix A to the June 15, 2011 MOU.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">IHS Lead Agency.</E> For projects administered by ANTHC, IHS will be the lead agency for the environmental review process, including all findings and determinations. The environmental review process, including all findings and determinations will be completed in accordance with the Department of Health and Human Services policies and procedures in General Administration Manual, Part 30, Council on Environmental Quality regulations at 40 CFR 1500-1508 and with procedures published by IHS in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> Vol. 58, No.3, page 569, January 6, 1993. The ANTHC shall notify the funding agencies and the IHS if a change in the project or project scope occurs which could change any previously prepared environmental findings or determinations or could adversely impact the environment. In the event of an unanticipated discovery of a historic property or other environmental resource, the ANTHC shall stop construction activity in the area of the discovery and notify the appropriate authority and the IHS. Mitigation options resulting from unanticipated discoveries, including but not limited to changes in project scope or cancellation of the project will be evaluated by the funding agencies in collaboration with the ANTHC and IHS. If appropriate and necessary, mitigation plans will be negotiated and approved by all parties. When the funding agencies have approved a mitigation plan and IHS has reaffirmed its environmental review process, including all findings and determinations, the ANTHC will be authorized to initiate the agreed to mitigation plan. The IHS shall bear no mitigation costs as it is not a funding agency for projects under this part.</P>
              <P>(g) RUS will have an opportunity to review the IHS or DEC environmental review documents, including all findings and determinations to ensure consistency with this part and agency procedures. Where an Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is required by the lead agency's environmental policies and procedures, the lead agency will ensure that the scope and content of the EA or EIS satisfies the statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to RUS. Where an EA and EIS is not required under the applicable lead agency's procedures for implementing NEPA, the review by RUS will be limited to ensure that the applicable lead agency's procedures were followed.</P>
              <P>(h) The National Historic Preservation Act Section 106 review requirements completed for ANTHC administered projects will be carried out in accordance with the process described in Appendix B of the June 15, 2011 MOU.</P>

              <P>This subpart B sets forth policies and procedures on the RUS cushion of creditpayments program. The cushion of credit payments program will be maintained only for insured loans evidenced by obligations of the Fund. A subaccount within the Fund is hereby established for purposes of promoting rural economic development. It shall be known as the “Rural Economic Development Subaccount.” The assets of the subaccount shall be obtained from crediting (on a monthly basis) a sum determined by multiplying the outstanding cushion of credit payments made after October 1, 1987, by the difference (converted on a monthly basis) between the average weighted interest rate paid on outstanding certificates of beneficial ownership issued by the Fund and the 5 percent rate of interest provided to borrowers on cushion of credit payments, repayment of loans made pursuant to Section 313 of the Act, and other sources as provided by law. This subaccount shall be used to provide grants or zero interest loans to borrowers under the Act for the purpose of promoting rural economic development.</P>

              <P>A cushion of credit account shall be automatically established by RUS for each borrower who makes a payment after October 1, 1987, in excess of amounts then due on an RUS note. Such account will bear interest at a rate of 5 percent per annum. All payments on RUS notes which are in excess of required payments and not otherwise designated shall be deposited in the borrowers' respective cushion of credit accounts. Payments received in the month in which an installment is <PRTPAGE P="369"/>due will be applied to the installment due. However, if the regular installment payment is received at a later date in the month, the first payment received will be applied retroactively to a cushion of credit account and the second will be applied to the installment due.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Application of RETRF cushion of credit payments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If a maturing installment on an RUS note or a note which has been guaranteed by RUS is not received by its due date, funds will be withdrawn from the borrower's cushion of credit account and applied as of the installment due date beginning with the oldest of such notes as follows: first, to current interest then due on all notes; second, to the accumulated interest due, if any, on all notes; and third, to the principal then due on all notes. In those instances where a borrower has prior to October 2, 1987, maintained an advance payment account with RUS, its cushion of credit account will be applied in accordance with the provisions of this section prior to using any balance remaining in its advance payment account to pay interest and principal installments on notes. Computations required under this section have been made by RUS as of October 2, 1987; however, on or before May 25, 1989 any borrower may make a one time irrevocable election to have all such computations made as of April 5, 1989, by filing written notice to that effect with Robert D. Ruddy, Director, Fiscal Accounting Division, Rural Utilities Service, Washington, DC 20250-1500.</P>
              <P>(b) A borrower may reduce the balance of its cushion of credit account only if the amount obtained from the reduction is used to make scheduled payments on loans made or guaranteed under the Act.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Prepayment Authority.</E> So long as the aggregate amount of prepayments made after December 22, 1987, including prepayments made pursuant to § 1786.28(d) and § 1786.28(e), under section 306(A) of the RE Act, does not exceed $2.5 billion, the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury is not required in order to make a prepayment pursuant to this subpart (such amount of prepayments is hereinafter called prepayment authority).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Program Allocations.</E> In accordance with the provisions of section 637 of the 1989 Appropriations Act, $350 million of prepayment authority is allocated to RUS-financed electric systems and $150 million of prepayment authority is allocated to RUS-financed telephone utilities. The amounts of prepayment authority allocated to electric program borrowers and telephone program borrowers shall not be transferred between programs. Borrowers may not sell, assign, or otherwise transfer prepayment authority to another borrower.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Categories of Prepayment Applications.</E> Applications received by RUS from borrowers desiring to prepay pursuant to this subpart will be separated into the following two application categories:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Electric Program Applications.</E> Electric program applications are applications to make a prepayment pursuant to this subpart from RUS-financed <PRTPAGE P="376"/>electric utilities, that qualify in accordance with § 1786.28(a) hereof and which are received by RUS during the application period. Electric program applications will be further subdivided and classified as being either (i) a financially distressed borrower's application, or (ii) a standard electric program application. Applications received from borrowers determined by the Administrator not to be a financially distressed borrower will be classified and processed as a standard electric program application;</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Telephone Program Applications.</E> Telephone program applications are applications to make a prepayment pursuant to this subpart from RUS-financed telephone utilities that qualify in accordance with § 1786.28(a) hereof and which are received by RUS during the application period;</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Financially distressed borrowers' reserve.</E> The $350 million of prepayment authority allocated for RUS-financed electric utilities, is initially set aside into a financially distressed borrowers' reserve. This reserve of prepayment authority will be available for prepayments pursuant to this subpart by financially distressed borrowers who apply to make such a prepayment during the application period. In the event that a portion of financially distressed borrowers' reserve remains unsubscribed at the end of the initial application period, the unallocated portion of the financially distressed borrowers' reserve will be allocated to other electric borrowers having submitted applications during an application period to be announced by RUS. Such prepayment applications shall be classified as standard electric program applications.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Processing procedure.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Priority of Processing.</E> The determination of the order or method in which applications or portions of applications will be processed by RUS pursuant to this subpart rests solely within the discretion of the Administrator. RUS expects that a number of prepayment applications will be processed simultaneously. In the event that it becomes necessary to establish priorities of processing, prepayment applications will be processed without regard to the date received, generally in the following order of priority:</P>
              <P>(1) Applications from telephone borrowers;</P>
              <P>(2) Applications from financially distressed borrowers;</P>

              <P>(3) Applications from all other borrowers. When assigning priority to such applications, RUS will consider a number of factors, including without limitation, (i) the number of prepayment applications being processed by the area office; (ii) the novelty or complexity of the proposed transaction; (iii) the method of prepayment; and (iv) the availability of resources. In the event that RUS receives during the initial application period, prepayment applications from such borrowers in an amount less than remaining prepayment authority for each respective program, RUS will establish a new application period and publish a notice to that effect in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Pro-rated Applications.</E> Standard electric program applications, and telephone program applications will be prorated within their respective application categories to permit partial prepayments in the event that the aggregate amount of prepayment applications received during the application period exceeds the amount of prepayment authority allocated to that application category. In such circumstances, the amount of each borrower's permitted prepayment shall be determined within each respective application category, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The principal amount of FFB advances under each individual application, which, if prepaid pursuant to this subpart, would result in an economic savings to the borrower, shall be divided by the aggregate principal amount of FFB advances, under all of the applications, which, if prepaid pursuant to this subpart, would result in an economic savings to the borrowers, in order to determine a percentage (hereinafter called a pro-rated percentage) for each borrower;</P>

              <P>(2) Each borrower's share of the prepayment authority for its application category shall be equal to the product of (i) the prepayment authority times <PRTPAGE P="377"/>(ii) the respective pro-rated percentage, and may be used to prepay a portion of any of the borrower's FFB loans listed pursuant to § 1786.31(a)(2);</P>
              <P>(3) If any approved prepayment transaction fails to be settled within 180 days of the date the borrower is notified by RUS of its prepayment allocation, RUS may rescind its approval. The unused prepayment authority represented by such a failed transaction is subject to being included in any subsequent notice of a new application period under this subpart; and</P>
              <P>(4) In the event that applications from financially distressed borrowers exceed the amount prepayment authority remaining in the financially distressed borrowers' reserve, the Administrator at his discretion shall select one or more of such applications and allocate the reserve. In making such a selection and allocation, the Administrator may consider various factors, including without limitation, (i) the dollar amount of savings to be realized by the proposed prepayment; (ii) the interest rates on the FFB loans proposed to be prepaid; (iii) the magnitude of the default or potential default; and (iv) whether the borrower has previously completed a prepayment under section 306(A).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Notification of Borrowers' Allocations.</E> Promptly after allocating the prepayment authority to borrowers and completing any proration calculations that may be necessary, RUS will return to each borrower submitting a prepayment application pursuant to this subpart, a copy of their Notice of Intent to Prepay the Federal Financing Bank specifying the amount of the borrower's prepayment allocation.</P>

              <P>If, after prepayment of RUS Notes, the Government should continue to hold liens on the borrower's property, the Administrator of RUS will consider a request for the accommodation of such liens for the purpose of providing security for loans the proceeds of which were used to prepay RUS Notes. Such lien accommodations shall be limited in amount to the Discounted Present Value of the RUS Notes plus such costs, as the Administrator shall determine to be reasonable, incurred by the borrower in obtaining such loans.</P>

              <P>RUS shall have the right to audit within 6 months of closing, transactions involving the RUS construction fund established and maintained by the borrower pursuant to the terms of the RUS Loan Agreement and to inspect all books, records, accounts and other documents and papers of the borrower. Should RUS determine that the borrower has made disbursements of funds advanced pursuant to RUS Notes which do not comply with the requirements of the RUS Loan Agreement, the borrower shall be required to pay the Government an amount equal to the difference between the amount which the borrower prepaid on such RUS Notes evidencing RUS loans funds which were improperly disbursed and the amount which the borrower would otherwise have been required to return to the Government as a result of noncompliance if the borrower had not prepaid such RUS Notes.

              <P>(b) The RUS Notes shall be prepaid at a closing to be held in accordance with the prepayment agreement. RUS shall designate the date of closing which in no event shall be later than one year after the effective date of the merger or consolidation. At closing, in addition to paying all current interest due on the date of prepayment, a borrower shall prepay the RUS Notes by paying to the Government an amount equal to the lesser of the outstanding balance or the Discounted Present Value of the RUS Notes. The closing shall otherwise be conducted as prescribed in the prepayment agreement.</P>

              <P>RUS loan documentation generally permits borrowers to prepay RUS Notes by paying the outstanding balance due thereon. Nothing in this subpart shall prohibit any borrower from prepaying its outstanding RUS Notes in accordance with the terms thereof. The provisions of this subpart shall not be applicable to such prepayment.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Description of the Treasury Constant Maturity Series</HD>
              <P>Yields on Treasury securities at “constant maturity” are interpolated by the U.S. Treasury from the daily yield curve. This curve, which relates the yield on a security to its time to maturity, is based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded Treasury securities in the over-the-counter market. These market yields are calculated from composites of quotations reported by five leading U.S. Government securities dealers to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The constant maturity yield values are read from the yield curve at fixed maturities, currently 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 30 years. This method provides a yield for a 10-year maturity, for example, even if no outstanding security has exactly 10 years remaining to maturity.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Sample Contract Terms</HD>
                <P>So long as any of the notes evidencing secured loans of the power supply borrower are outstanding, the borrower will not, without the approval in writing of the power supply borrower and the Administrator, take or suffer to be taken any steps for reorganization or dissolution, or to consolidate with or merge into any corporation, or to sell, lease or transfer (or make any agreement therefor) all or a substantial portion of its assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired. The power supply borrower will not unreasonably withhold or condition its consent to any such, reorganization, dissolution, consolidation, or merger, or to any such sale, lease or transfer (or any agreement therefor) of assets. The power supply borrower will not withhold or condition such consent except in cases where to do otherwise would result in rate increases for the other members of the power supply borrower or impair the ability of the power supply borrower to repay its secured loans in accordance with their terms, or adversely affect system performance in a material way. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the borrower may take or suffer to be taken any steps for reorganization or dissolution or to consolidate with or merge into any corporation or to sell, lease or transfer (or make any agreement therefor) all or a substantial portion of its assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired without the power supply borrower's consent, so long as the borrower shall pay such portion of the outstanding indebtedness on the power supply borrower's notes or other obligations as shall be determined by the power supply borrower with the prior written consent of the Administrator and shall otherwise comply with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Administrator and power supply borrower may require either: (1) To eliminate any adverse effect that such action seems likely to have on the rates of the other members of the power supply borrower, or</P>
                <P>(2) To assure that the power supply borrower's ability to repay the secured loans and other obligations of the power supply borrower in accordance with their terms is not impaired.</P>
                <P>The Administrator may require, among other things, that any payment owed under (2) of the preceding sentence that represents a portion of the power supply borrower's indebtedness on Notes shall be paid by the borrower in the manner necessary to accomplish a defeasance of those obligations in accordance with the loan documents relating thereto, or be paid directly to the holders of the Notes for application by them as prepayments in accordance with the provisions of such documents, or be paid to the power supply borrower and held and invested in a manner satisfactory to the Administrator.</P>

During the 120 month period the Administrator may consider providing an insured loan if, among other matters, it is necessary to assure repayment of, or protect the Government's security for any outstanding loans or loan guarantees, or the borrower's system has suffered severe physical plant related damage due to conditions beyond its control and the borrower is unable to obtain financing at reasonable terms to restore the system from non-RUS sources, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and from private sources. Upon expiration of the 120 months, such borrowers may apply for direct or insured loans in the same manner as other borrowers provided that such borrowers may not apply for direct or insured loans for facilities, construction of which commenced prior to the expiration of the 120 months. Special provisions for mergers involving a borrower that has prepaid pursuant to this subpart are in 7 CFR 1717.158.</P>
              <P>(b) Borrowers that prepay their direct or insured RUS loans under this subpart remain eligible for certain types of financial assistance under the RE Act, including loan guarantees and rural development loans.</P>

              <P>(a) A borrower that had prepaid, prior to the date of enactment of Public Law 102-428 (106 Stat. 2183) on October 21, 1992, at a discount rate as provided at 7 CFR part 1786, subpart C:</P>
              <P>(1) Shall not be eligible except at the discretion of the Administrator as stated in paragraph § 1786.167(a), to apply for or receive direct or insured loans during the 180-month period beginning on the date of the prepayment; and</P>
              <P>(2) Shall not be eligible to apply for or receive direct or insured loans from RUS until the borrower has repaid to the RUS the sum of:</P>

              <P>(i) The amount (if any) by which the discount the borrower received by reason of the prepayment exceeds the discount the borrower would have received had the discount been based on the cost of funds to the Department of <PRTPAGE P="396"/>the Treasury as calculated at § 1786.153 at the time of the prepayment; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Interest on the amount described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section for the period beginning on the date of the prepayment and ending on the date of the repayment, at a rate equal to the average annual cost of borrowing by the Department of the Treasury. This rate will be calculated first on the date of prepayment and at one year intervals from that date based on the same U.S. Treasury issues published in the Federal Reserve Statistical Release closest to that date. The Treasury rate of interest to be applied for each year will be the rate for the Treasury issue of comparable maturity to the number of years from the prepayment date to the repayment date and at one year intervals thereafter.</P>
              <P>(b) If a borrower and the Administrator have entered into an agreement with respect to a prepayment occurring before October 21, 1992, this section shall supersede any provision in the agreement relating to the restoration of eligibility for loans under the RE Act.</P>
              <P>(c) Borrowers who prepaid prior to October 1, 1987, are eligible for assistance under the RE Act in the same manner as other borrowers with respect to loan guarantees and the rural development loans.</P>
              <P>(d) During the 180 month period described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section the Administrator may consider providing an insured loan, if the conditions described in § 1786.167(a) exist.</P>
              <P>(e) Borrowers may not apply for direct or insured loans for facilities, construction of which commenced prior to the expiration of the 180 month period described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>

            <P>(a) The “Buy American” provision of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (RE Act) requires, to the extent practicable and the cost of which is not unreasonable, that RUS Borrowers use loan funds only for such manufactured articles, materials, and supplies as have been manufactured in the United States or in any eligible country, substantially all from articles, materials, or supplies mined, produced or manufactured, as the case may be, in the United States or any eligible country.</P>
            <P>(b) Each RUS Borrower is responsible for assuring that its use of loan funds complies with this requirement, and that the contracts it enters into for construction, materials and equipment, and purchases with vendors contain the Buy American requirement, along with certification as to compliance, made through RUS Form 213.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Nondomestic products.</SUBJECT>
            <P>A product is considered to be nondomestic for the purpose of compliance with the “Buy American” requirement if:</P>
            <P>(a) The product is manufactured outside the United States or any eligible country; or</P>
            <P>(b) The product is manufactured in the United States or in any eligible country, but the cost of nondomestic components used therein constitutes 50 percent or more of the cost of all components. The cost of components shall be determined on a comparable basis, so that only the cost of domestic and nondomestic components, up to the point where they are combined and manufactured into a complete product shall be considered.</P>
            <P>(1) The determination of the cost of the nondomestic components of a product shall include:</P>
            <P>(i) The price paid to the nondomestic source;</P>
            <P>(ii) The cost of shipment to the port of entry into the United States;</P>
            <P>(iii) Applicable tariffs or duties;</P>
            <P>(iv) The cost of transportation from the port of entry to the distributor's plant or warehouse; and</P>
            <P>(v) Profit, overhead, and commissions of domestic and nondomestic suppliers and subcontractors of the components.</P>
            <P>(2) The following items shall not be considered in determining the cost of components, although they are proper elements in the determination of the final selling price of the product:</P>
            <P>(i) Fabrication or processing costs, if any, of nondomestic or domestic components at the assembly plant, or any other place of fabrication in the United States or any eligible country;</P>
            <P>(ii) Testing costs at the assembly plant or at the installation site;</P>
            <P>(iii) Direct profit, overhead, and commissions of the domestic distributor; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Cost of transportation from the domestic assembly point to the installation site.</P>

            <P>Where a component is manufactured only determines whether the component is classified as domestic or nondomestic even if all the materials and subcomponents comprising the component are manufactured in ineligible countries. A component manufactured in the United States or in an eligible country shall be considered domestic when determining whether a product is classified as domestic or nondomestic. A component manufactured in an ineligible country shall be considered nondomestic.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purchase of nondomestic products.</SUBJECT>

            <P>An RUS Borrower may only use loan funds to purchase a nondomestic product if a waiver pursuant to § 1787.10 has been received by the Administrator before entering into a contract with the vendor. Should the Administrator deny the waiver request, the RUS Borrower <PRTPAGE P="402"/>must use its own funds for the expenditure.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Waivers.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Under limited circumstances the Administrator may waive the Buy American requirement with respect to a specific contract entered into between an RUS Borrower and a third party which will be paid for with loan funds, subject to §§ 1787.10 through 1787.14.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1787.10</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Applications for specific waivers.</SUBJECT>
            <P>RUS borrowers may request a specific waiver of the Buy American requirement through a written, detailed explanation showing that:</P>
            <P>(a) The cost between the nondomestic product and domestic product is unreasonable;</P>
            <P>(b) There is a non-availability of domestic products; or</P>
            <P>(c) It is not in the public interest or impractical for the RUS Borrower to purchase a domestic product.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1787.11</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Cost differential.</SUBJECT>
            <P>By application pursuant to § 1787.10, the Administrator may waive the Buy American requirement if the cost of the domestic product is unreasonable. Given that RUS loans terms normally range from 20 to 35 years, and that additional costs will be magnified with interest over these terms, the Administrator has determined that if the lowest bid or offered price is a nondomestic bid that is at least 6percent lower than the next lowest bid or offered price, the RUS Borrower may request a cost differential waiver. With respect to contracts that are not required to be bid, prices of market-available, domestic products must be used for comparison in a request for waiver.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1787.12</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Non-availability or shortages.</SUBJECT>
            <P>By application pursuant to § 1787.10, the Administrator may waive the Buy American requirement upon a showing that there is no domestic product available in the market in sufficient and reasonable quantities and of satisfactory quality, and that such shortage of suitable domestic alternatives jeopardizes the project being completed on budget and/or according to scheduled planning. A lack of responsive and responsible bids to a well-publicized request for bids will be presumed to meet the conditions of a non-availability waiver. With respect to contracts that are not required to be bid, sufficient evidence must be presented to the Administrator in order to make a determination.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1787.13</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Public interest or impracticality.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) By application pursuant to § 1787.10, the Administrator may waive the Buy American requirement upon a showing that application of the requirement would be inconsistent with the public interest or impractical for the RUS Borrower. With respect to impracticality, an RUS Borrower may request a waiver upon a showing that the domestic product is incompatible or impractical to integrate with existing, significant capital infrastructure or existing, critical software already in use. Notwithstanding, the burden shall rest with the RUS Borrower to present how the use of the domestic product would create a hardship or negatively impact its project.</P>
            <P>(b) With respect to contracts that were approved by RUS based on a bidder or offer that originally certified compliance with the Buy America requirements, but which can no longer comply with such certification, the Administrator may grant an impracticality waiver based on a showing that the original certification was made in good faith and that the product cannot now be obtained domestically due to commercial impossibility or impracticability, or without undue hardship or a negative impact to the project.</P>
            <P>(c) In determining whether to issue any public interest waiver, the Administrator will consider all appropriate factors on a case-by-case basis, unless a general waiver has already been issued by the Administrator with respect to the product.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1787.14</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>General waivers.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The Administrator may issue a general waiver for all RUS Borrowers for a determinate period, if the Administrator finds that such manufactured or unmanufactured goods are in shortage regionally or nationally, so as to <PRTPAGE P="403"/>avoid the administrative burden of issuing individual, specific waivers.</P>

            <P>(b) The Administrator has determined that it is in the best interest of RUS to issue a permanent general public interest waiver from the Buy America requirements for “small purchases,” which shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for each program under the RE Act and amended as needed from time to time. In carrying out this exception, however, the Administrator shall ensure that contracts are not artificially fragmented.</P>

            <P>This appendix shows an example of how the 6 percent differential is applied to determine award of a bid. In response to a request for bids for a digital central office a borrower receives four responsive bids to the specification, three domestic bids and one nondomestic bid. The nondomestic bid is the apparent low bid. We will consider in our analysis the nondomestic bid and the lowest domestic bid as shown in the following table.</P>

            <P>In this example, 6 percent of the total material content in the nondomestic bid ($895,000) equals $53,700. This cost differential is added to the total nondomestic bid as shown in the following table.</P>

            <P>This total evaluated bid, (that is the nondomestic bid plus the 6% of the cost of its material content), is compared with all the domestic bids for award of the bid. In our example the domestic bid ($1,098,500) is lower than the nondomestic evaluated bid ($1,104,700).</P>
            <P>The domestic bid becomes the low bid and the domestic bidder gets award of the bid. This product is classified as domestic since the cost of the domestic components used in the product constitutes more than 50 percent of the cost of all the components used.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General insurance requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Borrowers will take out, as the respective risks are incurred, and maintain the classes and amounts of insurance in conformance with generally accepted utility industry standards for such classes and amounts of coverage for utilities of the size and character of the borrower and consistent with Prudent Utility Practice. Prudent Utility Practice shall mean any of the practices, methods, and acts which, in the exercise of reasonable judgment, in light of the facts, including but not limited to, the practices, methods, and acts engaged in or approved by a significant portion of the electric utility industry in the case of an electric borrower or of the telecommunications industry in the case of a telecommunications borrowers prior thereto, known at the time the decision was made, would have been expected to accomplish the desired result consistent with cost-effectiveness, reliability, safety, and expedition. It is recognized that Prudent Utility Practice is not intended to be limited to optimum practice, method, or act to the exclusion of all others, but rather is a spectrum of possible practices, methods, or act which could have been expected to accomplish the desired result at the lowest reasonable cost consistent with cost-effectiveness, reliability, safety, and expedition.</P>
              <P>(b) The foregoing insurance coverage shall be obtained by means of bond and policy forms approved by regulatory authorities having jurisdiction, and, with respect to insurance upon any part of the mortgaged property securing an RUS loan, shall provide that the insurance shall be payable to the mortgagees as their interests may appear by means of the standard mortgagee clause without contribution. Each policy or other contract for such insurance shall contain an agreement by the insurer that, notwithstanding any right of cancellation reserved to such insurer, such policy or contract shall continue in force for at least 30 days after written notice to each mortgagee of suspension, cancellation, or termination.</P>
              <P>(c) In the event of damage to or the destruction or loss of any portion of the mortgaged property which is used or useful in the borrower's business and which shall be covered by insurance, unless each mortgagee shall otherwise agree, the borrower shall replace or restore such damaged, destroyed, or lost portion so that such mortgaged property shall be in substantially the same condition as it was in prior to such damage, destruction, or loss and shall apply the proceeds of the insurance for that purpose. The borrower shall replace the lost portion of such mortgaged property or shall commence such restoration promptly after such damage, destruction, or loss shall have occurred and shall complete such replacement or restoration as expeditiously as practicable, and shall pay or cause to be paid out of the proceeds of such insurance form all costs and expenses in connection therewith.</P>
              <P>(d) Sums recovered under any policy or fidelity bond by the borrower for a loss of funds advanced under a note secured by a mortgage or recovered by any mortgagee or holder of any note secured by the mortgage for any loss under such policy or bond shall, unless applied as provided in the preceding paragraph, be used as directed by the borrower's mortgage.</P>

              <P>(e) Borrowers shall furnish evidence annually that the required insurance and fidelity coverage has been in force <PRTPAGE P="405"/>for the entire year, and that the borrower has taken all steps currently necessary and will continue to take all steps necessary to ensure that the coverage will remain in force until all loans made or guaranteed by RUS are paid in full. Such evidence shall be in a form satisfactory to RUS. Generally a certification included as part of the RUS Financial and Statistical Report filed by the borrower annually (RUS Form 7 or Form 12 for electric borrowers, RUS Form 479 for telecommunications borrowers, or the successors to these forms) is sufficient evidence of this coverage.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Flood insurance.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Borrowers shall purchase and maintain flood insurance for buildings in flood hazard areas to the extent available and required under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4001, <E T="03">et seq.</E>) The insurance should cover, in addition to the building, any machinery, equipment, fixtures, and furnishings contained in the building.</P>

              <P>(b) The National Flood Insurance Program (see 44 CFR part 59 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) provides for a standard flood insurance policy; however, other existing insurance policies which provide flood coverage may be used where flood insurance is available in lieu of the standard flood insurance policy. Such policies must be endorsed to provide:</P>
              <P>(1) That the insurer give 30 days written notice of cancellation or nonrenewal to the insured with respect to the flood insurance coverage. To be effective, such notice must be mailed to both the insured and RUS and other mortgagees if any and must include information as to the availability of flood insurance coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program, and</P>
              <P>(2) That the flood insurance coverage is at least as broad as the coverage offered by the Standard Flood Insurance Policy.</P>

                <P>The Insurer agrees with the Rural Utilities Service that such insurance as is afforded by the policy applies subject to the following provisions:</P>
                <P>1. The Insurer agrees that it will not use, either in the adjustment of claims or in the defense of suits against the Insured, the immunity of the Insured from tort liability, unless requested by the Insured to interpose such defense.</P>
                <P>2. The Insured agrees that the waiver of the defense of immunity shall not subject the Insurer to liability of any portion of a claim, verdict or judgment in excess of the limits of liability stated in the policy.</P>
                <P>3. The Insurer agrees that if the Insured is relieved of liability because of its immunity, either by interposition of such defense at the request of the Insured or by voluntary action of a court, the insurance applicable to the injuries on which such suit is based, to the extent to which it would otherwise have been available to the Insured, shall apply to officers and employees of the Insured in their capacity as such; provided that all defenses other than immunity from tort liability which would be available to the Insurer but for said immunity in suits against the Insured or against the Insurer under the policy shall be available to the Insurer with respect to such officers and employees in suits against such officers and employees or against the Insurer under the policy.</P>

              <EXTRACT>
                <P>1. The Contractor shall take out and maintain throughout the period of this Agreement insurance of the following minimum types and amounts:</P>
                <P>a. Worker's compensation and employer's liability insurance, as required by law, covering all their employees who perform any of the obligations of the contractor, engineer, and architect under the contract. If any employer or employee is not subject to workers' compensation laws of the governing State, then insurance shall be obtained voluntarily to extend to the employer and employee coverage to the same extent as though the employer or employee were subject to the workers' compensation laws.</P>
                <P>b. Public liability insurance covering all operations under the contract shall have limits for bodily injury or death of not less than $1 million each occurrence, limits for property damage of not less than $1 million each occurrence, and $1 million aggregate for accidents during the policy period. A single limit of $1 million of bodily injury and property damage is acceptable. This required insurance may be in a policy or policies of insurance, primary and excess including the umbrella or catastrophe form.</P>
                <P>c. Automobile liability insurance on all motor vehicles used in connection with the contract, whether owned, non-owned, or hired, shall have limits for bodily injury or death of not less than $1 million per person and $1 million each occurrence, and property damage limits of $1 million for each occurrence. This required insurance may be in a policy or policies of insurance, primary and excess including the umbrella or catastrophe form.</P>
                <P>2. The Owner shall have the right at any time to require public liability insurance and property damage liability insurance greater than those required in paragraphs (a)(1)(b) and (a)(1)(c) of this section. In any such event, the additional premium or premiums payable solely as the result of such additional insurance shall be added to the Contract price.</P>
                <P>3. The Owner shall be named as Additional Insured on all policies of insurance required in (a)(1)(b) and (a)(1)(c) of this section.</P>
                <P>4. The policies of insurance shall be in such form and issued by such insurer as shall be satisfactory to the Owner. The Contractor shall furnish the Owner a certificate evidencing compliance with the foregoing requirements that shall provide not less than 30 days prior written notice to the Owner of any cancellation or material change in the insurance.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(b) Electric borrowers shall also ensure that all architects and engineers working under contract with the borrower have insurance coverage for Errors and Omissions (Professional Liability Insurance) in an amount at least as large as the amount of the architectural or engineering services contract but not less than $500,000.</P>
              <P>(c) The borrower may increase the limits of insurance if desired.</P>
              <P>(d) The minimum requirement of $1 million of public liability insurance does not apply to contractors performing maintenance work, janitorial-type services, meter reading services, rights-of-way mowing, and jobs of a similar nature. However, borrowers shall ensure that the contractor performing the work has public liability coverage at a level determined to be appropriate by the borrower.</P>
              <P>(e) If requested by RUS, the borrower shall provide RUS with a certificate from the contractor, engineer, or architect evidencing compliance with the requirements of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) As provided in this subpart, RUS may, at its discretion, use the services of Consultants funded by a Borrower where such services will facilitate timely action on an Application by such Borrower for financial assistance or other approvals. Such Consultants may provide financial, legal, engineering, environmental or other technical advice and services in connection with the review of an Application.</P>
              <P>(b) With the approval of RUS, a Borrower may fund the cost of consulting services in connection with the review by RUS of an Application by such Borrower. Such funding shall be provided pursuant to the terms of a Funding Agreement between the Borrower and the Consultant designated by RUS.</P>
              <P>(c) RUS may not, without the consent of the Borrower, require, as a condition of processing any Application for approval, that the Borrower agree to pay the costs of a Consultant hired to provide services to RUS.</P>
              <P>(d) The government shall retain sole discretion in the selection of Consultants to provide services to RUS and the form of contract utilized. RUS may either use the services of one or more Consultants retained under Retainer Contracts or the government may elect to retain a Consultant not otherwise on retainer. The government shall have sole discretion to prescribe terms and conditions of Consultant Contracts. The Borrower may bring considerations to the attention of the government which the Borrower deems pertinent to the selection process.</P>
              <P>(e) RUS shall retain sole discretion as to whether to further pursue use of an outside consultant for the relevant application in the event the Borrower does not enter into the agreements referenced in § 1789.158(c)(3)(iii) within 60 days of the government providing to the Borrower the information set forth in § 1789.158(c)(3).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Approval criteria.</SUBJECT>
              <P>RUS will consider approving the use of consultant services funded by a Borrower on a case by case basis taking into account, among other matters, the following:</P>
              <P>(a) Whether such services are required to facilitate timely action on a Borrower's Application. RUS shall determine what represents timely action with respect to each Application considering, among other matters, the review period normally required for such projects by RUS and other lenders and the consequences to the Borrower of adjusting the review period.</P>
              <P>(b) The availability of staff resources, the priorities of other projects then before RUS, and the efficiencies to be realized from the use of consultant services.</P>
              <P>(c) Whether it is in the best interest of RUS to use Borrower-funded Consultants. Certain types of projects, such as those involving issues of program-wide significance, may not be well suited for the use of Borrower funded Consultants.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1789.156</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Proposal procedure.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In the event RUS determines that consideration should be given to the use of a Borrower-funded consultant in connection with the review of an Application, the RUS Regional Director or the Director of the Power Supply Division, as appropriate, will discuss with the Borrower the nature of the Application and the projected review period required of RUS. If RUS concludes that the projected review period will not result in timely action on the Application, and after being so notified in writing by RUS the Borrower wishes to fund consultant services to facilitate RUS review, the Borrower shall submit to the same Director a funding proposal. The proposal shall set forth the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Identification in the heading or caption as a Notice of Proposal to Fund Consulting Services;</P>
              <P>(2) Borrower's REA/RUS designation;</P>
              <P>(3) Borrower's legal name and address;</P>
              <P>(4) A description of the Application, critical issues and concerns relating to the Application, time deadlines, and the consequences of any delays in RUS review;</P>
              <P>(5) A description of the consulting service(s) that would facilitate timely RUS review of the Application; and</P>
              <P>(6) Such additional documents and information as RUS may request.</P>
              <P>(b) RUS will review the Notice of Proposal to Fund and any additional information RUS deems relevant in determining whether to proceed with procuring Borrower funded Consultants. If RUS proposes to utilize Legal Consultants, RUS must obtain the concurrence of the Office of General Counsel (OGC) of the Department of Agriculture. RUS will notify the Borrower in writing of its determination.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Implementation.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Upon making a determination to go forward with Borrower funding for <PRTPAGE P="411"/>consulting services, RUS shall initiate a procurement request for a Consultant to provide the services. The government may either contract with a Consultant on a case by case basis or elect to use a Consultant pursuant to an outstanding Retainer Contract. The Borrower will not be informed of the Consultant selected until such time as the government provides the information set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) If the government determines to contract with a Consultant on a case by case basis, the government shall notify the Borrower of the applicable procedures.</P>
              <P>(c) If the government determines to contract with a Consultant under an outstanding Retainer Contract, the following procedures will normally apply:</P>
              <P>(1) Pursuant to the terms of the contract, the government will prepare a draft Task Order requesting consultant services in connection with the review of the Borrower's Application. The draft Task Order shall set forth for the Consultant's review and acceptance, a description of the services to be provided and applicable time frames for the provision of such services.</P>
              <P>(2) The government will request that the Consultant:</P>
              <P>(i) Notify the government as to the acceptability of the form and substance of the draft Task Order;</P>
              <P>(ii) Notify the government as to its ability to provide a satisfactory conflict of interest certification consistent with the requirements of the FAR (48 CFR ch. 1); and</P>
              <P>(iii) Provide a cost estimate for the draft Task Order.</P>
              <P>(3) When the government is satisfied with the response(s) received pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the government shall promptly provide to the Borrower:</P>
              <P>(i) A copy of the draft Task Order identifying the Consultant;</P>
              <P>(ii) The Consultant's cost estimate for the draft Task Order; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Contract information required to enable the Borrower to develop a Funding Agreement, an Escrow Agreement and an Indemnification Agreement (the “agreements”).</P>
              <P>(4) The Borrower shall develop and submit to the government for approval executed originals of:</P>
              <P>(i) The agreements; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A certified copy of a resolution of the board of directors authorizing the Borrower to enter into the agreements and to take such other action as is necessary to effect the purposes of the agreements.</P>
              <P>(5) Upon receiving written RUS approval of the agreements and the form and substance of the board resolution, the Borrower shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Establish and fund the Escrow Account; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Provide written notice to the government of the Escrow Account number, the funding thereof, and such other information as required pursuant to the agreements.</P>
              <P>(6) After the Borrower has funded the Escrow Account, the government shall issue Task Order(s) for consultant services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Retainer Contract.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Contract administration.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The government shall be solely responsible for the administration of a Consulting Contract and shall have complete control over the scope of the Consultant's work, the timetable for performance, the standards to be applied in determining the acceptability of deliverables and the approval of payment of Invoices.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Access to information.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The Borrower shall not have rights in nor right of access to the work product of the Consultant. All analyses, studies, opinions, memoranda, and other documents and information provided by the Consultant pursuant to a Consulting Contract may be released and made available to the Borrower only with the approval of RUS. This section does not restrict release of information by RUS pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)) or other legal process.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1789.161</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Conflicts of interest.</SUBJECT>

              <P>The standard for determining organizational conflicts of interest shall be as set forth in the FAR subpart 9.5 (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.5); however, the <PRTPAGE P="412"/>identification of the existence of an organizational conflict of interest may be made by either the Administrator or the cognizant Contracting Officer. In the event an organizational conflict of interest is determined to exist, the cognizant Contracting Officer shall take the actions prescribed at FAR 9.504 (48 CFR 9.504) to attempt to avoid, neutralize or mitigate the conflict. Should these actions be deemed by the Administrator and the Contracting Officer to adequately resolve the conflict, the contracting action with the offeror/contractor may proceed. Should the Administrator or the Contracting Officer determine that an organizational conflict of interest still exists such that contract award or other contracting action cannot be taken (award of task/delivery order, etc.) the offeror/contractor shall be so informed by the Contracting Officer and be provided a reasonable opportunity to respond in accordance with FAR 9.504(e) (48 CFR 9.504(e)). After considering the contractor's response, if it is found by both the Administrator and Contracting Officer to remedy the conflict of interest, the contracting action may proceed. If the Administrator and Contracting Officer determine that the contractor's response does not resolve the conflict of interest, yet continuing with the contracting action with the offeror/contractor in question is considered in the best interest of the United States, a waiver in accordance with FAR 9.503 (48 CFR 9.503) may be executed. This waiver shall be submitted under the Contracting Officer's signature and approved by the Administrator. The Administrator has been delegated Head of Contracting Activity authority by the USDA Senior Procurement Executive solely for the purpose of waiver approval.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Indemnification agreement.</SUBJECT>
              <P>As a condition of approving Borrower funding, the government will require the Borrower to enter into an Indemnification Agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to RUS, providing that the Borrower will indemnify and hold harmless the government and any officers, agents or employees of the government from any and all liability, including costs, fees, and settlements arising out of, or in any way connected with the payment of the Consultant's fee pursuant to the Consultant Contract. The Indemnification Agreement may recognize, as a condition of liability thereunder, the rights of the borrower to prompt notice, to use of counsel of its own choosing, and to participation in any settlement of a claim against which indemnification is sought.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 (42 U.S.C. 7701 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) was enacted to reduce risks to life and property through the establishment and maintenance of an effective earthquake hazards reduction program (the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program or NEHRP). The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is designated as the agency with the primary responsibilities to plan and coordinate the NEHRP. This program includes the development and implementation of feasible design and construction methods to make structures earthquake resistant. Executive Order 12699 of January 5, 1990, Seismic Safety of Federal and Federally Assisted or Regulated New Building Construction (3 CFR, 1990 Comp., p. 269), <PRTPAGE P="414"/>requires that measures to assure seismic safety be imposed on federally assisted new building construction.</P>
              <P>(b) This subpart identifies acceptable seismic standards which must be employed in new building construction funded by loans, grants, or guarantees made by the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) or the Rural Telephone Bank (RTB) (or through lien accommodations or subordinations approved by RUS or RTB).</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 1806.2</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Companies and policies.</SUBJECT>

                <P>Property insurance policies or other evidence of insurance will be accepted <PRTPAGE P="420"/>from borrowers when the requirements outlined herein are complied with fully.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Companies.</E> It is desirable that companies be licensed to do business in the particular State or other jurisdiction where the property is located, or that they be otherwise authorized by law to transact business within such State or other jurisdiction (hereinafter called “State”). If the required insurance is not available locally at comparable rates from an insurance company licensed or otherwise authorized to do business in the State, insurance may be accepted from another company if (1) the OGC advises that policies issued by such company will not be rendered unenforceable by virtue of the company's failure to be licensed or otherwise authorized to transact business in the State and that the company is a legal entity which may be sued in the State where the insured property is located, and (2) the State Director determines that the company is reputable and financially sound. In making the above determinations, the State Director will consider all relevant available information such as that which may be obtained from financial statements, Best's Insurance Reports, State insurance authorities, and other lending institutions.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Insurance policies</E>—(1) <E T="03">Standard policies.</E> If a standard fire insurance policy has been adopted for the State, it should be used unless State statutes exempt the company from the regulations requiring its use. The standard policy is one containing substantially the same standard provisions adopted or recommended by legislative action or by order of the supervisory insurance authorities of the State in which the security is located.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Other policies.</E> To be acceptable, any other insurance policies must conform to the requirements of this Instruction.</P>
                <P>(i) “Homeowner's” policies, “All Physical Loss” policies, “Broad Form” policies, and other such all-inclusive policies are acceptable if they otherwise meet the requirements of this Instruction.</P>
                <P>(ii) A builder's risk policy naming the borrower as the insured or a builder's risk endorsement for a policy issued to the borrower may be accepted during the period a building is under construction if the policy otherwise meets the requirements of this Instruction. If such a policy or endorsement does not automatically convert to full coverage when the building is completed, acceptable insurance must be obtained simultaneously with the expiration of the builder's isk provisions of the policy.</P>
                <P>(iii) A builder's risk insurance policy issued to a contractor only may not be substituted for the property insurance, the borrower is required to provide.</P>
                <P>(iv) Borrowers eligible for insurance under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended by the Flood Disaster Act of 1973, will be serviced in accordance with subpart B of this part.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">State instructions.</E> If the State Director and the OGC consider it advisable, a State Instruction may be issued to help County Supervisors identify standard insurance policies adopted for the State. The Instruction should also furnish a guide to assist in identifying other acceptable insurance policy forms that are commonly used by insurance companies in the State, recognizing that such information is not all inclusive.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Binders.</E> Whenever there is a justifiable reason for not issuing a policy or endorsement, as required, a written binder will be acceptable for a period not to exceed 60 days from the effective date of the insurance. The written binder must have attached thereto the approved form of mortgage clause. Such a binder will be submitted to the County Supervisor in lieu of an insurance policy or endorsement and the insurance policy or endorsement will be submitted on or before the expiration date of the binder. The State Director, with the advice of the OGC and subject to prior approval of the National Office, may issue a State Instruction authorizing such binders to be accepted for periods longer than 60 days.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Submission of policies.</E> (i) For Farmer Program (FP) loans secured by a first lien, the original policy or declaration page must be delivered to the County Supervisor. The original policy or declaration page will be returned to the borrower after one year using Form <PRTPAGE P="421"/>RD 426-4, “Notice of Expiration of Insurance.”</P>
                <P>(ii) For Single Family Housing (SFH) loans secured by a first lien, the original policy or declaration page must be delivered to the closing agent.</P>
                <P>(iii) In cases where an FP or SFH loan is secured by other than a first lien and the mortgage clauses include the names of the prior mortgagees, a certificate of insurance, copy of the policy, or other evidence of insurance is acceptable.</P>
                <P>(iv) The County Supervisor will process an advance to pay for insurance only in strict compliance with provisions of § 1806.6 of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Master sets.</E> If the master sets meet all of the requirements of this Instruction they may be accepted in lieu of an original policy for each Agency borrower.</P>
                <P>(i) One complete master set of the different insurance forms for policies issued by the insurance company must be on file in each County Office where the company insures property of Agency borrowers.</P>
                <P>(ii) The “Declaration Page” furnished by the insurance company for each borrower insured, in lieu of a complete policy, will be filed in the borrower's case folder. When a “Declaration Page” in the form of a computer printout is used by an insurance company an endorsement on every policy issued by that company or a letter from that company will be obtained and attached to the printout. However, a letter signed by an authorized official of the company and addressed to the State Director may cover all policies issued by that company in the State. Any such endorsements or letters should clearly state that the company considers the printout to be an original “Declaration Page”. Such endorsements or letters are not necessary if the printout itself clearly states that it is an original “Declaration Page.”</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Name and location.</E> The policy should contain names of all the borrowers who are owners of the property being insured, and it will be returned for correction if it does not do so. The location of the property should be so described in the policy that the property can easily be identified. The complete legal description of the property by metes and bounds is not required. Any deviation from the requirements of this paragraph must first be cleared with the National Office.</P>
                <P>(8) <E T="03">Loss or damage covered.</E> Buildings must be insured against loss or damage by fire, lightning, windstorm, hail, explosion, riot, civil commotion, aircraft, vehicles, and smoke.</P>
                <P>(9) <E T="03">Effective date of insurance.</E> If there are insurable buildings located on the property, the borrower will arrange with his agent or company to have adequate insurance in force at the time the loan, assumption, or credit sale is closed so that the policy will properly insure the borrower and the mortgagees. When new buildings are erected or major improvements are made to existing buildings, such insurance will be made effective as of the date materials are delivered to the property. The County Supervisor will make no payments from loan funds for labor or materials until the borrower has furnished adequate insurance to protect the interest of the Agency in the buildings being erected or improved.</P>
                <P>(10) <E T="03">Term.</E> The borrower will be required to furnish insurance for a term of at least one year with evidence that a full year's premium is paid. The term “premium” as used herein includes any assessments which may be charged to the borrower. If the assessments are of the type imposed only after a loss occurs involving property insured by the insurance company, then the borrower must present evidence (such as a letter from the company) that he currently does not owe any such assessments. The borrower may receive a discount for insuring for a longer period such as three years or five years and with an annual premium. If the insurance contains an automatic renewal clause, its provision should be substantially the following to be acceptable to the Agency:
                </P>
                <EXTRACT>
                  <FP>This policy will be automatically extended for successive terms at expiration of the original term and of each extension thereof, upon payment of renewal premiums. It is a condition of this policy that if the policy expires or is canceled for nonpayment of premium, or for any other reason, the mortgagee will be given 10 days notice.</FP>
                </EXTRACT>
                
                <P>(11) <E T="03">Mortgage clause.</E> The standard mortgage clause adopted by the State <PRTPAGE P="422"/>must be attached to or printed in the policy, or Form RD 426-2, “Property Insurance Mortgage Clause (Without Contribution),” must be attached to or the provisions thereof printed in the policy. A letter signed by an authorized official of an insurance company to the State Director, stating that all insurance policies the company issues in the State and in which the Agency has a mortgage interest incorporates all of the provisions of Form RD 426-2 may be accepted in lieu of attaching Form RD 426-2 to each policy. If such a blanket letter is used, the Agency will be named in the loss payable clause and a State Instruction will be issued, after prior approval is obtained from the National Office, authorizing the use of such method.</P>
                <P>(i) If the use of a mortgage clause, other than the standard mortgage clause (without contribution), has been made mandatory by State laws or insurance regulations, a State Instruction will be issued, after prior approval is obtained from the National Office, authorizing the use of such a form.</P>
                <P>(ii) When an approved mortgage clause is printed in the policy a “Loss Payable Clause” is acceptable provided the Agency, as mortgagee, would receive payment in case of loss even though the company would not be liable to the borrower. A “Loss Payable Clause” which contains the statement that the mortgagee is “subject to all terms and conditions of the policy” is not acceptable.</P>
                <P>(iii) Whenever a new mortgage clause including the interest of the Agency is issued after the policy has been in force, the new mortgage clause must be signed by an authorized agent or officer of the company that issued the policy. Form RD 426-6, “Transmittal of Property Insurance Mortgage Clause,” may be used to transmit the mortgage clause to the insurance official.</P>
                <P>(iv) The Agency and all other mortgagees whose interests are insured by the policy will be shown either in the mortgage clause or in the “Declaration Page” in the order of priority of their mortgages.</P>
                <P>(A) “United States of America (Rural Development)” will be named in the mortgage clause for direct and insured loan mortgages naming the Agency as mortgagee, whether in its own right or as trustee under a 2(f) or other agreement with a State Rural Rehabilitation Corporation.</P>
                <P>(B) “United States of America (Rural Development), as first mortgagee or as statutory agent and insurer of such mortgagee,” will be named in the mortgage clause for insured FO mortgages naming the lender as mortgagee, whether the mortgage is held by the original or a subsequent lender or by the insurance fund or by the Agency under a trust agreement or declaration of trust.</P>
                <P>(C) If the designation is not identical to that set forth in paragraphs (b)(11)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section, whichever is applicable, it will be sufficient if the mortgagee is readily identifiable as Rural Development.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Evidence of premium payment.</E> (1) When Form RD 426-2 is attached to or the provisions thereof are printed in the policy, or a blanket letter from an insurance company incorporating the provisions of Form RD 426-2 in all policies in which the Agency has a mortgagee interest in effect, in accordance with paragraph (b)(11) of this section, no evidence of premium or assessment payment is required except for the first year of the loan. When a subsequent FP or section 502 RH loan is made to build, buy or rehabilitate essential buildings an endorsement to the existing policy including coverage for the property improved will be sufficient.</P>
                <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Policy restrictions.</E> (1) Any insurance on essential buildings as defined in § 1806.3 having restrictions which limit the amount of collectible insurance must meet the Agency requirements set forth below (except for the clause described in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section which is never acceptable); otherwise, such restrictions must be eliminated or modified to afford the required protection.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Coinsurance clause.</E> This clause generally provides that in consideration of a reduced rate, the borrower agrees to maintain insurance on his buildings up to a specified percentage (usually 80 percent) of their value and that the company will not be liable for a greater proportion of any partial loss than the amount of insurance bears to <PRTPAGE P="423"/>the specified percentage of either the undepreciated replacement value or the depreciated replacement value or the depreciated replacement value (actual cash value) of the buildings at the time of the loss. When the buildings are insured for the specified percentage of their value, the company, in the event of a partial loss, will be liable for the full amount of the loss not to exceed the amount of insurance. A coinsurance clause can be accepted only where the amount of insurance is at least equal to the specified percentage of either the undepreciated replacement value or the depreciated replacement value (actual cash value). For example, an 80 percent coinsurance clause can be accepted only where the amount of insurance on each insured building is at least equal to 80 percent of the appropriate replacement value of the insured building.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Three-fourths' value clause.</E> This clause provides that the liability of the company shall be limited to three-fourths of the depreciated replacement value of the buildings covered at the time of the loss, not to exceed the amount of insurance. This clause may be accepted if the unpaid balance of the loan is not greater than three-fourths of the depreciated replacement value of the building and the amount of insurance is at least equal to the unpaid balance of the loan and any prior liens and no building is insured for more than three-fourths of its depreciated replacement value.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Loss deductible clause.</E> (A) For all loans other than RRH, RCH, and LH organizations this clause generally provides that loss to each building to the extent of the limitation is not recoverable. The company is liable only for loss to each building in excess of such limitation stated in the clause. This clause may be accepted where the limitation does not exceed $150, or one percent of the insurance coverage whichever is greater. In no case, however, may the limitation on any one building exceed $500.00.</P>
                <P>(B) For RRH, RCH, and LH organization loans this clause generally provides that loss to each project to the extent of the limitation is not recoverable. The company is liable only for loss to each project in excess of such limitation stated in the clause. This clause may be accepted where the limitation does not exceed the option shown below that is chosen by the borrower and agreed to by the Loan Approving Official and properly annotated in the borrower file. The borrower and the Official should consider the economic impact to the project when selecting the appropriate option.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Option 1—Up to one-fourth of one percent (0.0025) of the insurable value. Maximum deductible $5,000.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Option 2—Up to a maximum deductible of $500 on any project with an insurable value not exceeding $200,000.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Option 3—Option 1 may be chosen and increased above the maximum deductible by an amount equivalent to funds specifically escrowed in the project replacement reserve account as an offset to the increased deductible.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Option 4—Option 2 may be chosen and increased above the maximum deductible by an amount equivalent to funds specifically escrowed in the project replacement reserve account as an offset to the increased deductible.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) The funds used to increase the deductible in Option 3 or Option 4 may be from project funds if it does not create an unsecure financial situation for the project. Also, non-project funds may be used for Option 3 or 4 and then repaid by withdrawal from the project at the rate of 75 percent of the annual insurance premium savings earned by the amount of escrow deposit, up to the amount deposited.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) The funds escrowed to increase the authorized deductible will be placed in the project reserve account as an increased amount in and above the amount required by the Loan Agreement/Resolution and so annotated in the borrower's accounting system.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Three-fourths' loss clause.</E> This clause provides that the company will not pay more than three-fourths of any loss, nor more than three-fourths of the amount of insurance in force. This clause is never acceptable and must be eliminated.</P>
                <P>(v) <E T="03">Deferred loss payable clause.</E> This clause provides that, if the amount payable under the policy for any loss to any building insured shall be in excess of a specified portion, (usually 60 percent) of the amount of insurance on <PRTPAGE P="424"/>such building, the company will withhold from its initial loss payment any sum in excess of the specified portion of the amount of insurance on such building. If the building sustaining such loss is repaired or replaced within six months from the date of the fire and at or within 300 feet of the original location, as described in the policy, the company upon receipt of evidence to that effect from the insured will pay the full balance withheld from the initial payment, provided the amount expended in repairing or replacing the building damaged or destroyed will equal or exceed the amount of loss as determined under the terms of the policy. Failure to repair or replace any insured building within the time and manner provided will constitute acceptance of the initial payment as full and final settlement under the policy with respect to the loss. This clause may be accepted if the amount of insurance is for the full depreciated replacement value (actual cash value) of the building and the unpaid balance of the loan and any prior lien(s) is not greater than the initial loss payment made by the company.</P>
                <P>(vi) <E T="03">Construction specifications and use conditions.</E> If the insurance policy contains clauses which specify certain standards of construction or prescribes certain uses of the property for the insurance to be valid, the policy is acceptable only if the property meets such specifications or conditions at the time of acceptance. For example, if the policy provides that the chimney be constructed of a certain type of material, the County Supervisor should be assured that the required material has been used, or if the policy provides that farming operations are not carried out on the premises he should be assured that this condition is met.</P>
                <P>(2) Policies generally will not be accepted if, under the terms of the policies or local laws, contributions or assessments may be made against the Agency. However, policies which impose assessments on the borrower may be accepted only if the Agency mortgage will be recorded prior to any failure of the borrower to pay any such assessments. Policies also will not be accepted if, by their terms or other conditions, loss payments are contingent upon collective action by the Board of Directors, or the stockholders, or the members.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Buildings on leaseholds.</E> The policy will indicate that the insured is the lessee or tenant and not the owner of the buildings securing the Agency loan; or, if he is the owner of the building on the leased land, the policy will indicate that the insured is the owner of the building, but not of the land. State Directors, with the advice of the OGC will issue State Instructions to meet any other special requirements needed to conform with the insurance requirements of the State to enable leaseholders to obtain property insurance for buildings which are security for the Agency loans.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Coverage requirements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The County Supervisor should encourage the borrower for his own protection to insure for their depreciated replacement value (actual cash value) all essential buildings. Essential buildings include the dwelling and any other buildings that are necessary for the operation of the property or that provide income to assure orderly repayment of the loan. If insurance is for less than the depreciated replacement value of all essential buildings, the County Supervisor will see that the coverage is obtained on one or more of the most essential buildings. The minimum amount of coverage will be furnished as prescribed below:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Loans secured by a first lien.</E> (1) When the unpaid balance of the Agency loan secured by a first lien is equal to or greater than the depreciated replacement value of the essential buildings, or the cost of adequate essential buildings which can be constructed for <PRTPAGE P="425"/>amounts less than the depreciated replacement value of the existing buildings, the essential buildings will be insured, to the nearest multiple of insurance that is available, for the lesser of (i) their depreciated replacement value, or (ii) the cost of constructing adequate essential buildings. For example, if insurance is available in only multiples of $1,000, the minimum insurance required on an essential building valued at $6,600 would be $7,000, and that required on an essential building valued at $6,400 would be $6,000.</P>
                <P>(2) When the unpaid balance of the loan is less than the sum of the depreciated replacement value of the essential buildings to be insured, the total amount of insurance must be at least equal to the lesser of (i) the unpaid balance of the loan, or (ii) the cost of adequate essential buildings which can be constructed for amounts less than the depreciated replacement value of the existing buildings to be insured.</P>
                <P>(3) When, by the use of loan funds or otherwise, buildings are erected or substantial improvements are made to essential buildings, the amount of insurance will be adjusted in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section, whichever is applicable.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Loans secured by other than first liens.</E> The amount of insurance on buildings in the case of Agency loans secured by other than a first lien will be the same as required in paragraph (a) of this section, with the understanding that the unpaid balance of the loan will be deemed for this purpose to be the amount of the total real estate mortgage indebtedness owed all prior mortgagees named in the mortgage clause, plus the debt to the Agency which is secured by real estate mortgage.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Exception of buildings from insurance.</E> (1) Insurance will not be required on a building:</P>
                <P>(i) That is not essential.</P>
                <P>(ii) In such a state of disrepair that the cost of insurance would be prohibitive.</P>
                <P>(iii) Which has a depreciated replacement value of $2,500 or less.</P>
                <P>(iv) Which is being or has been repaired with a section 504 loan of $7,500 or less. Families receiving section 504 loans should be encouraged but not required to carry insurance on their home.</P>
                <P>(v) On LH security property which was not built or repaired with Agency loan funds provided that the State Director determines that the land and other structures adequately secure the Agency loan and any prior liens.</P>
                <P>(vi) On which the hazards are so slight because of the character and construction of the building, or the cost of the insurance is so high in comparison with the value of the building that, according to common standards of judgment, it should not be insured, including but not limited to windmills, silos, and fire-cured tobacco barns.</P>
                <P>(vii) In cases where the unpaid balance of the Agency loans and any prior liens have been reduced to $2,500 or less, property insurance need not be required if the borrower wants to discontinue it, provided the County Supervisor determines that the value of the land security itself is sufficient to protect the Agency in its collection of the amount of the outstanding indebtedness.</P>
                <P>(viii) If insurance for windstorm and hail to meet all Agency requirements is not available in a hurricane area, the County Supervisor may accept from the borrower or applicant the windstorm and hail insurance policy that most nearly conforms to Agency requirements. If such an exception is made, the situation should be fully documented in the borrower's case file. However, if the best insurance policy a borrower or applicant can obtain at the time he receives a loan contains a loss deductible clause for windstorm and hail damage exceeding $250 or 10 percent of the actual cash value of the buildings, whichever amount is greater, the insurance policy, with an explanation of the reasons why more adequate insurance is not available will be submitted to the State Office for prior approval.</P>

                <P>(2) <E T="03">Expiration records and notices.</E> (i) In cases other than those involving FP or section 502 RH borrowers, the County Supervisor will notify the borrower of the expiration of his insurance at least 30 days in advance of such expiration unless he has received written evidence that the insurance has been renewed.</P>
                <P>(ii) FP and Section 502 RH borrowers will be informed during the tenth month after the date of loan closing of their responsibility to carry insurance. Form RD 426-4 will be sent to these borrowers, regardless of whether there is evidence that the insurance has been renewed. Thereafter, the County Supervisor will not be required to further determine whether the borrower has adequately maintained insurance; however, if a further notice of expiration is received in the County Office, the County Supervisor will again notify the borrower by using RD 426-4 of his responsibility.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Release of mortgage interest.</E> When the borrower's loan has been paid in full and the satisfaction or release of the mortgage has been executed, the County Supervisor or his delegate will execute the following Release of Mortgage Interest on the mortgage clause attached to the policy or other evidence of insurance and transmit it with the policy or other evidence of insurance, the paid-in-full note, and the satisfaction to the borrower:
                </P>
                <EXTRACT>
                  <FP>It is understood and agreed that the interest of the United States of America in the property insured hereunder ceased as of (Date of Final Payment), and that the Government shall have no interest in any loss or damage to such property occurring thereafter.</FP>
                </EXTRACT>
                
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Lost or misplaced policies.</E> When an unexpired insurance policy or other evidence of insurance is lost or misplaced, it will be necessary to obtain a replacement policy or other evidence of insurance. The County Supervisor is authorized to sign a Lost Policy Receipt on behalf of the Agency. For FP and section 502 RH loans, this paragraph applies only during the period the policy is retained in the County Office.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Disposition of expired and canceled policies.</E> An expired or canceled policy or other evidence of insurance will be returned to the borrower, unless there is a loss settlement pending.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Special servicing of insurance</E>—(1) <E T="03">Vacancy or unoccupancy—tenant occupancy—increased hazard.</E> If the County Supervisor has knowledge that insured property is vacant or unoccupied or that the ownership or occupancy has changed from owner to tenant, or that the hazards otherwise are increased, he will examine the policy to determine whether the policy permits such conditions. Unless the insurance permits such conditions, the County Supervisor will immediately notify the company or agent in writing. In any case where there is an additional premium due because of vacancy, unoccupancy, tenant occupancy, or other increased hazard, upon demand to the Agency from the company or agent because the borrower cannot, or will not, pay the additional premium, it may be paid in accordance with RD Instruction 2024-A, to the company or agent. For FP and section 502 RH borrowers, property insurance will not be obtained except in cases where an unusual and severe hazard exists and insurance is necessary to protect the interests of the Government.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Transfer of property.</E> (i) When a borrower or transferee requests the consent of the Agency to a transfer of the security property which already has been made, or when the County Supervisor learns that any such transfer <PRTPAGE P="427"/>has been made, he will immediately inform the transferee that the mortgage requires the owner to provide and maintain adequate insurance acceptable to, and with loss payable to, the Agency as mortgagee. The transferee may obtain a new insurance policy or the transferor may have the insurance company or agent issue an endorsement to the current insurance policy changing the name of the assured to that of the transferee. If a new insurance policy is obtained, the old policy or other evidence of insurance will be returned to the transferor unless there is an unsettled loss. If there is an unsettled loss, the policy or other evidence of insurance will not be returned until the claim has been settled. The County Supervisor, with the concurrence of the State Director and the OGC, will notify the borrower and transferee that acceptance of the new policy or endorsement will not constitute consent by the Government to the transfer even though the Government is protected by a loss payable clause in such an insurance policy.</P>
                <P>(ii) In a transfer with assumption, insurance will be required in the same amount and according to the same provisions as for an initial loan of the same type.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Voluntary conveyance of property to the Government and foreclosure.</E> Insurance will not be carried on buildings which the Government has acquired. After a foreclosure sale has been held, or after a deed of conveyance to the Government in lieu of foreclosure has been filed for record, insurance will not be maintained by the Government (whether or not subject to redemption).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Losses.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Protecting property.</E> It is the responsibility of the borrower to immediately notify the County Supervisor and insurance company or agent of any loss or damage to insured property and collect the amount of the loss. When the County Supervisor learns of a loss to property which secures an Agency loan, he will:</P>
                <P>(1) Check the borrower's casefile for an insurance policy or other evidence of insurance. When a policy or other evidence of insurance has not been retained by the Agency, such as for FP and section 502 RH borrowers, the County Supervisor will determine whether the property was insured and whether the Agency was named as mortgagee in the insurance policy.</P>
                <P>(2) Determine that the borrower has taken such steps as are necessary to protect the interest of the Agency in the security property against further damage. When serious problems arise with respect to protecting the property from further damage, the borrower cannot or will not arrange adequate protection for the property, or when legal action appears to be necessary, the County Supervisor will arrange for emergency protection and immediately refer the case with complete information to the State Director.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Loss covered by insurance.</E> (1) If the Agency is listed as mortgagee in the insurance policy, the County Supervisor will collect the amount of the loss and may consent to the borrower using funds to repair or replace damaged or destroyed property or to apply loss proceeds to his loan account or to any prior liens that might exist in the order of their priority.</P>
                <P>(2) If the Agency is not listed as mortgagee in the insurance policy, the County Supervisor will contact the borrower to determine whether he has received the loss proceeds. If the borrower has received the loss proceeds but not yet paid for improvements to repair or replace the property, or has not received the loss proceeds the County Supervisor will:</P>
                <P>(i) Notify the insurance company in writing of the Agency's interest in the security property and request that the loss proceeds be made payable jointly to the Agency and the borrower.</P>
                <P>(ii) Inform the borrower of his responsibility for repairing or replacing the damaged or destroyed property or for authorized disposition of the loss proceeds as outlined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Loss drafts—when loan is secured by a first mortgage.</E> (1) A loss draft which <PRTPAGE P="428"/>in the opinion of the County Supervisor represents a satisfactory adjustment of the loss will be endorsed immediately without recourse and deposited in a supervised bank account to be used in repairing or replacing the damaged building, except:</P>
                <P>(i) Where the amount of the loss is $1,000 or less and the borrower will use the funds for repairing or replacing an essential building, the loss draft may be endorsed without recourse and given to the borrower upon satisfactory proof that the repairs or replacements have been made, or upon satisfactory assurance that the work will be performed.</P>
                <P>(ii) When (A) the essential buildings are not to be repaired or replaced and other suitable buildings are not to be erected, or (B) a balance remains after all repairs, replacements, and other authorized disbursements have been made, such insurance funds will be applied on prior liens or as an extra payment to the borrower's loan accounts secured by the real estate or disposed of in accordance with the general principles applicable to the use of proceeds from the sale of a part of the security contained in applicable security servicing regulations for the type loan involved.</P>
                <P>(iii) An insurance payment for loss or damage to a nonessential building the borrower voluntarily insured will be (A) applied on prior liens, or to current delinquencies to the Agency or as an extra payment on the borrower's loan accounts secured by real estate, (B) disposed of as authorized by the State Director in accordance with the general principles applicable to the use of proceeds from the sale of a part of the security contained in applicable security servicing regulations for the type loan involved, or (C) used for other purposes as authorized by the State Director if the loan is adequately secured and the loan account is current.</P>
                <P>(iv) When the indebtedness secured by the insured property has been paid in full or the draft is in payment for loss of property on which the Agency has no claim, a loss draft which includes the Agency as a joint payee may be endorsed without recourse and delivered to the borrower.</P>
                <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Loss drafts—When loan is secured by other than first mortgage.</E> (1) When the loss draft does not include the interest of a prior mortgagee, it will be processed as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) When the loss draft includes the interest of a prior mortgagee, the County Supervisor is authorized to endorse and process the draft as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) When the prior mortgagee will permit the use of such loss funds to repair or replace the damaged building, the draft may be endorsed without recourse upon satisfactory proof that the repairs or replacements have been made or upon satisfactory assurance that the work will be performed.</P>
                <P>(ii) When the amount of the draft does not exceed the amount of the indebtedness then secured by the prior mortgage as stated in writing by the holder of the prior mortgage, and the holder of the prior mortgage has agreed in a written statement to the County Supervisor that he will apply such funds as a payment on the borrower's prior mortgage indebtedness, the draft may be endorsed without recourse.</P>
                <P>(iii) When the amount of the draft exceeds the amount of the indebtedness then secured by the prior mortgage, as stated in writing by the holder, and he has agreed in writing to pay such indebtedness from the loss funds, the draft will be endorsed without recourse only after all parties named as payees in the draft have signed an agreement to deliver the draft “in escrow” to a bank acceptable to the named parties. The agreement will specify the manner in which the funds will be disbursed by the bank, as escrow agent, to the several mortgagees named in the draft. After the loss funds have been collected by the bank, it will issue cashier's checks in the manner prescribed in the escrow agreement (see exhibit A for suggested form). If this procedure is found to be impractical in an individual instance, the State Director may authorize an alternative method for disbursing the loss funds to protect the Government's financial interest.</P>

                <P>(iv) Drafts which have been endorsed by all other payees will be endorsed immediately without recourse. Such drafts or other loss funds will be processed in accordance with the methods <PRTPAGE P="429"/>described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Servicing insurance losses under special circumstances</E>—(1) <E T="03">Foreclosures and voluntary conveyances.</E> Losses on properties in process of foreclosure or voluntary conveyance will be handled with the advice of the OGC. If the necessary cooperation of the borrower cannot be obtained, the State Director, with the advice of the OGC, will determine the proper action to be taken. To the extent feasible from a legal and practical standpoint, all loss payments should be received for a damaged or destroyed building and applied on the borrower's real estate indebtedness before title to the property is taken by the Government through foreclosure sale, voluntary conveyance, or otherwise, unless absolute assignment has been made by the borrower to the Government of all loss funds due from the insurance company.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Subrogation agreements.</E> When a company claims nonliability to the borrower and subrogation to the rights of the Agency, the County Supervisor will forward a full report of the facts in the case to the State Director. The State Director will upon advice from OGC, instruct the County Supervisor regarding further action to be taken.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Repairs and replacements.</E> When any loss payments have been deposited in a supervised bank account, all repairs and replacements done by or under the direction of the borrower, or by contract, will be planned, performed, inspected, and paid for in the same manner as improvements financed with loan funds.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Completing adjustment.</E> The borrower must complete the adjustment of the loss with the company or its authorized representatives. The County Supervisor, upon request of the borrower may consult with the borrower regarding the loss adjustment, but will not enter into negotiations with insurance adjusters or company representatives relative to the adjustment or settlement of losses on borrower property, or make any commitments, or sign any forms in connection with the adjustment of the loss. The Agency will not waive any rights which it may have against the company except when the borrower's account or the Agency claim has been paid-in-full.</P>
                <P>(1) The County Supervisor will maintain a proper followup on all losses until satisfactory settlement has been made by the company.</P>
                <P>(2) Where the County Supervisor has evidence that the adjustment agreed to by the borrower is significantly less than the amount of damage to which the borrower is entitled under the terms of the policy, the loss draft accompanied by a report will be sent to the State Director so that he may reopen the adjustment, if he considers it is in the interest of the Agency to do so.</P>
                <P>(3) When it appears evident that the amount of the loss is $1,000 or less, the County Supervisor may rely on estimates of contractors, building supply firms, reliable carpenters, or other evidence rather than personal inspection in determining whether the adjustment is equitable and the Government's interest is protected.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Reinstatement after loss.</E> In cases where insurance in the amount of the loss is not reinstated automatically by the provisions of the policy, it will be the responsibility of the County Supervisor to have the borrower reinstate as much of the insurance as may be necessary to fulfill the requirements of the Agency.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Losses not covered by insurance.</E> When a loss occurs and insurance is not in force, the County Supervisor will:</P>
                <P>(1) Inform the borrower that he has violated the security instrument by not providing insurance coverage and that it is his responsibility to make the needed replacements or repairs.</P>
                <P>(2) If the borrower is unable or unwilling to make needed repairs or replacements from his own resources, the County Supervisor will submit complete information to the Agency official authorized to determine whether the Agency will or will not continue with the loan. The County Supervisor's report will include recommendations on the following items:</P>
                <P>(i) The advisability and possibility of making a subsequent loan to pay for needed repairs.</P>

                <P>(ii) Subordination of the Agency real estate lien to permit the borrower to <PRTPAGE P="430"/>obtain funds for needed repairs from another source.</P>
                <P>(iii) The possibility of the borrower obtaining funds secured by a junior lien from another source.</P>
                <P>(iv) Whether an advance is needed to protect the Government's interest in the property.</P>
                <P>(3) If the loan will not be continued with the borrower, it must be serviced in accordance with the applicable Instructions.</P>
                <P>(4) If the borrower has improperly disposed of loss proceeds, the County Supervisor will refer the case with complete information and recommendations to the State Director. The State Director will consult the Regional Attorney when necessary and advise the County Supervisor as to appropriate servicing actions.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 1806.6</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Failure of borrower to provide insurance.</SUBJECT>

                <P>When a borrower fails to provide and maintain property insurance which meets the requirements set forth in § 1806.2 of this subpart, every effort will be made to have the borrower provide coverage acceptable to the Agency. It will be emphasized that under the terms of the security instrument, it is the borrower's responsibility to provide and maintain proper insurance coverage. Existing borrowers required to escrow will be notified by letter at least 90 days prior to initiating escrowing for insurance. Failure to provide insurance is a nonmonetary default and will be a consideration in determining if the loan is to be continued. For FP or SFH borrowers <E T="03">not</E> required to escrow, the County Supervisor will obtain insurance coverage and voucher for the insurance premium only in cases where: An unusual and severe hazard, such as recurring fires or unstable ground conditions, exists, or, an SFH borrower on a moratorium is unable to pay the insurance premium and the borrower requests that the Agency pay the premium. For SFH borrowers required to escrow, force placed insurance will be obtained if the borrower fails to provide acceptable insurance. Borrowers being phased into escrow will be given at least 30 days to obtain coverage, after which force placed insurance will be obtained. If the escrow account contains insufficient funds to pay the insurance when due, the County Supervisor will request the borrower to pay an amount equal to the difference between the premium due and the escrow balance in a lump sum within 30 days after notification. If the borrower fails to remit the amount requested, the amount will be advanced and charged to the borrower's account as a recoverable cost. The amortization period for an advance due to an escrow shortage will be one year. Insurance coverage shall be provided continuously unless the property is acquired by the Agency. The cost of obtaining such a policy shall be advanced and charged to the borrower's account as a recoverable cost. Amortization of the charge will be handled in accordance with 7 CFR part 3550. If a borrower indebted for other than an FP or SFH loan fails to provide acceptable insurance, the Servicing Official will take the following action:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Expired policies.</E> (1) The County Supervisor will request the insurance agency or broker who issued the expired policy to issue a new policy which is acceptable to the Agency.</P>
                <P>(i) The new policy will be effective as of the date of the County Supervisor's contact with the insurance agency or broker or as soon thereafter as possible, and will be for a term of one year. If State insurance regulations require a longer term, the State Director will issue a State Instruction authorizing County Supervisors to obtain policies for the minimum period permitted by State insurance regulations.</P>
                <P>(ii) The Agency will be shown in the loss payable clause and in the mortgage clause in the proper order of priority.</P>
                <P>(iii) Insurance coverage on each building usually will be the same as shown on the expired policy if it meets or exceeds Agency requirements. If the coverage shown on the expired policy does not meet Agency requirements, proper coverage will be obtained.</P>

                <P>(iv) The County Supervisor will, if possible, have an automatic renewal provision included in the policy.<PRTPAGE P="431"/>
                </P>
                <P>(v) If the borrower refuses to pay the insurance premium with his own funds or arrange with the agent for subsequent payment by premium not or otherwise, the County Supervisor will pay the amount of the insurance premium in accordance with RD Instruction 2024-A. The amount of the premium payment will be charged to the borrower's Agency account with the highest lien priority as a recoverable cost item.</P>
                <P>(vi) If the insurance agency or broker who issued the expired policy refuses to issue a new policy, the County Supervisor will have the borrower designate in writing another insurance agency or broker from whom the insurance can be obtained.</P>
                <P>(vii) After the County Supervisor and the borrower exhaust all efforts to obtain acceptable insurance, the County Supervisor will request advice from the State Office as to companies issuing acceptable policies in the State and from which the borrower might be able to obtain an acceptable policy. If the borrower still cannot obtain an acceptable policy from any such company, and the determination has been made to continue with the borrower, the County Supervisor will temporarily accept from the borrower the available insurance policy the Agency determines most nearly conforms to the requirements of § 1806.2 of this subpart.</P>

                <P>(A) In making this determination, the following deficiencies become more objectionable in the order from (<E T="03">1</E>) to (<E T="03">5</E>) paragraphs (a)(1)(vii)(A) of this section:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A policy written for an initial term of less than one year.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A policy which will insure the most essential buildings but will not cover all essential buildings.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) A policy which covers major risks such as fire and lightning, but does not include one or more of the other risks specified in § 1806.2(8).</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) A policy for a lesser amount of insurance than is required by § 1806.3.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) A policy that is issued by a company which is not licensed to do business in the State or otherwise does not meet the requirements of § 1806.3.</P>
                <P>(B) Whenever adequate insurance becomes available, the County Supervisor will require the borrower to deliver to the County Office an acceptable insurance policy. The temporary policy will be returned to the borrower for cancellation after all losses claimed under the policy have been settled.</P>
                <P>(C) If the borrower is unable to furnish a property insurance policy of any kind, he is still responsible for the debt in the event of loss.</P>
                <P>(D) If the County Supervisor accepts an inadequate insurance policy under these conditions or the borrower fails to furnish any insurance policy, the County Supervisor will include in his report to the State Director an explanation of the efforts he and the borrower made to obtain acceptable insurance and his justification for accepting an inadequate policy, or for not obtaining an insurance policy of any kind.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Insurance canceled for reasons other than nonpayment of insurance premium.</E> (1) The County Supervisor, immediately upon receipt of a 10-day notice of cancellation for a policy, will urge the borrower to provide acceptable insurance.</P>
                <P>(2) If the borrower fails to provide acceptable insurance before the cancellation is effective, the County Supervisor will contact the insurance agency or broker who issued the insurance policy to determine the reasons for cancellation and, if possible, have the policy reinstated.</P>
                <P>(3) If the insurance company will not reinstate the policy, the County Supervisor will attempt to obtain an acceptable insurance policy from another agency or broker in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Insurance canceled for nonpayment of premium.</E> (1) The County Supervisor, immediately upon receiving a 10-day cancellation notice for a policy, will, if possible, contact the borrower in an effort to have him pay the insurance premium from his own funds or arrange with the agent for subsequent payment by premium note, or otherwise.</P>

                <P>(2) If the borrower does not pay or arrange to pay the premium before the policy cancellation is effective, the County Supervisor will, before the cancellation becomes effective, notify the insurance company or broker by certified mail (return receipt requested), that the Agency as mortgagee (or <PRTPAGE P="432"/>trustee) will pay the premium for one year to continue the policy in effect for that period. The County Supervisor will, in accordance with RD Instruction 2024-A, pay the amount of the premium for a period of one year. The amount of the premium will be charged to the borrower's loan account as a recoverable cost item.</P>
                <P>(3) If a property insurance mortgage clause other than Form RD 426-2 is used in connection with the policy and the insurance company or broker refuses to accept payment from the Agency in this manner to reinstate or continue the policy, the County Supervisor will attempt to obtain an acceptable insurance policy from another insurance company or broker in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

                <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> This subpart prescribes the policies and procedures to be followed in implementing the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 as amended by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. The provisions of these Acts are applicable to Rural Development and Farm Service Agency, herein referred to as the “Agency” authorities permitting financing of buildings of any type now located in or to be located in special flood or mudslide prone areas as designated by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and any machinery, equipment, fixtures and furnishings contained or to be contained therein. This subpart does not apply to Farm Service Agency, Farm Loan Programs and to Rural Rental Housing, Rural Cooperative Housing, or Farm Labor Housing programs of the Rural Housing Service.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Background.</E> The Congress has found that annual losses throughout the nation caused by floods and mudslides are increasing at an alarming rate, largely as a result of the accelerated development and concentration of populations in areas subject to floods and mudslides. The availability of Federal funds in the form of loans, grants, guarantees, insurance and other forms of financial assistance are often determining factors in the utilization of land and the location and construction of industrial, commercial and residential facilities.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Scope.</E> The National Flood Insurance Program (the program) was authorized and created because the private insurance industry has been unable to provide insurance coverage at <PRTPAGE P="433"/>reasonable prices for such natural disasters as floods and mudslides. Subsidized and affordable insurance has been made available under the Act through an agreement between the Federal Insurance Administration and the National Flood Insurers Association.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Areas of responsibility.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Federal Insurance Administration</E> (<E T="03">FIA</E>). (1) Identify and publish information with respect to all areas in the country which are subject to floods and mudslides and designate those areas on Flood Hazard Boundary maps.</P>
                <P>(2) Notify affected communities of their designations and encourage them to adopt and enforce land use and other control measures and to adopt ordinances or laws which will regulate and control construction in areas designated as having special flood or mudslide hazards.</P>
                <P>(3) Make flood insurance available at reasonable rates in sufficient amounts, within the statutory limits, to adequately protect owners against loss to their buildings and contents when those buildings are located in or will be located in designated special flood and mudslide prone areas in communities participating in the National Flood Insurance Program.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">The Agency.</E> The State Director, after being notified by the National Office or FIA of designated flood or mudslide hazard areas and receiving flood hazard boundary maps identifying the hazard areas, FIA insurance rate charts, or other information concerning the program, will inform the appropriate County Supervisors and provide them the maps, rate charts, and other relevant information concerning the program in areas they serve. Permanent records indicating the date a community was notified as containing identified flood hazard areas, communities participating in the program, and communities eligible to participate but not participating in the program will be maintained in the State Office. County Supervisors will notify, in writing, those borrowers whose insurable buildings are located in designated flood or mudslide hazard areas of the availability of national flood insurance and encourage them to obtain flood insurance to protect their and the Government's financial interest.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Community.</E> Communities are required to participate in the National Flood Insurance Program within 1 year after notification of its formal identification as a community containing one or more special flood and mudslide prone areas, or by July 1, 1975, whichever is later, or be denied Federal financial assistance or Federally-related financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes in such areas. Communities wishing to qualify for the program may submit a completed application to: Administrator, Federal Insurance Administration, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Lender.</E> The lender must determine whether real property is located in an area identified as having special flood or mudslide hazards and cannot discharge the responsibility merely by obtaining a self-certification from the applicant that the property is not located in an area having special flood hazards.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Conditions.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The Agency financial assistance may be extended to eligible applicants meeting the eligibility requirements of § 1806.24 of this subpart, provided the following conditions are also met:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Dwelling and multi-unit housing facilities.</E> (1) If the financial assistance is to buy a dwelling or multi-unit housing facility:</P>
                <P>(i) The first floor elevation of the habitable space of the dwelling or housing unit must be above the 100-year flood level.</P>
                <P>(ii) The housing must be served by public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems that are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage, or have an onsite water supply system and waste disposal system located so as to avoid impairment of such systems and contamination from the waste disposal system to the water supply system from flooding.</P>

                <P>(2) If the financial assistance is to build or provide substantial improvement, the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be met and all construction must meet requirements of the applicable development standards, and:<PRTPAGE P="435"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) A building permit must be issued by the appropriate governing officials having jurisdiction in the area and compliance must be had with the zoning code or other established legal requirements of the area for reducing or eliminating flood or mudslide damage.</P>
                <P>(ii) The structure must be designed and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure.</P>
                <P>(iii) Construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant to flood damage must be used.</P>
                <P>(iv) Construction methods and practices that will minimize flood damage must be followed.</P>
                <P>(3) If the financial assistance is to make minor repairs, the conditions of paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) and (2) (i), (ii) and (iii) of this section must be met or the building must have existed on the site prior to the date the area was identified as having special flood or mudslide hazards and the loan approval official must determine that the dwelling is suitable as a residence.</P>
                <P>(4) When applications for financial assistance are received in areas identified as having special flood and mudslide hazards, the loan approval official will consider the expected severity and frequency of floods and mudslides in determining whether any housing loans should be made in the area. He should be sure, if loans are made, that the objectives of the loans can be accomplished and the Government's financial interest will be adequately protected.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Nonresidential buildings.</E> Construction plans and specifications for new buildings or improvements to existing buildings must comply with flood plain area management or control laws, regulations or ordinances.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Flood insurance coverage.</E> (1) Any property on which flood insurance is required must be covered by such insurance during its anticipated economic and useful life in an amount at least equal to its development or replacement cost (except estimated land cost), or to the maximum limit of coverage made available with respect to the particular type of property under the National Flood Insurance Program, whichever is less. However, if the financial assistance provided is in the form of a loan, the amount of flood insurance required need not exceed the outstanding principal balance of the loan and need not be required beyond the term of the loan.</P>
                <P>(2) The contents of a building must be insured separately from a building but coverage cannot be written on the contents of a three-walled machinery shed or similar type open building.</P>
                <P>(3) Flood insurance shall not be required on any state owned property that is covered under an adequate state policy of self-insurance satisfactory to the Secretary of HUD, who will publish a list of states with such policies.</P>
                <P>(4) It will be emphasized that under the terms of the security instrument it is the borrower's responsibility to provide and maintain proper flood insurance coverage. If flood insurance is not provided on any property for which it is required, the flood insurance premium will be paid to protect the Government's security interest. For borrowers required to escrow for flood insurance, payment of the premium will be handled in accordance with § 1806.28 of this subpart. Existing borrowers required to escrow will be notified by letter at least 90 days prior to initiating escrowing for flood insurance. If the Agency pays the flood insurance premium for borrowers not required to escrow, the cost will be charged to the borrower's account as a recoverable cost. Failure to provide flood insurance is a nonmonetary default and will be a consideration in determining if the loan is to be continued.</P>

                <P>For borrowers required to use escrow accounts for the payment of real estate taxes and insurance, the flood insurance premium will be paid when due from funds contained in the escrow account. If the escrow account contains insufficient funds to pay the flood insurance premium when due, the County Supervisor will request the borrower to pay an amount equal to the difference between the premium due and the escrow balance in a lump sum within 30 days after notification. If the borrower fails to remit the amount requested, the amount will be advanced and charged to the borrower's account as a recoverable cost. The amortization period for an advance due to an escrow shortage will be one year. Amortization of the charge will be handled in accordance with7 CFR part 3550. When a borrower has more than one loan secured by the real estate on which the flood insurance premium is being paid, the advance will be charged to the initial or lowest numbered loan.</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Sale of developed sites.</E> The sites developed with a section 524 loan must be for housing low- and moderate-income families and may be sold to families, nonprofit organizations, public agencies, and cooperatives eligible for assistance under any section of title V of the Housing Act of 1949, or under any other law which provides financial assistance.

                <P>(e) <E T="03">Obligations incurred before loan closing.</E> When an applicant files an application for a loan, the county supervisor will advise the applicant that development work must not be started and obligations for work, materials, or land purchase must not be incurred before the loan is closed. If, nevertheless, the applicant incurs obligations for work, materials, or land purchase before the loan is closed, the State director may authorize the use of loan funds to pay such obligations only when he finds that all the following conditions exist:</P>
                <P>(1) The obligations were incurred after the applicant filed a written application for a loan.</P>
                <P>(2) The applicant is unable to pay such obligations from its own resources or to obtain credit from other sources, and failure to authorize the use of loan funds to pay such debts would impair the applicant's financial position.</P>
                <P>(3) The obligations were incurred for authorized loan purposes.</P>
                <P>(4) Contracts, materials, development and any land purchase meet RD standards and requirements.</P>

                <P>(5) Payment of the obligations will remove any liens which have attached, and any basis for liens that may attach, to the property on account of <PRTPAGE P="441"/>such obligations or such work, materials, or land purchase.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Special conditions.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Evidence of need.</E> Loans will be made on the basis of the applicant providing firm information as to the number of sites to be developed and evidence of a need for the proposed building sites in the locality.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Nondiscrimination.</E> The borrower will be required to agree not to discriminate or permit discrimination, in accordance with section 3 of the loan resolution form “(‘Rural Housing Site’ Loan to Nonprofit Corporation),” available at all RD offices.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Supervisory assistance.</E> Supervision will be provided borrowers to the extent necessary to achieve the objectives of the loan and to protect the interests of the Government. County supervisors will counsel with applicants in selecting locations that will provide essential services and facilities and will result in the development of desirable residential communities.</P>

The cost of the facilities should be considered as a cost of developing the sites and included in the price charged for the lots when they are sold.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Compliance with local codes and regulations.</E> Planning and development of sites will comply with all State, county, and local planning and zoning requirements, and will be for housing that will conform with any applicable laws, ordinances, codes, and regulations governing such matters as construction, heating, plumbing, electrical installation, fire prevention, health, and sanitation.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Optioning of land.</E> If a loan includes funds to purchase real estate, the applicable provisions of subpart A of part 1943 regarding options will be followed.

                <P>(i) <E T="03">Use of and accountability for loan funds.</E> Supervised bank accounts will not be used except when their requirement is made or authorized by the State director for cases where adequate bonding is not available. If a supervised bank account is used, collateral for deposits of funds will be pledged when the supervised bank account exceeds $100,000. All loan funds and funds from other sources to be used to pay the development costs of the site, as well as proceeds from the sale of any sites, will be deposited in accordance with part 1902, subpart A of this chapter. The county supervisor will see that funds for land purchase are paid to the seller simultaneously with loan closing. After the loan is closed, monthly reports will be provided to Rural Development of all disbursements made and income received by the borrower. Reports for each month will be submitted to the Rural Development county office during the first 10 days of the next month. No expenditures will be made without prior Rural Development consent for items which are not included in the Rural Development approved development cost estimate or for amounts greater than those set forth in such estimate.</P>

In other cases, the county supervisor will determine whether a surety bond is required.</P>
                <P>(2) The applicant will provide fidelity bond coverage for its officers and employees entrusted with the receipt, custody, and disbursement of its funds and the custody of any other negotiable or readily saleable personal property. The amount of the bond will be at least equal to the maximum amount of such funds including funds in bank accounts, and property that the applicant will have in its possession or control at any one time. If permitted by State law, the United States will be named coobligee in the bond. Form RD, “Position Fidelity Schedule Bond,” may be used if permitted by State law.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Conditional commitments for construction of homes on developed sites.</E> Conditional commitments may be issued on sites developed with an RHS section 524 loan to permit homes to be constructed on sites prior to the sale of the site to an eligible purchaser in accordance with the following:</P>
                <P>(1) The requirements of 7 CFR 3550.70 must be met and a conditional commitment issued prior to the start of construction of the home.</P>
                <P>(2) The conditional commitment must be issued to an RHS borrower who can legally provide the proposed housing and has the experience and training in construction to the extent necessary to assure that the housing will be built or jointly to the RHS loan borrower and a builder who has the legal capacity, training and experience necessary to construct the housing. In all cases the following language will be added under “other conditions” on Form RD 1944-11, “Conditional Commitment”:</P>
                <P>(i) “Not withstanding the other provisions of this commitment the sale of completed homes on sites developed with section 524 Rural Housing Site loans will be limited to families eligible for assistance under any section of title V of the Housing Act of 1949 or under any other law which provides financial assistance for housing low- and moderate-income families. The approval of Rural Development will be obtained prior to the sale of each home. The request for approval shall be submitted to the local Rural Development office along with an application for an RH 502 loan or a financial statement from the purchaser and verification of the other credit that is available.”</P>
                <P>(ii) The benefits of the nonprofit development of the site(s) must be passed on to the purchaser. This will result in this site being sold for $___ (price to be determined as provided for in (§ 1822.275(b))).</P>
                <P>(3) In arriving at the commitment price for the site and the completed home, the value will be based on the present market value of the house only, plus the nonprofit selling price of the lot.</P>
                <P>(4) If in order to obtain interim financing for the construction of the homes, the RHS loan borrower requests a subordination by Rural Development on individual lots, the State Director may approve the subordination by completing and executing a subordination in the format of exhibit C of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(5) The government's lien on any lot will be released only at the time of sale to an eligible purchaser.</P>

                <P>(6) The County Supervisor should provide the necessary supervision to assure that the RHS loan borrower takes the necessary action to assure that all qualified builders in the area are aware of the availability of rural housing sites and are given an equal opportunity to participate in this conditional commitment program. As a minimum, the borrower will be required to submit a signed statement indicating the actions taken including <PRTPAGE P="443"/>names and dates of contacts with builders.</P>

                <P>(2) Review the applicant's articles of incorporation and bylaws.

                <P>Loans made by Rural Development are authorized and executed pursuant to Federal programs adopted by Congress to achieve national purposes of the U.S. Government.</P>
                <P>(a) Instruments evidencing or securing a loan payable to or held by the Rural Development, such as promissory notes, bonds, guaranty agreements, mortgages, deeds of trust, financing statements, security agreements, and other evidences of debt or security shall be construed and enforced in accordance with applicable Federal law.</P>
                <P>(b) Instruments evidencing a guarantee, conditional commitment to guarantee, or a grant, such as contracts of guarantee, grant agreements or other evidences of an obligation to guarantee or make a grant, executed by the Rural Development, shall be construed and enforced in accordance with applicable Federal law.</P>
                <P>(c) In order to implement and facilitate these Federal loan programs, the application of local procedures, especially for recordation and notification purposes, may be utilized to the fullest extent feasible and practicable. However, the use of local procedures shall not be deemed or construed to be any waiver by Rural Development of Federal immunity from any local control, penalty, or liability, or to subject Rural Development to any State required acts or actions subsequent to the delivery by Rural Development officials of the instrument to the appropriate local or State official.</P>

                <P>(d) Any person, corporation, or organization that applies for and receives any benefit or assistance from Rural Development that offers any assurance or security upon which Rural Development relies for the granting of such benefit or assistance, shall not be entitled to claim or assert any local immunity, privilege, or exemption to defeat <PRTPAGE P="459"/>the obligation such party incurred in obtaining or assuring such Federal benefit or assistance.</P>

In all cases in which there has been a disposition without authorization by Rural Development of personal property mortgaged to that agency, any auctioneer involved in said disposition shall be liable to the Government for conversion—notwithstanding any State statute or decisional rule to the contrary.</P>

                <P>(4) Do not have a business or close personal association with the recipient.</P>
                <P>(b) No provision of this subpart takes precedence over individual program requirements or restrictions relating to eligibility for Rural Development assistance to Rural Development employees, members of families of employees, close relatives, or business or close personal associates of employees.</P>
                <P>(c) The determination of a case's need for special handling under the provisions of this subpart is not an adverse action and, therefore, is not subject to appeal.</P>

Regardless of whether the relationship or association is defined in § 1900.152, if the employee believes there may be a potential conflict of interest, the Rural Development official who is processing or servicing the assistance may be notified and special handling requested.

The State Director reviews the information, determines the need for special handling, designates the processing/servicing official, completes and submits RD Guide Letter 1900-D-3 to the Administrator for written concurrence. When the Administrator's concurrence is received, the State Director returns completed RD Guide Letter 1900-D-3 to the original official who completes the action described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

Each participant in FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 housing program shall pursue affirmative fair housing marketing policies in soliciting buyers and tenants, in determining their eligibility and in concluding sales and rental transactions.</P>

                <P>(v) Posting in a conspicuous position on each property and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 construction site a sign displaying the equal opportunity logo or the following statement:
                </P>
                <EXTRACT>
                  <P>We are pledged to the letter and spirit of U.S. policy for the achievement of equal housing opportunity throughout the nation.

When illustrations or persons are included they shall depict persons of both sexes and of majority and minority groups.</P>
                <P>(4) The affirmative fair housing marketing plans or evidence that the participant is covered by an approved voluntary affirmative marketing agreement must be submitted as follows:</P>

                <P>The preamble to regulations establishing a new part 60-4 to 41 CFR chapter 60 published at 43 FR 14888-14894, April 7, 1978, states that OFCCP contemplates proposing standards and goals for minorities within the very near future. Until that notice has been proposed and final action taken, construction contractors and subcontractors will continue to be subject to the goals and timetables for minority utilization on Federal and federally assisted construction existing now under Executive order 11246. Such goals are published in appendix B.</P>
                <P>Now, therefore, based on the foregoing and 41 CFR part 60-4, each contracting agency, each applicant, and each contractor shall include the appropriate goal set forth in appendix A and appendix B in all invitations for bids or other solicitations for federally involved construction contracts in excess of $10,000. The goals in appendix A hereby are established on a nationwide basis as the standards for female utilization for all trades.</P>
                <P>Appendix B established the goals for minority utilization which shall be applicable for the respective areas set forth in appendix B.</P>
                <P>Appendix A and appendix B shall be effective with respect to transactions for which the invitations for bids or other solicitations or amendments thereto are sent, on or after May 8, 1978.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Scope.</SUBJECT>
                <P>FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will evaluate all undertakings for possible HA significance. This subpart covers the following types of undertakings:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Undertakings requiring a historical and archeological assessment.</E> Although the following undertakings are presumed to involve nonfederally owned lands, they may have an effect on properties having HA significance and, therefore, will require a historical and archeological assessment:</P>
                <P>(1) Loans and grants for the development of business and industry including guaranteed loans.</P>
                <P>(2) Loans and grants for multiple family housing projects of 25 or more dwelling units.</P>
                <P>(3) Subdivision plans submitted for approval having 25 or more building sites.</P>
                <P>(4) Loans and grants in rural areas to construct, enlarge, extend, or otherwise improve:</P>
                <P>(i) Community water, sanitary sewage, solid waste disposal, and storm waste water disposal systems.</P>
                <P>(ii) Other essential community facilities such as fire and rescue, health, safety, public buildings, schools, transportation, traffic, and law enforcement.</P>
                <P>(5) Loans to develop community irrigation, drainage, and other soil and water conservation and use facilities.</P>
                <P>(6) Loans to acquire and develop grazing land for livestock of an association of members.</P>
                <P>(7) Loans in areas designated by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), to conserve and develop natural resources and to contribute to economic improvement of the area.</P>

                <P>(9) Loans to permit Indian tribes to buy land within their reservations.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Undertakings presumed not to require a historical and archeological assessment.</E> The following undertakings are generally presumed to involve nonfederally owned lands and not to have an effect on properties of historical and archeological value and will therefore not usually require a historical and archeological assessment. However, when the State Director or County Supervisor finds or has had communication or obtains information from a recognized historical and archeological authority that a specific undertaking may have an effect on a property included or eligible for inclusion in the National Register, a historical and archeological assessment will be made.</P>
                <P>(1) Loans to farmers and ranchers in rural areas for the purchase, development, and operation of farms and ranches.</P>
                <P>(2) Loans to individual families in rural areas for the purchase, construction, or improvement of single family residences.</P>
                <P>(3) Loans and grants for multiple family housing projects of not more than 24 family dwelling units.</P>
                <P>(4) Subdivision plans submitted for approval having 24 or less building sites.</P>
                <P>(5) Loans to farmers, ranchers, and other rural residents to develop land, water, and other related resources for increased production of food and other crops, improved pastures, feed crops, water facilities for livestock, and improved habitats for fish and wildlife.</P>
                <P>(6) Emergency and disaster loans to farmers, ranchers and other rural residents in declared or designated areas as a result of a major or national disaster.</P>

                <P>(a) The FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 official, normally the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 County Supervisor, who receives a preapplication or application for loan or grant assistance on an undertaking that may have an effect on HA properties will, as part of the process, take the following actions:<PRTPAGE P="485"/>
                </P>
                <P>(1) Carefully review the State supplements issued by the State Director pursuant to § 1901.262(a) to determine whether there are any properties within the project area that appear in the National Register.</P>
                <P>(2) Document the following:</P>
                <P>(i) A brief narrative report of the findings and conclusions of an on-site reconnaissance of the project area.</P>
                <P>(ii) Any “in-house” knowledge of known or suspected HA sites in the project area.</P>
                <P>(3) Submit the information outlined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Director as part of the preapplication or application.</P>
                <P>(b) Upon receipt of the preapplication/application the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Director will, as a concurrent part of the preapplication/application review, prepare a historical and archeological assessment of the undertaking. In making the assessment the State Director will consider information from the following sources:</P>
                <P>(1) State and Regional Clearinghouse comments.</P>
                <P>(2) Information submitted by the County Supervisor pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(3) Factual comments or recommendations of the SHPO or other responsible Federal, State, or local officials.</P>
                <P>(4) Any other reliable information concerning properties in the project area having HA significance.</P>
                <P>(c) Upon completion of the preapplication or application review, the State Director will take the following actions:</P>
                <P>(1) When his assessment indicates that no properties of HA significance will be effected by the proposed undertaking, he will proceed with processing of the preapplication or application.</P>
                <P>(2) When his assessment indicates that there are properties included in the National Register that may be effected by the proposed undertaking, he will in consultation with the SHPO, the applicant and its representatives, and other appropriate historical and archeological authorities plan appropriate measures to avoid or mitigate any adverse effects. He will also notify the Advisory Council and Secretary of the Interior of the proposed undertaking, and of its possible effect on the National Register properties and provide them with a copy of the proposed plan in order to afford them a reasonable opportunity for comment. Comments that are received with 45 calendar days of notification in accordance with the requirements for comment as outlined in section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, will be considered in further development of the undertaking.</P>
                <P>(3) When his assessment indicates that there are properties thay may be eligible for inclusion in the National Register, based on his application of the National Register criteria, he will request the Regional Director of the National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, Attention: Interagency Archeological Services, in writing, to cause a survey of the project area to be made to determine the significance of the properties in accordance with section 3(b) of Pub. L. 93-291. The State Director's letter to the Regional Director should request a response within 45 calendar days as to whether the National Park Service intends to cause a survey to be made, declines to undertake a survey, or that a survey is not warranted based on available data. The addresses of the Regional Offices of the National Park Service are listed in exhibit A of this subpart. If no response is received within the 45-day period, the State Director will proceed as outlined in paragraph (c)(7) of this section.</P>
                <P>(4) The State Director will cooperate fully with the National Park Service in the conduct of a survey should one be undertaken to assure that:</P>
                <P>(i) The professional archeologist/historian conducting the survey provides his written opinion as to the eligibility of any identified properties for inclusion in the National Register.</P>
                <P>(ii) When the professional archeologist/historian recommends recovery, protection, or preservation of identified properties, the National Park Service is requested to undertake this project.</P>

                <P>(5) When the survey made in paragraph (c)(3) of this section does not <PRTPAGE P="486"/>identify any historical and archeological properties that may be eligible for inclusion in the National Register, or the National Park Service is not going to undertake activity pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the State Director, after consultation with the SHPO and the National Park Service, will document the findings and proceed with processing of the application.</P>
                <P>(6) When the survey identifies properties that may be eligible for inclusion in the National Register, the State Director will request the SHPO to proceed with the nomination of such properties. The State Director will then proceed as outlined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section for any properties accepted for inclusion in the National Register.</P>
                <P>(7) When the National Park Service declines to cause a survey to be made or determines that one is not warranted, the State Director will document such facts and proceed with processing of the application.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Actions to be taken when archeological properties are discovered during construction.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) When properties of significant HA value are discovered during construction, the State Director will immediately consult with the applicant, the SHPO and the Regional Director of the National Park Service to determine whether there is sufficient factual evidence to warrant a decision to stop construction and undertake detailed survey and recovery.</P>
                <P>(b) When the consultations in paragraph (a) of this section result in a determination by the National Park Service to request the applicant to stop construction, such stop action should be taken so that the Park Service can initiate measures for immediate recovery within 60 days after notification of a discovery.</P>
                <P>(c) When the consultations in paragraph (a) of this section do not result in a determination by the National Park Service to stop construction and to undertake a survey and recovery, construction should be permitted to proceed with caution. In the event that the National Park Service determines that recovery is necessary, the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 applicant/borrower and the Park Service should determine that the consent of all persons, associations, or public entities having legal interests in the property involved has been secured. Also, the applicant should be informed that the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to compensate any person, association, or public entity damaged as a result of delay in construction or as a result of the temporary loss of the use of public or any nonfederally owned land.</P>
                <P>(d) No survey or recovery work will be required which in the determination of the State Director would seriously impede FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 actions in providing assistance where the State Director determines that immediate action is required to avoid loss or damage of life or property. Nevertheless, appropriate measures will be taken to the extent practical to preserve, protect, or mitigate any damage to properties having HA significance.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Coordination with other agencies.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) When other Agencies are directly involved in any undertaking that requires a historical and archeological assessment, the State Director will contact the Agencies concerned to determine if a joint assessment will be prepared and whether a single lead Agency will assume primary responsibility for preparing the assessment.</P>
                <P>(b) When a lead Agency is agreed upon other than FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will provide that Agency with information about its respective areas of responsibility. Assessments will indicate Agency participation and concurrence.</P>
                <P>(c) When FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 program activities are planned that primarily supplement those of the SCS, USDA, such as watershed projects, resource conservation and development measures, and irrigation and drainage projects, the SCS will be designated as the lead Agency.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority of Reserve bank.</E> Each Reserve bank is hereby authorized in accordance with the provisions of this subpart to:</P>
                <P>(1) Issue book-entry Rural Development securities by means of entries on its records which shall include the name of the depositor, the amount, the securities title (or series) and maturity date.</P>
                <P>(2) Effect conversions between book-entry Rural Development securities and definitive Rural Development securities.</P>

                <P>(4) Issue a confirmation of transaction in the form of a written advice (serially numbered or otherwise) which specifies the amount and description of any securities (that is, the securities title (or series) and the maturity date) <PRTPAGE P="490"/>sold or transferred and the date of the transaction.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope and effect of book-entry procedure.</E> (1) A Reserve bank as fiscal agent of the United States acting on behalf of Rural Development may apply the book-entry procedure provided for in this subpart to any Rural Development securities which have been or are hereafter deposited for any purpose in accounts with it in its individual capacity under terms and conditions which indicate that the Reserve bank will continue to maintain such deposit accounts in its individual capacity, notwithstanding application of the book-entry procedure to such securities. This paragraph shall be applicable but not limited to Rural Development securities deposited:</P>
                <P>(i) As collateral pledged to a Reserve bank (in its individual capacity) for advances by it.</P>
                <P>(ii) By a member bank for its sole account.</P>
                <P>(iii) By a member bank held for the account of its customers.</P>
                <P>(iv) In connection with deposits in a member bank of funds of States, Municipalities, or other political subdivisions.</P>
                <P>(v) In connection with the performance of an obligation or duty under Federal, State, Municipal, or local law, or judgments or decrees of courts.</P>
                <P>(2) The application of the book-entry procedure under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not detract from or adversely affect the relationships that would otherwise exist between a Reserve bank in its individual capacity and its depositors concerning any deposit under this paragraph. Whenever the book-entry procedure is applied to such Rural Development securities, the Reserve bank is authorized to take all action necessary in respect of the book-entry procedure to enable such Reserve bank in its individual capacity to perform its obligation as depositary with respect to such Rural Development securities.</P>
                <P>(3) A Reserve bank as fiscal agent of the United States acting on behalf of Rural Development may apply the book-entry procedure to Rural Development securities deposited as collateral pledged to the United States under Treasury Department Circular Nos. 92 and 176, both as revised and amended, and may apply the book-entry procedure, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, to any other Rural Development securities deposited with a Reserve bank as fiscal agent of the United States.</P>
                <P>(4) Any person having an interest in Rural Development securities which are deposited with a Reserve bank (in either its individual capacity or as fiscal agent of the United States) for any purpose shall be deemed to have consented to their conversion to book-entry Rural Development securities pursuant to the provisions of this subpart and in the manner and under the procedure prescribed by the Reserve bank.</P>
                <P>(5) No deposits shall be accepted under this section on or after the date of maturity or call of Rural Development securities.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Transfer or pledge.</E> (1) A transfer or pledge of book-entry Rural Development securities to a Reserve bank (in its individual capacity or as fiscal agent of the United States), or to the United States, or to any transferee or pledgee eligible to maintain an appropriate book-entry account in its name with a Reserve bank under this subpart is effected and perfected, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, by a Reserve bank making an appropriate entry in its records of the securities transferred or pledged. The making of such an entry in the records of a Reserve bank shall:</P>
                <P>(i) Have the effect of a delivery in bearer form of definitive Rural Development securities.</P>
                <P>(ii) Have the effect of a taking of delivery by the transferee or pledgee.</P>
                <P>(iii) Constitute the transferee or pledgee a holder.</P>
                <P>(iv) If a pledge, effect a perfected security interest therein in favor of the pledgee. A transfer or pledge of book-entry Rural Development securities effected under this paragraph shall have priority over any transfer, pledge, or other interest, theretofore or thereafter effected or perfected under paragraph (c)(2) of this section or any other manner.</P>

                <P>(2) A transfer or pledge of transferable Rural Development securities, or <PRTPAGE P="491"/>any interest therein, which is maintained by a Reserve bank (in its individual capacity or as fiscal agent of the United States) in a book-entry account under this subpart, including securities in book-entry form under § 1901.506(b)(1)(iii) is effected, and a pledge is perfected by any means that would be effective under applicable law to effect a transfer or to effect and perfect a pledge of Rural Development securities, or any interest therein, if the securities were maintained by the Reserve bank in bearer definitive form. For purposes of transfer or pledge hereunder, book-entry Rural Development securities maintained by a Reserve bank shall, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, be deemed to be maintained in bearer definitive form. A Reserve bank maintaining book-entry Rural Development securities, either in its individual capacity or as fiscal agent of the United States, is not a bailee for the purposes of notification of pledges of these securities under this paragraph, or a third person in possession for the purposes of acknowledgment of transfers thereof under this paragraph. Where transferable Rural Development securities are recorded on the books of a depositary (a bank, banking institution, financial firm, or similar party, which regularly accepts in the course of its business Rural Development securities as a custodial service for customers, and maintains accounts in the names of such customers reflecting ownership of or interest in such securities) for account of the pledgor or transferor thereof and such securities are on deposit with a Reserve bank in a book-entry account hereunder, such depositary shall, for purposes of perfecting a pledge of such securities or effecting delivery of such securities to a purchaser under applicable provisions of law, be the bailee to which notification of the pledge of the securities may be given or the third person in possession from which acknowledgment of the holding of the securities for the purchaser may be obtained. A Reserve bank will not accept notice or advice of a transfer or pledge effected or perfected under this paragraph and any such notice or advice shall have no effect. A Reserve bank may continue to deal with its depositor in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, notwithstanding any transfer or pledge effected or perfected under this paragraph.</P>
                <P>(3) No filing or recording with a public recording office or officer shall be necessary or effective with respect to any transfer or pledge of book-entry Rural Development securities or any interest therein.</P>
                <P>(4) A Reserve bank shall, upon receipt of appropriate instructions, convert book-entry Rural Development securities into definitive Rural Development securities and deliver them in accordance with such instructions. No such conversion shall affect existing interest in such Rural Development securities.</P>
                <P>(5) A transfer of book-entry Rural Development securities within a Federal Reserve Bank shall be made in accordance with procedures established by the Reserve bank not inconsistent with this subpart. The transfer of book-entry Rural Development securities by a Reserve bank may be made through a telegraphic transfer procedure.</P>
                <P>(6) All requests for transfer or withdrawal must be made prior to the maturity or date of call of the securities.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Withdrawal of Rural Development securities.</E> (1) A depositor of book-entry Rural Development securities may withdraw them from a Reserve bank by requesting delivery of like definitive Rural Development securities to itself or on its order to a transferee.</P>
                <P>(2) Rural Development securities which are actually to be delivered upon withdrawal may be issued in bearer or registered form.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Delivery of Rural Development securities.</E> A Reserve bank which has received Rural Development securities and effected pledges, made entries regarding them, or transferred or delivered them according to the instructions of its depositor is not liable for conversion or for participation in breach of fiduciary duty even though the depositor had no right to dispose of or take other action in respect of the securities. A Reserve bank shall be fully discharged of its obligations under this subpart by the delivery of Rural Development securities in definitive form to its depositor or upon the <PRTPAGE P="492"/>order of such depositor. Customers of a member bank or other depositary (other than a Reserve bank) may obtain Rural Development securities in definitive form only by causing the depositor of the Reserve bank to order the withdrawal thereof from the Reserve bank.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Registered securities.</E> (1) No formal assignment shall be required for the conversion to book-entry Rural Development securities of registered Rural Development securities held by a Reserve bank (in either its individual capacity or as fiscal agent of the United States) on the effective date of this subpart for any purpose specified in § 1901.506(b)(1). Registered Rural Development securities deposited thereafter with a Reserve bank for any purpose specified in § 1901.506(b) shall be assigned for conversion to book-entry Rural Development securities.</P>
                <P>(2) The assignment which shall be executed in accordance with the provisions of subpart F of 31 CFR part 306, so far as applicable, shall be to Federal Reserve Bank of ____, as fiscal agent of the United States acting on behalf of the Rural Development, United States Department of Agriculture, for conversion to book-entry Rural Development securities.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Servicing book-entry Rural Development securities, payment of interest, payment at maturity or upon call.</E> Interest becoming due on book-entry Rural Development securities shall be charged to the general account of the Treasurer of the United States on the interest due date and remitted or credited in accordance with the depositor's instructions. Such securities shall be redeemed and charged to the same account on the date of maturity or call, and the redemption proceeds, principal, and interest shall be disposed of in accordance with the depositor's instructions.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Issuance and redemption.</E> (1) In those instances where the Reserve bank is acting as fiscal agent of the United States acting on behalf of Rural Development, the following subparts of Treasury Department Circular No. 300 (31 CFR part 306), so far as applicable, shall apply to such certificates.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 1901.507</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Certificates of beneficial ownership by the Rural Development Finance Office.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Orders and payment.</E> Orders for investment in certificates may be placed with the Finance Office by mail, telephone, or in person. Payment for purchase of certificates may be made by a wire transfer to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for credit to the Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, by a certified check or bank draft payable to the Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. The rate of interest paid on the certificate will be the rate in effect on the date the Finance Office receives the payment.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Registration.</E> (1) The registration used must express the actual ownership of a certificate and may not restrict the authority of the owner to dispose of it in any manner. Rural Development reserves the right to treat the registration as conclusive ownership. Request for registration must be clear, accurate, and complete, and include the appropriate taxpayer identifying number or social security number.<PRTPAGE P="493"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) The registration of all certificates owned by the same person, organization, or fiduciary should be uniform with respect to the name of the owner and, in case of fiduciary, the description of the fiduciary capacity. Individual owners should be designated by the names by which they are ordinarily known or under which they do business, preferably including at least one full given name. The name of an individual may be preceded by an applicable title, as, for example “Mrs.”, “Mr.”, “Miss”, “Ms.”, “Dr.”, or “Rev.”, or followed by a designation such as “M.D.”, “D.D.”, “Sr.”, or “Jr.”, Any other similar suffix should be included when ordinarily used or when necessary to distinguish the owner from another member of his family. The address should include, where appropriate, the name and street, route, or any other location feature, and zip code.</P>
                <P>(3) If an erroneously inscribed certificate is received, it should not be altered in any respect. Rural Development should be given full particulars about the error and asked to furnish instructions.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Transfers and exchanges—closed periods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Transfer of registered certificates should be made by assignment in accordance with this section. Registered securities are eligible for denominational exchange. Specific instructions for issuance and delivery of new certificates signed by the owner or the owner's authorized representative must accompany the certificates presented. Certificates presented for transfer must be received by Rural Development not less than 1 full month before the date on which they mature. Any certificates so presented which are received too late to comply with this provision will be accepted for payment only.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Closing of transfer books.</E> The transfer books are closed for 1 full month preceding interest payment dates. If the date set for closing falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, the books will be closed as of the close of business on the last business day preceding that date. The books are reopened on the first business day following the date on which interest falls due. Registered certificates which have not matured, or have been submitted for transfer and are received when the books are closed for that certificate, will be processed on or after the date such books are reopened. If certificates are received for transfer when the books are closed for payment of final interest at maturity, the following action will be taken in the absence of different instructions:</P>
                <P>(i) Payment of final interest will be made to the registered owner of record on the date the books were closed.</P>
                <P>(ii) Payment of principal will be made to the assignee under a proper assignment of the certificate.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Redemption or payment</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Certificates are payable in regular course of business at maturity. Rural Development may provide for the exchange of maturing certificates. The registered certificates should be presented and surrendered for redemption at the Rural Development Finance Office. No assignments or evidence in support of them will be required by or on behalf of the registered owner or assignee for redemption for his or its account, or for redemption-exchange if the new certificates are to be registered in exactly the same names and forms as in the registrations or assignments of the certificates surrendered.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Redemption at maturity.</E> Registered certificates presented and surrendered for redemption at maturity need not be assigned unless the owner desires that payment be made to some other person. Should the owner so desire assignments should be made to the “ Rural Development for redemption for the account of (inserting name and address of person to whom payment is to be made).” Specific instructions for the issuance and delivery of the redemption check signed by the owner or the owner's authorized representative must accompany the certificates unless included in the assignment. Payment of the principal and interest will be made by a check drawn on the Treasurer of the United States to the order of the person entitled and mailed in accordance with the instructions received. If instructions are not received concerning interest, interest will be paid to the registered owner.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Interest.</E> The interest on Rural Development certificates accrues and is <PRTPAGE P="494"/>payable annually. A full interest period does not include the day on which the last preceding interest became due, but does include the day on which the next succeeding interest payment is due. Certificates will cease to bear interest on the date of their maturity. The interest on registered certificates is payable by checks drawn on the Treasurer of the United States to the order of the registered owners, except as otherwise provided in this section. Rural Development prepares the interest checks in advance of the interest payment date and ordinarily mails them in time to reach the addressees on that date. Interest on a registered certificate which has not matured and which is presented for any transaction when the books for that certificate are closed will be paid by check drawn to the order of the registered owner of record. On receipt of notice of the death or incompetency of an individual named as registered owner, a change in the name or in the status of a partnership, corporation, or unincorporated association, the removal, resignation, succession, or death of a fiduciary or trustee, delivery of interest checks will be withheld pending receipt and approval of evidence showing who is entitled to receive the interest checks. If the inscriptions on certificates do not clearly identify the owners, delivery of interest checks may be withheld pending reissue of the certificates in the correct registration, except as provided in this section. The final installment of interest will be paid by check drawn to the order of the registered owner of record on presentation and surrender of the certificate for redemption. To assure timely delivery of interest checks, owners should promptly notify Rural Development of any change of address.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Assignments.</E> Assignments of certificates should be executed by the owner or the owner's authorized representative in the presence of an officer authorized to certify assignments. Registered certificates may be assigned to a specified transferee or to Rural Development for redemption or for exchange for other certificates offered at maturity. Assignments to “United States, Rural Development,” “Farmers Home Administration for Transfer,” or “Rural Development for Exchange” will not be accepted unless supplemented by specific instructions by or in behalf of the owner. If an alteration or erasure has been made in an assignment, a new assignment from the assignor should be obtained. Otherwise, an affidavit or explanation by the person responsible for the alteration or erasure should be submitted for consideration.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Death of certificate holder.</E> The Finance Office should be notified of the death of the registered owner of a certificate. The following documents should be forwarded with the notice if available.</P>
                <P>(1) A certified copy of the death certificate.</P>
                <P>(2) A certified copy of the court order appointing the Administrator or Executor (include the mailing address of the Administrator or Executor). The Finance Office will notify the person submitting such notice and/or documentation if any other records or documents are needed. Legal opinions and advice will be obtained by the Finance Office as needed from the Regional Attorney. After all legal requirements are met, the certificate should be reissued in the name of the current owner.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Replacement.</E> Lost, stolen, destroyed, or mutilated certificates will be replaced by the Finance Office on the registered owner's compliance with the requirements of § 1901.509.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Servicing of insured notes outstanding with investors.</SUBJECT>

                <P>The Director, or the insured loan officer of the Finance Office, is authorized in connection with the sale of any insured note to execute required documents on behalf of Rural Development and to take other appropriate action, including, but not limited to, acknowledging notice of sale of an insured note, or requiring an insured holder to sell an insured note to Rural Development in connection with any voluntary conveyance or foreclosure, or transfer related to liquidation of the borrower's account or any other servicing action so related. Upon recommendation by the State Director that purchase of an insured note is necessary for any servicing action not related to liquidation <PRTPAGE P="495"/>of the borrower's account, authorization may be given by the National Office to request the Director, Finance Office, to require a holder to sell an insured note to Rural Development.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Assignments</E>—(1) <E T="03">Effective date of assignment.</E> When an insured note is sold by a private holder to a private buyer, notice of such sale executed by the seller must be given to and acknowledged by Rural Development in order for the sale to be binding on Rural Development, as to Rural Development, the effective date of the sale will be the acknowledgment date specified in the acknowledgement of notice executed by Rural Development.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Assignment to Rural Development at request of Rural Development.</E> At any time Rural Development considers it necessary for proper servicing of the loan, Rural Development may require, in writing, a private holder to sell an insured note to Rural Development.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Assignment to Rural Development at option of holder.</E> A private holder at any time during the option period may require, in writing, Rural Development to purchase an insured note.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Price.</E> If Rural Development is the buyer of an insured note, the price will be the par value as of the effective date of the sale. In other cases, the price will be determined by an agreement between the parties.</P>

                <P>(ii) A statement of the unpaid principal. If requested the Director, Finance Office, will furnish a statement of account instead of or in addition to a statement of the unpaid principal.</P>
                <P>(iii) Appropriate information on how to complete the assignment.</P>
                <P>(2) If the Director, Finance Office, is informed that an insured note has been assigned and Rural Development is requested to recognize the assignment, the Director, Finance Office, will send the assignor Form RD 471-7, with directions for its execution.</P>
                <P>(3) On receipt of Form RD 471-7 properly executed by the assignor, the Director, Finance Office, will complete and execute the acknowledgment section of the form. The Director, Finance Office, will retain the original of the form, have two facsimile copies made and send one to the assignor, and one to the assignee. For any correction or other change to be made in the record of the name or address of a private holder, or of a designated agent of a private holder, a request will be made to Rural Development in writing.</P>
                <P>(4) As of the date of the acknowledgment, executed by the Director, Finance Office, on Form RD 471-7 the Director, Finance Office, will transfer the insured note from the assignor to the assignee as the insured holder on the records of Rural Development. The name and address of the assignee will be recorded by Rural Development exactly as they appear on Form RD 471-7.</P>
                <P>(5) Payments transmitted by Rural Development on or after the acknowledgment date shown on Form RD 471-7 will be transmitted to the assignee. The Director, Finance Office, will give notice to the assignor and the assignee of any payments transmitted by Rural Development to the assignor before the acknowledgment date and after either the date of sale, or the date of the statement of account, whichever is earlier. However, Rural Development will not be liable for any failure to give such notice.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Assignment of insured notes to Rural Development</E>—(1) <E T="03">Assignment at the request of the holder.</E> For assignment of an insured note to Rural Development during the option period at the request of the holder, the following procedure will apply:</P>

All available portions of an insurance contract that is mutilated, defaced, or partially destroyed should be submitted to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (Rural Development's fiscal agent) for determination as to whether a duplicate insurance contract can be issued without a certificate of loss and posting of an indemnity bond. In the event the holder of a block sales insurance contract obtains possession of the underlying notes, the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section apply.</P>

When a note or certificate of beneficial ownership is lost, stolen, or destroyed while in the custody of the holder or his designee, the following will apply:</P>
                <P>(1) A certificate of loss should be filed with Rural Development Finance Office. The certificate should include:</P>
                <P>(i) Legal name and present address of owner when issued, if different from present address.</P>
                <P>(ii) Capacity of person certifying, if other than the owner.</P>
                <P>(iii) Identity of the note or certificate of beneficial ownership, including the name and Rural Development case number of the maker thereof, issue date, interest rate of obligation, face amount of note or certificate of beneficial ownership, and a full description of any assignment, endorsement, or any other writing.</P>

                <P>(i) Substantially the entire note or certificate of beneficial ownership is presented and surrendered by the owner or holder, and the Director, Finance Office, is satisfied as to the identity of the instruments and that any missing portions are not sufficient to form the basis of a valid claim against the United States or the borrower; or</P>
                <P>(ii) The owner or holder is the United States, a Federal Reserve Bank, a Federal Government Corporation, a State or territory, or the District of Columbia.</P>

                <P>(ii) Cases involving registered unassigned obligations where the evidence reasonably justifies a conclusion that the obligations were destroyed and the unpaid principal and interest amount does not exceed $1,000.</P>
                <P>(4) An indemnity posted with a qualified surety is required in all cases involving registered unassigned obligations other than those cited in paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), (b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii) of this section. A qualified surety is a company holding a certificate of authority from the Secretary of the Treasury as acceptable sureties on Federal Bonds, and listed in Treasury Department Circular 570.</P>
                <P>(5) All indemnity bonds for notes must be payable to both the borrower and Rural Development. All indemnity bonds for certificates of beneficial ownership must be payable to Rural Development. The bond may be posted at the time the note or certificate of beneficial ownership becomes eligible for repurchase by Rural Development. If the holder desires to continue to hold the note for the life of the note, an indemnity bond will not be required.</P>
                <P>(6) An assignment of the note or certificate of beneficial ownership shall be made to the United States of America, acting through Rural Development, United States Department of Agriculture. An acceptable form of assignment is available from the Director, Finance Office.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Other cases.</E> Cases involving bearer obligations and other cases not discussed in this section will be forwarded to the Director, Finance Office, for requirements.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Replacement of notes.</E> Rural Development will not attempt to obtain replacement notes from borrowers.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Policies concerning disbursement of funds.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Generally, loan and grant disbursements may be requested on an as needed basis, thereby reducing the need for supervised bank accounts. For all construction loans and those loans using multiple advances, only the actual amount to be disbursed at loan closing will be requested through the automated systems. Subsequent disbursements will be ordered as needed. However, supervised bank accounts may be used in certain circumstances. For example:</P>
                <P>(1) When a construction loan is made and the construction is substantially completed, but a small amount is being withheld pending completion of landscaping or some similar item. In this case, funds not disbursed may be placed in a supervised bank account for future disbursement as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(2) When a large number of checks will be issued in the construction of a dwelling or other development. In such cases, loan and grant disbursements will be requested in accordance with 7 CFR part 2018, subpart D as necessary, deposited in a supervised bank account, and disbursed as necessary to suppliers, sub-contractors, etc.</P>
                <P>(3) Association loan and grant funds made on a multiple advance basis may be deposited in a supervised bank account when required by State statutes or when determined necessary by the loan approval official.</P>
                <P>(4) Supervised bank accounts may be used when needed as defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section to ensure the correct expenditures of all or a part of loan and grant funds, borrower contributions, and borrower income. Such accounts will be limited in amount and duration to the extent feasible through the prudent disbursement of funds and the prompt termination of the interests of Rural Development and other lenders when the accounts are no longer required.</P>
                <P>(5) When it is determined by the Servicing Official that special supervision is needed in the management of the borrower's finances, funds may be deposited in a supervised bank account. This supervisory technique will be used for a temporary period to help the borrower learn to properly manage his/her finances. Such a period will not exceed 1 year unless extended by the Servicing Official.</P>
                <P>(b) Program instructions provide information as to the type of note to be utilized and the method of handling advances and the interest accrued.</P>
                <P>(c) The debt instruments executed at the time of loan closing constitute an obligation on the part of the Government to disburse all funds at one time or in multiple advances, provided the funds are for purposes authorized by the Government at the time of loan closing. This obligatory commitment takes priority over any intervening liens or advances by other creditors, regardless of the provisions of the State laws involved.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Procedures to follow in fund disbursement.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The Servicing Official will determine during loan approval the amount(s) of loan or grant disbursement(s)—full or partial—and will process the request to the appropriate automated system in accordance with 7 CFR part 2018, subpart D.</P>
                <P>(b) When Treasury check(s) are delivered to the Servicing Official, the Servicing Official will make sure that the name of the borrower and the amount(s) of check(s) coincide with the request on file. The Servicing Official should be sure that the check is properly endorsed to ensure payment to the intended recipient. Examples of such restrictive endorsements are:</P>

                <P>(1) “For Deposit only to Account No. (Number of Construction Account) of (<E T="03">Name of Borrower</E>) in (<E T="03">Name of Financial Institution</E>).”</P>
                <P>(2) “Pay to the order of (3rd party payee)”—(Contractor, Developer, Sub-Contractor, Building Supply House, etc.) for the purpose of _____.</P>

                <P>(c) When necessary, and only under the circumstances listed in § 1902.2, the Servicing Official will establish, or cause to be established, a supervised bank account. Funds deposited in a supervised bank account are to be recorded and accounted for on Form RD <PRTPAGE P="500"/>402-2, “Statement of Deposits and Withdrawals”.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Establishing MFH reserve accounts in a supervised bank account.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> All MFH borrowers required to maintain reserve accounts must place the reserve accounts in a supervised bank account(s) which meets the following requirements:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Countersignature requirements.</E> The reserve account must require that any funds withdrawn be countersigned by an authorized government official.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Restrictions on collateral.</E> The financial institution holding the reserve account must ensure that the funds are not pledged or taken as security without the Agency's prior consent.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Interest bearing.</E> The reserve account funds are encouraged to be maintained in an interest-bearing account. The “Interest-Bearing Deposit Agreement” set out in Exhibit B of this subpart is not required to be used for reserve accounts.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Restricted investments.</E> Reserve funds must be placed in investments authorized in 7 CFR part 3560, subpart G. The authorized investments are deemed to be of acceptable risk such that the potential for any loss is minimal.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Financial institutions.</E> The reserve account must be maintained in authorized financial institutions set out in 7 CFR part 3560, subpart G; e.g., banks, savings associations, credit unions, brokerage firms, mutual funds. Generally, any financial institution may be used provided invested or deposited funds are insured to protect against theft and dishonesty. The reserve account funds need not be Federally insured, but must be otherwise covered by non-Federal insurance against theft and dishonesty.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Rules where multiple projects are involved.</E> A reserve account(s) must be maintained for each borrower. When a borrower owns multiple projects, reserve accounts may be established for each project. A single reserve account may also be established by a borrower owning multiple projects, provided the conditions set out in 7 CFR part 3560. subpart G are met.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Term.</E> Reserve accounts are expected to be kept for the full term of the loan.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Deposits and account activity statements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Deposits.</E> Generally, Rural Development will not require the review or approval of deposits or the use of Form RD 402-1 or 402-2.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Account activity statements.</E> Generally, Rural Development will not monitor or reconcile the reserve account activity statements issued periodically by the financial institutions holding the funds. Rural Development will monitor reserve account levels through budget reports, audits, and Agency reserve tracking systems. If disputes arise or the borrower is in violation of Agency regulations, the Agency may require account activity statements. When account activity statements are sought, it will normally be sufficient to obtain the statement which reflects balances as of the last activity statement ending period. Form RD 402-2 is not required to be used.</P>

                <P>(a) Each borrower will be given an opportunity to choose the financial institution in which the supervised bank account will be established, provided the financial institution is a member of the FDIC or NCUA, as applicable.</P>
                <P>(b) When accounts are established, it should be determined that:</P>
                <P>(1) The financial institution is fully informed concerning the provisions of the applicable deposit agreement,</P>
                <P>(2) Agreements are reached with respect to the services to be provided by the financial institution including the frequency and method of transmittal of checking account statements, and</P>

                <P>(3) An agreement is reached with the financial institution regarding the place where the counter-signature will be on the checks.<PRTPAGE P="501"/>
                </P>
                <P>(c) When possible, Servicing Officials will make arrangements with financial institutions to waive service charges in connection with supervised bank accounts. However, there is no objection to the payment by the borrower of a reasonable charge for such service.</P>
                <P>(d) For each borrower, if the amount of any loan and grant funds, plus any borrower contributions and funds from other sources to be deposited in the supervised bank account will exceed the maximum amount insurable by the Federal government, the financial institution will be required to pledge collateral for the excess over that limit before the deposit is made (see § 1902.7 of this subpart). If the supervised bank account is a joint account, any amount over the maximum amount insurable by the federal government must be collateralized.</P>

                <P>(e) Only one supervised bank account will be established for any borrower regardless of the amount or source of funds, except for <E T="03">Rural Rental Housing</E> loans where separate accounts will be established for each project.</P>
                <P>(f) When a supervised bank account is established, an original and two copies of the applicable Deposit Agreement and the Interest-Bearing Deposit Agreement (Exhibit B of this subpart), when applicable, will be executed by the borrower, the financial institution, and a Servicing Office employee. The original will be retained in the borrower's case file, one executed copy will be delivered to the financial institution and one executed copy to the borrower. An extra copy of the Interest-Bearing Deposit Agreement, when applicable, will be prepared and attached to the certificate, passbook, or other evidence of deposit representing the interest-bearing deposit.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Pledging collateral for deposit of funds in supervised bank accounts.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Funds in excess of the maximum amount insurable by the Federal government, per financial institution, deposited for borrowers in supervised bank accounts, must be secured by pledging acceptable collateral with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) in an amount not less than the excess. If the supervised bank account is a joint account, any amount over the maximum amount insurable by the federal government must be collateralized.</P>
                <P>(b) As soon as it is determined that the loan will be approved and the applicant has selected or tentatively selected a financial institution for the supervised bank account, the Servicing Official will contact the financial institution to determine:</P>
                <P>(1) That the financial institution selected is insured by the FDIC (banks and savings associations) or NCUA (credit unions).</P>
                <P>(2) Whether the financial institution is willing to pledge collateral with the FRB under 31 CFR part 202 (Treasury Circular 176) to the extent necessary to secure the amount of funds being deposited in excess of the FDIC or NCUA insurance limit.</P>
                <P>(3) If the financial institution is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, it will be necessary for the financial institution to pledge the securities with a correspondent bank who is a member of the System. The correspondent bank should contact the FRB informing them they are holding securities pledged for the supervised bank account under 31 CFR part 202 (Treasury Circular 176).</P>
                <P>(c) If the financial institution agrees to pledge collateral, the Servicing Official should complete RD Form Letter 1902-A-2, “Designated Financial Institution—Collateral Pledge”, in an original and two copies: The original for the National Office, Policy and Analysis Division; the first copy for the State Office; and the second copy for the Servicing Official. The Rural Development Form Letter 1902-A-2 should be forwarded to the National Office, Policy and Analysis Division, at least 30 days before the date of loan closing.</P>
                <P>(d) The National Office, Policy and Analysis Division, will arrange for the financial institution under its designation as a depository and financial agent of the U.S. Government to pledge the requested collateral.</P>

                <P>(e) If, two days before loan closing, the local Rural Development office which requested the collateral has not received notification from the National <PRTPAGE P="502"/>Office, Policy and Analysis Division, that collateral has been pledged, contact should be made with the financial institution to ascertain whether they have pledged collateral with their local FRB under 31 CFR part 202 (Treasury Circular 176). If the financial institution has pledged collateral, the local Rural Development office should contact the National Office, Policy and Analysis Division, who will follow-up with the local FRB concerning the collateral.</P>
                <P>(f) When the amount of deposit in the supervised bank account has been reduced to a point where the financial institution desires part or all of the collateral released, it should contact the National Office, Policy and Analysis Division. The local Rural Development office will be contacted for release authorization. The authorization release will be made through the local FRB, with notification to the financial institution. The local Rural Development office may also request release through the National Office, Policy and Analysis Division.</P>

                <P>(2) Rural Development personnel will accept funds for deposit in a borrower's supervised bank account ONLY in the form of: A check or money order endorsed by the borrower “For Deposit Only;” a check drawn to the order of the financial institution in which the funds are to be deposited; a loan check drawn on the U.S. Treasury; or a Rural Development electronic funds transfer disbursement.</P>
                <P>(i) A joint check that is payable to the borrower and Rural Development will be endorsed by the Servicing Official as provided in 7 CFR part 1951, subpart B, Exhibit B, section 4.</P>

All such checks should be delivered or mailed to the Servicing Office.</P>
                <P>(3) If direct or insured loan funds or borrower contributions are to be deposited in a supervised bank account, such funds will be deposited on the date of loan closing after it has been determined that the loan can be closed. However, if it is impossible to deposit the funds on the day the loan is closed due to reasons such as distance from the financial institution or banking hours, the funds will be deposited on the first banking day following the date of loan closing.</P>
                <P>(4) Grant funds will be deposited when such funds are delivered.</P>
                <P>(5) When funds from any source in the form of cash, check, or money order are deposited by Rural Development personnel in a supervised bank account, a deposit slip will be prepared in an original and two copies with distribution as follows: Original to the financial institution, one copy to the borrower, and one copy for the borrower's case folder. The name of the borrower, the sources of funds, “Subject to Rural Development Countersignature” and, if applicable, the account number, will be entered on each deposit slip.</P>

                <P>(6) A loan or grant check drawn on the U.S. Treasury may be deposited in a supervised bank account without endorsement by the borrower when it will <PRTPAGE P="503"/>facilitate delivery of the check and is acceptable to the financial institution. The borrower will be notified immediately of any deposit made and will be furnished a copy of the deposit slip. When a deposit of this nature is made, the following endorsement will be used:

                <P>(1) A loan or grant check drawn on the U.S. Treasury may be deposited in a supervised bank account by a borrower, provided the following endorsement is used and is inserted thereon prior to delivery to the borrower for signature:

                <P>(2) Funds other than loan or grant funds may be deposited by the borrower in those exceptional instances where an agreement is reached between the Servicing Official and the borrower, whereby the borrower will make deposits of income from any source directly into the supervised bank account. In such instances the borrower will be instructed to prepare the deposit slip in the manner described in § 1902.9 (a)(5) of this subpart.</P>

If minor capital items are being purchased or numerous items of operating and family living expenses are involved as in connection with a monthly budget, a check may be drawn to the borrower to provide the funds to meet such costs.</P>
                <P>(1) A check will be issued payable to the appropriate payee but will never be issued to “cash.” The purpose of the expenditure will be clearly shown on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 402-2 and indicated on the fact of the check. When checks are drawn in favor of the borrower to cover items too numerous to identify, the expenditure will be identified on the check, as “miscellaneous.”</P>

                <P>(2) Ordinarily, a check will be countersigned before it is delivered to the payee. However, in justifiable circumstances, such as when excessive travel on the part of the borrower or Servicing Official would be involved, or purchase would be prevented, and the borrower can be relied upon to select goods and services in accordance with the plans, a check may be delivered to <PRTPAGE P="504"/>the payee by the borrower before being countersigned.</P>
                <P>(i) When a check is to be delivered to the payee before being countersigned, the Servicing Official must make it clear to the borrower and to the payee, if possible, that the check will be countersigned only if the quantity and quality of items purchased are in accordance with approved plans.</P>
                <P>(ii) Checks delivered to the payee before counter-signature will bear the following legend in addition to the legend for countersignature: Valid only upon countersignature of Rural Development.”</P>
                <P>(iii) The check must be presented by the payee or a representative to the Rural Development Servicing Office for the required countersignature.</P>
                <P>(iv) Such check must be accompanied by a bill of sale, invoice, or receipt signed by the borrower identifying the nature and cost of goods or services purchased, or similar information must be indicated on the check.</P>
                <P>(3) For real estate loans or grants, whether the check is delivered to the payee before or after countersignature, the number and date of the check will be inserted on all bills of sale, invoices, receipts, and itemized statements for materials, equipment, and services.</P>
                <P>(4) Bills of sale, invoices, receipts, or itemized statements may be returned to the borrower with the canceled check for the payment of the bill.</P>

                <P>(5) Checks to be drawn on a supervised bank account will bear the legend:

                <P>When Rural Development loan or grant funds and those of any other lender or grantor have all been properly expended or withdrawn, Form RD <PRTPAGE P="505"/>402-6 may be used to give Rural Development's consent (and of another lender or grantor, if involved) to close the supervised bank account in the following situations:</P>
                <P>(a) When Rural Development loan funds in the supervised bank account of a borrower have been reduced to $100 or less, and a check for the unexpended balance has been issued to the borrower to be used for authorized purposes.</P>
                <P>(b) For all loan accounts, after completion of authorized loan funds expenditures, and after promptly refunding any remaining unexpended loan funds on the borrower's loan account with Rural Development or another lender, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(c) Promptly upon death of a borrower, except when the loan is being continued with a joint debtor, when a borrower is in default and it is determined that no further assistance will be given, or when a borrower is no longer classified as “active.”</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Deceased borrowers.</E> (i) Ordinarily, upon notice of the death of a borrower, the District Director or the County Supervisor will request the State Director to make demand upon the bank for the balance on deposit and apply all the balance after payment of any bank charges to the borrower's Rural Development indebtedness. When the State Director approves continuation with a survivor, the supervised bank account of deceased borrower may be continued with a remaining joint debtor who is liable for the loan and agrees to use the unexpended funds as planned, provided:</P>
                <P>(i) Ordinarily, upon notice of the death of a borrower, the Servicing Official will request the State Director to make demand upon the bank for the balance on deposit and apply all the balance after payment of any bank charges to the borrower's Rural Development indebtedness. When the State Director approves continuation with a survivor, the supervised bank account of a deceased borrower may be continued with a remaining joint debtor who is liable for the loan and agrees to use the unexpended funds as planned, provided:</P>
                <P>(A) The account is a joint survivorship supervised bank account, or</P>
                <P>(B) If not a joint survivorship account, the financial institution will agree to permit the addition of the surviving joint debtor's name to the existing signature card and the appropriate Deposit Agreement and continue to disburse checks out of the existing account upon Rural Development's countersignature and the joint debtor's signature in place of the deceased borrower, or</P>
                <P>(C) The financial institution will permit the State Director to withdraw the balance from the existing supervised bank account with a check jointly payable to the Rural Development and the surviving joint debtor and deposit the money in a new supervised bank account with a surviving joint debtor, and will disburse checks from this new account upon the signature of such survivor and the countersignature of an authorized Rural Development official.</P>
                <P>(ii) The State Director, before applying the balance remaining in the supervised bank account to the Rural Development indebtedness, is authorized upon approval by the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) to refund any unobligated balances of funds from other lenders to the Rural Development borrower for specific operating purposes in accordance with subordination agreements or other arrangements between Rural Development, the lender and the borrower.</P>
                <P>(iii) The State Director, upon the recommendation of an authorized representative of the estate of the deceased borrower and the approval of the OGC, is authorized to approve the use of deposited funds for the payment of commitments for goods delivered or services performed in accordance with the deceased borrower's plans approved by Rural Development.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Borrowers in default.</E> Whenever it is impossible or impractical to obtain a signed check from a borrower whose supervised bank account is to be closed, the Servicing Official will request the State Director to make demand upon the financial institution for the balance on deposit in the borrower's supervised bank account for application as appropriate:</P>

                <P>(i) To the borrower's Rural Development indebtedness, or<PRTPAGE P="506"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) As refunds of any unobligated advance provided by other lenders which were deposited in the account, or</P>
                <P>(iii) For the return of Rural Development grant funds in accordance with 7 CFR part 1951, subpart B or</P>
                <P>(iv) For the return of grant funds to other grantors.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Inactive borrowers.</E> An inactive borrower is one whose loan has not been paid in full, but is no longer classified as “active.”</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Paid up borrowers.</E> A paid-up borrower is one who has a balance remaining in the supervised bank account and has repaid the entire indebtedness to Rural Development and has properly expended all funds advanced by other lenders. In such cases the Servicing Official will:</P>
                <P>(i) Notify the borrower in writing that the interests in the account of Rural Development have been terminated, and</P>
                <P>(ii) Inform the borrower of the balance remaining in the supervised bank account.</P>

                <P>(ii) When land development consists of, or includes, the conservation and <PRTPAGE P="514"/>use of water for irrigation or domestic purposes, the information submitted to the County Supervisor will include a statement as to the source of the water supply, right to the use of the water, and the adequacy and quality of the supply.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Responsibilities for planning development.</E> Planning construction and land development and obtaining technical services in connection with drawings, specifications and cost estimates are the sole responsibility of the applicant, with such assistance from the County Supervisor or District Director (whichever is the appropriate loan processing and servicing officer for the type of loan involved), as may be necessary to be sure that the development is properly planned in order to protect the Agency's security.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Responsibility of the applicant.</E> (i) The applicant will arrange for obtaining any required technical services from qualified technicians, tradespeople, and recognized plan services, and the applicant will furnish the Agency sufficient information to describe fully the planned development and the manner in which it will be accomplished.</P>
                <P>(ii) When items of construction or land development require drawings and specifications, they will be sufficiently complete to avoid any misunderstanding as to extent, kind, and quality of work to be performed. The applicant will provide the Agency with one copy of the drawings and specifications. Approval will be indicated by the applicant and acceptance for the purposes of the loan indicated by the County Supervisor or District Director on all sheets of the drawings and at the end of the specifications, and both instruments will be a part of the loan docket. After the loan is closed, the borrower will retain a conformed copy of the approved drawings and specifications, and provide another conformed copy to the contractor. Items not requiring drawings and specifications may be described in narrative form.</P>
                <P>(iii) The Agency will accept final drawings and specifications and any modifications thereof only after the documents have been certified in writing as being in conformance with the applicable development standard if required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Certification is required for all Single Family Housing (SFH) thermal designs (plans, specifications, and calculations).</P>
                <P>(A) Certifications may be accepted from individuals or organizations who are trained and experienced in the compliance, interpretation or enforcement of the applicable development standards for drawings and specifications. Plan certifiers may be any of the following:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Licensed architects,</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Professional engineers,</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Plan reviewers certified by a national model code organization listed in exhibit E to this subpart,</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Local building officials authorized to review and approve building plans and specifications, or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) National codes organizations listed in exhibit E to this subpart.</P>

                <P>(B) The license or authorization of the individual must be current at the time of the certification statement. A building permit (except as noted in paragraph (f)(1)(iii)(C)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section) or professional's stamp is not an acceptable substitute for the certification statement. However, a code compliance review conducted by one of the National recognized code organizations indicating no deficiencies or the noted deficiencies have been corrected is an acceptable substitute for the certification statement.</P>
                <P>(C) For Single Family Housing (one to four family dwelling units) the Agency may also accept drawings and specifications that have been certified by:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Registered Professional Building Designers certified by the American Institute of Building Design.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A local community, if that community has adopted, by reference, one of the model building codes and has trained official(s) who review(s) plans as well as inspect(s) construction for compliance as a requisite for issuing a building permit. The building permit, issued by the community, may serve as evidence of acceptance. The State Director will determine eligible communities and publish, as a State supplement to this section, a list of those communities that qualify.<PRTPAGE P="515"/>
                </P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) A plan service that provides drawings and specifications that are certified by individuals or organizations as listed in paragraph (f)(1)(iii)(A) or (f)(1)(iii)(C) (<E T="03">1</E>) and (<E T="03">2</E>) of this section as meeting the appropriate state adopted development standard.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Builders/Contractors who provide 10-year warranty plans for the specific Agency finance dwelling unit that meet the requirements of exhibit L of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Builders/Contractors that are approved by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for self-certification.</P>
                <P>(D) The modifications of certified drawings or specifications must be certified by the same individual or organization that certified the original drawings and specifications. If such individual or organization is not available, the entire set of modified drawings and specifications must be recertified.</P>
                <P>(E) The certification of modifications for single family housing (SFH) construction may be waived if the builder or original author of the drawings and specifications provides a written statement that the modifications are not regulated by the applicable development standard. The County Supervisor may consult with the State Office Architect/Engineer as to acceptance of the statement and granting a waiver.</P>
                <P>(F) All certifications of final drawings, specifications, and calculations shall be on Form RD 1924-25, “Plan Certification.”</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Responsibility of the County Supervisor or District Director.</E> In accordance with program regulations for loans and grants they are required to process, the County Supervisor or District Director, for the sole benefit of the Agency, will:</P>
                <P>(i) Visit each farm or site on which the development is proposed. For an FO loan, the County Supervisor and the applicant will determine the items of development necessary to put the farm in a livable and operable condition at the outset. Prepare Form RD 1924-1, when applicable in accordance with the Forms Manual Insert (FMI) for the form, after a complete understanding has been reached between the applicant and the County Supervisor regarding the development to be accomplished, including the dates each item of development will be started and completed.</P>
                <P>(ii) Notify the loan or grant applicant in writing immediately if, after reviewing the preliminary proposal and inspecting the site, the proposal is not acceptable. If the proposal is acceptable, an understanding will be reached with the applicant concerning the starting date for each item of development.</P>
                <P>(iii) Discuss with the applicant the Agency requirements with respect to good construction and land development practices.</P>
                <P>(iv) Advise the applicant regarding drawings, specifications, cost estimates, and other related material which the applicant must submit to the Agency forreview before the loan can be developed. Advise the applicant of the information necessary in the drawings, how the cost estimates should be prepared, the number of sets of drawings, specifications, and cost estimates required, and the necessity for furnishing such information promptly. Advise the applicant that the Agency will provide appropriate specification forms, Form RD 1924-2, “Description of Materials,” and Form RD 1924-3, “Service Building Specifications.” The applicant may, however, use other properly prepared specifications.</P>
                <P>(v) Advise the applicant regarding publications, plans, planning aids, engineering data, and other technical advice and assistance available through local, state, and Federal agencies, and private individuals and organizations.</P>
                <P>(vi) Review the information furnished by the applicant to determine the completeness of the plans, adequacy of the cost estimates, suitability and soundness of the proposed development.</P>

                <P>(vii) When appropriate, offer suggestions as to how drawings and specifications might be altered to improve the facility and better serve the needs of the applicant. The County Supervisor or District Director may assist the applicant in making revisions to the drawings. When appropriate, the contract documents will be forwarded to the State architect/engineer for review. For revisions requiring technical determinations that the Agency is not able <PRTPAGE P="516"/>to make, the applicant will be requested to obtain additional technical assistance.</P>
                <P>(viii) Provide the applicant with a written list of changes required in the contract documents. The applicant will submit two complete revised (as requested) sets of contract documents, for approval. On one set, the County Supervisor or District Director will indicate acceptance on each sheet of the drawings, and on the cover of the specifications and all other contract documents. At least the date and the initials of the approval official must be shown. On projects where a consulting architect or engineer has been retained, this acceptance will be indicated only after the State Director has given written authorization. The marked set of documents shall be available at the job site at all times for review by the Agency. The second set will become part of the loan docket.</P>
                <P>(ix) Review the proposed method of doing the work and determine whether the work can be performed satisfactorily under the proposed method.</P>
                <P>(x) Instruct the applicant not to incur any debts prior to loan closing for materials or labor or make any expenditures for such purposes with the expectation of being reimbursed from loan funds.</P>
                <P>(xi) Instruct the applicant not to commence any construction nor cause any supplies or materials to be delivered to the construction site prior to loan closing.</P>
                <P>(xii) Under certain conditions prescribed in exhibit H of this subpart, provide the applicant with a copy of the leaflet, “Warning—Lead-Based Paint Hazards,” which is attachment 1 of exhibit H (available in any Agency office), and the warning sheet, “Caution Note on Lead-Based Paint Hazard,” which is attachment 2 of exhibit H (available in any Agency office).</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Surplus structures and use or sale of timber, sand, or stone.</E> In planning the development, the applicant and the County Supervisor or District Director should, when practicable, plan to use salvage from old buildings, timber, sand, gravel, or stone from the property. The borrower may sell surplus buildings, timber, sand, gravel, or stone that is not to be used in performing planned development and use net proceeds to pay costs of performing planned development work. In such a case:</P>
                <P>(1) An agreement will be recorded in the narrative of Form RD 1924-1 which as a minimum will:</P>
                <P>(i) Identify the property to be sold, the estimated net proceeds to be received, and the approximate date by which the property will be sold.</P>
                <P>(ii) Provide that the borrower will deposit the net proceeds in the supervised bank account and apply any funds remaining after the development is complete as an extra payment on the loan, or in accordance with § 1965.13(f) of subpart A of part 1965 of this chapter for farm program loans.</P>
                <P>(2) The agreement will be considered by the Government as modifying the mortgage contract to the extent of authorizing and requiring the Government to release the identified property subject to the conditions stated in the agreement without payment or other consideration at the time of release, regardless of whether or not the mortgage specifically refers to Form RD 1924-1 or the agreement to release.</P>
                <P>(3) If the Agency loan will be secured by a junior lien, all prior lienholders must give written consent to the proposed sale and the use of the net proceeds before the loan is approved.</P>
                <P>(4) Releases requested by the borrower or the buyer will be processed in accordance with applicable release procedures in 7 CFR part 3550, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Review prior to performing development work.</E> For the sole benefit of the Agency, prior to beginning development work, the County Supervisor or District Director will review planned development with the borrower. Adequacy of the drawings and specifications as well as the estimates will be checked to make sure the work can be completed within the time limits previously agreed upon and with available funds. Items and quantities of any materials the borrower has agreed to furnish will be checked and dates by which each item of development should be started will be checked in order that the work may be completed on schedule. If any changes in the plans and specifications are proposed, they <PRTPAGE P="517"/>should be within the general scope of the work as originally planned. Changes must be approved and processed in accordance with § 1924.10 of this subpart. The appropriate procedure for performing development should be explained to the borrower. Copies of RD forms that will be used during the period of construction should be given to the borrower. The borrower should be advised as to the purpose of each form and at what period during construction each form will be used.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Time of starting development work.</E> Development work will be started as soon as feasible after the loan is closed. Except in cases in which advance commitments are made in accordance with 7 CFR part 3550 or according to § 1924.13(e)(1)(vi)(A) or § 1924.13(e)(2)(ix)(A) of this subpart, no commitments with respect to performing planned development will be made by the Agency or the applicant before the loan is closed. The applicant will be instructed that before the loan is closed, debts should not be incurred for labor or materials, or expenditures made for such purposes, with the expectation of being reimbursed from funds except as provided in subpart A of part 1943 of this chapter, 7 CFR part 3550, and subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter. However, with the prior approval of the National Office, a State Supplement may be issued authorizing County Supervisors to permit applicants to commence welldrilling operations prior to loan closing, provided:</P>
                <P>(1) It is necessary in the area to provide the water supply prior to loan closing,</P>
                <P>(2) The applicant agrees in writing to pay with personal funds all costs incurred if a satisfactory water supply is not obtained,</P>
                <P>(3) Any contractors and suppliers understand and agree that loan funds may not be available to make the payment,</P>
                <P>(4) Such action will not result under applicable State law in the giving of priority to mechanics and materialmen's liens over the later recorded Agency mortgage, and</P>
                <P>(5) The Agency does not guarantee that the cost will be paid.</P>

Other contract documents for more complex construction, acceptable to the loan approval official and containing the requirements of subpart E of part 1901 of this chapter, may be used provided they are customarily used in the area and protect the interest of the borrower and the Government with respect to compliance with items such as the drawings, specifications, payments for work, inspections, completion, nondiscrimination in construction work and acceptance of the work. If needed, the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) will be consulted. The United States (including the Agency) will not become a party to a construction contract or incur any liability under it.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Contract provisions.</E> Contracts will have a listing of attachments and the provisions of the contract will include:</P>
                <P>(i) The contract sum.</P>
                <P>(ii) The dates for starting and completing the work.</P>

                <P>(iii) The amount of liquidated damages to be charged.<PRTPAGE P="518"/>
                </P>
                <P>(iv) The amount, method, and frequency of payment.</P>
                <P>(v) Whether or not surety bonds will be provided.</P>
                <P>(vi) The requirement that changes or additions must have prior written approval of the Agency.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Surety requirements.</E> (i) Unless an exception is granted in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section or when interim financing will be used, surety that guarantees both payment and performance in the amount of the contract will be furnished when one or more of the following conditions exist:</P>
                <P>(A) The contract exceeds the applicable Rural Development Single Family Housing area loan limit as per 7 CFR 3550.63. (Loan limits are available at the local Rural Development field office.)</P>
                <P>(B) The loan approval official determines that a surety bond appears advisable to protect the borrower against default of the contractor.</P>
                <P>(C) The applicant requests a surety bond.</P>
                <P>(D) The contract provides for partial payments in excess of the amount of 60 percent of the value of the work in place.</P>
                <P>(E) The contract provides for partial payments for materials suitably stored on the site.</P>

                <P>(ii) If surety bonds are required the construction contract must indicate that the contractor will furnish properly executed surety bonds prior to the start of any work. Exhibits F and G of this subpart as revised by OGC if necessary to comply with local or state statutory requirements will be used as the forms of payment bond and performance bond to be provided. Unless noncorporate surety is provided, the surety bonds may only be obtained from a corporate bonding company listed on the current Department of the Treasury Circular 570 (published annually in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>), as holding a certificate of authority as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds and as legally doing business in the State where the land is located. Noncorporate sureties are not recommended and the State Director will be responsible for determining the acceptability of the individual or individuals proposed as sureties on the bonds. The State Director must determine that an individual or individuals proposed as sureties must have cash or other liquid assets easily convertible to cash in an amount at least equal to 25 percent more than the contract amount in order to be acceptable. The individual(s) will pledge such liquid assets in an amount equal to the contract amount. Fees charged for noncorporate sureties may not exceed fees charged by corporate sureties on bonds of equal amount and, in no case, may surety be provided by the applicant or any person or organization with an identity of interest in the applicant's operation. The United States (including the Agency) will incur no liability related in any way to a performance or payment bond provided in connection with a construction contract. The Agency will be named as co-obligee in the performance and payment bonds unless prohibited by state law.</P>

                <P>(iii) When an experienced and reliable contractor cannot obtain payment and performance bonds meeting the surety requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, the State Director may entertain a request from the applicant for an exception to the surety requirements. The applicant's request must specifically state why the proposed contractor is unable to obtain payment and performance bonds meeting the surety requirements, and why it is financially advantageous for the applicant to award the contract to the proposed contractor without the required bonds.
                </P>
                <FP>If the applicant's request is reasonable and justified, and if the proposed contractor is reliable and experienced in the construction of projects of similar size, design, scope, and complexity, the State Director may grant an exception to the surety requirements for loans or grants within the State Director's approval authority and accept one or a combination of the following:</FP>

                <P>(A) An unconditional and irrevocable letter of credit issued by a lending institution which has been reviewed and approved by OGC. In such cases, the construction contract must indicate that the contractor will furnish a properly executed letter of credit from a lending institution acceptable to the Agency prior to the start of any work. <PRTPAGE P="519"/>The letter of credit must remain in effect until the date of final acceptance of work by the owner and the Agency. In addition, the letter of credit must stipulate that the lending institution, upon written notification by the Agency of the contractor's failure to perform under the terms of the contract, will advance funds up to the amount of the contract (including all Agency approved contract change orders) to satisfy all prior debts incurred by the contractor in performing the contract and all funds necessary to complete the work. Payments may be made to the contractor in accordance with paragraph (a)(12)(i)(C) of this section as if full surety bonds were being provided.</P>
                <P>(B) If a letter of credit satisfying the conditions of paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) of this section cannot be obtained, the State Director may accept a deposit in the amount of the contract, into an interest or non-interest bearing supervised bank account. In such cases, the construction contract must indicate that the contractor will furnish the required deposit prior to the start of any work and that the funds shall remain on deposit until final acceptance of work by the owner and the Agency. Payments may be made to the contractor in accordance with paragraph (a)(12)(i)(C) of this section as if full surety bonds were being provided.</P>
                <P>(C) When the provisions of paragraph (a)(3)(iii) (A) or (B) of this section can be met except that a surety bond, a letter of credit, and/or deposits are not obtainable in full amount of the contract, the State Director may accept an amount less than the full amount of the contract provided all of the following conditions are met:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The contractor provides a surety bond, a letter of credit, or deposits in the greatest amount possible, and provides documentation indicating the reasons why amounts exceeding the proposed amount cannot be provided.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The applicant agrees to the amount of the surety bond, letter of credit, or deposits proposed, and the State Director determines that the applicant has the financial capability to withstand any financial loss due to default of the contractor.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) In the opinion of the State Director, the proposed amount and the method of payment will provide adequate protection for the borrower and the Government against default of the contractor.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The contract provides for partial payments not to exceed 90 percent of the value of the work in place for that portion of the total contract which is guaranteed by an acceptable surety bond, letter of credit, or deposits, and partial payments not to exceed 60 percent of the value of the work in place for that portion of the total contract which is not guaranteed by surety, letter of credit, or deposits.
                </P>
                <EXTRACT>
                  <P>Example:
                  </P>

                  <P>Contractor has a surety bond which guarantees payment and performance in an amount of $150,000 which represents 75 percent of the total contract amount of $200,000. The contractor's first request for payment appears thus:
                  </P>
                  <FP SOURCE="FP-1">—Value of work in place is $10,000.</FP>

                  <FP SOURCE="FP-1">—Authorized payment is $8,250.</FP>
                  
                  <P>(Each partial payment shall reflect values for work guaranteed by surety, letter of credit, or deposits, and work not so guaranteed).</P>
                </EXTRACT>
                
                <P>(iv) In cases where the contractor does not obtain payment and performance bonds in accordance with the surety requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, or where an exception to the surety requirements is granted by the State Director, the following steps will be taken to protect the borrower and the government against latent obligations or defects in connection with the construction:</P>
                <P>(A) The contractor will furnish a properly executed corporate latent defects bond or a maintenance bond in the amount of 10 percent of the construction contract; or</P>
                <P>(B) An unconditional and irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of 10 percent of the construction contract issued by a lending institution which has been reviewed and approved by OGC; or</P>

                <P>(C) A cash deposit into an interest or non-interest bearing supervised bank account in the amount of 10 percent of the construction contract;<PRTPAGE P="520"/>
                </P>
                <P>(D) The period of protection against latent obligations and/or defects shall be one year from the date of final acceptance of work by the owner and the Agency;</P>
                <P>(E) Final payment shall not be rendered to the contractor until the provisions of paragraph (a)(3)(iv) (A), (B) or (C) of this section have been met;</P>
                <P>(F) The contract will contain a clause indicating that the contractor agrees to provide surety or guarantee acceptable to the owner and the Agency against latent obligations and/or defects in connection with the construction.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Equal opportunity.</E> Section 1901.205 of subpart E of part 1901 of this chapter applies to all loans or grants involving construction contracts and subcontracts in excess of $10,000.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Labor standards provisions.</E> The provisions of the Davis-Bacon and related acts, which are published by the Department of Labor (29 CFR parts 1, 3 and 5), will apply when the contract involves either LH grant assistance, or 9 or more units in a project being assisted under the HUD section 8 housing assistance payment program for new construction.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Historical and archaeological preservation.</E> The provisions of subpart F of part 1901 of this chapter concerning the protection of historical and archaeological properties will apply to all construction financed, in whole or in part, by Agency loans and grants. These provisions have special applicability to development in areas designated by NRCS as Resource Conservation and Development (RC&amp;D) areas. (See part 1942, subpart I of this chapter.)</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Air and water acts.</E> Under Executive Order 11738, all loans or grants involving construction contracts for more than $100,000 must meet all the requirements of section 114 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7414) and section 308 of the Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C., section 1813). The contract should contain provisions obligating the contractor as a condition for the award of the contract as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) To notify the owner of the receipt of any communication from Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) indicating that a facility to be utilized in the performance of the contract is under consideration to be listed on the EPA list of Violating Facilities. Prompt notification is required prior to contract award.</P>
                <P>(ii) To certify that any facility to be utilized in the performance of any nonexempt contractor subcontract is not listed on the EPA list of Violating Facilities as of the date of contract award.</P>
                <P>(iii) To include or cause to be included the above criteria and requirements of paragraphs (a)(7) (i) and (ii) of this section in every nonexempt subcontract, and that the contractor will take such action as the Government may direct as a means of enforcing such provisions.</P>
                <P>(8) <E T="03">Architectural barriers.</E> In accordance with the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (Pub. L. 90-480), as implemented by the General Services Administration regulations (41 CFR 101-19.6) and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-112) as implemented by 7 CFR, parts 15 and 15b, all facilities financed with Agency loans and grants and which are accessible to the public or in which people with disabilities may be employed or reside must be developed in compliance with this Act. Copies of the Act and Federal accessibility design standards may be obtained from the Executive Director, Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, Washington, DC 20201.</P>
                <P>(9) <E T="03">National Environmental Policy Act.</E> Loans and grants, including those being assisted under the HUD section 8 housing assistance payment program for new construction, must comply with the environmental review requirements in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970.</P>
                <P>(10) <E T="03">Obtaining bids and selecting a contractor.</E> (i) The applicant may select a contractor and negotiate a contract or contact several contractors and request each to submit a bid. For complex construction projects, refer also to § 1924.13(e) of this subpart.</P>

                <P>(ii) When a price has already been negotiated by an applicant and a contractor, the County Supervisor, District Director or other appropriate <PRTPAGE P="521"/>Agency official will review the proposed contract. If the contractor is qualified to perform the development and provide a warranty of the work and the price compares favorably with the cost of similar construction in the area, further negotiation is unnecessary. If the Agency official determines the price is too high or otherwise unreasonable, the applicant will be requested to negotiate further with the contractor. If a reasonable price cannot be negotiated or if the contractor is not qualified, the applicant will be requested to obtain competitive bids.</P>
                <P>(iii) When an applicant has a proposed development plan and no contractor in mind, competitive bidding will be encouraged. The applicant should obtain bids from as many qualified contractors, dealers or tradespeople as feasible depending on the method and type of construction.</P>
                <P>(iv) If the award of the contract is by competitive bidding, Form RD 1924-5, “Invitation for Bid (Construction Contract),” or another similar invitation bid form containing the requirements of subpart E of part 1901 of this chapter, may be used. All contractors from whom bids are requested should be informed of all conditions of the contract including the time and place of opening bids. Conditions shall not be established which would give preference to a specific bidder or type of bidder. When applicable, copies of Forms RD 1924-6 and RD 400-6, “Compliance Statement,” also should be provided to the prospective bidders.</P>
                <P>(11) <E T="03">Awarding the contract.</E> The borrower, with the assistance of the County Supervisor or District Director, will consider the amount of the bids or proposals, and all conditions which were listed in the “Invitation for Bid.” On the basis of these considerations, the borrower will select and notify the lowest responsible bidder.</P>
                <P>(i) Before work commences, the County Supervisor, District Director or other Agency employee having knowledge of contracts and construction practices will hold a preconstruction conference with the borrower(s), contractor and architect/engineer (if applicable). The purpose of the conference is to reach a mutual understanding of each party's responsibilities under the terms and conditions of the contract documents and the loan agreement during the construction and warranty periods. Form RD 1924-16, “Record of Preconstruction Conference,” may be used as a guide for an agenda.</P>
                <P>(ii) A summary of the items covered will be entered in the running case record.</P>
                <P>(iii) The contract will then be prepared, signed and copies distributed in accordance with the FMI for Form RD 1924-6.</P>
                <P>(iv) After a borrower/contractor's contract or subcontract in excess of $10,000 is received in the Agency County or District Office, the responsible Agency official will send within 10 calendar days of the date of the contract or subcontract, a report similar in form and content to exhibit C of subpart E of part 1901 of this chapter to the Area Director, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, U.S. Department of Labor, at the applicable address listed in exhibit E, subpart E of part 1901 of this chapter. The report must contain, at least, the following information: contractor's name, address and telephone number; employer's identification number; amount, starting date and planned completion date of the contract; contract number; and city and DOL region of the contract site. The information for this report should be obtained from the contractor when the contract is awarded.</P>
                <P>(12) <E T="03">Payments for work done by the contract method.</E> (i) Payments will be made in accordance with one of the following methods unless prohibited by state statute, in which case the State Director shall issue a State Supplement to this section:</P>
                <P>(A) The “One-Lump-Sum” payment method will be used when the payment will be made in one lump-sum for the whole contract.</P>
                <P>(B) The “Partial payments not to exceed 60 percent of the value of the work in place” payment method will be used when the contractor does not provide surety bond, a letter of credit, or deposits.</P>

                <P>(C) The “Partial payments in the amount of 90 percent of the value of the work in place and of the value of the materials suitably stored at the site” payment method will be used <PRTPAGE P="522"/>when the contractor provides a surety bond equal to the total contract amount.</P>
                <P>(D) The “Partial payments which reflect the portions of the contract amount which is guaranteed” method will be used when the contractor provides surety bonds, a letter of credit, or deposits less than the total amount of the contract in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(C) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) When Form RD 1924-6 is used, the appropriate payment clause will be checked and the other payment clauses not used will be effectively crossed out.</P>
                <P>(iii) When a contract form other than Form RD 1924-6 is used, the payment clause must conform with paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this section and the appropriate clause as set forth in Form RD 1924-6.</P>
                <P>(iv) The borrower and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 must take precautionary measures to see that all payments made to the contractor are properly applied against bills for materials and labor procured under the contract. Prior to making any partial payment on any contract where a surety bond is not used, the contractor will be required to furnish the borrower and the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 with a statement showing the total amount owed to date for materials and labor procured under the contract. The contractor also may be required to submit evidence showing that previous partial payments were applied properly. When the borrower and the County Supervisor or District Director have reason to believe that partial payments may not be applied properly, checks may be made jointly to the contractor and persons who furnished materials and labor in connection with the contract.</P>
                <P>(v) When partial payments are requested by the contractor and approved by the owner, the amount of the partial payment will be determined by one of the following methods:</P>
                <P>(A) Based upon the percentage completed as shown on a recently completed and properly executed Form RD 1924-12, “Inspection Report.”</P>
                <P>(B) When the structure will be covered by an insured 10-year warranty, the insurer's construction inspector must provide the Agency with any available copies of inspection reports showing percentage of completion immediately after the inspections are completed. To make partial payments when copies of inspection reports are not available, the responsible Agency official will make the inspections or will be guided by the provisions of § 1924.6(a)(12)(v)(C) of this subpart. If further assurance is deemed necessary to justify partial payments, the Agency official may make onsite inspections or require additional information.</P>
                <P>(C) Based upon an application for payment containing an estimate of the value of work in place which has been prepared by the contractor and accepted by the borrower and the Agency. When the contract provides for partial payments for materials satisfactorily stored at the site, the application for payment may include these items. Prior to receiving the first partial payment, the contractor should be required to submit a list of major subcontractors and suppliers and a schedule of prices or values of the various phases of the work aggregating the total sum of the contract such as excavation, foundations, framing, roofing, siding, mill work, painting, plumbing, heating, electric wiring, etc., made out in such form as agreed upon by the borrower, the Agency, and the contractor. In applying for payments, the contractor should submit a statement based upon this schedule. See exhibit A of this subpart for guidance in reviewing the contractor's schedule of prices and estimating the value of the work in place.</P>
                <P>(vi) <E T="03">Final payment.</E> (A) When the structure will be covered by an insured 10-year warranty, the insurer must provide an insured 10-year warranty policy (or a binder if the policy is not available) before final payment is made to the builder.</P>

                <P>(B) Final payment of the amount due on the contract or disbursal of the Agency loan funds where an interim loan was used will be made only upon completion of the entire contract, final inspection by the Agency, acceptance <PRTPAGE P="523"/>of the work by the Agency and the borrower, issuance of any and all final permits and approvals for the use and occupancy of the structure by any applicable state and local governmental authorities, and compliance by the contractor with all terms and conditions of the contract. In the event the work of construction is delayed or interrupted by reason of fire, flood unusually stormy weather, war, riot, strike, an order, requisition or regulation of any governmental body (excluding delays related to possible defects in the contractor's performance and excluding delays caused by the necessity of securing building permits or any required inspection procedures connected therewith) or other contingencies reasonably unforeseeable and beyond the reasonable control of the contractor, then with the written consent of the Agency, the date of completion of the work may be extended by the owner by the period of such delay, provided that the contractor shall give the owner and the Agency written notice within 72 hours of the occurrence of the event causing the delay or interruption.</P>
                <P>(C) Prior to making final payment on the contract when a surety bond is not used or disbursing Agency loan funds when an interim loan was used, the Agency will be provided with a Form RD 1924-9, “Certificate of Contractor's Release,” and Form RD 1924-10, “Release by Claimants.” executed by all persons who furnished materials or labor in connection with the contract. The borrower should furnish the contractor with a copy of the “Release by Claimants” form at the beginning of the work in order that the contractor may obtain these releases as the work progresses.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) If such releases cannot be obtained, the funds may be disbursed provided all the following can be met:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Release statements to the extent possible are obtained;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) The interests of the Agency can be adequately protected and its security position is not impaired; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) Adequate provisions are made for handling the unpaid account by withholding or escrowing sufficient funds to pay any such claims or obtaining a release bond.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The State Director may issue a State Supplement which will:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Not require the use of Form RD 1924-10, if, under existing state statutes, the furnishing of labor and materials gives no right to a lien against the property, or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Provide an alternative method to protect against mechanic's and materialmen's liens. In this case, the use of Form RD 1924-10 is optional.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Borrower method.</E> The borrower method means performance of work by or under the direction of the borrower, using one or more of the ways specified in this paragraph. Development work may be performed by the borrower method only when it is not practicable to do the work by the contract method; the borrower possesses or arranges through an approved self-help plan for the necessary skill and managerial ability to complete the work satisfactorily; such work not interfere seriously with the borrower's farming operation or work schedule, and the County Office caseload will permit a County Supervisor to properly advise the borrower and inspect the work.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Ways of performing the work.</E> The borrower will:</P>
                <P>(i) Purchase the material and equipment and do the work.</P>
                <P>(ii) Utilize lump-sum agreements for (A) minor items or minor portions of items of development, the total cost of which does not exceed $5,000 per agreement, such as labor, material, or labor and material for small service buildings, repair jobs, or land development; or (B) material and equipment which involve a single trade and will be installed by the seller, such as the purchase and installation of heating facilities, electric wiring, wells, painting, liming, or sodding. All agreements will be in writing, however, the County Supervisor may make an exception to this requirement when the agreement involves a relatively small amount.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Acceptance and storage of material on site.</E> The County Supervisor will advise the borrower that the acceptance of material as delivered to the site and the proper storage of material will be the borrower's responsibility.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Payment for work done by the borrower method</E>—(i) <E T="03">Payments for labor.</E> Before the County Supervisor <PRTPAGE P="524"/>countersigns checks for labor, the borrower must submit a completed Form RD 1924-11, “Statement of Labor Performed,” for each hired worker performing labor during the pay period. Ordinarily, checks for labor will be made payable to the workers involved. However, under justifiable circumstances, when the borrower has paid for labor with personal funds and has obtained signatures of the workers on Form RD 1924-11 as having received payment, the County Supervisor may countersign a check made payable to the borrower for reimbursement of these expenditures. Under no circumstances will the County Supervisor permit loan funds or funds withdrawn from the supervised bank account to be used to pay the borrower for the borrower's own labor or labor performed by any member of the borrower's household.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Payment for equipment, materials or lump-sum agreements.</E> (A) Before countersigning checks for equipment or materials, the County Supervisor must normally have an invoice from the seller covering the equipment or materials to be purchased. When an invoice is not available at the time the check is issued, an itemized statement of the equipment or materials to be purchased may be substituted until a paid invoice from the seller is submitted, at which time the prepurchase statement may be destroyed.</P>
                <P>(B) When an invoice is available at the time the check is drawn, the check will include a reference to the invoice number, the invoice date if unnumbered and, if necessary, the purpose of the expenditure.</P>
                <P>(C) The check number and date of payment will be indicated on the appropriate Form RD 1924-11, invoice, itemized statement of equipment or materials and/or lump-sum agreement.</P>
                <P>(D) Ordinarily, checks for equipment or materials will be made payable to the seller. Under justifiable circumstances, when the borrower has paid for equipment or materials with personal funds and furnished a paid invoice, the County Supervisor may countersign a check made payable to the borrower for reimbursement of these expenses.</P>
                <P>(E) When an invoice includes equipment or materials for more than one item of development, the appropriate part of the cost to be charged against each item of development will be indicated on the invoice by the borrower, with the assistance of the County Supervisor.</P>
                <P>(F) Payment made under lump-sum agreements will be made only when all items of equipment and materials have been furnished, labor has been performed as agreed upon, and the work has been accepted by the borrower and the Agency.</P>
                <P>(G) Each paid Form RD 1924-11, invoice, itemized statement for equipment or material and/or lump-sum agreement will be given to the borrower in accordance with the FMI.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Mutual self-help method.</E> The mutual self-help method is performance of work by a group of families by mutual labor under the direction of a construction supervisor, as described in 7 CFR part 3550. The ways of doing the work, buying materials, and contracting for special services are like those used for the borrower method. Materials can be bought jointly by the group of families, but payments will be made individually by each family. In the case of RH loans to families being assisted by Self-Help Technical Assistance (TA) grants in accordance with subpart I of part 1944 of this chapter, the County Supervisor may countersign checks for materials and necessary contract work made payable directly to the TA grantee, provided the District Director determines that:</P>
                <P>(1) The grantee acts in the same capacity as a construction manager in the group purchase of material and services.</P>
                <P>(2) The grantee has an adequate bookkeeping system approved by the District Director to assure that funds in each RH account are properly distributed and maintained.</P>
                <P>(3) The grantee receives no compensation in the way of profit or overhead for this service and all discounts and rebates received in connection with the purchase of materials or services are passed on to the participating families.</P>

                <P>(4) The grantee has a record-keeping system which shows that the costs of <PRTPAGE P="525"/>the materials and services were prorated to each borrower's account in relation to the actual material and service used by each borrower.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Owner-builder method.</E> This method of construction applies only to RRH loans made under subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter. Regulations governing this method are found at § 1924.13(e)(2) of this subpart.</P>

                <P>The following policies will govern the inspection of all development work.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Responsibility for inspection.</E> The County Supervisor or District Director, accompanied by the borrower when practicable, will make final inspection of all development work and periodic inspections as appropriate to protect the security interest of the government. In this respect, inspections other than final inspections, may be conducted by other qualified persons as authorized in paragraph (d) of this section, in 7 CFR part 3550, in RD Instruction 2024-A (available in any Agency office), and as authorized under other agreements executed by, or authorized by, the National Office.
                </P>

                <FP>The borrower will be responsible for making inspections necessary to protect the borrower's interest. Agency <PRTPAGE P="526"/>inspectionsare not to assure the borrower that the house is built in accordance with the plans and specifications. The inspections create or imply no duty or obligation to the particular borrower. Agency inspections are for the dual purpose of determining that the Agency has adequate security for its loan and is achieving the statutory goal of providing adequate housing. If difficult technical problems are encountered, the County Supervisor or District Director should request the assistance of the State Office or a qualified technician from SCS or the State University Cooperative Extension Service.</FP>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Frequency of inspections.</E> The County Supervisor or District Director will inspect development work as frequently as necessary to assure that construction and land development conforms to the drawings and specifications. The final inspection will be made at the earliest possible date after completion of the planned development. When several major items of development are involved, final inspection will be made upon completion of each item.</P>
                <P>(1) For new buildings and additions to existing buildings, inspections will be made at the following stages of construction and at such other stages of construction as determined by the County Supervisor or District Director except as modified by paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Stage 1.</E> Customarily, the initial inspection in construction cases is made just prior to or during the placement of concrete footings or monolithic footings and floor slabs. At this point, foundation excavations are complete, forms or trenches and steel are ready for concrete placement and the subsurface installation is roughed in. However, when it is not practicable to make the initial inspection prior to or during the placement of concrete, the County Supervisor or District Director will make the initial inspection as soon as possible after the placement of concrete and before any backfill is in place.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Stage 2.</E> The Stage 2 inspection will be made when the building is enclosed, structural members are still exposed, roughing in for heating, plumbing, and electrical work is in place and visible, and wall insulation and vapor barriers are installed. Customarily, this is prior to installation of brick veneer or any interior finish which would include lath, wallboard and finish flooring.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Stage 3.</E> The final inspection will be made when all on-site and off-site development has been completed and the structure is ready for occupancy or its intended use.</P>
                <P>(2) For rehabilitation of existing buildings, inspections will be made in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section, and at such other stages of construction to assure that construction is being performed in a professional manner and in accordance with Agency approved drawings and specifications.</P>
                <P>(3) For new construction when the structure will be covered by an insured 10-year warranty plan as described in exhibit L of this subpart, only the final inspection is required, except in cases when partial payments are required when the provisions of § 1924.6(a)(12)(v) of this subpart will be followed.</P>
                <P>(4) Arrangements should be made to have the borrower join the County Supervisor or the District Director in making periodic inspections as often as necessary to provide a mutual understanding with regard to the progress and performance of the work.</P>
                <P>(5) The Borrower should make enough periodic visits to the site to be familiar with the progress and performance of the work, in order to protect the borrower's interest. If the borrower observes or otherwise becomes aware of any fault or defect in the work or nonconformance with the contract documents, the borrower should give prompt written notice thereof to the contractor with a copy to the County Supervisor or District Director responsible for servicing the type of loan or grant involved.</P>
                <P>(6) The borrower should, when practicable, join the County Supervisor or District Director in making all final inspections.</P>

                <P>(7) When irrigation equipment and materials are to be purchased and installed, a performance test under actual operating conditions by the person or firm making the installation should be required before final acceptance is <PRTPAGE P="527"/>made. The test should be conducted in the presence of the borrower, a qualified technician, and, when practicable, the County Supervisor or District Director. If the Agency official is not present at the performance test, he or she should request the technician to furnish a report as to whether or not the installation meets the requirements of the plans and specifications.</P>
                <P>(8) For irrigation and drainage construction or any dwelling construction where part or all of the work will be buried or backfilled, interim inspections should be made at such stages of construction that compliance with plans and specifications can be determined.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Recording inspections and correction of deficiencies.</E> All periodic and final inspections made by the County Supervisor or District Director will be recorded on Form RD 1924-12 in accordance with the FMI. The County Supervisor or District Director will be responsible for following up on the correction of deficiencies reported on Form RD 1924-12. When an architect/engineer is providing services on a project, the District Director should notify the architect/engineer immediately of any fault or defect observed in the work or of any nonconformance with the contract document. If the borrower or the contractor refuses to correct the deficiencies, the District Director will report the facts to the State Director who will determine the action to be taken. No inspection will be recorded as a final inspection until all deficiencies or nonconforming conditions have been corrected.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Acceptance by responsible public authority.</E> When local (city) county, state, or other public authority) codes and ordinances require inspections, final acceptance by the local authority having jurisdiction will be required prior to final inspection or acceptance by the Agency.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Acceptance by project architect.</E> If architectural services pursuant to § 1924.13(a) of this subpart have been obtained, final acceptance by the project architect pursuant to § 1924.13(a)(5)(v) of this subpart will be required prior to acceptance by the Agency.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Making changes in the planned development.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The borrower may request changes in the planned development in accordance with this section.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority of the County Supervisor.</E> The County Supervisor is authorized to approve changes in the planned development involving loans and grants within the County Supervisor's approval authority provided:</P>
                <P>(1) The change is for an authorized purpose and within the scope of the original proposal.</P>
                <P>(2) Sufficient funds are deposited in the borrower's supervised bank account or with the interim lender, as appropriate, to cover the contemplated changes when the change involves additional funds to be furnished by the borrower.</P>
                <P>(3) The change will not adversely affect the soundness of the operation or the Agency's security. If uncertain as to the probable effect the change would have on the soundness of the operation or Agency security, the County Supervisor will obtain advice from the District Director on whether to approve the change.</P>
                <P>(4) If a surety bond has been provided on the full amount of the construction contract, the aggregate amount of all contract change orders on Form RD 1924-7, “Contract Change Order,” or other acceptable form will not exceed 20 percent of the original contract amount. Change orders for contracts on which a surety bond has been provided which increases the original contract amount by more than 20 percent may only be approved if additional surety is provided in the full revised amount of the contract. For purposes of this paragraph, letters of credit and deposits are not considered surety.</P>

                <P>(5) Change orders for contracts on which letters of credit or deposits have been provided on the full amount of the contract which will increase the original contract amount are approved only <PRTPAGE P="528"/>if additional letters of credit or deposits are provided in the full revised amount of the contract.</P>
                <P>(6) Modifications have been certified in accordance with § 1924.5(f)(1)(iii) or certification has been waived in accordance with § 1924.5(f)(1)(iii)(C) of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Authority of the District Director.</E> The District Director is authorized to approve changes in the development planned with RRH, RCH, and RHS loans and LH loans and grants within the District Director's approval authority, provided the conditions in § 1924.10(a) have been met. For such loans in excess of the District Director's approval authority, the borrower's request with the District Director's recommendation will be forwarded to the State Director for consideration.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Recording changes in the planned development.</E> (1) Changes should be accomplished only after Agency written approval. Changes will not be included in payment requests until approved by the borrower; the contractor, if applicable; the architect/engineer, if applicable; and the Agency loan approval official. Examples of changes requiring documentation are:</P>
                <P>(i) Any changes in labor and materials and their respective costs.</P>
                <P>(ii) Changes in facility design.</P>
                <P>(iii) Any decrease or increase in unit-price on final measurements that are different from those shown in the bidding schedule.</P>
                <P>(iv) Any increase or decrease in the time to complete the project.</P>
                <P>(2) All changes shall be recorded in chronological order as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) Contract method. Changes shall be numbered in sequence as they occur using Form RD 1924-7 with necessary attachments.</P>
                <P>(ii) Borrower method. An increase or decrease in the cash cost, extension of time, transfer of funds between items, or an addition or deletion of items of development, will be summarized on the front of Form RD 1924-1 by striking through the original figures on items and writing in the changes. Changes made in the “Development Plan” in the working drawings, or in the plans and specifications will be dated and initialed by all parties.</P>
                <P>(iii) Mutual self-help method. [See paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.]</P>
                <P>(iv) Owner-builder method. [See paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.]</P>

                <SUBJECT>District Director's review of incomplete development.</SUBJECT>
                <P>During monthly District Office work organization meetings and during regular visits to the County Office, the District Director will review the progress that is being made in completing development financed with loans within the District Director's and County Supervisor's responsibility.</P>
                <P>(a) Once each year the District Director will make a comprehensive review of all development work not completed within the time scheduled. For incomplete development financed with loan or grant funds within the responsibility of the District Director, the District Director will take the necessary actions to assure that the borrower or grantee completes the planned development. For incomplete development financed with loan or grant funds within the responsibility of the County Supervisor, the District Director will give the necessary direction to the County Supervisor to assure completion of the work. In connection with these responsibilities, the District Director will consider:</P>
                <P>(1) The current farm and home operations with respect to the need for the development as originally planned.</P>
                <P>(2) Revisions to the development plan.</P>
                <P>(3) Funds remaining in the supervised bank account.</P>
                <P>(4) Need for additional funds.</P>
                <P>(5) Personal funds that could be furnished by the borrower.</P>
                <P>(6) Estimated completion dates.</P>
                <P>(7) The borrower's attitude with respect to completing the development.</P>

                <P>(b) After a complete review of the status of development in both the District and County Offices has been made, the District Director will make a written report to the State Director which will include observations and recommendations regarding incomplete development. The report may be <PRTPAGE P="529"/>included in the District Director's regular report, and will include:</P>
                <P>(1) The number of cases in which borrowers have not completed their development within 9, 15 or 24 months when authorized, and also the number of cases in which funds have been exhausted and the work is incomplete.</P>
                <P>(2) The number of borrowers who have not completed their development within 3 years from the loan closing, and indicate the action that was taken in each such case.</P>
                <P>(c) If the borrower has not completed development work within 3 years after the date of loan closing and the District Director has determined that the borrower cannot or will not complete the development, the District Director will so indicate on Form RD 1924-1 and request the State Director to withdraw, for application on the loan, any unused development funds remaining in the borrower's supervised bank account, if the borrower will not sign a check for a refund to the loan account.</P>

                <P>(a) Form RD 1924-19, “Builder's Warranty,” or an insured 10-year home warranty as described in exhibit L of this subpart, and normal trade warranties on items of equipment will be issued to the borrower at the completion of new building construction, dwelling rehabilitation by the contract method, all cases of newly completed and previously unoccupied dwellings or construction under conditional commitments issued to builders and sellers.</P>
                <P>(b) If the warranty is not an insured 10-year warranty, a completed Form RD 1924-19, with warranty protection for 1 year, must be provided by the builder upon final acceptance of the work by the owner and the Agency. If an insured 10-year warranty is provided, the requirements of exhibit L of this subpart apply, and a copy of the warranty insurance policy or a binder must have been received by the Agency prior to disbursement of the final payment to the builder.</P>
                <P>(c) If, for some reason, the warranty insurance policy cannot be issued, the contractor will be required to execute Form RD 1924-19 and the case will be forwarded to the State Director for consideration of debarment under the provisions of subpart M of part 1940 (available in any Agency office). The County Supervisor will assist the borrower to the extent necessary under the provisions of the warranty and subpart F of part 1924 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(d) The County Supervisor will take the following action prior to the expiration of the first year of the warranty period:</P>
                <P>(1) As soon as the warranty has been executed, the follow-up date for sending Form RD 1924-21, “Notice of Expiration of First Year of Warranty,” which will be used for the 1 year warranty or the first year of the insured 10-year warranty, will be posted to the “Servicing and Supervision” section of the Management System card.</P>
                <P>(2) Form RD 1924-21 is provided for use in notifying the borrower of the expiration date of the first year of the warranty. This letter will be mailed to the borrower early in the second month preceding the expiration date of the first year of the warranty period.</P>
                <P>(3) If the County Supervisor or District Director does not hear from the borrower within 30 days, it can reasonably be assumed that no complaint exists or that any complaint has been satisfied unless information to the contrary has been received.</P>
                <P>(4) If the borrower notifies the Agency that any complaint has not been satisfied, an onsite inspection shall be made as early as possible, but not later than 1 month preceding the expiration date of the first year of the warranty. The results of the inspection will be recorded on Form RD 1924-12. If the borrower has complaints, the case should be handled in accordance with the provisions of subpart F of part 1924 of this chapter, or as otherwise provided in this subpart.</P>

                <P>This section includes additional provisions that apply to planning and conduct of construction work on all multiple family housing projects and other projects that are more extensive in scope and more complex in nature than <PRTPAGE P="530"/>individual housing units or farm buildings. This section will apply in addition to all other requirements contained elsewhere in this subpart.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Architectural services.</E> Complete architectural services, as defined in § 1924.4(o)(1) of this subpart are recommended on all projects. They are required for projects involving an LH grant and for all loans for RRH, RCH, and LH projects consisting of more than 4 units unless prior consent to making an exception to the requirements for complete architectural services is obtained from the National Office. If the applicant or contractor is an architect or organization with architectural capability, the applicant must, nevertheless, hire an independent qualified architect or architectural firm to inspect the construction work and perform other needed services during the construction and warranty phases. See Guide 4, attachment 1, “Attachment to AIA Document—Standard Form of Agreement Between Owner and Architect,” for further information (available in any Agency office).</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Exception.</E> Any request for National Office consent to an exception being made for complete architectural services should include the proposed drawings and specifications, method of providing specific services, the comments and recommendations of the Agency State Architect, and any other pertinent information. The State Director must determine that any services for which an exception is requested can be performed by qualified State or District Office staff members.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Selecting the architect.</E> The applicant is responsible for selecting the architect. The District Director with the advice of the State architect/engineer should discuss with the applicant the selection of the architect for the job as early as possible to assist in the site selection and participate in early consultations regarding project scope and design.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Architectural fees.</E> Fees for architectural services shall not exceed the fee ordinarily charged by the profession for similar work when Agency financing is not involved. The fee should cover only the architectural services rendered by the architect. The reduction or elimination of any services described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section shall be directly reflected in the fee.

These inspections will be augmented, when necessary, by inspections performed by structural, mechanical, and electrical representatives. Periodic inspections should be made as frequently as is necessary to verify that the work conforms with the intent of the contract documents and that a high quality of workmanship is maintained. The State Director may require a full-time project representative on projects with a total development cost of $750,000 or more, when in the opinion of the State Director there is a need for such representative, and the State Director states the reasons for such need to the borrower.</P>

                <P>(G) Determine, based on the inspections, the dates of substantial completion and final completion; receive on the borrower's behalf all written guarantees and related documents assembled by the contractor; and issue a final certificate for payment.<PRTPAGE P="532"/>

                <P>(1) Professional services typically include soils engineering, structural engineering, civil engineering, surveying, land planning, or professional cost estimation or certification. Fees for these services may be paid directly by the borrower or by the architect as reimbursable expenses.</P>
                <P>(2) When a project representative is utilized, unless otherwise agreed, the representative will be provided by the consulting architect/engineer. Prior to the preconstruction conference, the architect/engineer will submit a resume of qualifications of the project representative to the applicant and to the Agency for acceptance in writing. If the applicant provided the project representative, the applicant must submit a resume of the representative's qualifications to the project architect/engineer and the Agency for acceptance in writing, prior to the preconstruction conference. The project representative will attend the preconstruction conference where duties and responsibilities will be fully discussed. The project representative will work under the general supervision of the architect/engineer. The project representative will maintain a daily diary in accordance with the following:</P>
                <P>(i) The diary shall be maintained in a hard-bound book.</P>
                <P>(ii) The diary shall have all pages numbered and all entries in ink.</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Drawings.</E> The type and kinds of drawings should be in accordance with exhibit C of this subpart and subpart D of part 1944 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(1) The drawings must be clear, accurate, with adequate dimensions and of sufficient scale for estimating purposes.</P>
                <P>(2) Construction sections and large-scale details sufficient for accurate bidding and for the purpose of correlating all parts of the work should be part of the general drawings. This is particularly important where the size of a project makes necessary the preparation of the general drawings at a scale of <FR>1/8</FR> inch equals 1 foot or less.</P>
                <P>(3) Mechanical and electrical work should be shown on separate plans.</P>
                <P>(4) Schedules should be provided for doors, windows, finishes, electrical fixtures, finish hardware, and any other specialty items necessary to clarify drawings.</P>

Construction of all other projects, however, will be administered by the contract method or owner-builder method as set forth in this section.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Contract method.</E> This method of development will be used for all complex construction except in cases where owner-builder method is authorized. Development under this method is done in accordance with § 1924.6(a) of this subpart except as modified by this paragraph. All construction work will <PRTPAGE P="533"/>be completed under one written construction contract. Guide 1, “Contract Documents,” of this subpart (available in any Agency office) is provided to assist Agency personnel and applicants in assembling and reviewing contract documents for more complex construction such as that administered under this section.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Competitive bidding methods.</E> (A) All construction contracts must be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding unless an exception is granted in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(vii) of this section thereby permitting contract negotiation. The applicant's architect should prepare the bidding documents. Public notice must be given inviting all interested bidders to submit a bid. Prospective bidders may be contacted asking for their bids; however, public notice is necessary so that all local contractors have the opportunity to submit bids.</P>
                <P>(B) A bid bond is required from each bidder in the amount of 5 percent of the bid price as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of the bid, execute the required contract documents within the time specified.</P>
                <P>(C) The construction contract will be awarded based on the contract cost, and all conditions listed in the “Invitation to Bid.”</P>
                <P>(D) If advertising does not provide a satisfactory bid in the opinion of the applicant and the Agency, the applicant shall reject all bids and will then be free to negotiate with bidders on anyone else to obtain a satisfactory contract. The following conditions must be met:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The State Director determines that the original competitive bid process was handled in a satisfactory manner and that there is no advantage to advertising for competitive bid again.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(vii) of this section are met.</P>
                <P>(E) If there is no agreement by the Agency and the applicant as to the construction cost, the State Director will cease any further action on the preapplication and inform the applicant of the right to appeal in accordance with subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Contract documents.</E> Contract documents will conform with recognized professional practices as prescribed in this paragraph. Such contract documents will contain substantially the following:

                <P>(A) Substitution of term “architect” for “engineer” may be necessary on some of the forms. Other modifications may be necessary in some cases to conform to the nature and extent of the project. All such contract documents and related items will be concurred with by the State Director, with the assistance of OGC prior to the release of invitations to bid.</P>
                <P>(B) Items listed as I through IV and item XI of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section may be omitted when an exception to the competitive bidding requirement is granted in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(vii) of this section, thereby permitting a negotiated contract.</P>

                <P>(C) All negotiated contracts shall include a provision to the effect that the borrower, USDA, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers, and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to a specific Federal loan program for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and transcriptions.<PRTPAGE P="534"/>
                </P>
                <P>(D) A provision of liquidated damages <E T="03">will</E> be included in all contracts. The liquidated damage amount must be reasonable and represent the best estimate possible of how much interest or other costs will accrue on the loan, and also represent any loss of rent or other income which would result from a delay in the completion of the project beyond the estimated completion date.</P>
                <P>(E) All contracts shall include a provision for compliance with the Copeland “Anti-Kickback” Act (18 U.S.C. 874) as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 3). This Act prohibits anyone from inducing any person in connection with the construction to give up any part of the compensation to which the person is otherwise entitled.</P>
                <P>(F) All contracts will contain a certification by the applicant indicating that there is not now nor will there be an identity of interest between the applicant and any of the following: Contractor, architect, engineer, attorney, subcontractors, material suppliers, equipment lessors, or any of their members, directors, officers, stockholders, partners, or beneficiaries unless specifically identified to the Agency in writing prior to the award of the contract. All contracts must also indicate that when any identity of interest exists or comes into being, the contractor agrees to have construction costs as reported to the Agency on Form 1924-13, “Estimate and Certificate of Actual Cost,” audited by a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) or Licensed Public Accountant (LPA) licensed prior to December 31, 1970, who will provide an opinion as to whether the Form RD 1924-13 presents fairly the costs of construction in conformity with eligible construction costs as prescribed in Agency regulations.</P>
                <P>(G) All contracts on any form other than Form RD 1924-6, must contain the language of clause (D) of Form RD 1924-6, which is available in all Agency offices. The language of clause (D) of Form RD 1924-6 sets forth the Notice of Requirement for Affirmative Action to Ensure Equal Employment Opportunity required by Executive Order 11246, the Equal Opportunity clause published at 41 CFR 60-1.4 (a) and (b), and the Standard Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Construction Contract Specifications required by Executive Order 11246. For contract forms other than Form RD 1924-6, Form AD 767, “Equal Employment Opportunity Contract Compliance Notices,” which can be obtained from the Finance Office, should be attached and made a part of the contract.</P>

                <P>(H) All contracts will contain a provision that they are not in full force and effect until concurred with by the State Director or the State Director's delegate, in writing. Therefore, before loan closing or before the start of construction, whichever occurs first, the State Director or the State Director's delegate will concur in the contract form, content, and execution if acceptable, by including the following paragraph at the end of the contract:
                </P>
                <EXTRACT>

                <P>(I) The requirements of § 1924.6 (a)(11)(iv) of this subpart apply to all contracts or subcontracts in excess of $10,000.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Surety.</E> When multiple advances of loan or grant funds are utilized, surety that guarantees both payment and performance in the full amount of the contract will be provided in accordance with § 1924.6(a)(3)(ii) of this subpart. Exceptions to the surety requirements shall be governed by the following:</P>
                <P>(A) In accordance with the guidance and recommendations of OMB Circulars A-102 and A-110, exceptions to the surety requirements of § 1924.6(a)(3)(ii) of this subpart will not be granted for nonprofit organization or public body applicants.</P>

                <P>(B) For loans or grants to applicants other than non-profit organizations or public bodies that are within the State Director's approval authority, the State Director may, upon request of the borrower or grantee, grant exceptions to the surety requirements in accordance with the provisions of § 1924.6(a)(3)(iii) of this subpart. Before <PRTPAGE P="535"/>granting such an exception, however, the State Director should be provided the following information from the proposed contractor in order to fully evaluate the experience and capabilities of the contractor:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A resume indicating the contractor's history, ability and experience.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A current, dated and signed financial statement of the contractor's operations indicating the payment status of accounts and any contingent liabilities that may exist. Agency personnel will be responsible for analyzing the financial statement as to the sufficiency of the contractor's financial capability to carry out construction. The financial strength must demonstrate the ability of the contractor to pay all bills prior to receiving periodic draws of funds from the lender.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) A credit report (obtained at no expense to the Agency) attesting to the contractor's credit standing.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) A listing of trade references that could be contacted to substantiate the contractor's experience and good standing.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Statements from owners for whom the contractor has done similar work, indicating the scope of the work and the owner's evaluation of the contractor's performance.</P>
                <P>(C) For loans or grants to applicants other than non-profit organization or public bodies that are in excess of the State Director's approval authority, the State Director may request National Office authorization to grant one of the exceptions to the surety requirements as indicated in § 1924.6(a)(3)(iii) of this subpart. The following information must be submitted with the request to the National Office:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) An explanation of why interim financing is not available.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) An explanation of why the proposed contractor cannot obtain surety bonds meeting the requirements of § 1924.6(a)(3)(ii) of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The information listed in paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(B) of this section.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The drawings and specifications for the proposed project, together with the comments of the State architect/engineer.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) The applicant's written request for an exception.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) An explanation of why the requirements of § 1924.6(a)(3)(iii) (A) or (B) of this subpart cannot be met in those cases where the State Director requests authorization to grant an exception as indicated in § 1924.6(a)(3)(iii)(C) of this subpart. When such a request is made, the documentation required of the contractor under the provision must also be forwarded.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">7</E>) The State Director's recommendation.</P>
                <P>(D) Adequate steps will be taken to protect the interests of the borrower and the government in accordance with the payment provisions of § 1924.6(a)(12)(i) of this subpart and any alternative as outlined in § 1924.6(a)(3)(iii)(c) of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Contract cost breakdown.</E> In any case where the loan approval official feels it appropriate, and prior to the award or approval of any contract in which there is an identity of interest as defined in § 1924.4 (i) of this subpart, the contractor and any subcontractor, material supplier or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest must provide the applicant and the Agency with a trade-item cost breakdown of the proposed contract amount for evaluation. The cost of any surety as required by § 1944.222 (h) and (i) of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter and § 1924.6(a)(3) of this subpart, or cost certification as required by paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section, will be included in the proposed contract amount and shown under General Requirements on Form RD 1924-13, which is available in all Agency offices. Agency personnel will be responsible for reviewing the estimates on Form RD 1924-13 to determine if the dollar amounts total correctly, to assure that costs are categorized under their appropriate columns, and to confirm that the estimated costs for all line items are reasonable and customary for the State.</P>
                <P>(v) <E T="03">Cost certification.</E> Whenever the State Director determines it appropriate, and in all situations where there is an identity of interest as defined in § 1924.4(i) of this subpart, the borrower, contractor and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor having an identity of interest must each provide certification <PRTPAGE P="536"/>using Form RD 1924-13 as to the actual cost of the work performed in connection with the construction contract. The construction costs, as reported on Form RD 1924-13, must also be audited, in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, by a CPA, or LPA licensed on or before December 31, 1970. In addition, certain agreed upon procedures (available in any Agency office) will be performed in accordance with Attestation Standards. In some cases, the Agency will contract directly with a CPA or LPA for the cost certification. In that event, documentation necessary to have the costs of construction certified by an Agency contractor that they were the actual costs of the work performed, as reported on Form RD 1924-13, will be provided. Funds which were included in the loan for cost certification and which are ultimately not needed because Agency contracts for the cost certification will be returned on the loan. Agency personnel will utilize exhibit M of this subpart (available in any Agency office) and Form RD 1924-26, “Cost Certification Worksheet,” to assist in the evaluation of the cost certification process.</P>
                <P>(A) Prior to the start of construction, the borrower, contractor and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest must submit, to the CPA or LPA, the accounting system that the borrower, contractor, subcontractor, material supplier or equipment lessor and/or the CPA or LPA proposes to set up and use in maintaining a running record of the actual cost. In order to be acceptable, the borrower must provide a written assertion that it has an accounting system that is suitably designed to provide for a trade-item basis comparison of the actual cost as compared to the estimated cost submitted on Form RD 1924-13. Costs pertaining to a specific line item will be set up in the accounting system for that particular account. For instance, only costs of materials, supplies, equipment, and labor associated with concrete will be shown in the concrete account. The accounting system must also restrict costs to those pertaining to a specific project so that costs from multiple projects will not be co-mingled. The independent CPA or LPA shall report on the borrower's assertion in accordance with the Standards for Attestation Engagements of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). The borrower's and the CPA or LPA's reports on the accounting system shall be provided to the Agency by the borrower.</P>

                <P>(B) Prior to final payment to anyone required to cost certify, a trade-item breakdown showing the actual cost compared to the estimated cost must be provided to the owner and the Agency. Form RD 1924-13 is the form of comparative breakdown that must be used, and contains the certifications required of the applicant and contractor prior to final payment. The amounts for builder's general overhead, builder's profit, and general requirements, respectively, shall not exceed the amounts represented on the estimate of cost breakdown provided in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section for any contractor, subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor having or sharing an identity of interest with the borrower. The amounts for general overhead, builder's profit, and general requirements must be established prior to the Agency approving the construction contract and will not be changed during the course of construction. This applies to all contractors, subcontractors, material suppliers, or equipment lessors having or sharing an identity of interest with the applicant. Contract change orders will be processed to adjust the contract amount downward prior to the final payment to the contractor, if necessary, to assure that the amounts shown in the certificate of actual costs do not exceed the amounts represented in the contract cost breakdown. Reduction in the builder's profit, and general overhead if needed, will counterbalance any increase reflected in the contract costs. Any funds remaining as a result of hard cost savings will be applied to the account as an extra payment or used for eligible loan purposes approved by the Agency as long as the improvements are genuinely needed and will enhance marketability of the project. All increases or decreases of 15 percent or more in line item costs will require documentation as to the reason <PRTPAGE P="537"/>for the increases and/or decreases. The State Director may require documentation for increases and/or decreases of less than 15 percent, if he/she determines it necessary. This information will be required with the cost certification.</P>
                <P>(C) The CPA or LPA audit, performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, will include such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures of the borrower and the contractor (and any subcontractor, material supplier or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest) concerning the work performed, services rendered, and materials supplied in accordance with the construction contract he/she considers necessary to express an opinion on the construction costs as reported on Form RD 1924-13. The CPA or LPA shall also perform the additional agreed upon procedures specified by the Agency (available in any Agency office), performed in accordance with Attestation Standards, for the applicant and the contractor (and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest) concerning the work performed, services rendered, and materials supplied in accordance with the construction contract.</P>
                <P>(D) Upon completion of construction and prior to final payment, the CPA or LPA will provide an opinion concerning whether the construction costs, as reported on Form RD 1924-13, present fairly the costs of construction in conformity with eligible construction costs as prescribed in Agency regulations.</P>
                <P>(E) In some cases, cost certification will be obtained by the Agency through direct contract with the CPA or LPA. The borrower and his/her CPA or LPA will cooperate fully with the contract CPA or LPA by providing all documentation necessary to conduct the certification. The Agency reserves the right to determine, upon receipt of the certified Form RD 1924-13 and the auditor's report, whether they are satisfactory to the Agency. If not satisfactory to the Agency, the borrower will be responsible for providing additional information.</P>
                <P>(F) There will exist no business relationship between the CPA or LPA and the borrower except for the performance of the examination of the cost certification, accounting systems work, and tax preparation. Any CPA or LPA who acts as the borrower's accountant (performing manual or automated bookkeeping services or maintains the official accounting records) will not be the same CPA or LPA who cost certifies the project.</P>
                <P>(G) Forms RD 1944-30, “Identity of Interest (IOI) Disclosure Certificate” and RD 1944-31, “Identity of Interest (IOI) Qualification Form,” provide written notification to the borrower that willful and intentional falsification of cost certification documents will result in debarment of all violators in accordance with the provisions of RD Instruction 1940-M (available in any Agency office). These forms require the disclosure of all identities of interest associated with project construction, certify the entity's ability to provide the contracted service, and cite the penalties for failure to disclose or falsify such certification. Each applicant/borrower will be required to complete and sign the forms (available in any Agency office).</P>
                <P>(H) (<E T="03">Subcontracting development work.</E>(<E T="03">1</E>) Contractors will not be allowed to obtain a profit and overhead unless they are performing actual construction. “Actual construction” means “work” as defined in American Institute of Architects (AIA) documents: “* * * labor, materials, equipment, and services provided by the contractor to fulfill the contractor's obligations.” Under this definition, contractors who choose to subcontract out construction of the project to another contractor will not obtain a builder's fee (general overhead and profit) when:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) More than 50 percent of the contract sum in the construction contract is subcontracted to one subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor, and/or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Seventy-five percent or more with three or fewer subcontractors, material suppliers and/or equipment lessors.</P>

                </P>
                <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) The 50 percent rule will apply when division of the amount of the largest subcontract by the contract sum of the construction contract results in more than 50 percent.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) The 75 percent rule will apply when division of the sum of the amounts of the three largest subcontracts by the contract sum of the construction contract results in 75 percent or more.</P>
                <P>(I) <E T="03">Qualified contracting entities.</E> Contractors, subcontractors, material suppliers, and any other individual or organization sharing an identity of interest and providing materials or services for the project must certify that it is a viable, ongoing trade or business qualified and properly licensed to undertake the work for which it intends to contract. Form RD 1944-31 will be prepared and executed by the contracting entities. The form provides notification to the entities of the penalty, under law, for erroneously certifying to the statements contained therein. Debarment actions will be instituted against entities who fail to disclose an identity of interest in accordance with the provisions of RD Instruction 1940-M (available in any Agency office).</P>
                <P>(vi) <E T="03">Method of payments.</E> Partial payments may be requested in accordance with the terms of the construction contract on Form RD 1924-18, “Partial Payment Estimate,” or other professionally recognized form that contains the architect's certification, approval of the owner, and conditional acceptance of the Agency as shown in Form RD 1924-18.</P>

                <P>(A) If interim financing is available at reasonable rates and terms for the construction period, such financing shall be obtained. exhibit B of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter shall be used to inform the interim lender that the Agency will not close its loan until the project is substantially complete, ready for occupancy, evidence is furnished indicating that all bills have been paid or will be paid at loan closing for work completed on the project, all inspections have been completed and all required approvals have been obtained from municipal and governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the project.
                </P>
                <FP>Upon presentation of proper partial payment estimates approved by the applicant and accepted by the Agency, the interim lender may advance construction funds in accordance with the payment terms of the contract. It is suggested that partial payments not exceed 90 percent of the value of work in place and materials suitably stored on site.</FP>
                <P>(B) When interim financing is not available, payments will be made in accordance with § 1924.6(a)(12) of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(vii) <E T="03">Exception to competitive bidding</E>—(A) <E T="03">For all applicants.</E> An applicant may negotiate a construction contract provided the State Director grants an exception and documentation shows that:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The contract price is competitive with other projects similar in construction and design being built in the area.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The proposed contractor is experienced in construction of projects of similar size, scope, and complexity, and is recognized as a reliable builder.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The proposed development work meets all requirements of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) If appropriate for nonprofit organizations and public bodies, the applicant provides a copy of a duly authorized resolution by its governing body requesting the Agency to permit awarding the construction contract without formal bidding.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) The applicant is permitted by state law, local law and/or organizational by-laws to negotiate a construction contract.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) The requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of this section are met.</P>
                <P>(B) In considering an exception to competitive bidding, the following additional steps will be taken in all cases.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) If, after a full review of the case documents by the appropriate members of the State Office staff, the State Director determines that the requirements have been met and the costs are reasonable, an exception to competitive bidding may be granted. Written documentation of the State Office review results will be placed in the application file.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If after the full review by the State Office staff, the State Director determines that the negotiated contract price is not competitive with <PRTPAGE P="539"/>other similar projects in construction and design being built in the area, the applicant will be requested to competitively bid the construction of the project in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) If there is no agreement by the Agency and the applicant as to the construction cost, the State Director will cease any further action on the preapplication and inform the applicant of the right to appeal in accordance with subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(C) Any requests for exceptions to competitive bidding that are not covered in this section may be submitted to the National Office for consideration.</P>
                <P>(viii) <E T="03">Exception to contract method—public body.</E> With the approval of the National Office, the State Director may grant to a public body an exception to the requirement for using contract method construction under the following circumstances:</P>
                <P>(A) The loan or grant is for repair or rehabilitation of existing facilities and it is not practicable to perform all work by the contract method.</P>
                <P>(B) The applicant has the managerial ability and qualified employees necessary to complete the work successfully.</P>
                <P>(C) That applicant submits a written request to the District Director indicating:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The scope of work and construction timetable;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) What phases of work can be contracted and what cannot;</P>

                <P>(D) The request, recommendations of the District Director, appropriate members of the State Office staff and the State Director and the application file will be sent to the National Office.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Owner-builder method.</E> This method of development is used only when requested by profit or limited profit RRH applicants when the applicant or any of its controlling principals (such as stockholders, members, partners other than limited partners, directors, or officers), are general contractors by profession, and will serve as the builder of the project without a written construction contract. The State Director may make an exception to the contract method of construction and authorize proceeding by the owner-builder method of construction in accordance with the provisions of this section if the amount of the loan(s) does not exceed the State Director's approval authority. For projects over the State Director's authority, prior written consent of the National Office is required. In such cases, the drawings, specifications, cost estimates, copy of the State Architect/Engineer's review and detailed information on the applicant's qualifications will be submitted to the National Office along with the State Director's recommendations.</P>
                <P>(i) The applicant's request to construct a project by the owner-builder method of construction shall be in the form of a letter giving specific and detailed information concerning the owner-builder's proposal, and the qualifications and past experience of the owner-builder. The following information must be included with the request:</P>
                <P>(A) A resume indicating the owner-builder's history, ability, and experience.</P>
                <P>(B) Dated and signed financial statements on the owner-builder's operation (including balance sheets and statements of income and expense) from current and prior years indicating the payment status of the owner-builder's accounts and any contingent liabilities that may exist. Agency personnel will be responsible for analyzing the financial statement as to the sufficiency of the owner-builder's financial capability to carry out construction. The financial strength must demonstrate the ability of the owner-builder to pay all bills prior to receiving periodic draws of funds from the lender.</P>

                <P>(C) A written, dated, and signed statement agreement to provide any funds necessary in excess of the applicant's contribution and the loan amount to complete the project.<PRTPAGE P="540"/>
                </P>
                <P>(D) A credit report (obtained at no expense to the Agency) attesting to the owner-builder's credit standing.</P>
                <P>(E) A listing of trade references that could be contacted to substantiate the owner-builder's experience and good standing.</P>
                <P>(F) Statements from other persons for whom the owner-builder has done similar work, indicating the scope of the work and that person's evaluation of the owner-builder's performance.</P>
                <P>(G) A current, dated, and signed trade-item cost breakdown of the estimated total development cost of the project which has been prepared by the applicant/owner-builder. Form RD 1924-13 will be used for this purpose. If cost certification services are required by the Agency, the cost of such services may be included in the total development cost of the project. Any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest with the applicant/owner-builder as defined in § 1924.4(i) of this subpart must also provide a trade-item cost breakdown of the proposed amount.</P>
                <P>(H) Prior to the start of construction, the owner-builder and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest must submit, to the CPA or LPA, the accounting system that the owner-builder, subcontractor, material supplier or equipment lessor and/or the CPA or LPA proposes to set up and use in maintaining a running record of the actual cost. In order to be acceptable, the owner-builder must provide a written assertion that it has an accounting system that is suitably designed to provide for a trade-item basis comparison of the actual cost as compared to the estimated cost submitted on Form RD 1924-13. Costs pertaining to a specific line item will be set up in the accounting system for that particular account. For instance, only costs of materials, supplies, equipment, and labor associated with concrete will be shown in the concrete account. The accounting system must also restrict costs to those pertaining to a specific project so that costs from multiple projects will not be co-mingled. The independent CPA or LPA shall report on the owner-builder's assertion in accordance with the Standards for Attestation Engagements of the AICPA. The owner-builder's and the CPA or LPA's reports on the accounting system shall be provided to the Agency by the owner-builder.</P>
                <P>(I) A written, dated, and signed statement agreeing to permit U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, to have access to any books, documents, papers, and records which are directly pertinent to the specific Federal program for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts and transcriptions.</P>
                <P>(ii) In order to grant an exception to the contract method of construction and proceed with the owner-builder method of construction, the State Director must determine that the following conditions exist:</P>
                <P>(A) The applicant or at least one of its principals is a fully qualified and licensed (if necessary under applicable local law) builder by profession, has adequate experience in constructing the type of units proposed as well as projects of similar size, scope, and complexity and will be able to complete the work in accordance with the Agency approved drawings and specifications.</P>
                <P>(B) Based upon the information presented in the applicant's financial statements, the applicant is presently able and is likely to continue to be able to provide any funds necessary in excess of the applicant's contribution and the loan amount to complete the project.</P>
                <P>(C) The total development cost of the project does not exceed that which is typical for similar type projects in the area. The total development cost recognized by the Agency for each individual case will be determined by the MFH Coordinator with the advice of the State Architect.</P>
                <P>(D) The owner-builder has provided sufficient information on all contracts or subcontracts in excess of $10,000 to permit compliance with § 1924.6(a)(11)(iv) of this subpart.</P>

                <P>(iii) In addition to the requirements for the State Director to authorize the owner-builder method of construction as indicated in § 1924.13(e)(2) (i) and (ii) <PRTPAGE P="541"/>of this subpart, the following additional steps will be taken by the State Director.</P>
                <P>(A) If, after a full review of the case documents by the appropriate members of the State Office staff, the State Director determines that the requirements have been met and the construction cost is reasonable, an exception to competitive bidding may be granted. Written documentation of the State Office review results will be placed in the application file.</P>
                <P>(B) If, after the full review by the State Office staff, the State Director determines that the construction cost is not competitive with other similar projects in construction and design being built in the area, the applicant will be requested to competitively bid the construction of the project in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
                <P>(C) If there is no agreement by the Agency and the applicant as to construction cost and the applicant is not agreeable to any of the aforementioned alternatives, the State Director will cease any further action on the preapplication and inform the applicant of the right to appeal, in accordance with subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(iv) The development cost of the project may include a typical allowance for general overhead, general requirements and a builder's profit. These amounts may be determined by local investigation and also from HUD data for the area. The applicant/owner-builder and any subcontractors, material suppliers and equipment lessors having or sharing an identity of interest with the applicant/owner-builder may not be permitted a builder's profit, general overhead, and general requirements which exceed the amounts represented on their cost breakdown.</P>
                <P>(v) Under no circumstances will loan funds be used to pay the owner/builder or its stockholders, members, directors or officers, directly or indirectly, any profits from the construction of the project except a typical builder's fee for performing the services that would normally be performed by a general contractor under the contract method of construction. Discounts and rebates given the owner-builder in advance must be deducted before the invoices are paid. If discounts or rebates are given after the invoices are paid, the funds must be returned to the supervised bank account or applied on the interim construction loan, as appropriate. Under no circumstances will the dollar amount be placed in the reserve account.</P>
                <P>(vi) The plan and specifications must be specific and complete so that there is a clear understanding as to how the facility will be constructed and the materials that will be used.</P>
                <P>(vii) When architectural services are required by § 1924.13(a) during the construction and warranty phases they must be provided by an architect who has no identity of interest with the applicant/owner-builder. The services to be rendered during the construction and warranty phases include, but are not limited to inspections, changes in the scope of project or work to be done, administration of construction accounts, rejection of work and materials not conforming to the Agency approved drawings and specifications, and other appropriate service listed in § 1924.13(a)(5) (v) and (vi) of this subpart.</P>

                <P>(viii) The applicant/owner-builder and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest as defined in § 1924.4(i) of this subpart must each provide certification as to the actual cost of the work performed in connection with the construction of the project on Form RD 1924-13 prior to final payment. The construction costs, as reported on Form RD 1924-13, must be audited by a CPA, or LPA licensed on or before December 31, 1970, in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, and certain agreed upon procedures (available in any Agency office) performed in accordance with Attestation Standards. In some cases, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will contract directly with a CPA or LPA for the cost certification. In that event, documentation necessary to have the costs of construction certified by an Agency contractor that they were the actual costs of the work performed, as reported on Form RD 1924-13, will be provided. Funds which <PRTPAGE P="542"/>were included in the loan for cost certification and which are ultimately not needed because Agency contracts for the cost certification will be returned on the loan.</P>
                <P>(A) The CPA or LPA's audit, performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, will include such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures of the applicant/owner-builder (and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest) concerning the work performed, services rendered, and materials supplied in connection with the construction of the project he/she considers necessary to express an opinion on the construction costs as reported on Form RD 1924-13. Upon completion of construction and prior to final payment, the CPA or LPA will provide an opinion as to whether the construction costs as reported on Form RD 1924-13 present fairly the costs of construction in conformity with eligible construction costs as prescribed in Agency regulations. The Agency reserves the right to determine, upon receipt of the certified Form RD 1924-13 and the auditor's report, whether they are satisfactory to the Agency. At a minimum, the CPA or LPA shall also perform any additional agreed upon procedures (available in any Agency office) specified by the Agency, performed in accordance with Attestation Standards, of the owner-builder (and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest) concerning the work performed, services rendered, and materials supplied in connection with the construction. There will exist no business relationship between the CPA or LPA and the borrower except for the performance of the examination of the cost certification, accounting systems work, and tax preparation. Any CPA or LPA who acts as the borrower's accountant (performing manual or automated bookkeeping services or maintains the official accounting records) will not be the same CPA or LPA who cost certifies the project.</P>
                <P>(B) Prior to final payment to anyone required to cost certify, the Agency must be provided with a certification and a trade-item breakdown showing the actual cost compared to the estimated cost furnished in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(i)(G) of this section. Form RD 1924-13 is the form of comparative breakdown that must be used, and contains the certification required of the applicant/owner-builder prior to final payment. The amounts for builder's general overhead, general requirements, and builder's profit shall not exceed the amounts represented on the estimate of cost breakdown provided in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(i)(G) of this section for the owner-builder or any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor having or sharing an identity of interest with the applicant/owner-builder. Final payment to the owner-builder will be adjusted, if necessary, to assure that the amounts shown on the certificate of actual cost do not exceed the amounts represented on the cost breakdown. Any funds remaining as a result of hard cost savings will be applied to the account as an extra payment or used for eligible loan purposes approved by the Agency as long as the improvements are genuinely needed and will enhance marketability of the project. All increases or decreases of 15 percent or more in line item costs will require documentation as to the reason for the increases or decreases. The State Director may require documentation for increases or decreases of less than 15 percent, if he/she determines it necessary. This information will be required with the cost certification.</P>
                <P>(C) Subcontracting development work.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Owner-builders will not be allowed to obtain a profit and overhead unless they are performing actual construction. “Actual construction” means “work” as defined in AIA documents: “* * * labor, materials, equipment, and services provided by the contractor to fulfill the contractor's obligations.” Under this definition, owner-builders who choose to subcontract out construction of the project to another contractor will not obtain a builder's fee (general overhead and profit) when:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) More than 50 percent of the total cost of the building construction is subcontracted to one subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor, and/or<PRTPAGE P="543"/>
                </P>
                <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Seventy-five percent or more with three or fewer subcontractors, material suppliers, and/or equipment lessors.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) <E T="04">Note:</E> If two or more subcontractors have common ownership, they are considered as one subcontractor.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) How to apply rule:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) The 50 percent rule will apply when division of the amount of the largest subcontract by the total amount of the building cost results in more than 50 percent.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) The 75 percent rule will apply when division of the sum of the amounts of the three largest subcontracts by the total building cost results in 75 percent or more.</P>
                <P>(D) Qualified contracting entities. Contractors, subcontractors, material suppliers, and any other individual or organization sharing an identity of interest and providing materials or services for the project must certify that it is a viable, ongoing trade or business qualified and properly licensed to undertake the work for which it intends to contract. Form RD 1944-31 will be prepared and executed by the contracting entities.

                <P>(A) If interim financing is available at reasonable rates and terms for the construction period, such financing shall be obtained. Exhibit B of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter shall be used to inform the interim lender that the Agency will not close its loan until the project is complete, ready for occupancy, evidence is furnished indicating that all bills have been paid for work completed on the project, all inspections have been completed and all required approvals have been obtained from any governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the project. Upon presentation of proper partial payment estimates containing an estimate of the value of work in place which has been prepared and executed by the owner-builder, certified by the applicant's architect, and accepted by the Agency, the interim lender may advance construction funds in accordance with the provisions of this section. It is suggested that the partial payment not exceed 90 percent of the value of work in place and material suitably stored on site.</P>

                <P>(B) If interim financing is not available, partial payments not to exceed 90 percent of the value of work in place and materials suitably stored on site may be made to the owner-builder for that portion of the estimated cost of development guaranteed by a letter of credit or deposits meeting the requirements of § 1924.6(a)(3)(iii) (A), (B) or (C) of this subpart. Partial payments may not exceed 60 percent of the value of work in place in all other cases. The determination of the value of work in place will be based upon an application for payment containing an estimate of the value of work in place which has been prepared and executed by the owner-builder, certified by the borrower's architect, and accepted by the <PRTPAGE P="544"/>Agency. Prior to receiving the first partial payment, the owner-builder must submit a schedule of prices or values of the various trades or phases of the work aggregating the total development cost of the project as required in § 1924.13(e)(2)(i) (G) and (H) of this subpart. Each application for payment must be based upon this schedule, and show the total amount owed and paid to date for materials and labor procured in connection with the project. With each application for payment, the owner-builder must also submit evidence showing how the requested partial payment is to be applied, evidence showing that previous partial payments were properly applied, and a signed statement from the applicant's attorney, title insurance company, or local official in charge of recording documents certifying that the public records have been searched and that there are no liens of record. When the District Director has reason to believe that partial payments may not be applied properly, checks will be made payable to persons who furnish materials and labor for eligible purposes in connection with the project.</P>
                <P>(x) Under no circumstances shall funds be released for final payment or to pay any items of the builder's profit until the project is 100 percent complete, ready for occupancy, and the owner-builder has completed and properly executed Form RD 1924-13 or complied with the cost certification procedures of § 1924.13(e)(2)(viii) of this subpart.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Exhibit B to Subpart A of Part 1924—Requirements for Modular/Panelized Housing Units</HD>
                <P>For the benefit of the Agency this exhibit prescribes evaluation, acceptance, inspection and certification procedures formodular/panelized housing units proposed for use in Agency Rural Housing programs. It applies to proposed development packages provided either under a contract between an Agency borrower and a single contractor or under a conditional commitment. This exhibit also describes the use of background information available through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for analysis of manufactured products. This exhibit also applies to the evaluation of manufactured farm service buildings in paragraph XI, below. For the purpose of this exhibit, County Supervisor and County Office also mean District Director and District Office, respectively.</P>
                <P>I. Applicable Standards and Manuals.</P>

                <P>A. The HUD Handbook 4950.1, Technical Suitability of Products Program Technical and Processing Procedures, must be followed by housing manufacturers to obtain acceptance of their products. Acceptance documents issued by HUD include: Structural Engineering Bulletins (SEB) on a national basis, Area Letters of Acceptance (ALA) which when accepted by all Area HUD Offices in a HUD region will, in essence, become Regional Letters of Acceptance (RLA), Truss Connector Bulletins (TCB): and, Mechanical Engineering Bulletins (MEB). These documents as well as the Use of Material Bulletins (UM) and Materials Release Bulletins (MR) are addendums to the HUD Minimum Property Standards (MPS), Under handbook guidelines, HUD also examines state agency regulations concerning design, construction and labeling of modular/panelized housing units and designates those states having procedures acceptable for use under HUD programs. Modular/panelized housing produced in these states is called <E T="03">Category III</E> and is considered technically suitable for use without further structural analysis.</P>
                <P>B. All Agency Offices should maintain a close working relationship with each HUD office in their jurisdiction to assure coordination. Any deviations in structure, materials or design from HUD acceptance documents must comply with one of the other applicable development standards.</P>
                <P>II. Modular Housing Units that Require Factory Inspections.</P>
                <P>Only those types which cannot be completely inspected on site are required to obtain acceptance from HUD. Those that receive acceptance will be periodically factory inspected by HUD or HUD's designated agency, usually about every 6 months.</P>
                <P>III. Panelized Housing Units that Do Not Require Factory Inspections.</P>
                <P>A. Housing completely assembled on the building site does not require HUD acceptance. This includes housing that is manufactured but is assembled on the site such as: Precut pieces, log wall houses, trussed roof rafters or floor trusses; open panel walls, and other types that can be completely inspected on site.</P>
                <P>B. Housing that is assembled in local materials dealers' yards for moving to local sites and to be purchased by an Agency applicant, will be inspected during construction in the yard by the local Agency County representative. These units must be constructed according to the applicable development standard and not transported out of the local Agency County Office jurisdiction. The inspection must be recorded on Form RD 1924-12, “Inspection Report.”</P>
                <P>IV. Manufacturer's Actions Required for Submissions to the Agency are listed in attachment 1 to this exhibit B.</P>

                <P>6. Observe any noncompliance with the applicable development standard or with paragraphs IV and V of this exhibit B. In this respect:</P>
                <P>a. Minor noncompliance will be resolved by the manufacturer through the builder/dealer. In cases where there is no builder/dealer, the County Office may resolve such issues with the manufacturer directly.</P>
                <P>b. Noncompliance that cannot be resolved at the County Office level will be reported to the State Office.</P>
                <P>7. Inspect manufactured housing according to § 1924.8(d) of this subpart.</P>
                <P>8. Be aware that the accepted list may include many models from which loan applicants may choose. No changes from accepted model designs are permitted. The model selected by an applicant should be appropriate to the needs of that particular family in accordance with 7 CFR part 3550.</P>
                <P>VII. Noncompliance Issues.</P>
                <P>A. When minor issues are noted, the County Office will attempt to resolve them as described above. If they cannot be resolved locally, they will be referred to the State Office. When any issues cannot be resolved at State Office level, the National Office Program Support Staff (PSS) will be contacted for guidance.</P>
                <P>B. The National Office PSS coordinating with HUD, will take the appropriate actions to resolve the issues reported.</P>
                <P>C. Manufacturers and builder/dealers must be aware that if the Agency inspector finds any of the following conditions, the inspector may refuse to accept the construction until corrections have been made:</P>
                <P>1. Evidence of noncompliance with any option of the method described in the HUD—SEB, RLA, or ALA.</P>
                <P>2. Faulty shop fabrication, including surface defects.</P>

                <P>3. Damage to shop fabricated items or materials due to transportation, improper storage, handling or assembly operation.<PRTPAGE P="547"/>
                </P>
                <P>4. Unsatisfactory field or site workmanship.</P>
                <P>VIII. Actions by Other State Offices. When a State Office receives a copy of the accepted list from the State Office in which a manufacturing plant is located, it will:</P>
                <P>A. Maintain a file, by manufacturer, of each accepted list of models.</P>
                <P>B. Provide copies of the accepted list of models to each County Office in the State.</P>
                <P>C. Request a copy of the drawings, description of materials, and thermal calculations to determine compliance with the thermal requirements for the county in which the house is to be located according to exhibit D of this subpart.</P>
                <P>D. Check to see that County Offices within the state will act as prescribed in paragraph VI of this exhibit B.</P>
                <P>E. When two or more State Offices have different interpretations of the acceptability of a particular model, there must be an agreement between the states so that they will have the same requirements. If the states cannot agree, the National Office PSS will be consulted for guidance.</P>
                <P>IX. Subsequent Review.</P>
                <P>The Agency will make periodic reviews of houses, both site-built and houses manufactured offsite, to determine acceptability of the finished product. If, in the judgment of the Agency, the product has failed to perform satisfactorily, acceptance may be withdrawn. The State Director will notify the manufacturer and/or the builder/dealer of the reasons for the withdrawal no later than the time of withdrawal. Negotiations for corrections will be carried out by the County Office with the assistance of the State Office or National Office, as necessary.</P>
                <P>X. Materials and Products Acceptance—Material Release Bulletins, Use of Materials Bulletins, Manufacturer's Instructions.</P>
                <P>A. The Materials Release (MR) and Use of Materials Bulletins (UM) provide for the national acceptance of specific nonstandard materials and products not covered in the current HUD MPS.</P>
                <P>B. When contractors or builders intend to use products or materials not listed as approved in the MPS, the Agency personnel reviewing or concerned with the approval of construction in which the product is to be used, will require the contractor or builder to furnish a Materials Release Bulletin or Use of Materials Bulletin on the materials or products. If the product has been accepted, the supplier should be able to obtain the bulletin for the contractor or builder from the manufacturer. These bulletins describe the products or materials limitations to use, method of installing or applying, approved type of fasteners, if used, etc. and will provide the contractor with instructions as to proper installation or application.</P>
                <P>C. When Agency personnel are unfamiliar with any materials or products which have been accepted in the MPS, they will request the contractor or builder to furnish the manufacturer's instructions to assure that the materials or products are properly installed or applied. Any questions on any product that cannot be resolved in the County Office should be referred to the State Office. When the question cannot be resolved at the State Office level, the National Office PSS should be consulted for guidance.</P>
                <P>XI. Manufactured Farm Service Buildings.</P>
                <P>A. When a loan application is received that involves a manufactured building or special equipment that cannot be completely inspected on the site, the local State Land Grant University recommendations should be requested.</P>
                <P>B. When the County Office questions the advisability of making a loan on a manufactured building, the State Office should also be consulted.</P>
                <P>C. The State Office should review and make recommendations to the County Office. If doubt still exists, the National Office PSS should be consulted for guidance.</P>

                <P>A. <E T="03">British thermal unit</E> (Btu) means the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound (.4535 Kg.) of water by one degree Fahrenheit (F). For example, one Btu is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water from 59 degrees F to 60 degrees F.</P>
                <P>B. <E T="03">Glazing</E> is the material set into a sash or door when used as a natural light source and/or for occupant's views of the outdoors.</P>
                <P>C. <E T="03">“R” value,</E> thermal resistence, is a unit of measure of the ability to resist heat flow. The higher the R value, the higher the insulating ability.</P>
                <P>D. <E T="03">“U” value</E> is the overall coefficient of heat transmission and is the combined thermal value of all the materials in a building section. U is the reciprocal of R. Thus U = 1/R or R = 1/U or 1/C where C is the thermal conductance and is the unit of measure of the rate of heat flow for the actual thickness of a material one square foot in area at a temperature of one degree Fahrenheit. The lower the U value, the higher the insulating ability.</P>
                <P>E. <E T="03">Winter degree-day</E> is a unit based on temperature difference and time. For any one day, when the mean temperature is less than 65 degrees F (18.3 degrees Celsius), there are as many degree-days as the number of degrees difference between the mean temperature for the day and 65 degrees F. The daily mean temperature is computed as half the total of the daily maximum and daily minimum temperatures.</P>
                <P>F. <E T="03">CABO Model Energy Code, 1992 Edition (MEC-92)</E>—This code sets forth the minimum energy/thermal requirements for the design of new buildings and structures or portions thereof and additions to existing buildings.

                <P>If a central air conditioning system is provided by the home manufacturer, a “Comfort Cooling Certificate” must be permanently affixed to an interior surface of the unit that is readily visible. This certificate may be combined with the heating certificate on the data plate.</P>
                <P>V. <E T="03">General Design Recommendations:</E>
                </P>
                <P>A. Orient homes with greatest glass area facing south with adequate overhangs to control solar gain during non-heating periods. Examples of proper roof overhangs are given in attachment 3 to this exhibit D (available in any Agency office).</P>
                <P>B. Arrange plantings with evergreen wind buffers on north side and deciduous trees on south.</P>
                <P>C. Whenever possible, orient entry door away from winter winds.</P>
                <P>D. Design house with simple shape to minimize exterior wall area.</P>
                <P>E. Minimize glass areas within constraints of required light and ventilation, applicable safety codes and other appropriate consideration.</P>
                <P>F. Minimize the amount of paved surface adjacent to the structure where heat gain is not desirable.</P>

                <P>I. <E T="03">Purpose and Scope.</E> This exhibit describes and identifies acceptable site development, installation and set-up practices and concepts for manufactured homes. It is intended for Agency field personnel, builders, developers, sponsors, and others participating in Agency housing programs.</P>
                <P>This exhibit applies to all manufactured homes (except those referenced in exhibit B of this subpart) on scattered sites or in rental projects and subdivisions and covers the requirements for design and construction of manufactured home communities. The Agency may approve alternatives or substitutes if it finds the proposed design satisfactory for the proposed use, and if the materials, installation, device, arrangement, or method of work is at least equivalent to that prescribed in this exhibit considering quality, strength, effectiveness, durability, safety and protection of life and health.</P>
                <P>The Agency will require satisfactory evidence to be submitted to substantiate claims made regarding the use of any proposed alternative.</P>
                <P>II. <E T="03">Background.</E> The Agency has authority to make (1) section 502 Rural Housing (RH) loans with respect to manufactured homes and lots, and (2) section 515 Rural Rental Housing (RRH) loans with respect to manufactured home rental projects.<PRTPAGE P="564"/>
                </P>

                <P>The manufactured home must be constructed in conformance with the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standard (FMHCSS) and be permanently attached to a site-built permanent foundation which meets or exceeds the Minimum Property Standards (MPS) for One- and Two-Family Dwellings or Model Building Codes acceptable to the Agency. The manufactured home must be permanently attached to that foundation by anchoring devices adequate to resist all loads identified in the MPS. This includes resistance to ground movements, seismic shaking, potential shearing, overturning and uplift loads caused by wind. Note that anchoring straps or cables affixed to ground anchors other than footings will <E T="03">not</E> meet these requirements.</P>
                <P>7 CFR part 1970 applies on scattered sites, in subdivisions and rental projects with regard to the development, installation and set-up of manufactured homes. To determine the level of environmental analysis required for a particular application, each manufactured home or lot involved will be considered as equivalent to one housing unit or lot. Because the development, installation and set-up of manufactured home communities, including scattered sites, rental projects, and subdivisions, differ in some requirements from conventional site and subdivision development, two of the purposes of this exhibit are to:</P>
                <P>A. Encourage economical and orderly development of such communities and nearby areas, and</P>
                <P>B. Promote the safety and health of residents of such communities.</P>

                <P>The Stage 2 inspection for manufactured homes will be made within two working days after erection or placement on the foundation to determine compliance with accepted installation drawings and specifications for installation and set-up and to verify that the correct unit is on the site.</P>
                <P>Stages 2 and 3 inspections for manufactured homes may be combined when authorized by the State Director.</P>
                <P>B. The borrower will join the County Supervisor or the District Director in making periodic inspections as often as possible and always for the final inspection.</P>
                <P>C. The borrower should be encouraged to make enough periodic visits to the site to be familiar with the progress and performance of the work in order to protect the borrower's interest. If the borrower observes or otherwise becomes aware of any fault or defect in the work or nonconformance with the contract documents, the borrower should give prompt written notice thereof to the dealer-contractor and a copy of the notice to the appropriate County Supervisor or District Director.</P>
                <P>D. During inspection, it will generally be infeasible to determine whether a manufactured unit erected on a site was properly braced and stiffened during transportation. Inspectors should examine these units to determine that there is no obvious damage or loosening of fastenings that may have occurred during transportation. The dealer-contractor must warrant these units against such damage, which should protect the Agency's interest.</P>
                <P>III. <E T="03">Warranty Plan Coverage.</E> The warranty requirements for all development work shall be in accordance with § 1924.9(d) of this subpart and 7 CFR part 3550, subpart B.</P>

                <P>This exhibit distinguishes between what the Agency considers maintenance and repair work, moderate rehabilitation and substantial rehabilitation. In all cases, the building or project to be rehabilitated shall be structurally sound. The applicant shall have a structural analysis of the existing building made to determine the adequacy of all structural systems for the proposed rehabilitation.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">II. Definitions</HD>
                <P>Maintenance and Repair—Work involved in the selective replacement and general maintenance and repair of certain materials, appliances or components of an existing residential building.</P>
                <P>Moderate Rehabilitation—All work directly involved in the rearrangement of interior space, the replacement of finish materials or components of the electrical, plumbing, heating or conveyance systems of an existing multi-family residential building. Work and improvements are considered to be more than routine maintenance and repair.</P>
                <P>Substantial Rehabilitation—All work directly involved in the rearrangement of interior space that involves alteration of load bearing partitions and columns; the replacement of the electrical, plumbing, heating or conveyance systems; and the addition to and/or major conversion of existing multi-family residential buildings or other building structures.</P>
                <P>Moderate rehabilitation and repair shall not be limited to building changes for cosmetic or convenience purposes. In all cases moderate rehabilitation shall involve a minimum of three (3) components of building rehabilitation listed as moderate. Unless combined with other improvements in a project that are considered to be moderate or substantial rehabilitation the items identified as maintenance and repair are considered to be cosmetic and convenience changes.</P>

                <P>When a rehabilitation project consists of both moderate and substantial rehabilitation components, those substantial rehabilitation components shall be in accordance with the Agency's development standards and local codes and regulation requirements. Where the majority of project components of building rehabilitation are considered substantial <PRTPAGE P="570"/>the project shall be considered in the substantial rehabilitation category.</P>
                <P>Those site components of rehabilitation such as landscaping, grading, drainage, fencing, parking areas, recreation areas, water and waste disposal systems, etc., whether considered either maintenance and repair, moderate rehabilitation or substantial rehabilitation shall be in accordance with the Agency's development standards for site development work; all local codes and regulation requirements; and sound engineering and architectural practices.</P>
                <P>Any alteration of a structure listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places may be considered either moderate or substantial rehabilitation; however, it shall conform first to the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and then to the Agency's requirements. In cases where the Secretary of the Interior's standards cannot be met, rehabilitation will conform to the agreed upon approaches, treatments and techniques resulting from the consultation process between the Agency, the borrower, the State Historic Preservation Officer and the Advisory Council of Historic Preservation.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Exhibit L to Subpart A of Part 1924—Insured 10-Year Home Warranty Plan Requirements</HD>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">I. Purpose</HD>
                <P>In recent years, numerous third-party home warranty plans have been developed offering new homeowners varying degrees of protection against builder default and/or major structural defects in their homes. This exhibit establishes the criteria and procedures by which a warranty plan is found acceptable for new construction of single family homes financed by the Agency. An acceptable warranty plan will:</P>
                <P>A. Assure that the Agency borrowers receive adequate warranty coverage,</P>
                <P>B. In certain circumstances, eliminate the requirement for the Agency personnel to make the first two construction inspections, and</P>
                <P>C. Permit a loan up to the market value of the security (less the unpaid principal balance and past due interest of any other liens against the security), even though the Agency personnel may not have performed period inspections during construction.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">II. Types of Warranty Companies</HD>
                <P>A. An insured warranty company is underwritten by an insurance carrier, licensed to operate as an insurer by the states where the warranty company plans to operate, and has an acceptable rating from a nationally recognized rating company such as A.M. Best Company.</P>
                <P>B. A risk retention group is an insurer which is licensed in one state and is authorized, under the Products Liability Risk Retention Act of 1981, to issue its policies in all states. This authority is not challenged by the Agency; however, there remains some question as to the legal propriety of a 10-year insured warranty insurer to be a risk-retention group. If at some future time any state insurance commission or regulatory agency challenges the legal authority of such group, the Agency will reconsider its acceptance of the group.</P>
                <P>C. Individual state warranty plans, such as that offered by the State of New Jersey, are backed by the full faith and credit of the state government.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">III. Plan Requirements</HD>
                <P>To be considered acceptable, a warranty plan must include the following features:</P>
                <P>A. The entire cost (fee, premium, etc.) of the coverage is prepaid and coverage automatically transfers to subsequent owners without additional cost.</P>
                <P>B. The coverage is not cancellable by the warrantor (builder), warranty company or insurer.</P>
                <P>C. The coverage age includes at least the following:</P>
                <P>(1) For one year from the effective date, any defects caused by faulty workmanship of defective materials.</P>
                <P>(2) During the second year after the effective date, the warranty continues to cover the wiring, piping and duct work of the electrical, plumbing, heating and cooling systems, plus the items in (3).</P>
                <P>(3) During the third through the tenth years, the warranty continues to cover major structural defects. A major structural defect is actual damage to the load-bearing portion of the home including damage due to subsidence, expansion or lateral movement of the soil (excluding movement caused by flood or earthquake) which affects its load-bearing function and which vitally effects or is imminently likely to affect use of the home for residential purposes.</P>
                <P>D. A system is provided for complaint (claims) handling which includes a conciliation and, if necessary to resolve matters in dispute, arbitration arranged by the American Arbitration Association or similar organization.</P>
                <P>E. A construction inspection plan is required if the Agency is to eliminate the first two Agency inspections or permit a full market value loan when Agency inspections are not conducted.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">IV. Information for Review</HD>
                <P>A. Companies submitting warranty plans for a determination of acceptability must support requests with the following information.</P>
                <P>(1) Evidence that the insured warranty company has met the applicable state licensing and/or regulatory requirements in the state in which the company plans to operate.</P>
                <P>(2) Evidence that the insurance carrier underwriting the warranty plan is licensed to operate as an insurer in the states in which the company plans to operate and has an acceptable rating from a nationally recognized company such as A.M. Best Company.</P>
                <P>(3) State warrenty plan agencies will provide evidence that the plan is backed by the full faith and credit of the state.</P>

                <P>(4) A full description of the warranty plan including information on the fees, builder and home registration procedures, required <PRTPAGE P="572"/>construction standards, construction inspection procedures, coverage provided and claims procedures.</P>
                <P>(5) A sample copy of the warranty information and/or policy which is provided to the homeowner.</P>
                <P>(6) Suggested means by which Agency field offices can readily assure that the builder is a member in good standing prior to loan approval and that a warrant will be issued upon the completion of construction prior to the final release of funds.</P>
                <P>B. Submission and Acceptance:</P>
                <P>(1) Insured warranty companies, except those operating as risk retention groups, and state warranty plan agencies will submit their requests and supporting information to the Agency State Director in the state in which they plan to operate. State Directors will determine the acceptability of insured warranty plans and state warranty plans in their jurisdictions, notify the company or agency of the decision in writing and notify field offices by issuance of a State Supplement including the names and addresses of acceptable warranty companies and any other pertinent information.</P>
                <P>(2) Warranty companies claiming authority as risk retention groups will submit their requests and supporting information including certification that it has complied with all requirements of the Products Liability Risk Retention Act of 1981 (Pub. L. 97-45) and information indicating the state in which it is licensed, information to the Agency National Office, Single Family Housing Processing Division. The National Office will determine the acceptability of the warranty of a risk retention group, notify the company of the decision in writing and notify field offices by issuance of an attachment to this exhibit.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">V. Warranty Performance</HD>
                <P>A. County Supervisors will report inadequate warranty performance through their District Director to the State Director. State Directors will review the situation, assist in resolving any problems and, if necessary, initiate action under subpart F of part 1942 of this chapter. State Directors will inform, by memorandum, the Director, Single Family Housing Processing Division, National Office, of any problems with warranty performance and if any debarment action is initiated.</P>
                <P>B. State Directors will annually monitor each warranty company and/or its insurer to assure continued compliance with state licensing and/or regulatory requirements.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Attachment 1—Acceptable Warranty Companies</HD>
                <P>The warranty companies listed below claim authority to act as a risk retention group under the Products Liability Risk Retention Act of 1981 and as such, to operate in all States to provide 10-year home warranties. This authority remains subject to future challenges by any State insurance commissioner or regulatory agency; however, until such challenge is made, the Agency accepts their warranty.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Planning is an evaluation of specific development for a specific site. Planning must take into consideration topography, soils, climate, adjacent land use, environmental impacts, energy efficiency, local economy, aesthetic and cultural values, public and private services, housing and social conditions, and a degree of flexibility to accommodate changing demands. All planning and performing development work is the responsibility of the applicant or developer. All development will be arranged and completed according to applicable local, state, or Federal regulations including applicable health and safety standards, environmental requirements, and requirements of this subpart. When a public authority requires inspections prior to final acceptance, written assurance by the responsible public authority of compliance with local, city, county, state or other public codes, regulations, and ordinances is required prior to final acceptance by RHS.</P>

Such services may be provided by the applicant's or developer's “in house” staff subject to RHS concurrence. Technical services must be performed by professionals who are qualified and authorized to provide such services in the state in which the project would be developed. All technical services must be provided in accordance with the requirements of professional registration or licensing boards. At completion of all construction or completion of a phase or phases of the total project, the persons providing technical services under this section must notify the RHS field office in writing that all work has been completed in substantial conformance with the approved plans and specifications.</P>
                <P>(iii) For developments not specifically required to have technical services under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, such services may be required by the state director when construction of streets or installation of utilities is involved.</P>

                <P>(1) The site must be located in an eligible area as defined in the program regulations under which the development is being funded or approved.</P>
                <P>(2) The site must comply with the environmental review requirements in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Single Family Housing.</E> In addition to the general requirements in paragraph (a) of this section, sites must provide a desirable, safe, functional, convenient, and attractive living environment for the residents.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Multiple Family Housing.</E> Multiple family housing projects shall be located in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (r) of § 1944.215. Locating sites in less than desirable locations of the community because they are in close proximity to undesirable influences such as high activity railroad tracks; adjacent to or behind industrial sites; bordering sites or structures which are not decent, safe, or sanitary; or bordering sites which have potential environmental concerns such as processing plants, etc., is not acceptable. Screening such sites does not make them acceptable. Sites which are not an integral part of a residential community and do not have a reasonable access, either by location or terrain, to essential community facilities such as water, sewerage, schools, shopping, employment opportunities, medical facilities, etc., are not acceptable.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Water and wastewater disposal systems</E>—(1) <E T="03">Single Family Housing.</E> If sites are served by central water or sewer systems, the systems must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section. If sites have individual water or sewer systems, they must meet the requirements of the state department of health or other comparable reviewing and regulatory authority and the minimum requirements of exhibit B (available in any RHS field office), paragraphs V and VI. Sites in subdivisions of more than 25 dwelling units on individual systems, or sites that do not meet the requirements of exhibit B, paragraphs V and VI, must have state director concurrence.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Multiple Family Housing.</E> Proposals processed under this paragraph shall be served by centrally owned and operated water and wastewater disposal systems unless this is determined by RHS to be economically or environmentally not feasible. All central systems, whether they are public, community, or private, shall meet the design requirements of the state department of health or other comparable reviewing and regulatory authority. The regulatory authority will verify in writing that the water and wastewater systems are in compliance with the current provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act, respectively.</P>
                <P>(i) Sites which are not presently served by a central system, but are scheduled for tie-in to the central system within 2 years, should have all lines installed during the initial construction. Such sites must have an approved interim water supply or wastewater disposal system installed capable of satisfactory service until the scheduled tie-in occurs.</P>

                <P>(ii) In addition to written assurance of compliance with state and local requirements, there must be assurance of continuous service at reasonable rates for central water and wastewater disposal systems. Public ownership is preferred whenever possible. In cases where interim facilities are installed pending extension or construction of permanent public services, the developer must assume responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the interim facility or establish an entity <PRTPAGE P="576"/>for its operation and maintenance which is acceptable to the local governing body. If a system is not or will not be publicly owned and operated, it must comply with one of the following:</P>
                <P>(A) Be an organization that meets the ownership and operating requirements for a water or wastewater disposal system that RHS could finance under 7 CFR part 1942, subpart A or be dedicated to and accepted by such an organization.</P>
                <P>(B) Be an organization or individual that meets other acceptable methods of ownership and operation as outlined in HUD Handbook 4075.12, “Ownership and Organization of Central Water and Sewerage Systems.” RHS should be assured that the organization has the right, in its sole discretion, to enforce the obligation of the operator of the water and sewerage systems to provide satisfactory continuous service at reasonable rates.</P>
                <P>(C) Be adequately controlled as to rates and services by a public body (unit of Government or public services commission).</P>
                <P>(iii) Multiple family developments of more than 25 units with individual system must have national office concurrence.</P>
                <P>(A) [Reserved]</P>
                <P>(B) Supporting information for the proposed individual water systems, covering the following points:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) In areas where difficulty is anticipated in developing an acceptable water supply, the availability of a water supply will be determined before closing the loan.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Documentation must be provided that the quality of the supply meets the chemical, physical, and bacteriological standards of the regulatory authority having jurisdiction. The maximum contaminant levels of U.S. EPA shall apply. Individual water systems must be tested for quantity and bacteriological quality. Where problems are anticipated with chemical quality, chemical tests may be required. Chemical tests would be limited to analysis for the defects common to the area such as iron and manganese, hardness, nitrates, pH, turbidity, color, or other undesirable elements. Polluted or contaminated water supplies are unacceptable. In all cases, assurance of a potable water supply before loan closing is required.</P>
                <P>(C) Supporting information for individual wastewater disposal systems with subsurface discharge provided by a soil scientist, geologist, soils engineer, or other person recognized by the local regulatory authority. This data must include the following:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Assurance of nonpollution of ground water. The local regulatory authority having jurisdiction must be consulted to ensure that installation of individual wastewater systems will not pollute ground water sources or create other health hazards or otherwise violate State water quality standards.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Records of percolation tests. Guidance for performing these tests is included in the EPA design manual, “Onsite Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems” and the minimum RHS requirements are in exhibit B, paragraph VI. (These may be waived by the state director when the state has established other acceptable means for allowing onsite disposal.)</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Determination of soil types and description. The assistance of the SCS or other qualified persons should be obtained for soil type determination and a copy of its recommendations included in the documentation.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Soil and geologic conditions must be suitable for the type of construction proposed. In questionable or unsurveyed areas, the applicant or developer will provide an engineering report with supporting data sufficient to identify all pertinent subsurface conditions which could adversely affect the structure and show proposed solutions. Grading will promote drainage of surface water away from buildings and foundations, minimize earth settlement and erosion, and assure that drainage from adjacent properties onto the development or from the development to adjacent properties does not create a health hazard or other undesirable conditions. Grading and drainage will comply with exhibit B, paragraphs III and IV, of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Cuts and fills.</E> Development requiring extensive earthwork, cuts and fills of 4 feet or more shall be designed by a professional engineer. Where topography requires fills or extensive earthwork that must support structures and building foundations, these must be controlled fills designed, supervised, and tested by a qualified soils engineer.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Slope protection.</E> All slopes must be protected from erosion by planting or other means. Slopes may require temporary cover if exposed for long periods during construction.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Storm water systems.</E> The design of storm water systems must consider convenience and property protection both at the individual site level and the drainage basin level. Storm water systems should be compatible with the natural features of the site. In areas with inadequate drainage systems, permanent or temporary storm water storage shall be an integral part of the overall development plan. Design of these facilities shall consider safety, appearance, and economical maintenance operations.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Exhibit B to Subpart C of Part 1924—Site Development Design Requirements</HD>
                <P>This exhibit prescribes site development requirements to be used in developing residential sites in all housing programs. These requirements cover only those areas which involve health and safety concerns. They are not intended to cover all aspects of site development. Applicants and developers are expected to follow local practice, as a minimum, in all areas of site development not addressed in this exhibit. When State, local, or other requirements are applicable in addition to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's requirements, the most stringent requirement shall apply.</P>
                <P>Proper integration of the natural features of a site with the manmade improvements is one of the most critical aspects of residential development. Poor site planning in large scale subdivisions, rental projects and individual sites, has resulted in a loss of valuable private and public natural resources and caused economic burdens and conditions unsuitable for healthy and pleasant living. Proper site design can preserve desirable natural features of the site, minimize expenses for streets and utilities, and provide a safe and pleasant living environment.</P>

                <P>A. <E T="03">Types</E>—1. <E T="03">Collector streets.</E> Collector streets are feeder streets which carry traffic from local streets to the major system of arterial streets and highways. They include the principal entrance streets of residential developments and streets for circulation within such developments.</P>
                <P>2. <E T="03">Local streets.</E> Local streets are minor streets used primarily for access to abutting properties. These include drives serving multi-family housing units.</P>
                <P>B. <E T="03">Design Features</E>—1. <E T="03">Emergency Access.</E> Access for fire equipment and other emergency vehicles shall be within 100 feet of main building entrances.</P>
                <P>2. <E T="03">Cul-de-sacs.</E> Cul-de-sac streets shall have a turn-around with an outside roadway diameter of at least 80 feet, and a right-of-way diameter of at least 100 feet.</P>
                <P>3. <E T="03">Intersection Angle.</E> Streets shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at an angle less than 75 degrees. <PRTPAGE P="580"/>Curb radii shall be a minimum of 20 feet for street intersections.</P>
                <GPH DEEP="124" SPAN="2">
                  <GID>EC22SE91.000</GID>
                </GPH>
                <P>4. <E T="03">Intersection Sight Distance.</E> Adequate distances must be maintained at intersections. Vehicles must be visible when within 75 feet of the centerlines of uncontrolled intersecting streets.</P>
                <P>C. <E T="03">Street Geometry</E>—1. <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The definitions in Sections I.C.1.a and I.C.1.b. apply to the requirements in Section I.C.2.</P>
                <P>a. <E T="03">Terrain Classifications.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(1) Ordinary—Slope less than 8%.</P>
                <P>(2) Rolling—Slope range of 8% to 15%.</P>
                <P>(3) Hilly—Slope greater than 15%.</P>
                <P>b. <E T="03">Development Density</E> (Number of Lots). (Land Area minus Undeveloped Areas greater than Average Lot Size)</P>
                <P>(1) Low—Less than 2 lots per acre.</P>
                <P>(2) Medium—2 to 6.0 lots per acre.</P>
                <P>(3) High-More than six lots per acre.</P>
                <P>2. <E T="03">Design Requirements.</E> Collector streets and local streets shall comply with the requirements in tables 1 and 2 unless an exception is granted by the State Director. These requirements may need modification in localities having winter icing conditions.</P>

                <P>A. <E T="03">Individual Water Systems</E>—1. <E T="03">General.</E> a. In this subpart, an individual water system is a system which serves fewer customers or connections than the lower threshold for community systems stated in the Safe Drinking Water Act.</P>

                <P>b. The system for an individual household should be capable of delivering a sustained <PRTPAGE P="583"/>flow of 5 gpm. A system supplying water to multiple household shall be designed by a Professional Engineer and have sufficient capacity to serve estimated demand. A test of at least 4 hours duration shall be conducted to determine the yield and maximum drawdown for all wells developed as part of an individual water system. This test may be waived by the State Office based on the hydrologic and geologic conditions in the area.</P>
                <P>c. Water that requires continual or repetitive treatment to be safe bacterially is not acceptable.</P>
                <P>d. After installation, the system should be disinfected in accordance with the recommendations of the health authority. In the absence of a health authority, system cleaning and disinfection should conform with the current EPA Manual of Individual Water Supply Systems.</P>
                <P>e. Any method for individual water supply contained herein which is not permitted by the local health authority having jurisdiction shall not be used.</P>
                <P>2. <E T="03">Well Location</E>—a. A well located within the foundation walls of a dwelling is not acceptable except in arctic and sub-arctic regions.</P>
                <P>b. Water which comes from soil formation which may be polluted or contaminated or is fissured or creviced or which is less than 20 feet below the natural ground surface (subject to the requirements of the local health authority) is not acceptable.</P>
                <P>c. Individual water supply systems are not acceptable for individual lots in areas where chemical soil poisoning is practiced if the overburden of soil between the ground surface and the water bearing strata is coarse-grained sand, gravel, or porous rock, or is creviced in a manner which will permit the recharge water to carry the toxicants into the zone of saturation.</P>
                <P>d. Table 5 shall be used in establishing the minimum acceptable distances between wells and sources of pollution located on either the same or adjoining lots. These distances may be increased by either the health authority having jurisdiction or the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Director.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
                <P>This subpart contains policies and procedures for receiving and resolving complaints concerning the construction of dwellings and construction, installation and set-up of manufactured homes (herein called “units”), financed by the Rural Development, and for compensating borrowers for structural defects under section 509(c) of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended. Provisions of this subpart do not apply to dwellings financed with guaranteed section 502 loans.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
                <P> Rural Development is responsible for receiving and resolving all complaints concerning the construction of dwellings and the construction, installation and set-up of units financed by Rural Development. Rural Development must determine whether defects are structural or non-structural. If the defect is structural and is covered by the builder's/dealer-contractor's (the “contractor”) warranty, the contractor is expected to correct the defect. If the contractor cannot or will not correct the defect, the costs of correcting the defect may be paid by the Government, or the borrower may be compensated for correcting the defect, under the provisions of this subpart. If the defect is non-structural but is covered under the provisions of the contractor's warranty or independent home warranty, the contractor is still expected to correct the defect. Rural Development will assist the borrower in obtaining assistance through the independent home warranty company's and/or manufacturer's complaint resolution process. However, if the contractor cannot or will not correct a non-structural defect covered under the provisions of the contractor's warranty, the Government will not pay the costs for correcting the defect, nor will the borrower be compensated for doing so.</P>

                <P> Rural Development will notify by letter all borrowers who receive Section 502 RH financial assistance for a newly constructed dwelling or unit of the provisions of this subpart. Subsequent owners of eligible dwellings will also be notified in accordance with this section. Borrowers will be notified within 30 days after the loan is closed, or within 30 days after final inspection, whichever is later. This notification will contain information concerning time frames for filing claims under this subpart. Rural Development will also notify and advise borrowers of the construction defects procedure at any time construction defects are apparent within the statutory time frame and favorable results cannot be obtained from the contractor. This notification will be documented in the borrower's case file.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Handling dwelling construction complaints.</SUBJECT>
                <P>This section describes the procedure for handling construction defect complaints.</P>
                <P>(a) Each borrower who complains about construction defects will be requested to make a written complaint using a Rural Development approved format. All known defects will be listed. An oral complaint may be accepted if making a written complaint will impose a hardship on the borrower. If an oral complaint is made, Rural Development will notify the contractor on behalf of the borrower.</P>
                <P>(b) The borrower will be informed that if, after 30 calendar days, the defects have not been corrected or other satisfactory arrangements made by the contractor, the borrower should notify Rural Development using a Rural Development approved format.</P>
                <P>(c) Rural Development will advise the contractor in writing of the borrower's complaint, the time and date of planned inspection by Rural Development personnel, and request that the contractor accompany the inspector and borrower on a joint inspection of the property in an attempt to resolve the complaint.</P>
                <P>(d) If, prior to the planned inspection, the contractor informs Rural Development that the alleged defect(s) has been or will be corrected within 30 calendar days, Rural Development will notify the borrower.</P>
                <P>(e) If the case is not resolved as outlined in paragraph (d) of this section, Rural Development will:</P>
                <P>(1) [Reserved]</P>
                <P>(2) Notify the borrower, contractor and manufacturer, if applicable, in writing of the findings and who has been determined responsible for correcting the defect(s).</P>
                <P>(i) If the defects are determined to be covered under the contractor's warranty, Rural Development will advise the contractor that the repairs must be completed within 30 calendar days or other time period agreed to by the borrower, the contractor, and Rural Development.</P>

                <P>(ii) Rural Development will further advise the contractor and/or manufacturer that if the defect(s) are not corrected, the Government will consider compensating the borrower for the costs of correcting the defect(s). In such a case, the contractor and/or manufacturer may be liable for costs paid by the Government and may be subject to suspension and/or debarment pursuant to subpart M of part 1940 of this <PRTPAGE P="589"/>chapter (available in any Rural Development office). Even if the manufacturer is determined to be solely responsible for the defect, the contractor will still be held liable for correction of the defect.</P>
                <P>(3) Should a contractor refuse to correct a defect after being officially requested in writing to do so, Rural Development will promptly institute formal suspension and debarment proceedings against the contractor (as a company and as individual(s)) in accordance with subpart M of part 1940 of this chapter (available in any Rural Development office). The contractor's failure to reply to official correspondence or inability to correct a defect constitutes noncompliance.</P>
                <P>(4) If the contractor is willing to correct legitimate defects but the borrower refuses to permit this, Rural Development will document the facts in the borrower's case file. If the borrower chooses to file a claim for compensation for these defects, the circumstances of the borrower's refusal will be reviewed and may be sufficient grounds for disapproval of the claim.</P>

                <P>When a borrower who has purchased a manufactured home (or “unit”) complains about construction defects, the borrower will be instructed to first contact the dealer-contractor from whom the unit was purchased. Rural Development will assist the borrower in obtaining assistance through the dealer-contractor's and/or HUD's complaint resolution process. If the dealer-contractor cannot resolve the complaint, the borrower should contact the appropriate State Administrative Agency (SAA) or HUD.

                <P>When a borrower whose dwelling was constructed by the self-help method complains about construction defects, Rural Development will determine whether the defect is the result of work performed by a contractor or work performed by the borrower under the guidance of the self-help group. Defects which are determined to be the responsibility of a contractor will be handled in accordance with § 1924.259 of this subpart. Defects determined to be the result of work performed by the borrower are not eligible for compensation under this subpart.</P>

For loans made to construct a new dwelling or erect a new manufactured housing unit, financial assistance is granted on the date of final construction inspection and acceptance by the borrower and Rural Development. Claims must be submitted by completing the designated form (available in any Rural Development office).</P>
                <P>(5) Any obligation of the contractor to correct the defect(s) under a contractor's warranty must have expired, or the contractor is responsible for making corrections under the contractor's warranty but is unable or unwilling to do so.</P>
                <P>(b) Subsequent owners of eligible dwellings or units who are also Section 502 borrowers may be eligible to receive compensation for construction defects. These owners will be notified in accordance with § 1924.258 of this subpart. However, the claim for compensation must be filed in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section within the 18-month period established for the original rural housing (RH) borrower.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Purposes for which claims may be approved.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligible purposes.</E> A claim may be approved to:</P>
                <P>(1) Pay, or reimburse the borrower for costs already paid, to repair major structural defects which are completed in accordance with plans and specifications approved by Rural Development. Repairs must be made by a reputable licensed contractor and a warranty covering the repairs will be issued by the contractor when the repairs are completed, as prescribed in subpart A of this part. Payment will be based on actual cost of the development and the borrower must provide evidence to reasonably establish the development cost. Workmanship and materials used in repairs must be consistent with the level of quality specified in the original dwelling or unit specifications and/or comparable to the items being replaced. Payment may be made:</P>
                <P>(i) To cover damages which are a direct result of the defect to permanent enhancements made, such as landscaping, completion of unfinished living spaces, etc., of the dwelling or unit, installation or set-up of the unit, or related facilities, and</P>
                <P>(ii) For costs approved by Rural Development for professional reports by engineers, architects or others needed to determine cause of or means to repair the defect.</P>
                <P>(2) Reimburse the borrower for funds expended for emergency repairs. Emergency repairs are those repairs necessary to preserve the integrity of the structure, to prevent damage or further damage to personal property or fixtures in the dwelling or unit and related facilities, or to prevent or eliminate immediate health hazards. Receipts or other evidence of borrower's expenditures must be provided.</P>
                <P>(3) Acquire title to the property by the Government and, when appropriate, compensate the claimant for any loss of borrower contribution at the time the loan was closed. Conveyance of properties under this section will be handled in accordance with 7 CFR part 3550.</P>
                <P>(i) Before Rural Development accepts a conveyance, the borrower must attempt to sell the dwelling or unit in accordance with 7 CFR part 3550, if the dwelling or unit is considered decent, safe and sanitary as prescribed in 7 CFR part 3550. If the property is sold, Rural Development will:</P>

                <P>(A) Pay the borrower's relocation expenses, including temporary living expenses as prescribed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, until another suitable property can be located;<PRTPAGE P="591"/>
                </P>
                <P>(B) Pay related sales expenses, as prescribed in 7 CFR part 3550, if the property is sold for less than the debt against it;</P>
                <P>(C) Release the borrower from personal liability for the remaining Rural Development debt; and</P>
                <P>(D) Process an application for a new RH loan if the borrower so desires and is still eligible for Rural Development assistance.</P>
                <P>(ii) If the dwelling or unit is not considered decent, safe and sanitary as prescribed in 7 CFR part 3550, Rural Development should accept a voluntary conveyance of the property under the provisions of 7 CFR part 3550. Compensation for properties taken into inventory under this paragraph may not exceed the difference between the present market value of the security as established by the appraisal when the loan was made and the amount of the Rural Development loan and any prior liens.</P>
                <P>(iii) A borrower contribution which may be compensated for under this paragraph may be such things as:</P>
                <P>(A) A borrower's land or cash contribution,</P>
                <P>(B) Development work done by the borrower under the self-help program or borrower method of construction, the cost of which was not included in the loan funds,</P>
                <P>(C) Attorney fees, abstract costs or title insurance costs actually paid by the claimant in connection with closing the loan.</P>
                <P>(4) Pay or reimburse the borrower for temporary living expenses, miscellaneous expenses, storage of household goods and moving expenses incurred as a result of the defect.</P>
                <P>(i) Payment under this paragraph may be made under either of the following circumstances:</P>
                <P>(A) The property is acquired by the Government in accordance with 7 CFR part 3550 and Rural Development determines that the dwelling is not habitable and the severity of the defect(s) prevents the property from being repaired and made suitable as a permanent residence for the borrower.</P>
                <P>(B) The property is not acquired by the Government but Rural Development determines that the dwelling is not habitable or must be vacated in order to repair the defects.</P>
                <P>(ii) Claims for compensation under paragraph (a)(4) of this section are limited as follows:</P>
                <P>(A) Compensation may be granted for temporary living expenses for not more than 45 calendar days per claim unless a longer period is authorized by Rural Development. Compensation will be paid for actual cost to the claimant not to exceed the Government per diem rate for the area where the borrower's dwelling or unit is located. Reimbursement may be claimed for expenses such as food, lodging, laundering, etc., which would not have been incurred had the claimant remained in the house.</P>
                <P>(B) Compensation may be granted for actual miscellaneous expenses not to exceed $500 to cover such items as utility connect and disconnect fees.</P>
                <P>(C) Compensation may be granted for moving and storage expenses not to exceed $5,000 unless authorized by Rural Development and not to exceed the actual cost of moving the claimant household with personal belongings a distance of not more than 50 miles from the original residence. Compensation for storage expenses may not exceed that amount paid to store household furnishings for 45 days.</P>
                <P>(D) A strict accounting of the use of such funds must be maintained by the borrower and will be verified by Rural Development.</P>
                <P>(5) Compensate the claimant for reasonable interest paid on loans obtained for the sole purpose of correcting structural defects or other approved purposes under this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Ineligible purposes.</E> Compensation will not be granted for:</P>
                <P>(1) Completion of a dwelling or unit or installation of materials/items required under the construction contract and/or specifications.</P>
                <P>(2) Defective items which were not completed under the contract method or under the conditional commitment and supported by a builder's warranty. Work performed under the borrower method or self-help program without a warranty by a responsible party is not eligible for compensation.</P>

                <P>(3) Damage caused by defective design, workmanship, or material in <PRTPAGE P="592"/>making enhancements to or remodeling the dwelling or unit or related facilities which were not financed or approved by Rural Development.</P>
                <P>(4) The loss of past, present or future wages or salary directly or indirectly resulting from the defect.</P>
                <P>(5) Treatment for physical or psychological damages including medical and dental claims.</P>

It also applies to section 502 and section 504 Rural Housing borrowers (Single Family Housing (SFH)) who also have a Farmer Program loan. It does not apply to borrowers who have a SFH loan only; those will be serviced under 7 CFR part 3550. Borrowers are responsible for paying taxes on the real estate security to the proper taxing authorities before taxes become delinquent. This obligation is set forth in the security instrument securing the loan. This subpart is inapplicable to Farm Service Agency, Farm Loan Programs.</P>

                <P>(a) The County Supervisor will be responsible for ascertaining that all mortgaged real estate is listed properly for tax purposes.</P>
                <P>(b) The County Supervisor will be responsible for taking all actions in connection with taxes as may be necessary to protect the Government's security interests. Any unusual situations that may arise with respect to tax servicing should be referred to the State Office for consideration.</P>
                <P>(c) The County Supervisor will encourage each borrower to pay taxes promptly in order to avoid any penalties. Normally, this can be accomplished through routine servicing of loans by emphasizing the advantages of setting aside sufficient income to meet tax obligations when they become due. Taxes will be adequately budgeted for those borrowers with whom Form RD 431-2, “Farm and Home Plan,” is developed. Each borrower will be encouraged to notify the County Supervisor when he has paid his taxes. After the delinquent date, it will be necessary for the County Supervisor to determine the borrowers whose taxes are delinquent. The Multi-Family Housing Information System (MFIS) will be used in posting servicing actions on delinquent taxes.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Servicing delinquent taxes.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) The County Supervisor will contact each borrower with a delinquent tax and make every practical effort to have him pay the tax with his own funds. He will use the Management System Card for follow-up of delinquent taxes. If the delinquent tax is not paid and the borrower comes to the office with proceeds for application on the Agency account secured by the real estate, the County Office personnel will endeavor to get the borrower to use the proceeds to pay the delinquent tax. If the amount of the delinquent tax is less than the amount of the proposed payment, the difference will be applied on the Agency account in accordance with the policy outlined in subpart A of part 1951 of this chapter.<PRTPAGE P="594"/>
                </P>
                <P>(b) Prior (usually about 90 days) to the time it is legally possible for action to be taken that will cause the borrower to lose title or right of possessions of the security property or the use of essential water, the County Supervisor will contact the borrower and definitely determine if he will pay the delinquent tax immediately. If the borrower is unable or unwilling to pay the delinquent tax with his own funds after every appropriate effort has been made to have him do so, the County Supervisor will refer to RD Instruction 2024-A and utilize the Type 60 Purchase Order System to pay the amount of the delinquent taxes plus the amount of any accrued penalty to bring taxes current.</P>
                <P>(1) In an exceptional case where reasons for delinquent taxes have been removed and planned income during the next year covers payment of current obligations plus delinquent taxes not vouchered, only the delinquent taxes will be paid that could cause the borrower to lose title or right of possession of security property.</P>
                <P>(2) If the Government is holding a mortgage other than a first mortgage on the property, do not initiate payment request until the County Supervisor has determined that (i) the prior lien holder will not pay the delinquent tax, (ii) the Government's security will be jeopardized if the delinquent tax is not paid, and (iii) the value of the security is sufficient to justify the advance.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Requirements for closing agents.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Form of title certification.</E> State Offices are directed to require title insurance for all loan closings unless the agency determines that the use of title insurance is not available or is economically not feasible for the type of loan involved or the area of the state where the loan will be closed. If title insurance is used, State Offices are authorized to require a closing protection letter issued by an approved title insurance company to cover the closing agent, if available. A closing protection letter need not be furnished when the closing is conducted by the title insurance company.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Approval of closing agent.</E> An attorney or title company may act as a closing agent and close agency real estate loans, provide necessary title clearance, and perform such other duties as required in this subpart. A closing agent will be responsible for closing agency loans and disbursing both agency loan funds and funds provided by the borrower in connection with the agency loan so as to obtain title and security position as required by the agency. The closing agent must be covered by a fidelity bond which will protect the agency unless a closing protection letter is provided to the agency. The borrower will select the approved closing agent. If title clearance is by an attorney's opinion, the agency will approve the attorney who will perform the closing in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The attorney will be approved after submitting a certification acceptable to the agency. If title certification is by means of a policy of title insurance, the title company which will issue the policy must have been approved in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. A closing agent's delay in providing services without justification in connection with agency loans may be a basis for not approving the closing agent in future cases.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Approval of attorneys.</E> Any attorney selected by an applicant, who will be providing title clearance where the certificate of title will be an attorney's opinion, must submit an agency form certifying to professional liability insurance coverage. If the attorney is also the closing agent, fidelity coverage for the attorney and any employee having access to the funds must be provided. The agency will determine the appropriate level of such insurance. Required insurance will, as a minimum, cover the amount of the loan to be closed. The agency will approve the form stipulating the bond coverage. The agency will approve any attorney who is duly licensed to practice law in the state where the real estate security is located and who complies with the bonding and insurance requirements in this section. If the certification of title will be by means of title insurance, any attorney or closing agent designated as an approved attorney or closing agent by the approved title insurance company which will issue the policy of title insurance will be acceptable, and when covered by a closing protection letter, will not be required to obtain professional liability insurance or a fidelity bond. Each approved title insurance company may provide a master list of their approved attorneys that are covered by its closing protection letters to the State Office and, in such cases the attorneys are approved for closings for that title insurance company. Delay in providing closing services without justification may be a basis for not approving the attorney in future cases.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Approval of title companies.</E> A title company acting as a closing agent, or as an issuing agent for a title insurance company, must be covered by a title insurance company closing protection letter or submit an agency form certifying to fidelity coverage to cover all employees having access to the loan funds. The agency will determine the appropriate level of such coverage and will approve the form stipulating the bond coverage. Delay in providing closing services without justification may be a basis for not approving the company in future cases. Each approved title insurance company may provide a master list of their approved title companies that are covered by its closing protection letter to the State Office and, in such cases the title companies on the list are approved for closings for that title insurance company.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Approval of title insurance companies.</E> The agency will approve any title <PRTPAGE P="598"/>insurance company which issues policies of title insurance in the State where the security property is located if:</P>
                <P>(1) The form of the owner's and lender's policies of title insurance (including required endorsements) to be used in closing agency loans are acceptable to the agency, and will contain only standard types of exceptions and exclusions approved in advance by the agency;</P>
                <P>(2) The title insurance company is licensed to do business in the state (if a license is required); and</P>
                <P>(3) The title insurance company is regulated by a State Insurance Commission, or similar regulator, or if not, the title insurance company submits copies of audited financial statements, or other approved financial statements satisfactory to the agency, which show that the company has the financial ability to cover losses arising out of its activities as a title insurance company and under any closing protection letters issued by the title insurance company.</P>
                <P>(4) Delay in providing services without justification may be a basis for not approving the company.</P>
                <P>(f) [Reserved]</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Conflict of interest.</E> A closing agent who has, or whose spouse, children, or business associates have, a financial interest in the real estate which will secure the agency debt shall not be involved in the title clearance or loan closing process. Financial interest includes having either an equity, creditor, or debtor interest in any corporation, trust, or partnership with a financial interest in the real estate which will secure the agency debt.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Debarment or suspension.</E> No attorney, title company, title insurance company, or closing agent, currently debarred or suspended from participating in Federal programs, may participate in any aspect of the agency loan closing and title clearance process.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Special provisions.</E> Closing agents are responsible for having current knowledge of the requirements of State law in connection with loan closing and title clearance and should advise the agency of any changes in State law which necessitate changes in the agency's State mortgage forms and State Supplements.</P>

                <P>(d) <E T="03">Use of title opinion.</E> If a title opinion will be issued, a title examination will include searches of all relevant land title and other records, so as to express an opinion as to the title of the property and the steps necessary to obtain the appropriate title and security position to issue a title opinion as required by this subpart. The closing agent or approved attorney will determine:</P>
                <P>(1) The legal description and all owners of the real property;</P>
                <P>(2) Whether there are any exceptions affecting the property and advise the approval official and borrower of the nature and effect of outstanding interests or exceptions, prior sales of part of the property, judgments, or interests to assist in determining which exceptions must be corrected in order for the borrowers to obtain good and marketable title of record in accordance with prevailing title examination standards, and for the agency to obtain a valid lien of the required priority;</P>
                <P>(3) Whether there are outstanding Federal, State, or local tax claims (including taxes which under State law may become a lien superior to a previously attaching mortgage lien) or homeowner's association assessment liens;</P>

                <P>(4) Whether outstanding judgments of record, bankruptcy, insolvency, divorce, or probate proceedings involving <PRTPAGE P="599"/>any part of the property, whether already owned by the borrower, or to be acquired by assumption or with loan funds, or involving the borrower or the seller exist;</P>
                <P>(5) If a water right is to be included in the security for the loan, and if so, the full legal description of the water right;</P>
                <P>(6) In addition to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, if wetlands easements or other conservation easements have been placed on the property;</P>
                <P>(7) What measures are required for preparing, obtaining, or approving curative material, conveyances, and security instruments, and</P>
                <P>(8) That sufficient copies of these interests and exceptions are provided as requested by the approval official.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Use of title insurance.</E> When title insurance is to be obtained, the approval official will be furnished with a title insurance binder disclosing any defects in, exceptions to, and encumbrances against, the title, the conditions to be met to make the title insurable and in the condition required by the agency, and the curative or other actions to be taken before closing of the transaction. The binder must include a commitment to issue a lender policy in an amount at least equal the amount of the loan, except in instances where there may be an outstanding owner's policy in favor of the borrower. Not withstanding the provisions of this section, the instance of an assumption without a subsequent loan, the existing policy may be continued if the coverage meets or exceeds the assumption balance and the title company agrees in writing to extend coverage in full force and effect.</P>

                <P>(i) The prior lienholder shall agree not to declare the lien in default or accelerate the indebtedness secured by the prior lien for a specific period of time after notice to the agency. The agreement must:</P>
                <P>(A) Provide that the specified period of time will not commence until the lienholder gives written notice of the borrower's default and the prior lienholder's intention to accelerate the indebtedness to the agency office servicing the loan,</P>

                <P>(ii) When the prior lien secures future advances, including the lienholder's costs for borrower liquidation or bankruptcy, which under State law have priority over the mortgage being taken (or an agency mortgage already held), the prior lienholder shall agree not to make advances for purposes other than taxes, insurance or payments on other prior liens without written consent of the agency.</P>
                <P>(iii) The prior lienholder shall consent to the agency making (or transferring) the loan and taking (or retaining) the related mortgage if the prior lien instrument prohibits a loan or mortgage (or transfer) without the prior lienholder's consent.</P>
                <P>(iv) The prior lienholder shall consent to the agency transferring the property subject to the prior lien after the agency has obtained title to the property either by foreclosure or voluntary conveyance if the prior lien instrument prohibits such transfer without the prior lienholder's consent.</P>

                <P>(i) The seller shall agree not to sell or voluntarily transfer the seller's interest under the land purchase contract without the prior written consent of the State Office.</P>

This period of time will be 90 days unless a State Supplement provides otherwise. The agreement shall give the agency the option to cure any monetary default by paying the amount of the buyer's delinquent payments to the seller, or paying the seller in full and having the contract assigned to the agency.</P>
                <P>(iv) The seller shall consent to the agency making the loan and taking a security interest in the borrower's interest under the land purchase contract as security for the agency loan.</P>
                <P>(v) The seller shall agree not to take any actions to foreclose or forfeit the interest of the buyer under the land purchase contract because the agency has acquired the buyer's interest under the land purchase contract by foreclosure or voluntary conveyance, or because the agency has subsequently sold or assigned the buyer's interest to a third party who will assume the buyer's obligations under the land purchase contract.</P>
                <P>(vi) When the agency acquires a buyer's interest under a land purchase contract by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, the agency will not be deemed to have assumed any of the buyer's obligations under the contract, provided that the failure of the agency to perform any such obligations while it holds the buyer's interest is a ground to commence an action to terminate the land purchase contract.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Closing the transaction.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The closing agent will cooperate with the approval official, borrower, seller, and other necessary parties to arrange the time and place of closing. The transaction may be closed when the agency determines that the agency requirements for the loan have been satisfied and the closing agent or approved attorney can issue or cause to be issued a policy of title insurance or final title opinion as of the date of closing showing title vested as required by the agency, the lien of the agency's mortgage in the priority required by the agency, and title to the mortgaged property subject only to those exceptions approved in writing by the agency. The loan will be considered closed when the mortgage is filed for record and the required lien is obtained.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Disbursement of loan funds.</E> When the closing agent indicates that the conditions necessary to close the loan have been met, loan funds will be forwarded to the closing agent. Loan funds will not be disbursed prior to filing of the mortgage for record; however, when necessary, loan funds may be placed in escrow before the mortgage is filed for record and disbursed after it is filed. No development funds will be kept in escrow by the closing agent after loan closing, unless approved by the agency. Loan funds for the payment of a lien may be disbursed only upon the recording of a discharge, satisfaction, or release of prior lien interests (or assignment where necessary to protect the interests of the agency).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Title examination and liens or claims against borrowers.</E> If there are exceptions or recorded items which have arisen since the preliminary title opinion, the transaction will not be closed until these entries have been cleared of record or approved by the agency. The closing agent will advise the approval official of the nature of such intervening instruments and the effect they may have on obtaining a valid mortgage of the priority required or the title insurance policy to be issued.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Taxes and assessments.</E> The closing agent will determine if all taxes and assessments against the property which are due and payable are paid at or before the time of loan closing. If the seller and the borrower have agreed to prorate any taxes or assessments which are not yet due and payable for the year in which the closing of the transaction takes place, the seller's proportionate share of the taxes and assessments will be deducted from the proceeds to be paid to seller at closing and will be added to the amount required to be paid by borrower at closing. Appropriate prorations as agreed upon between the borrower and seller may also be made for taxes paid by the seller which are applicable to a period <PRTPAGE P="602"/>after the closing date, and for common area maintenance fees, prepaid rentals, insurance (unless the borrower is to obtain a new policy of insurance), and growing crops.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Affidavit regarding work of improvement</E>—(1) <E T="03">Execution by borrower.</E> If required by State Supplement, the closing agent will require that an affidavit regarding work of improvement, provided by the agency, be completed and executed when a loan is being made to a borrower who already owns the real estate to be mortgaged. This affidavit will be executed by the borrower at closing.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Execution by seller.</E> If required by State Supplement, the closing agent will require that an affidavit regarding work of improvement, provided by the agency, be completed and executed (including acknowledgment) by the seller when the agency is making a loan to a borrower to enable the borrower to acquire the property (including transfers). This affidavit will be executed by the seller at closing.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Legal insufficiency of affidavit form.</E> If the agency affidavit regarding work of improvement is not legally sufficient in a particular State, a State form approved by OGC will be used. A similar form that may be required by a title insurance company may be substituted for the agency form.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Recording.</E> The affidavit will not be recorded unless the closing agent deems it necessary and State law permits.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Delay in closing.</E> The loan will not be closed if, at the loan closing, the seller (in a sale transaction) or the borrower (in a nonpurchase money loan situation) indicates that construction, repair, or remodeling has been commenced or completed on the property, or related materials or services have been delivered to or performed on the property within the time limit specified in the affidavit, unless a State Supplement provides otherwise. The closing agent will notify the approval official, who will determine if the work of improvement could result in a lien prior to the agency lien. The State Office will, with the advice and concurrence of OGC, provide in a State Supplement the period of time to be used in completing the affidavit.</P>
                <P>(e)-(f) [Reserved]</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Return of loan documents to approval official after loan closing.</E> Within 1 day after loan closing, the closing agent will return completed and executed copies of the loan closing instructions, the executed original promissory note, and all other documents required for loan closing (except the mortgage), to the approval official. If the recorded mortgage is customarily returned to the borrower or closing agent after recording, then it must be forwarded to the approval official immediately.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Final title opinion or title insurance policy.</E> As soon as possible after the transaction has been closed.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Final title opinion.</E> The attorney will issue a final title opinion to the agency and the borrower on a form provided by the agency. Issuance of the final title opinion should not be held up pending the return of recorded instruments. If it is not possible for the final title opinion to show the book and page of recording of the agency security instrument, the words “and is recorded” in the final title opinion form provided by the agency office, may be deleted and the blank space completed to show the filing office and the filing instrument number, if available. Attached to the final title opinion will be required documents then available, including any which the approval official has furnished to the attorney which were not previously returned. The attorney will ensure that all recorded instruments are forwarded or delivered to the proper parties after recording. The certification of title will be forwarded for a voluntary conveyance.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Title insurance policy.</E> The closing agent will send or deliver the title insurance policy, with the United States listed as mortgage holder, to the approval official. The policy will be subject only to standard exceptions and those outstanding encumbrances, and exceptions, approved by the approval official. If an owner's policy of title insurance is requested, the closing agent will send or deliver it to the borrower. The closing agent will ensure that all recorded instruments are delivered or sent to the proper parties after recording.<PRTPAGE P="603"/>

The closing agent will keep the approval official advised as to the progress of title clearance and preparation of material for closing the transaction.</P>
                <P>(2) The closing agent will provide services for deeds in lieu of foreclosure as set forth in § 1927.62 of this subpart, and § 1955.10 of subpart A of part 1955 of this chapter.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Loans closed using title insurance or title opinions.</E> (1) Title insurance or title opinions will be obtained unless:</P>
                <P>(i) The cost of title services is excessive in relationship to the size of the loan,</P>
                <P>(ii) The agency currently has a first mortgage security interest,</P>
                <P>(iii) The applicant has sufficient income to service the additional loan,</P>
                <P>(iv) The borrower is current on the existing agency loan, and</P>
                <P>(v) The best mortgage obtainable adequately protects the agency security interests.</P>
                <P>(2) Title insurance or a final title opinion will not be obtained for a subsequent Section 504 loan where the previous Section 504 loan was unsecured or secured for less than $7,500 and the outstanding debt amount plus the new loan is less than $7,500.</P>
                <P>(3) Loans closed using a new lender title insurance policy:</P>
                <P>(i) Will cover the entire real property which is to secure the loan, including the real property already owned and any additional real property being acquired by the borrower with the loan proceeds.</P>
                <P>(ii) Will cover the entire amount of any subsequent loan plus the amount of any existing loan being refinanced (if the existing loan is not being refinanced, the new lender policy will insure only the amount of the subsequent loan).</P>
