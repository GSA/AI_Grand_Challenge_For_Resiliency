      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Purpose and general policy.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) The purpose of this subpart is to set forth the methodology and formulas by which the Administrator for the Rural Business-Cooperative Service or the Administrator for the Rural Housing Service, as applicable, allocates program funds to the States. (The term <E T="03">State</E> means any of the States of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, or the Western Pacific Areas.) This <PRTPAGE P="8"/>subpart is inapplicable to Farm Service Agency, Farm Loan Programs.</P>
                <P>(b) The formulas in this subpart are used to allocate program loan and grant funds to State Offices so that the overall mission of the Agency can be carried out. Considerations used when developing the formulas include enabling legislation, congressional direction, and administration policies. Allocation formulas ensure that program resources are available on an equal basis to all eligible individuals and organizations.</P>

                <P>(c) The actual amounts of funds, as computed by the methodology and formulas contained herein, allocated to a State for a funding period are distributed to each State Office by an exhibit to this subpart. The exhibit is available for review in any Rural Development State Office. The exhibit also contains clarifications of allocation policies and provides further guidance to the State Directors on any suballocation within the State. Rural Development will publish a Notice of Availability of Rural Housing funds in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> each year.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Amount available for allocation.</E> Funds appropriated or otherwise made availiable to the Agency for use in authorized programs. On occasion, the allocation of funds to States may not be practical for a particular program due to funding or administrative constraints. In these cases, funds will be controlled by the National Office.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Basic formula criteria, data source and weight.</E> Basic formulas are used to calculate a basic state factor as a part of the methodology for allocating funds to the States. The formulas take a number of criteria that reflect the funding needs for a particular program and through a normalization and weighting process for each of the criteria calculate the basic State Factor (SF). The data sources used for each criteria is believed to be the most current and reliable information that adequately quantifies the criterion. The weight, expressed as a percentage, gives a relative value to the importance of each of the criteria.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Basic formula allocation.</E> The result of multiplying the amount available for allocation less the total of any amounts held in reserve or distributed by base or administrative allocation times the basic State factor for each State. The basic formula allocation (BFA) for an individual State is equal to:
                </P>
                <EXTRACT>
                  <FP SOURCE="FP-2">BFA = (Amount available for allocation − NO reserve − Total base and administrative allocations) × SF.</FP>
                </EXTRACT>
                
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition formula.</E> A formula based on a proportional amount of previous year allocation used to maintain program continuity by preventing large fluctuations in individual State allocations. The transition formula limits allocation shifts to any particular State in the event of changes from year to year of the basic formula, the basic criteria, or the weights given the criteria. The transition formula first checks whether the current year's basic formula allocation is within the transition range (+ or −percentage points of the proportional amount of the previous year's BFA).</P>
                <MATH DEEP="62" SPAN="2">
                  <MID>EC14NO91.000</MID>
                </MATH>
                <PRTPAGE P="9"/>
                <FP>If the current year's State BFA is not within this transition range, the State formula allocation is changed to the amount of the transition range limit closest to the BFA amount. After having performed this transition adjustment for each State, the sum of the funds allocated to all States will differ from the amount of funds available for BFA. This difference, whether a positive or negative amount, is distributed to all States receiving a formula allocation by multiplying the difference by the SF. The end result is the transition formula allocation. The transition range will not exceed 40% (±20%), but when a smaller range is used it will be stated in the individual program section.</FP>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Base allocation.</E> An amount that may be allocated to each State dependent upon the particular program to provide the opportunity for funding at least one typical loan or grant in each Rural Development State, District, or County Office. The amount of the base allocation may be determined by criteria other than that used in the basic formula allocation such as agency historic data.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Administrative allocations.</E> Allocations made by the Administrator in cases where basic formula criteria information is not available. This form of allocation may be used when the Administrator determines the program objectives cannot be adequately met with a formula allocation.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Reserve.</E> An amount retained under the National Office control for each loan and grant program to provide flexibility in meeting situations of unexpected or justifiable need occurring during the fiscal year. The Administrator may make distributions from this reserve to any State when it determined necessary to meet a program need or agency objective. The Administrator may retain additional amounts to fund authorized demonstration programs. When such demonstration programs exist, the information is outlined in exhibit A of this subpart (available in any FmFA State Office).</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Pooling of funds.</E> A technique used to ensure that available funds are used in an effective, timely and efficient manner. At the time of pooling those funds within a State's allocation for the fiscal year or portion of the fiscal year, depending on the type of pooling, that have not been obligatedf by the State are placed in the National Office reserve. The Administrator will establish the pooling dates for each affected program.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Mid-year:</E> This pooling addresses the need to partially redistribute funds based on use/demand. Mid-year pooling occurs near the midpoint of the fiscal year.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Year-end:</E> This pooling is used to ensure maximum use of program funds on a national basis. Year-end pooling usually occurs near the first of August.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Emergency:</E> The Administrator may pool funds at any time that it is determined the conditions upon which the initial allocation was based have changed to such a degree that it is necessary to pool funds in order to efficiently carry out the Agency mission.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Availability of the allocation.</E> Program funds are made available to the Agency on a quarterly basis. In the high demand programs, it is necessary that specific instructions by given to the State Offices regarding the amount which is available for obligation during each quarter.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Suballocation by the State Director.</E> Dependent upon the individual program for which funds are being allocated, the State Director may be directed or given the option of suballocating the State allocation to District or County Offices. When suballocating the State Director may retain a portion of the funds in a State Office reserve to provide flexibility in situations of unexpected or justified need. When performing a suballocation the State Director will use the same formula, criteria and weights as used by the National Office.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Other documentation.</E> Additional instructions given to field offices regarding allocations.</P>

                <P>Each factor will receive a weight respectively of 40%, 40% and 20%. The criteria used in the basic formula are:</P>
                <P>(1) State's percentage of National rural population,</P>
                <P>(2) State's percentage of the National number of rural households between 50 and 115 percent of the area median income, and</P>

                <P>(1) The criteria used in the basic formula are:</P>
                <P>(i) State's percentage of national rural population—50 percent.</P>
                <P>(ii) State's percentage of national rural population with incomes below the poverty level—25 percent.</P>
                <P>(iii) State's percentage of national nonmetropolitan unemployment—25 percent.</P>
                <P>(2) The data source for the first criterion is the most recent decennial Census data. The data source for the second criterion is the 5-year data from the American Community Survey (ACS) or, if needed, other Census Bureau data. The data source for the third criterion is the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Each criterion is assigned a specific weight according to its relevance in determining need. The percentage representing each criterion is multiplied by the weight factor and summed to arrive at a State factor (SF). The SF cannot exceed 0.05.</P>
                <P>SF = (criterion (b)(1)(i) × 50 percent) + (criterion (b)(1)(ii) × 25 percent) + (criterion (b)(1)(iii) × 25 percent)</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Exhibit B to Subpart L of Part 1940—Section 515 Nonprofit Set Aside (NPSA)</HD>
                <P>I. <E T="03">Objective:</E> To provide eligible nonprofit entities with a reasonable opportunity to utilize section 515 funds.</P>
                <P>II. <E T="03">Background:</E> The Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 established the statutory authority for the section 515 NPSA funds.</P>
                <P>III. <E T="03">Eligible entities.</E> Amounts set aside shall be available only for nonprofit entities in the State, which may not be wholly or partially owned or controlled by a for-profit entity. An eligible entity may include a partnership, including a limited partnership, that has as its general partner a nonprofit entity or the nonprofit entity's for-profit subsidiary which will be receiving low-income housing tax credits authorized under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. For the purposes of this exhibit, a nonprofit entity is an organization that:</P>
                <P>A. Will own an interest in a project to be financed under this section and will materially participate in the development and the operations of the project; and</P>
                <P>B. Is a private organization that has nonprofit, tax exempt status under section 501(c)(3) or section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and</P>
                <P>C. Has among its purposes the planning, development, or management of low-income housing or community development projects; and</P>
                <P>D. Is not affiliated with or controlled by a for-profit organization; and</P>
                <P>E. May be a consumer cooperative, Indian tribe or tribal housing authority.</P>
                <P>IV. <E T="03">Nondiscrimination.</E> Rural Development reemphasizes the nondiscrimination in use and occupancy and location requirements of 7 CFR 3560.104.</P>
                <P>V. <E T="03">Amount of Set Aside.</E> See Attachment 1 of this exhibit (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Office):</P>
                <P>A. <E T="03">Small State Allocation Set Aside (SSASA).</E> The allocation for small States has been reserved and combined to form the SSASA, as shown in Attachment 1 of this exhibit (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Office). The definition of small State is included in Attachment 1 of this exhibit (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Office).</P>
                <P>B. <E T="03">Large State Allocation Set Aside (LSASA).</E> The allocation for large States has been reserved in the amounts shown in Attachment 1 of this exhibit (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Office). The definition of large State is included in Attachment 1 of this exhibit (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Office).</P>
                <P>C. <E T="03">NPSA Rental Assistance (RA).</E> NPSA RA has been reserved in the National Office as shown in Attachment 1 of this exhibit (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Office).</P>
                <P>VI. <E T="03">Access to NPSA funds and RA.</E> RA is available and may be requested, as needed, with eligible loan requests. NPSA funds and RA should be requested by the State Director using a format similar to Attachment 2 of this exhibit (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Office). Funds are available as follows:</P>
                <P>A. <E T="03">SSASA:</E> The SSASA is available to any SSASA State on a first-come-first-served basis until pooling. See Attachment 3 of this exhibit (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Office) for information regarding pooling.</P>
                <P>B. <E T="03">LSASA:</E> LSASA states may request LSASA funds up to the amount the state contributed to LSASA until pooling. See Attachment 3 of this exhibit (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Office) for information regarding pooling.</P>
                <P>VII. <E T="03">General Information on priority/processing of Preapplications.</E>
                </P>
                <P>A. Preapplications/applications for assistance from eligible nonprofit entities under this subpart must continue to meet all loan making requirements of 7 CFR part 3560, subpart B.</P>
                <P>B. A separate processing list will be maintained for NPSA loan requests.</P>
                <P>C. The State Director may issue Form AD-622, “Notice of Preapplication Review Action”, requesting a formal application to the highest ranking preapplication(s) from eligible nonprofit entities defined in paragraph III of this exhibit as follows:</P>
                <P>1. <E T="03">LSASA.</E> In LSASA States, AD-622s may not exceed 150 percent of the amount the State contributed to the LSASA. No single Form AD-622 may exceed the amount of funds the State contributed to LSASA.</P>
                <P>2. <E T="03">SSASA.</E> In SSASA States, AD-622s should not exceed the greater of $750,000 or 150 percent of the amount the State contributed to the SSASA; except that the State Director in a SSASA State may request authorization to issue a Form AD-622, in an amount in excess of $750,000 if additional funds are necessary to finance an average-size proposal based upon average construction costs in the state. For example, if the average size proposal currently being funded in the state is 24 units, and the average construction cost in the state is $35,000 per unit, the state may request authorization to issue an AD-622 for <PRTPAGE P="22"/>$840,000. The State Director will submit such requests to the National Office including data reflecting average size/cost projects in the State. No single Form AD-622 may exceed the amount of funds the State may receive from SSASA.</P>
                <P>D. All AD-622s issued for proposals to be funded from NPSA will be subject to the availability of NPSA funds. Form AD-622 should contain the following or similar language: “This Form AD-622 is issued subject to the availability of Nonprofit Set-Aside (NPSA) funds.”</P>
                <P>E. If a preapplication requesting NPSA funds has sufficient priority points to compete with non-NPSA loan requests based upon the District or State allocation (as applicable), the preapplication will be maintained on both the NPSA and non-NPSA rating/ranking lists.</P>
                <P>F. Provisions for providing preference to loan requests from nonprofit organizations is contained in 7 CFR 3560.56. Limited partnerships, with a nonprofit general partner, do not qualify for nonprofit preference.</P>
                <P>VIII. <E T="03">Exception authority.</E> The Administrator, or his/her designee, may, in individual cases, make an exception to any requirements of this exhibit which are not inconsistent with the authorizing statute, if he/she finds that application of such requirement would adversely affect the interest of the Government or adversely affect the intent of the authorizing statute and/or Rural Rental Housing program or result in an undue hardship by applying the requirement. The Administrator, or his/her designee, may exercise this authority upon the request of the State Director, Assistant Administrator for Housing, or Director of the Multi-Family Housing Processing Division. The request must be supported by information that demonstrates the adverse impact or effect on the program. The Administrator, or his/her designee, also reserves the right to change pooling dates, establish/change minimum and maximum fund usage from NPSA, or restrict participation in the set aside.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Objective</HD>
                <P>A. To improve the quality of affordable housing by targeting funds under Rural Housing Targeting Set Aside (RHTSA) to designated areas that have extremely high concentrations of poverty and substandard housing and have severe, unmet rural housing needs.</P>
                <P>B. To provide for the eligibility of certain colonias for rural housing funds.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Background</HD>
                <P>The Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (herein referred to as the “Act”) requires that Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 set aside section 502, 504, 514, 515, and 524 funds for assistance in targeted, underserved areas. An appropriate amount of section 521 new construction rental assistance (RA) is set aside for use with section 514 and 515 loan programs. Under the Act, certain colonias are now eligible for FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 housing assistance.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Colonias</HD>
                <P>A. Colonia is defined as any identifiable community that:</P>
                <P>1. Is in the State of Arizona, California, New Mexico or Texas;</P>
                <P>2. Is in the area of the United States within 150 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico, except that the term does not include any standard metropolitan statistical area that has a population exceeding 1 million;</P>
                <P>3. Is designated by the State or county in which it is located as a colonia;</P>
                <P>4. Is determined to be a colonia on the basis of objective criteria, including lack of potable water supply, lack of adequate sewage systems, and lack of decent, safe, and sanitary housing; and</P>
                <P>5. Was in existence and generally recognized as a colonia before November 28, 1990.</P>
                <P>B. Requests for housing assistance in colonias have priority as follows:</P>
                <P>1. When the State did not obligate its allocation in one or more of its housing programs during the previous 2 fiscal years (FYs), priority will be given to requests for assistance, in the affected program(s), from regularly allocated funds, until an amount equal to 5 percent of the current FY program(s) allocation is obligated in colonias. This priority takes precedence over other processing priority methods.</P>
                <P>2. When the State did obligate its allocation in one or more of its housing programs during the previous 2 FYs, priority will be given to requests for assistance, in the affected program(s), from RHTSA funds, until an amount equal to 5 percent of the current FY program(s) allocation is obligated in colonias. This priority takes precedence over other processing priority methods.</P>
                <P>C. Colonias may access pooled RHTSA funds as provided in paragraph IV G of this exhibit.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. RHTSA</HD>
                <P>A. <E T="03">Amount of Set Aside.</E> Set asides for RHTSA, from the current FY allocations, <PRTPAGE P="23"/>are established in attachment 1 of this exhibit (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Office).</P>
                <P>B. <E T="03">Selection of Targeted Counties</E>—1. <E T="03">Eligibility.</E> Eligible counties met the following criteria: (1) 20 percent or more of the county population is at, or below, poverty level; (2) 10 percent or more of the occupied housing units are substandard; and (3) the average funds received on a per capita basis in the county, during the previous 5 FYs, were more than 40 percent below the State per capita average during the same period. Data from the most recent available Census was used for all three criteria, with criteria (2) and (3) based on the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 rural area definition.</P>
                <P>2. <E T="03">Selection.</E> The Act requires that 100 of the most underserved counties be initially targeted for RHTSA funds. In establishing the 100 counties, those with 28 percent or more of their population at, or below, poverty level and 13 percent or more of their occupied housing units substandard, have preference. If less than 100 counties meet this criteria, the remaining counties meeting the criteria in paragraph IV B 1 of this exhibit will be ranked, based upon a total of their substandard housing and poverty level percentages. The highest-ranking counties are then selected until the list reaches 100. The remaining counties are eligible for pool funds only.</P>
                <P>C. <E T="03">State RHTSA Levels.</E> In the section 502, 504, and 515 programs, each State's RHTSA level will be based on its number of eligible counties, with each county receiving a pro rata share of the total funds available. In order to ensure that a meaningful amount of assistance is available to each State, minimum funding levels may be established. When minimum levels are established, they are set forth on Attachment 1 of this exhibit (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Office).</P>
                <P>D. <E T="03">Use of Funds.</E> To maximize the assistance to targeted counties, allocated program funds should be used in addition to RHTSA funds, where possible. The State Director has the discretion to determine the most effective delivery of RHTSA funds among the targeted counties within his/her jurisdiction. The 100 counties listed in attachment 2 of this exhibit (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Office) are eligible for RHTSA funding consideration immediately. Colonias are also eligible for RHTSA funds as described in paragraph III of this exhibit.</P>
                <P>E. <E T="03">National Office RHTSA Reserve.</E> A limited National Office reserve is available on an individual case basis when the State is unable to fund a request from its regular or RHTSA allocation. The amount of the reserve, and the date it can be accessed and any conditions thereof, if applicable, are contained in attachment 1 of this exhibit (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Office).</P>
                <P>F. <E T="03">Requests for Funds and RA.</E> All RHTSA funds are reserved in the National Office and requests for these funds and/or RA units must be submitted by the State Director, using the applicable format shown on attachment 4 or 5 of this exhibit (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Office). The State Director is responsible for notifying the Director of Single Family Housing Processing Division (SFHPD) or Multi-Family Housing Processing Division (MFHPD) of any RHTSA funds and RA units authorized, but not obligated, by RHTSA pooling date.</P>
                <P>G. <E T="03">Pooling.</E> Unused RHTSA funds and RA will be pooled. Pooling dates and any pertinent information thereof are available on attachment 1 of this exhibit (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Office). Pooled funds will be available on a first-come, first-served basis to all eligible colonias and all counties listed on attachments 2 and 3 of this exhibit (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Office). Pooled RHTSA funds will remain available until the year-end pooling date.</P>

                <P>(7) How to consider ranked preapplications/applications at the end of the FY that have not been funded; and</P>

                <P>(8) How to consider requests for additional funds needed by an applicant to complete a project that already has funds approved; <E T="03">i.e.</E>, construction bid cost overrun.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Duties and responsibilities.</E> The panel is required to advise the State Director on the desirability of funding applications from funds available to the State from designated rural development programs. In relation to this advice, the panel will have the following duties and responsibilities:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Establish policy and criteria to review and evaluate area plans and to review and rank preapplications/applications.</E> (i) <E T="03">Area plan.</E> The panel will develop a written policy and criteria to use when evaluating area plans. The criteria to be used when evaluating area plans will assure that the plan includes, as a minimum, the technical information included in § 1940.959 of this subpart. The criteria will be in sufficient detail for the panel to determine that the plan is technically and economically adequate, feasible, and likely to succeed in meeting the stated goals of the plan. The panel will give weight to area-wide or regional plans and comments submitted by intergovernmental development councils or similar organizations made up of local elected officials charged with the responsibility for rural area or regional development. A copy of the policy and evaluating criteria will be provided to Rural Development.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Applications.</E> The panel will annually review the policy and criteria used by the panel to evaluate and rank preapplications/applications in accordance with this subpart. The panel will assure that the policy and criteria are consistent with current rural development needs, and that the public has an opportunity to provide input during the development of the initial policy and criteria. The Governor will provide a copy of the initial policy and criteria established by the panel when submitting evidence of eligibility in accordance with § 1940.954 of this subpart. Annually, thereafter, and not later than <PRTPAGE P="28"/>September 1 of each FY, the State coordinator will send the Under Secretary evidence that the panel has reviewed the established policy and criteria. The State coordinator will also send the Under Secretary a copy of all revisions.</P>

                <P>(2) <E T="03">Review and evaluate area plans.</E> Each area plan submitted for a local or regional area will be reviewed and evaluated by the panel. After an area plan has been reviewed and evaluated in accordance with established policy and criteria:</P>
                <P>(i) The panel will accept any area plan that meets established criteria unless the plan is incompatible with any other area plan for that area that has been accepted by the panel; or</P>

                <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) This subpart outlines the policies and procedures for making and processing direct loans for Community Facilities except fire and rescue and other small essential community facility loans and water and waste disposal facilities. This subpart applies to Community Facilities loans for fire and rescue and other small essential community facility loans only as specifically provided for in subpart C of this part. Water and waste loans are provided for in part 1780 of this title.</P>
                <P>(1) The policies and procedures in this subpart address both loans between the Agency and the applicant and between the Agency and an approved eligible re-lender who then relends the funds to eligible applicants for eligible projects under this subpart.</P>

                <P>(2) The Agency shall cooperate fully with State, Tribal and local agencies in making loans to assure maximum support to the State and Tribal strategies for rural development. State Directors and their staffs shall maintain coordination and liaison with State agency and substate planning districts. Funds allocated for use under this subpart are also for the use of Indian tribes within the State, regardless of whether State development strategies include Indian reservations within the State's boundaries. Indians residing on such reservations must have equal opportunity to <PRTPAGE P="40"/>participate in the benefits of these programs as compared with other residents of the State.</P>
                <P>(3) Federal statutes provide for extending Agency financial programs without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, marital status, age, or physical/mental handicap. The participants must possess the capacity to enter into legal contracts under State and local statutes.</P>
                <P>(4) Any processing or servicing activity conducted pursuant to this subpart involving authorized assistance to Agency employees, members of their families, known close relatives, or business or close personal associates, is subject to the provisions of subpart D of part 1900 of this chapter. Applicants for this assistance are required to identify any known relationship or association with an Agency employee.</P>
                <P>(b) Indian tribes on Federal and State reservations and other Federally recognized Indian tribes are eligible to apply for and are encouraged to participate in this program. Such tribes might not be subject to State and local laws or jurisdiction. However, any requirements of this subpart that affect applicant eligibility, the adequacy of Agency's security or the adequacy of service to users of the facility and all other requirements of this subpart must be met.</P>
                <P>(c) Loans sold without insurance by RD to the private sector will be serviced in the private sector and will not be serviced under this subpart. The provisions of this subpart are not applicable to such loans. Future changes to this subpart will not be made applicable to such loans.</P>
                <P>(d) The District Office will normally be the entry point for preapplications and serve as a local point. Applications will be filed with the District Office and loans will be processed to the maxium extent possible by the District Office staff. The applicant's governing body should designate one person to coordinate the activities of its engineer, architect, attorney, and any other professional employees and to act as contact person during loan processing. Agency personnel should make every effort to involve the applicant's contact person when meeting with the applicant's professional consultants and/or agents. The State Office staff will monitor community programs loanmaking and servicing, and will provide assistance to District Office personnel to the extent necessary to assure that the activities are being accomplished in an orderly manner consistent with Agency regulations.</P>
                <P>(e) The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued guidance on Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards at 2 CFR part 200 on December 26, 2013. In 2 CFR 400.1, the Department adopted OMB's guidance in subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 200 as the Department's policies and procedures for uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for federal awards. As a result, this regulation contains references to 2 CFR part 200 as it has regulatory effect for the Department's programs and activities.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 1942.2</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Processing applications.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Preapplications.</E> (1) The District Office may handle initial inquiries and provide basic information about the program. They are to provide the preappllcation, SF 424.2, “Application for Federal Assistance (For Construction).” The District Director will assist applicants as needed in completing SF 424.2, and in filing written notice of intent and priority recommendation with the appropriate clearinghouse. The District Director will inform the applicant that it may be necessary to apply for credit from commercial sources. It will be explained that if credit for the project is available from commercial sources at reasonable rates and terms the applicant is not eligible for RD financing. The District Director will meet with the applicant, whenever appropriate to discuss RD preapplication processing. Guidance and assistance will be provided by the State Director, as needed, for orderly application processing. The District Director will determine that the preapplication is <PRTPAGE P="41"/>property completed and fully reviewed. The District Director will then forward to the State Director:</P>
                <P>(i) Eligibility determination and recommendations.</P>
                <P>(ii) One copy of SF 424.2.</P>
                <P>(iii) State intergovernmental review comments and recommendations (clearinghouse comments), as outlined in 2 CFR part 400, if applicable.</P>
                <P>(iv) Priority recommendations.</P>
                <P>(v) Supporting documentation necessary to make an eligibility determination such as financial statements, audits, or copies of organizational documents or existing debt instruments. The District Director will advise applicants on what documents are necessary. Applicants should not be required to expend significant amounts of money or time developing supporting documentation at the preapplication stage.</P>
                <P>(2) The State Director will review each SF 424.2 along with other information that is deemed necessary to determine whether financing from commercial sources at reasonable rates and terms is available. If credit elsewhere is indicated, the State Director will instruct the District Director to so inform the applicant and recommend the applicant apply to commercial sources for financing. Projects may be funded jointly with other lenders provided the requirements of § 1942.17 (g) of this subpart are met. Joint financing occurs when two or more lenders make separate loans to supply the funds required by one applicant for a project.</P>
                <P>(i) In order to provide a basis for referral of preapplications of only those applicants who may be able to finance projects through commercial sources, State Directors should maintain liaison with representatives of banks, investment bankers, financial advisors, and other lender representatives in the State. State Directors with their assistance, should maintain criteria for determining preapplications which should be referred to commercial lenders. A list of lender representatives interested in receiving such referrals should be maintained.</P>
                <P>(ii) The State Director shall maintain a working relationship with the State Office or official that has been designated as the single point of contact for the intergovernmental review process and give full consideration to their comments when selecting preapplications to be processed.</P>
                <P>(iii) The State Director will review the District Director's eligibility determination and recommendations in sufficient time for the District Director's use in preparing and issuing Form AD-622.</P>
                <P>(iv) Form AD-622 will be prepared by the District Director within forty-five (45) calendar days from receipt of the preapplication by RD, stating the results of the review action. The original will be signed and delivered to the applicant with a copy to the State Director.</P>

                <P>(3) For preapplications eligible for Agency funding which have the necessary priority to compete with similar preapplications, the Agency will issue Form AD-622 inviting an application containing the following statement:
                </P>
                <EXTRACT>
                  <P>You are advised against taking any actions or incurring any obligations which would either limit the range of alternatives to be considered, or which would have an adverse effect on the environment. Satisfactory completion of the environmental review process must occur prior to the issuance of the letter of conditions.</P>
                </EXTRACT>
                

                <P>(4) The following statement must be added to Form AD-622 when notifying preapplicants who are eligible, but do not have the priority necessary for further consideration at this time:
                </P>
                <EXTRACT>
                  <P>You are advised against incurring obligations which would limit the range of alternatives to be considered, or which cannot be fulfilled without Rural Development funds until the funds are actually made available. Therefore, you should refrain from such actions as initiating engineering and legal work, taking actions which would have an adverse effect on the environment, taking options on land rights, developing detailed plans and specifications, or inviting construction bids until notified by Rural Development to proceed.</P>
                </EXTRACT>
                
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Environmental review requirements.</E> Loans made under this subpart must comply with the environmental review requirements in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970. Starting with the earliest discussions with prospective applicants or review of pre-applications and continuing through application processing, environmental issues must be considered.<PRTPAGE P="42"/>
                </P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Applications.</E> The District Director should assist the applicant in application assembly and processing.</P>
                <P>(1) State Directors should have applications in process representing approximately 150 percent of the current State allocation.</P>
                <P>(2) The application docket will include SF 424.2, and related forms, materials, and information. The application will be assembled in accordance with guide 15 of this subpart or State guides developed under § 1942.16 of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(3) When an applicant is notified to proceed with an application, the District Director should arrange for a conference with the applicant to provide copies of appropriate appendices and forms; furnish guidance necessary for orderly application processing; and to initiate a processing checklist for establishing a time schedule for completing items using Form RD 1942-39, “Processing Check List (Other Than Public Bodies),” or Form RD 1942-40, “Processing Check List (Public Bodies),” or other checklist adopted for use in the State. The District Director will confirm decisions made at this conference by letter to the applicant and by a copy of the processing checklist. The original and a copy of the processing checklist will be retained in the District Office and a copy will be forwarded to the State Office. The original and copy of the checklist retained in the District Office will be kept current as application processing actions are taken. The copy will be sent to the State Office to use in updating its copy of this form. The State Office will then return the District Office's copy. As the application is being processed, and the need develops for additional conferences, the District Director will arrange with the applicant for such conference to extend and update the processing checklist.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Review of decision.</E> If at any time prior to loan approval it is decided that favorable action will not be taken on a preapplication or application, the District Director will notify the applicant in writing of the reasons why the request was not favorably considered. The notification to the applicant will state that a review of this decision by Rural Development may be requested by the applicant under subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter. The following statement will also be made on all notifications of adverse action.

                  <P>The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (provided that the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract); because all or part of the applicant's income is derived from any public assistance program; or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The Federal agency that administers compliance with this law is the Federal Trade Commission, Equal Credit Opportunity, Washington, DC 20580.</P>

                <P>(e) <E T="03">Joint funding.</E> Rural Development may finance projects jointly with funds from other sources, such as, commercial/private lenders, Federal agencies, State and local Governments, etc. Other departments, agencies, and executive establishments of the Federal Government may participate and provide financial and technical assistance jointly with Rural Development to any applicant to whom Rural Development is providing assistance. The amount of participation by the other department, agency, or executive establishment shall only be limited by its authorities except that any limitation on joint participation itself is superseded by section 125 of Pub. L. 95-334 (Section 347, Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, as amended).</P>

                <P>When the loan approval official requires an appraisal, Form RD 442-10, “Appraisal Report—Water and Waste Disposal Systems,” may be used with appropriate supplements. Form RD 442-10 may be modified as appropriate or other appropriate format may be used for facilities other than water and waste disposal. Appraisal reports prepared for use in connection with the purchase of existing essential community facilities or when required by <PRTPAGE P="43"/>§ 1942.17 (g)(2)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>), (g)(3)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>), and (j)(4) of this subpart, may be prepared by the RD engineer/architect or, if desired by the State Director, some other qualified appraiser. The loan approval official may require an applicant to provide an appraisal prepared by an independent qualified appraiser; however, the loan approval official must determine that the appraised value shown in such reports reflects the present market value.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Procedures for review.</E> The Rural Development staff review will proceed as applications are being developed. An overall review of the applicant's financial status, including a review of all assets and liabilities, will be a part of the docket review process by the staff and approval officials. The engineering/architect reports and associated data are to be reviewed by the Rural Development staff engineer or architect, as appropriate, as soon as available but prior to the District Director's completion of the project summary. During the review the District Director in all cases will make certain that no low income or minority community within the service area has been omitted or discouraged from participating in the proposed project. The District Director will also determine how the service area was defined to assure that gerrymandering of specific communities or areas has not occurred. The findings should be documented in the running record. Prior to presenting the assembled application to the approval official, the assembled application ordinarily will be processed in the following sequence:</P>
                <P>(1) The Rural Development manager will complete the project summary, including written analysis and recommendations, and will prepare a draft letter of conditions listing all the requirements that the applicant must agree to meet within a specific time.</P>
                <P>(i) Requirements listed in letters of conditions will include the following unless inappropriate due to the particular type of funding or entity involved: Maximum amount of loan and/or grant which may be considered, scheduling of payments, term of loan and any deferment of principal which may be allowed, reserve requirements, compliance with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, number of users (members) and verification required, contributions rates and charges, interim financing, disbursement of funds, security requirements, graduation requirements, debt collection policies execution of Form RD 1910-11, “Application Certification, Federal Collection Policies for Consumer or Commercial Debts,” organization, business operations, insurance and bonding (including applicant/borrower and contractor), construction contract documents and bidding, accounts, records, and audit reports required (including requirements of OMB Circulars A-128 and A-110), adoption of Form RD 1942-47, “Loan Resolution (Public Bodies),” for public bodies or Form RD 1942-9, “Loan Resolution (Security Agreement),” for other than public bodies, closing instructions, and other requirements.</P>

                <P>(ii) Each letter of conditions will contain the following paragraphs:
                </P>

                <SUBJECT>Community facilities.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This section includes information and procedures specifically designed for use by applicants, including their professional consultants and/or agents who provide such assistance and services as architectural, engineering, financial, legal, or other services related to application processing and facility planning and development. <PRTPAGE P="50"/>This section is made available as needed for such use. It includes Rural Development policies and requirements pertaining to loans for community facilities. It provides applicants with guidance for use in proceeding with their application. Rural Development shall cooperate fully with appropriate State agencies to give maximum support of the State's strategies for development of rural areas.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligibility.</E> Financial assistance to areas or communities adjacent to, or closely associated with, nonrural areas is limited by § 1942.17(c) of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Applicant.</E> (i) A public body, such as a municipality, county, district, authority, or other political subdivision of a state.</P>
                <P>(A) Loans for water or waste disposal facilities will not be made to a city or town with a population in excess of 10,000 inhabitants. The population figure is obtained from the most recent decennial Census of the United States (decennial Census). If the applicable population figure cannot be obtained from the most recent decennial Census, RD will determine the applicable population figure based on available population data.</P>
                <P>(B) Loans for essential community facilities will not be made to a city or town with a population in excess of 20,000 inhabitants according to the most recent decennial Census.</P>
                <P>(ii) An organization operated on a not-for-profit basis, such as an association, cooperative, and private corporation. Applicants organized under the general profit corporation laws may be eligible if they actually will be operated on a not-for-profit basis under their charter, bylaws, mortgage, or supplemental agreement provisions as may be required as a condition of loan approval. Essential community facility applicants other than utility-type must have significant ties with the local rural community. Such ties are necessary to ensure to the greatest extent possible that a facility under private control will carry out a public purpose and continue to primarily serve rural areas. Ties may be evidenced by items such as:</P>
                <P>(A) Association with or controlled by a local public body or bodies, or broadly based ownership and controlled by members of the community.</P>
                <P>(B) Substantial public funding through taxes, revenue bonds, or other local Government sources, and/or substantial voluntary community funding, such as would be obtained through a community-wide funding campaign.</P>
                <P>(iii) Indian tribes on Federal and State reservations and other Federally recognized Indian tribes.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Facility.</E> (i) Facilities must be located in rural areas, except for utility-type services such as water, sewer, natural gas, or hydroelectric, serving both rural and non-rural areas. In such cases, Rural Development funds may be used to finance only that portion serving rural areas, regardless of facility location.</P>
                <P>(ii) Essential community facilities must primarily serve rural areas.</P>

                <P>(iii) For water or waste disposal facilities, the terms <E T="03">rural</E> and <E T="03">rural area</E> will not include any area in any city or town with a population in excess of 10,000 inhabitants. The population figure is obtained from the most recent decennial Census. If the applicable population figure cannot be obtained from the most recent decennial Census, RD will determine the applicable population figure based on available population data.</P>
                <P>(iv) For essential community facilities, the terms <E T="03">rural</E> and <E T="03">rural area</E> will not include any area in any city or town with a population in excess of 20,000 inhabitants. The population figure is obtained from the most recent decennial Census. If the applicable population figure cannot be obtained from the most recent decennial Census, RD will determine the applicable population figure based on available population data.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Credit elsewhere.</E> Applicants must certify in writing and Rural Development shall determine and document that the applicant is unable to finance the proposed project from their own resources or through commercial credit at reasonable rates and terms.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Legal authority and responsibility.</E> Each applicant must have or will obtain the legal authority necessary for constructing, operating, and maintaining the proposed facility or service and for obtaining, giving security for, and <PRTPAGE P="51"/>repaying the proposed loan. The applicant shall be responsible for operating, maintaining, and managing the facility, and providing for its continued availability and use at reasonable rates and terms. This responsibility shall be exercised by the applicant even though the facility may be operated, maintained, or managed by a third party under contract, management agreement, or written lease. Leases may be used when this is the only feasible way to provide the service and is the customary practice. Management agreements should provide for at least those items listed in guide 24 of this subpart (available in any Rural Development office). Such contracts, management agreements, or leases must not contain options or other provisions for transfer of ownership.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Refinancing debt.</E> The Government shall require an agreement that if at any time it shall appear to the Government that the borrower is able to refinance the amount of the indebtedness then outstanding, in whole or in part, by obtaining a loan for such purposes from responsible cooperative or private credit sources, at reasonable rates and terms for loans for similar purposes and periods of time, the borrower will, upon request of the Government, apply for and accept such loan in sufficient amount to repay the Government and will take all such actions as may be required in connection with such loan.</P>
                <P>(6) Expanded eligibility for timber-dependent communities in Pacific Northwest. In the Pacific Northwest, defined as an area containing national forest covered by the Federal document entitled, “Forest Plan for a Sustainable Economy and a Sustainable Environment,” dated July 1, 1993; the population limits contained § 1942.17(b) are expanded to include communities with not more than 25,000 inhabitants until September 30, 1998, if:</P>
                <P>(i) Part or all of the community lies within 100 miles of the boundary of a national forest covered by the Federal document entitled, “Forest Plan for a Sustainable Economy and a Sustainable Environment,” dated July 1, 1993; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The community is located in a county in which at least 15 percent of the total primary and secondary labor and proprietor income is derived from forestry, wood products, or forest-related industries such as recreation and tourism.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Priorities</E>—(1) <E T="03">Truly rural areas.</E> Rural Development program assistance will be directed toward truly rural areas and rural communities. Normally, priority will not be given to preapplications for projects that will serve other than truly rural areas. Truly rural areas are areas other than densely settled areas or communities adjacent to, or closely associated with, a city or town with a population exceeding 10,000 residents for water or waste disposal assistance, or 20,000 residents for essential community facility assistance. When determining whether a rural area or rural community is adjacent to, or closely associated with, a city or town with a population exceeding 10,000 residents for water and waste disposal, or 20,000 residents for essential community facility assistance, minor open spaces such as those created by physical or legal barriers, commercial or industrial development, parks, areas reserved for convenience or appearance, or narrow strips of cultivated land, will be disregarded. An area or community shall be considered adjacent to or closely related with a nonrural area when it constitutes for general, social, and economic purposes a single community having a contiguous boundary.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Project selection process.</E> The following paragraphs indicate items and conditions which must be considered in selecting preapplications for further development. When ranking eligible preapplications for consideration for limited funds, Rural Development officials must consider the priority items met by each preapplication and the degree to which those priorities are met, and apply good judgement.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Preapplications.</E> The preapplication and supporting information submitted with it will be used to determine the proposed project's priority for available funds.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">State Office review.</E> All preapplications will be reviewed and scored and Form AD-622, “Notice of Preapplication Review Action,” issued within the time limits in § 1942.2(a)(2)(iv) of this subpart. When <PRTPAGE P="52"/>considering authorizing the development of an application for funding, the State Director should consider the remaining funds in the State allocation, and the anticipated allocation of funds for the next fiscal year as well as the amount of time necessary to complete that application. Applicants whose preapplications are found to be ineligible will be so advised. These applicants will be given adverse notice through Form AD-622 and advised of their appeal rights under subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter. Those applicants with eligible lower scoring preapplications which obviously cannot be funded within an eighteen month period of time, and are not within 150 percent of the State's allocation, should be notified that funds are not available; and requested to advise whether they wish to have their preapplication maintained in an active file for future consideration. The State Director may request an additional allocation of funds from the National Office for such preapplications. Such requests will be considered along with all others on hand.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Selection priorities.</E> The priorities described below will be used by the State Director to rate preapplications. The priorities should be applied to water and waste disposal or community facilities preapplications as directed. The format found in part I of guide 26 of this subpart should be followed in scoring each preapplication. A copy of the score sheet should be placed in the case file for future reference.</P>
                <P>(A) <E T="03">Population priorities.</E> The following priorities apply to both Water and Waste Disposal and Community Facilities preapplications. Points will be distributed as indicated.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The proposed project is located in a rural community having a population not in excess of 2,500—25 points.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The proposed project is located in a rural community having a population not in excess of 5,500—20 points. (Points under this priority should not be assigned to a preapplication if points were assigned under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) (A)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section.)</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Health priorities.</E> Points will be distributed as indicated.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Water and Waste Disposal preapplications only. The proposed project is:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Needed to alleviate the sudden unexpected diminution or deterioration of a water supply, or to meet health or sanitary standards which pertain to a community's water supply—25 points.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Required to correct an inadequate waste disposal system due to unexpected occurrences, or to meet health or sanitary standards which pertain to a community's waste disposal system—25 points.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Community Facility preapplication only. The proposed project is required either to correct a health or sanitary problem, or to meet a health or sanitary standard—25 points.</P>
                <P>(C) <E T="03">Income priorities.</E> The following priorities apply to both Water and Waste Disposal and Community Facilities preapplications. Points will be distributed as indicated. The median income of the population to be served by the proposed facility is:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Less than the poverty line for a family of four, as defined in Section 673(2) of the Community Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9902(2)), or less than 80 percent of the statewide nonmetropolitan median household income—25 points.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Equal to or more than the poverty line and between 80% and 100%, inclusive, of the State's nonmetropolitan median household income—20 points.</P>
                <P>(D) <E T="03">Other factors.</E> Points will be distributed as indicated.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Water and Waste Disposal preapplications only. The proposed project will: merge ownership, management, and operation of smaller facilities providing for more efficient management and economical service; and/or enlarge, extend, or otherwise modify existing facilities to provide service to additional rural residents—10 points.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Community Facilities preapplications only. The purpose of the proposed project is to construct, enlarge, extend or otherwise improve the following types of facilities. (Select only the factor most applicable to the proposed project.)</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Public safety—10 points. (Examples include police services and fire, <PRTPAGE P="53"/>rescue and ambulance services as authorized by subpart C of this part 1942.)</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Health care—5 points. (Examples include clinics, nursing homes, convalescent facilities, and hospital projects designed to make the facility conform with life/safety codes, medicare and medicaid requirements, and minor expansions needed to meet the immediate requirements of the community. Points under this authority should not be awarded to a preapplication if points were awarded under § 1942.17(c)(2)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this subpart.)</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Water and Waste Disposal and Community Facilities preapplications.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Applicant is a public body or Indian tribe—5 points.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Project is located in a “truly rural area” as described in § 1942.17(c)(1) of this subpart—10 points.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) Amount of joint financing committed to the project is:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) 20% or more private, local or state funds except federal funds channeled through a state agency—10 points.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) 5%-19% private, local or state funds except federal funds channeled through a state agency—5 points.</P>
                <P>(E) In certain cases the State Director may assign up to 15 points to a preapplication, in addition to those that may be scored under paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) (A) through (D), of this section. These points are primarily intended to address an unforeseen exigency or emergency, such as the loss of a community facility due to accident or natural disaster or the loss of joint financing if Rural Development funds are not committed in a timely fashion. However, the points may also be awarded to projects in order to improve compatibility/coordination between Rural Development's and other agencies' selection systems and to assist those projects that are the most cost effective. A written justification must be prepared and placed in the project file each time the State Director assigns these points.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Results of State Office review.</E> After completing the review, the State Director will normally select the eligible preapplications with the highest scores for further processing. In cases where preliminary cost estimates indicate that an eligible, high scoring preapplication is unfeasible or would require an amount of funding from Rural Development that exceeds either 25 percent of a State's current annual allocation or an amount greater than that remaining in the State's allocation, the State Director may instead select the next lower scoring preapplication(s) for futher processing provided the high scoring applicant is notified of this action and given an opportunity to revise the proposal and resubmit it. If it is found that there is no effective way to reduce costs, the State Director, after consultation with applicant, may submit a request for an additional allocation of funds for the proposed project to the National Office. The request should be submitted during the fiscal year in which obligation is anticipated. Such request will be considered along with all others on hand. A written justification must be prepared and placed in the project file when an eligible preapplication with a higher rating is not selected for further processing. The State Director will notify the District Director of the results of the review action. The State Director will return the preapplication information with an authorization for the District Director to prepare and issue Form AD-622 in accordance with § 1942.2(a)(2)(iv) of this subpart. Priority will be given to those preapplications and applications for funding which meet criteria in § 1942.17(c)(2)(iii)(A) (<E T="03">1</E>) or (<E T="03">2</E>); and the criteria in § 1942.17(c) (2)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) (<E T="03">i</E>) or (<E T="03">ii</E>) or (B)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(v) <E T="03">Application development.</E> Applications should be developed expeditiously following good management practices. Applications that are not developed in a reasonable period of time taking into account the size and complexity of the proposed project may be removed from the State's active file. Applicants will be consulted prior to taking such action.</P>
                <P>(vi) <E T="03">Project obligations.</E> To ensure efficient use of resources, obligations should occur in a timely fashion throughout the fiscal year. Projects may be obligated as their applications are completed and approved.</P>
                <P>(vii) <E T="03">Requests for additional funding.</E> All requests for additional allocations <PRTPAGE P="54"/>of funds submitted to the National Office must follow the formats found in parts I and II of guide 26. In selecting projects for funding at the National Office level, additional points may be scored based on the priority assigned to the project by the State Office. These points will be scored in the manner shown below. Only the three highest priority projects can score points. In addition, the Administrator may assign up to 15 additional points to account for items such as geographic distribution of funds and emergency conditions caused by economic problems or natural disasters.</P>

                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Arrangements cannot be made with the creditors to extend or modify the terms of the debts so that a sound basis will exist for making a loan.</P>

                <P>(v) To pay obligations for construction incurred before loan approval. Construction work should not be started and obligations for such work or materials should not be incurred before the loan is approved. However, if there are compelling reasons for proceeding with construction before loan approval, applicants may request Rural Development approval to pay such obligations. Such requests may be approved if Rural Development determines that:</P>
                <P>(A) Compelling reasons exist for incurring obligations before loan approval; and</P>
                <P>(B) The obligations will be incurred for authorized loan purposes; and</P>
                <P>(C) Contract documents have been approved by Rural Development; and</P>
                <P>(D) All environmental requirements applicable to Rural Development and the applicant have been met; and</P>
                <P>(E) The applicant has the legal authority to incur the obligations at the time proposed, and payment of the debts will remove any basis for any mechanic, material, or other liens that may attach to the security property. Rural Development may authorize payment of such obligations at the time of loan closing. Rural Development's authorization to pay such obligations, however, is on the condition that it is not committed to make the loan; it assumes no responsibility for any obligations incurred by the applicant; and the applicant must subsequently meet all loan approval requirements. The applicant's request and Rural Development authorization for paying such obligations shall be in writing. If construction is started without Rural Development approval, post approval in accordance with this section may be considered.</P>
                <P>(2) Funds may not be used to finance:</P>
                <P>(i) On-site utility systems or business and industrial buildings in connection with industrial parks.</P>

                <P>(v) Facilities which are not modest in size, design, and cost.<PRTPAGE P="56"/>
                </P>
                <P>(vi) Loan or grant finder's fees.</P>
                <P>(vii) Projects located within the Coastal Barriers Resource System that do not qualify for an exception as defined in section 6 of the Coastal Barriers Resource Act, Pub. L. 97-348.</P>
                <P>(viii) New combined sanitary and storm water sewer facilities.</P>
                <P>(ix) That portion of a water and/or waste disposal facility normally provided by a business or industrial user.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Facilities for public use.</E> All facilities financed under the provisions of this subpart shall be for public use.</P>
                <P>(1) Utility-type service facilities will be installed so as to serve any user within the service area who desires service and can be feasibly and legally served. Applicants and borrowers must obtain written concurrence of the Rural Development prior to refusing service to such user. Upon failure to provide service which is reasonable and legal, such user shall have direct right of action against the applicant/borrower. A notice of the availability of this service should be given by the applicant/borrower to all persons living within the area who can feasibly and legally be served by the phase of the project being financed.</P>
                <P>(i) If a mandatory hookup ordinance will be adopted, the required bond ordinance or resolution advertisement will be considered adequate notification.</P>

                <P>(ii) When any portion of the income will be derived from user fees and a mandatory hookup ordinance will not be adopted, each potent user will be afforded an opportunity to request service by signing a Users Agreement.
                </P>
                <FP>Those declining service will be afforded an opportunity to sign a statement to such effect. Rural Development has guides available for these purposes in all Rural Development offices.</FP>
                <P>(2) In no case will boundaries for the proposed service area be chosen in such a way that any user or area will be excluded because of race, color, religion, sex, marital status, age, handicap, or national origin.</P>
                <P>(3) This does not preclude:</P>
                <P>(i) Financing or constructing projects in phases when it is not practical to finance or construct the entire project at one time; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Financing or constructing facilities where it is not economically feasible to serve the entire area, provided economic feasibility is determined on the basis of the entire system and not by considering the cost of separate extensions to or parts thereof; the applicant publicly announces a plan for extending service to areas not initially receiving service from the system; and potential users located in the areas not to be initially served receive written notice from the applicant that service will not be provided until such time as it is economically feasible to do so, and</P>
                <P>(iii) Extending services to industrial areas when service is made available to users located along the extensions.</P>

                <P>(4) The State Director will determine that, when feasibly and legally possible, inequities within the proposed project's service area for the same type service proposed (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, water or waste disposal) will be remedied by the owner on or before completion of the project that includes Rural Development funding. Inequities are defined as flagrant variations in availability, adequacy or quality of service. User rate schedules for portions of existing systems that were developed under different financing, rates, terms or conditions, as determined by the State Director, do not necessarily constitute inequities.</P>

                <P>(5) Before a loan is made to an applicant other than a public body, for other than utility type projects, the articles of incorporation or loan agreement will include a condition similar to the following:
                </P>
                <EXTRACT>
                  <P>In the event of dissolution of this corporation, or in the event it shall cease to carry out the objectives and purposes herein set forth, all business, property, and assets of the corporation shall go and be distributed to one or more nonprofit corporations or public bodies as may be selected by the board of directors of this corporation and approved by at least 75 percent of the users or members to be used for, and devoted to, the purpose of a community facility project or other purpose to serve the public welfare of the community. In no event shall any of the assets or property, in the event of dissolution thereof, go or be distributed to members, directors, stockholders, or others having financial or managerial interest in the corporation either for the reimbursement of any sum subscribed, donated or contributed by such members or for any other purposes, provided that nothing herein shall prohibit the corporation from paying its just debts.</P>
                </EXTRACT>
                
                <PRTPAGE P="57"/>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Rates and terms</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Each loan will bear interest at the rate prescribed in RD Instruction 440.1, exhibit B (available in any Rural Development office). The interest rates will be set by Rural Development at least for each quarter of the fiscal year. All rates will be adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 percent. The applicant may submit a written request prior to loan closing that the interest rate charged on the loan be the lower of the rate in effect at the time of loan approval or the rate in effect at the time of loan closing. If the interest rate is to be that in effect at loan closing, the interest rate charged on a loan involving multiple advances of Rural Development funds, using temporary debt instruments, shall be that in effect on the date when the first temporary debt instrument is issued. If no written request is received from the applicant prior to loan closing, the interest rate charged on the loan will be the rate in effect at the time of loan approval.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Poverty line rate.</E> The poverty line interest rate will not exceed 5 per centum per annum. The provisions of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section do not apply to health care and related facilities that provide direct health care to the public. Otherwise, all loans must comply with the following conditions:</P>
                <P>(i) The primary purpose of the loan is to upgrade existing facilities or construct new facilities required to meet applicable health or sanitary standards. Documentation will be obtained from the appropriate regulatory agency with jurisdiction to establish the standard, to verify that a bonafide standard exists, what that standard is, and that the proposed improvements are needed and required to meet the standard; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The median household income of the service area is below the poverty line for a family of four, as defined in section 673(2) of the Community Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9902(2)), or below 80 percent of the Statewide nonmetropolitan median household income.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Intermediate rate.</E> The intermediate interest rate will be set at the poverty line rate plus one-half of the difference between the poverty line rate and the market rate, not to exceed 7 percent per annum. It will apply to loans that do not meet the requirements for the poverty line rate and for which the median household income of the service area is below the poverty line or not more than 100 percent of the nonmetropolitan median household income of the State.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Market rate.</E> The market interest rate will be set using as guidance the average of the Bond Buyer Index for the four weeks prior to the first Friday of the last month before the beginning of the quarter. The market rate will apply to all loans that do not qualify for a different rate under paragraph (f)(2) or (f)(3) of this section. It may be adjusted as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this section.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Prime farmland.</E> For essential community facilities loans, the rate indicated by paragraphs (f)(2), (f)(3) or (f)(4) of this section will be increased by two per centum per annum if the project being financed will involve the use of, or construction on, prime or unique farmland in accordance with RD Instruction 440.1, exhibits B and J (available in any Rural Development office).</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Income determination.</E> The income data used to determine median household income should be that which most accurately reflects the income of the service area. The service area is that area reasonably expected to be served by the facility being financed by Rural Development. The median household income of the service area and the nonmetropolitan median household income of the State will be determined from 5-year income data from the American Community Survey (ACS) or, if needed, other Census Bureau data. If there is reason to believe that the ACS or other Census Bureau data does not accurately represent the median household income within the area to be served, the reasons will be documented and the applicant may furnish, or Rural Development may obtain, additional information regarding such median household income data. Information must consist of reliable data from local, regional, State or Federal sources or from a survey conducted by a reliable impartial source. The nonmetropolitan median household income of the State may only be updated on a national <PRTPAGE P="58"/>basis by the Rural Development National Office. This will be done only when median household income data for the same year for all Bureau of the Census areas is available from the Bureau of the Census or other reliable sources. Bureau of the Census areas would include areas such as: Counties, County Subdivisions, Cities, Towns, Townships, Boroughs, and other places.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Repayment terms.</E> The loan repayment period shall not exceed the useful life of the facility, State statute or 40 years from the date of the note(s) or bond(s), whichever is less. Where FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 grant funds are used in connection with a Rural Development loan, the loan will be for the maximum term permitted by this subpart, State statute, or the useful life of the facility, whichever is less, unless there is an exceptional case where circumstances justify making a Rural Development loan for less than the maximum term permitted. In such cases, the reasons must be fully documented. In all cases, including those in which the Rural Development is jointly financing with another lender, the Rural Development payments of principal and interest should approximate amortized installments.</P>
                <P>(i) Principal payments may be deferred in whole or in part for a period not to exceed 36 months following the date the first interest installment is due. If for any reason it appears necessary to permit a longer period of deferment, the State Director may authorize such deferment with the prior approval of the National Office. Deferments of principal will not be used to:</P>
                <P>(A) Postpone the levying of taxes or assessments.</P>
                <P>(B) Delay collection of the full rates which the borrower has agreed to charge users for its services as soon as major benefits or the improvements are available to those users.</P>
                <P>(C) Create reserves for normal operation and maintenance.</P>
                <P>(D) Make any capital improvements except those approved by Rural Development determined to be essential to the repayment of the loan or to the obtaining of adequate security thereof.</P>
                <P>(E) Accelerate the payment of other debts.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Payment date.</E> Loan payments will be scheduled to coincide with income availability and be in accordance with State law. If consistent with the foregoing, monthly payments will be required and will be enumerated in the bond, other evidence of indebtedness, or other supplemental agreement. However, if State law only permits principal plus interest (P&amp;I) type bonds, annual or semiannual payments will be used. Insofar as practical monthly payments will be scheduled one full month following the date of loan closing; or semiannual or annual payments will be scheduled six or twelve full months, respectively, following the date of loan closing or any deferment period. Due dates falling on the 29th, 30th or 31st day of the month will be avoided.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Security.</E> Loans will be secured by the best security position practicable in a manner which will adequately protect the interest of Rural Development during the repayment period of the loan. Specific requirements for security for each loan will be included in a letter of conditions.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Joint financing security.</E> For projects utilizing joint financing, when adequate security of more than one type is available, the other lender may take one type of security with the United States taking another type. For projects utilizing joint financing with the same security to be shared by the United States and another lender, the United States will obtain at least a parity position with the other lender. A parity position is to ensure that with joint security, in the event of default, each lender will be affected on a proportionate basis. A parity position will conform with the following unless an exception is granted by the National Office:</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Terms.</E> It is not necessary for loans to have the same repayment terms to meet the parity requirements. Loans made by other lenders involved in joint financing with the United States for facilities should be scheduled for repayment on terms similar to those customarily used in the State for financing such facilities.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Use of trustee or other similar paying agent.</E> The use of a trustee or other <PRTPAGE P="59"/>similar paying agent by the other lender in a joint financing arrangement is acceptable to the United States. A trustee or other similar paying agent will not normally be used for the United States portion of the funding unless required to comply with State law. The responsibilities and authorities of any trustee or other similar paying agent on projects that include United States funds must be clearly specified by written agreement and approved by the State Director and Regional Attorney. The United States must be able to deal directly with the borrower to enforce the provisions of loan and grant agreements and perform necessary servicing actions.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Regular payments.</E> In the event adequate funds are not available to meet regular installments on parity loans, the funds available will be apportioned to the lenders based on the respective current installments of principal and interest due.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Disposition of property.</E> Funds obtained from the sale or liquidation of secured property or fixed assets will be apportioned to the lenders on the basis of the pro rata amount loaned, but not to exceed their respective outstanding balances; provided, however, funds obtained from such sale or liquidation for a project that included grant funds will be apportioned as may be required by the grant agreement.</P>
                <P>(v) <E T="03">Protective advances.</E> Protective advances are payments made by a lender for items such as insurance or taxes, to protect the financial interest of the lender, and charged to the borrower's loan account. To the extent consistent with State law and customary lending practices in the area, repayment of protective advances made by either lender, for the mutual protection of both lenders, should receive first priority in apportionment of funds between the lenders. To ensure agreement between lenders, efforts should be made to obtain the concurrence of both lenders before one lender makes a protective advance.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Public bodies.</E> Loans to such borrowers will be evidenced by notes, bonds, warrants, or other contractual obligations as may be authorized by relevant State statutes and by borrower's documents, resolutions, and ordinances.</P>
                <P>(i) Utility-type facilities such as water and sewer systems, natural gas distribution systems, electric systems, etc., will be secured by:</P>
                <P>(A) The full faith and credit of the borrower when the debt is evidenced by general obligation bonds; and/or</P>
                <P>(B) Pledges of taxes or assessments; and/or</P>
                <P>(C) Pledges of facility revenue and, when it is the customary financial practice in the State, liens will be taken on the interest of the applicant in all land, easements, rights-of-way, water rights, water purchase contracts, water sales contracts, sewage treatment contracts, and similar property rights, including leasehold interest, used or to be used in connection with the facility whether owned at the time the loan is approved or acquired with loan funds; and/or</P>
                <P>(D) In those cases involving water and waste disposal projects where there is a substantial number of other than full-time users and facility costs result in a higher than reasonable rate for such full-time users, the loan will be secured by the full faith and credit of the borrower or by an assignment or pledge of taxes or assessments from public bodies or other organizations having the authority to issue bonds or pledge such taxes or assessments.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Solid waste systems.</E> The type of security required will be based on State law and what is determined adequate to protect the interest of the United States during the repayment period of the loan.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Other essential community facilities</E> other than utility type, such as those for public health and safety, social, and cultural needs and the like will meet the following security requirements:</P>
                <P>(A) Such loans will be secured by one or a combination of the following and in the following order of preference:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) General obligation bonds.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Assessments.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Bonds which pledge other taxes.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Bonds pledging revenues of the facility being financed when such bonds provide for the mandatory levy and <PRTPAGE P="60"/>collection of taxes in the event revenues later become insufficient to properly operate and maintain the facility and to retire the loan.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Assignment of assured income which will be available for the life of the loan, from such sources as insurance premium rebates, income from endowments, irrevocable trusts, or commitments from industries, public bodies, or other reliable sources.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) Liens on real and chattel property when legally permissible and an assignment of the borrowers income from applicants who have been in existence and are able to present evidence of a financially successful operation of a similar facility for a period of time sufficient to indicate project success. National Office concurrence is required when the applicant has been in existence for less than five years or has not operated on a financially successful basis for five years immediately prior to loan application.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">7</E>) Liens on real and chattel property when legally permissible and an assignment of income from an organization receiving Health and Human Services (HHS) operating grants under the “Memorandum of Understanding Between Health Resources and Services Administration, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Rural Development, U.S. Department of Agriculture” (see RD Instruction 2000-T, available in any Rural Development office.)</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">8</E>) Liens on real and chattel property when legally permissible and an assignment of income from an organization proposing a facility whose users receive reliable income from programs such as social security, supplemental security income (SSI), retirement plans, long-term insurance annuities, medicare or medicaid. Examples are homes for the handicapped or institutions whose clientele receive State or local government assistance.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">9</E>) When the applicant cannot meet the criteria in paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(A) (<E T="03">1</E>) through (<E T="03">8</E>) of this section, such proposals may be considered when all the following are met:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) The applicant is a new organization or one that has not operated the type of facility being proposed.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) There is a demonstration of exceptional community support such as substantial financial contributions, and aggressive leadership in the formation of the organization and proposed project which indicates a commitment of the entire community.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) The State Director has determined that adequate and dependable revenues will be available to meet all operation expenses, debt repayment, and the required reserve.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) Prior National Office review and concurrence is obtained.</P>

                <P>(B) Real estate and chattel property taken as security in accordance with paragraphs (g)(2)(iii)(A) (<E T="03">6</E>) through (<E T="03">9</E>) of this section:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Ordinarily will include the property that is used in connection with the facility being financed; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Will have an as-developed present market value determined by a qualified appraiser equal to or exceeding the amount of the loan to be obtained plus any other indebtedness against the proposed security; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) May have one of the lien requirements deleted when the loan approval official determines that the loan will be adequately secured with a lien on either the real estate or chattel property.</P>

                <P>(C) When security is not available in accordance with paragraphs (g)(2)(iii)(A) (<E T="03">1</E>) through (<E T="03">5</E>) of this section and State law precludes securing the loan with liens on real or chattel property, the loan will be secured in the best manner consistent with State law and customary security taken by private lenders in the State, such as revenue bonds, and any other security the loan approval official determines necessary for a sound loan. Such loans will otherwise meet the requirements of (g)(2)(iii)(A) (<E T="03">6</E>) through (<E T="03">9</E>) of this section as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Other-than-public bodies.</E> Loans to other-than-public body applicants will be secured as follows:</P>

                <P>(A) Assignments of borrower income will be taken and perfected by filing, if legally permissable; and</P>
                <P>(B) A lien will be taken on the interest of the applicant in all land, easements, rights-of-way, water rights, water purchase contracts, water sales contracts, sewage treatment contracts and similar property rights, including leasehold interest, used, or to be used in connection with the facility whether owned at the time the loan is approved or acquired with loan funds. In unusual circumstances where it is not feasible to obtain a lien on such land (such as land rights obtained from Federal or local government agencies, and from railroads) and the loan approval official `determines that the interest of the United States otherwise is secured adequately, the lien requirement may be omitted as to such land rights.</P>
                <P>(C) When the loan is approved or the acquisition of real property is subject to an outstanding lien indebtedness, the next highest priority lien obtainable will be taken if the loan approval official determines that the loan is adequately secured.</P>
                <P>(D) <E T="03">Other security.</E> Promissory notes from individuals, stock or membership subscription agreements, individuals member's liability agreements, or other evidences of debt, as well as mortgages or other security instruments encumbering the private property of members of the association may be pledged or assigned to the United States as additional security in any case in which the interest of the United States will not be otherwise adequately protected.</P>
                <P>(E) In those cases where there is a substantial number of other than full-time users and facility costs result in a higher than reasonable rate for such full-time users, the loan will be secured by an assignment or pledge of general obligation bonds, taxes, or assessments from public bodies or other organizations having the authority to issue bonds or pledge such taxes, or assessments.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Solid waste systems.</E> The type of security required will be based on State law and what is determined adequate to protect the interest of the United States during the repayment period of the loan.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Essential community facilities</E> other than utility type such as those for public health and safety, social, and cultural needs and the like will meet the following security requirements:</P>
                <P>(A) Such loans will be secured by one or a combination of the following and in the following order of preference:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) An assignment of assured income that will be available for the life of the loan, from sources such as insurance premium rebates, income from endowments, irrevocable trusts, or commitments from industries, public bodies, or other reliable sources.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Liens on real and chattel property with an assignment of income from applicants who have been in existence and are able to present evidence of a financially successful operation of a similar facility for a period of time sufficient to indicate project success. National Office concurrence is required when the applicant has been in existence for less than five years or has not operated on a financially successful basis for at least the five years immediately prior to loan application.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Liens on real and chattel property and an assignment of income from an organization receiving HHS operating grants under the “Memorandum of Understanding Between Health Resources and Services Administration, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Rural Development, U.S. Department of Agriculture” (see RD Instruction 2000-T, available in any Rural Development office).</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Liens on real and chattel property when legally permissible and an assignment of income from an organization proposing a facility whose users receive reliable income from programs such as social security, supplemental security income (SSI), retirement plans, long-term insurance annuities, medicare or medicaid. Examples are homes for the handicapped or institutions whose clientele receive State or local government assistance.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) When the applicant cannot meet the criteria in paragraphs (g)(3)(iii)(A) (<E T="03">1</E>) through (<E T="03">4</E>) of this section, such proposals may be considered when all the following are met:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) The applicant is a new organization or one that has not operated the type of facility being proposed.<PRTPAGE P="62"/>
                </P>
                <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) There is a demonstration of exceptional community support such as substantial financial contributions, and aggressive leadership in the formation of the organization and proposed project which indicates a commitment of the entire community.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) The State Director has determined that adequate and dependable revenues will be available to meet all operation expenses, debt repayment, and the required reserve.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) Prior National Office review and concurrence is obtained.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) Additional security may be taken as determined necessary by the loan approval official.</P>
                <P>(B) Real estate and chattel property taken as security:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Ordinarily will include the property that is used in connection with the facility being financed; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Will have an as-developed present market value determined by a qualified appraiser equal to or exceeding the amount of the loan to be obtained plus any other indebtedness against the proposed security; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) May have one of the lien requirements deleted when the loan approval official determines that the loan will be adequately secured with a lien on either the real estate or the chattel property.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Economic feasibility requirements.</E> All projects financed under the provisions of this section must be based on taxes, assessments, revenues, fees, or other satisfactory sources of revenues in an amount sufficient to provide for facility operation and maintenance, a reasonable reserve, and debt payment. An overall review of the applicant's financial status, including a review of all assets and liabilities, will be a part of the docket review process by the Rural Development staff and approval official. If the primary use of the facility is by business and the success or failure of the facility is dependent on the business, then the economic viability of that business must be assessed. The number of users for a rural business will be based on equivalent dwelling units, which is the level of service provided to a typical rural residential dwelling.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Financial feasibility reports.</E> All applicants will be expected to provide a financial feasibility report prepared by a qualified firm or individual. These financial feasibility reports will normally be:</P>
                <P>(i) Included as part of the preliminary engineer/architectural report using guides 6 through 10 as applicable; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Prepared by a qualified firm or individual not having a direct interest in the management or construction of the facility using guide 5 when:</P>
                <P>(A) The project will significantly affect the applicant's financial operations and is not a utility-type facility but is dependent on revenues from the facility to repay the loan; or</P>
                <P>(B) It is specifically requested by Rural Development.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Applicants for loans for utility-type facilities</E> dependent on users fees for debt payment shall base their income and expense forecast on realistic user estimates in accordance with the following:</P>
                <P>(i) In estimating the number of users and establishing rates or fees on which the loan will be based for new systems and for extensions or improvements to existing systems, consideration should be given to the following:</P>
                <P>(A) An estimated number of maximum initial users should not be used when setting user fees and rates since it may be several years before all residents in the community will need the services provided by the system. In establishing rates a realistic number of initial users should be employed.</P>
                <P>(B) User agreements from individual vacant property owners will not be considered when determining project feasibility unless:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The owner has plans to develop the property in a reasonable period of time and become a user of the facility; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The owner agrees in writing to make a monthly payment at least equal to the proportionate share of debt service attributable to the vacant property until the property is developed and the facility is utilized on a regular basis. A bond or escrowed security deposit must be provided to guarantee this monthly payment and to guarantee an amount at least equal to the owner's proportionate share of construction costs. If a bond is provided, it <PRTPAGE P="63"/>must be executed by a surety company that appears on the Treasury Department's most current list (Circular 570, as amended) and be authorized to transact business in the State where the project is located. The guarantee shall be payable jointly to the borrower and the Rural Development; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Such guarantee will mature not later than 4 years from the date of execution and will be finally due and payable upon default of a monthly payment or at maturity, unless the property covered by the guarantee has been developed and the facility is being utilized on a regular basis.</P>
                <P>(C) Income from other vacant property owners will be considered only as extra income.</P>
                <P>(ii) Realistic user estimates will be established as follows:</P>
                <P>(A) Meaningful potential user cash contributions. Potential user cash contributions are required except:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) For users presently receiving service, or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Where Rural Development determines that the potential users as a whole in the applicant's service area cannot make cash contributions, or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Where State statutes or local ordinances require mandatory use of the system and the applicant or legal entity having such authority agrees in writing to enforce such statutes, or ordinances.</P>
                <P>(B) The amount of cash contributions required in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section will be set by the applicant and concurred in by Rural Development. Contribtions should be an amount high enough to indicate sincere interest on the part of the potential user, but not so high as to preclude service to low income families. Contributions ordinarily should be an amount approximating one year's minimum user fee, and shall be paid in full before loan closing or commencement of construction, whichever occurs first. Once economic feasibility is ascertained based on a demonstration of meaningful potential user cash contributions, the contribution, membership fee or other fees that may be imposed are not a requirement of Rural Development under this section. However, borrowers do have an additional responsibility relating to generating sufficient revenues as set forth in paragraph (n)(2)(iii) of this section.</P>
                <P>(C) Enforceable user agreement. Except for users presently receiving service, an enforceable user agreement with a penalty clause is required unless State statutes or local ordinances require mandatory use of the system and the applicant or legal entity having such authority agrees in writing to enforce such statutes or ordinances.</P>
                <P>(iii) In those cases where all or part of the borrower's debt payment revenues will come from user fees, applicants must provide a positive program to encourage connection by all users as soon as service is available. The program will be available for review and approval by Rural Development before loan closing or commencement of construction, whichever occurs first. Such a program shall include:</P>
                <P>(A) An aggressive information program to be carried out during the construction period. The borrower should send written notification to all signed users at least three weeks in advance of the date service will be available, stating the date users will be expected to have their connections completed, and the date user charges will begin.</P>
                <P>(B) Positive steps to assure that installation services will be available. These may be provided by the contractor installing the system, local plumbing companies, or local contractors.</P>
                <P>(C) Aggressive action to see that all signed users can finance their connections. This might require collection of sufficient user contributions to finance connections. Extreme cases might necessitate additional loan funds for this purpose; however, loan funds should be used only when absolutely necessary and when approved by Rural Development prior to loan closing.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Utility-type facilities for new developing communities or areas.</E> Developers are normally expected to provide utility-type facilities in new or developing areas and such facilities shall be installed in compliance with appropriate State statutes and regulations. Rural Development will be considered to an eligible applicant in such cases when failure to complete development would <PRTPAGE P="64"/>result in an adverse economic condition for the rural area (not the community being developed); the proposal is necessary to the success of an area development plan; and loan repayment can be assured by:</P>
                <P>(i) The applicant already having sufficient assured revenues to repay the loan; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Developers providing a bond or escrowed security deposit as a guarantee sufficient to meet expenses attributable to the area in question until a sufficient number of the building sites are occupied and connected to the facility to provide enough revenues to meet operating, maintenance, debt service, and reserve requirements. Such guarantees from developers will meet the requirements in paragraph (h)(2)(i)(B) of this section; or</P>
                <P>(iii) Developers paying cash for the increased capital cost and any increased operating expenses until the developing area will support the increased costs; or</P>
                <P>(iv) The full faith and credit of a public body where the debt is evidenced by general obligation bonds; or</P>
                <P>(v) The loan is to a public body evidenced by a pledge of tax assessments; or</P>
                <P>(vi) The user charges can become a tax lien upon the property being served and income from such lien can be collected in sufficient time to be used for its intended purposes.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Reserve requirements.</E> Provision for the accumulation of necessary reserves over a reasonable period of time will be included in the loan documents and in assessments, tax levies, or rates charged for services. In those cases where statutes providing for extinguishing assessment liens of public bodies when properties subject to such liens are sold for delinquent State or local taxes, special reserves will be established and maintained for the protection of the borrower's assessment lien.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">General obligation or special assessment bonds.</E> Ordinarily, the requirements for reserves will be considered to have been met if general obligation or other bonds which pledge the full faith and credit of the political subdivision are used, or special assessment bonds are used, and if such bonds provide for the annual collection of sufficient taxes or assessments to cover debt service, operation and maintenance, and a reasonable amount for emergencies and to offset the possible nonpayment of taxes or assessments by a percentage of the property owners, or a statutory method is provided to prevent the incurrence of a deficiency.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Other than general obligation or special assessment bonds.</E> Each borrower will be required to establish and maintain reserves sufficient to assure that loan installments will be paid on time, for emergency maintenance, for extensions to facilities, and for replacement of short-lived assets which have a useful life significantly less than the repayment period of the loan. It is expected that borrowers issuing bonds or other evidences of debt pledging facility revenues as security will ordinarily plan their reserve to provide for a total reserve in an amount at least equal to one average loan installment. It is also expected the ordinarily such reserve will be accumulated at the rate of at least one-tenth of the total each year until the desired level is reached.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">General requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Membership authorization.</E> For organizations other than public bodies, the membership will authorize the project and its financing except that the State Director may, with the concurrence of OGC, accept the loan resolution without such membership authorization when State statutes and the organization's charter and bylaws do not require such authorization; and</P>
                <P>(i) The organization is well established and is operating with a sound financial base; or</P>
                <P>(ii) For utility-type projects the members of the organization have all signed an enforceable user agreement with a penalty clause and have made the required meaningful user cash contribution, except for members presently receiving service or when State statutes or local ordinances require mandatory use of the facility.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Planning, bidding, contracting, constructing.</E> (See § 1942.18).</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Insurance and fidelity bonds.</E> The purpose of RD's insurance and fidelity bond requirements is to protect the government's financial interest based <PRTPAGE P="65"/>on the facility financed. The requirements below apply to all types of coverage determined necessary. The National Office may grant exceptions to normal requirements when appropriate justification is provided establishing that it is in the best interest of the applicant/borrower and will not adversely affect the government's interest.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">General.</E> (A) Applicants must provide evidence of adequate insurance and fidelity bond coverage by loan closing or start of construction, whichever occurs first. Adequate coverage in accordance with this section must then be maintained for the life of the loan. It is the responsibility of the applicant/borrower and not that of Rural Development to assure that adequate insurance and fidelity bond coverage is maintained.</P>
                <P>(B) Insurance and fidelity bond requirements by Rural Development shall normally not exceed those proposed by the applicant/borrower if the Rural Development loan approval or servicing official determines that proposed coverage is adequate to protect the government's financial interest. Applicants/borrowers are encouraged to have their attorney, consulting engineer/architect, and/or insurance provider(s) review proposed types and amounts of coverage, including any deductible provisions. If the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 official and the applicant/borrower cannot agree on the acceptability of coverage proposed, a decision will be made by the State Director.</P>
                <P>(C) The use of deductibles, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, an initial amount of each claim to be paid by the applicant/borrower, may be allowed by Rural Development providing the applicant/borrower has financial resources which would likely be adequate to cover potential claims requiring payment of the deductible.</P>
                <P>(D) Borrowers must provide evidence to Rural Development that adequate insurance and fidelity bond coverage is being maintained. This may consist of a listing of policies and coverage amounts in yearend reports submitted with management reports required under § 1942.17(q)(2) or other documentation. The borrower is responsible for updating and/or renewing policies or coverage which expire between submissions to Rural Development. Any monitoring of insurance and fidelity bond coverage by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 is solely for the benefit of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, and does not relieve the applicant/borrower of its obligation under the loan resolution to maintain such coverage.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Fidelity bond.</E> Applicants/borrowers will provide fidelity bond coverage for all persons who have access to funds. Coverage may be provided either for all individual positions or persons, or through “blanket” coverage providing protection for all appropriate employees and/or officials. An exception may be granted by the State Director when funds relating to the facility financed are handled by another entity and it is determined that the entity has adequate coverage or the government's interest would otherwise be adequately protected.</P>
                <P>(A) The amount of coverage required by Rural Development will normally approximate the total annual debt service requirements for the Rural Development loans.</P>
                <P>(B) Form RD 440-24, “Position Fidelity Schedule Bond” may be used. Similar forms may be used if determined acceptable to Rural Development. Other types of coverage may be considered acceptable if it is determined by Rural Development that they fulfill essentially the same purpose as a fidelity bond.</P>
                <P>(C) Fidelity bonds must be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, “Surety Companies doing Business with the United States.”</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Insurance.</E> The following types of coverage must be maintained if appropriate for the type of project and entity involved. Insurance must be in amounts acceptable to the Agency and at least equivalent to coverage for real property and equipment acquired without Federal funds.</P>
                <P>(A) <E T="03">Property insurance.</E> Fire and extended coverage will normally be maintained on all structures except as noted in paragraphs (j)(3)(iii)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) and (<E T="03">2</E>) of this section. Ordinarily, Rural Development should be listed as mortgagee on <PRTPAGE P="66"/>the policy when Rural Development has a lien on the property. Normally, major items of equipment or machinery located in the insured structures must also be covered. Exceptions:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Reservoirs, standpipes, elevated tanks, and other structures built entirely of noncombustible materials if such structures are not normally insured.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Subsurface lift stations except for the value of electrical and pumping equipment therein.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Liability and property damage insurance, including vehicular coverage.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(C) <E T="03">Malpractice insurance.</E> The need and requirements for malpractice insurance will be carefully and thoroughly considered in connection with each health care facility financed.</P>
                <P>(D) <E T="03">Flood insurance.</E> Facilities located in special flood- and mudslide-prone areas must comply with the eligibility and insurance requirements of subpart B of part 1806 of this chapter (RD Instruction 426.2).</P>
                <P>(E) <E T="03">Worker's compensation.</E> The borrower will carry worker's compensation insurance for employees in accordance with State laws.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Acquisition of land, easements, water rights, and existing facilities.</E> Applicants are responsible for acquisition of all property rights necessary for the project and will determine that prices paid are reasonable and fair. Rural Development may require an appraisal by an independent appraiser or Rural Development employee.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Title for land, rights-of-way, easements, or existing facilities.</E> The applicant must certify and provide a legal opinion relative to the title to rights-of-way and easements. Form RD 442-21, “Rights-of-Way Certificate,” and Form RD 442-22, “Opinion of Counsel Relative to Rights-of-Way,” may be used.</P>
                <P>(A) <E T="03">Rights-of-way and easements.</E> Applicants are responsible for and will obtain valid, continuous and adequate rights-of-way and easements needed for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the facility. Form RD 442-20, “Right-of-Way Easement,” may be used. When a site is for major structures for utility-type facilities such as a reservoir or pumping station and the applicant is able to obtain only a right-of-way or easement on such a site rather than a fee simple title, the applicant will furnish a title report thereon by the applicant's attorney showing ownership of the land and all mortgages or other lien defects, restrictions, or encumbrances, if any. It is the responsibility of the applicant to obtain and record such releases, consents or subordinations to such property rights from holders of outstanding liens or other instruments as may be necessary for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the facility and give Rural Development the required security.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Title for land or existing facilities.</E> Title to land essential to the successful operation of facilities or title to facilities being purchased, must not contain any restrictions that will adversely affect the suitability, successful operation, security value, or transferability of the facility. Title opinions must be provided by the applicant's attorney. The opinions must be in sufficient detail to assess marketability of the property. Form RD 1927-9, “Preliminary Title Opinion,” and Form RD 1927-10, “Final Title Opinion,” may be used to provide the required title opinions. If other forms are used they must be reviewed and approved by Rural Development and OGC.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) In lieu of receiving title opinions from the applicant's attorney, the applicant may use a title insurance company. If a title insurance company is used, the company must provide RD a title insurance binder, disclosing all title defects or restrictions, and include a commitment to issue a title insurance policy. The policy should be in an amount at least equal to the market value of the property as improved. The title insurance binder and commitment should be provided to RD prior to requesting closing instructions. RD will be provided a title insurance policy which will insure RD's interest in the property without any title defects or restrictions which have not been waived by RD.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The loan approval official may waive title defects or restrictions, such as utility easements, that do not adversely affect the suitability, successful operation, security value, or transferability of the facility. If the District Director is the loan approval official <PRTPAGE P="67"/>and is unable to waive the defect or restriction, the title opinion or title insurance binder will be forwarded to the State Director. If the State Director, with the advice of the OGC, determines that the defect or restriction cannot be waived, the defect or restriction must be removed.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Water rights.</E> When legally permissible, an assignment will be taken on water rights owned or to be acquired by the applicant. The following will be furnished as applicable:</P>
                <P>(A) A statement by the applicant's attorney regarding the nature of the water rights owned or to be acquired by the applicant (such as conveyance of title, appropriation and decree, application and permit, public notice and appropriation and use).</P>
                <P>(B) A copy of a contract with another company or municipality to supply water; or stock certificates in another company which represents the right to receive water.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Land purchase contract:</E> (A) A land purchase contract (known in some areas as a contract for deed) is an agreement between two or more parties which obligates the purchaser to pay the purchase price, gives the purchaser the rights of immediate possession, control, and beneficial use of the property, and entitles the purchaser to a deed upon paying all or a specified part of the purchase price.</P>
                <P>(B) Applicants may obtain land through land purchase contracts when all of the following conditions are met:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The applicant has exhausted all reasonable means of obtaining outright fee simple title to the necessary land.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The applicant cannot obtain the land through condemnation.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) There are not other suitable sites available.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) National Office concurrence is obtained in accordance with paragraph (j)(4)(iii)(D)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section.</P>
                <P>(C) The land purchase contract must provide for the transfer of ownership by the seller without any restrictions, liens or other title defects. The contract must not contain provisions for future advances (except for taxes, insurance, or other costs needed to protect the security), summary cancellations, summary forfeiture, or other clauses that may jeopardize the Government's interest or the purchaser's ability to pay the Rural Development loan. The contract must provide that if the purchaser fails to make payment that Rural Development will be given at least 90 days written notice with an option to cure the default before the contract can be cancelled, terminated or foreclosed. Then Rural Development must have the option of making the payment and charging it to the purchaser's account, making the payment and taking over the ownership of the purchase contract, or taking any other action necessary to protect the Government's interest.</P>
                <P>(D) Prior to loan closing or the beginning of construction, whichever occurs first, the following actions must be taken in the order listed below:</P>

                <P>(5) <E T="03">Lease agreements.</E> Where the right of use or control of real property not owned by the applicant/borrower is essential to the successful operation of the facility during the life of the loan, such right will be evidenced by written agreements or contracts between the owner(s) of the property and the applicant/borrower. Lease agreements shall not contain provisions for restricted use of the site of facility, forfeiture or summary cancellation clauses and shall provide for the right to transfer and lease without restriction. Lease agreements will ordinarily be written for a term at least equal to the term of the loan. Such lease contracts or agreements will be approved by the Rural Development loan approval official with the advice and counsel of the Regional Attorney, OGC, as to the legal sufficiency of such documents. A copy of the lease contract or agreement will be included in the loan docket.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Notes and bonds.</E> Notes and bonds will be completed on the date of loan <PRTPAGE P="68"/>closing except for the entry of subsequent multiple advances where applicable.

                <P>(9) <E T="03">Public information.</E> Applicants should inform the general public regarding the development of any proposed project. Any applicant not required to obtain authorization by vote of its membership or by public referendum, to incur the obligations of the proposed loan or grant, will hold at least one public information meeting. The public meeting must be held after the preapplication is filed and not later than loan approval.

                <P>(10) <E T="03">Service through individual installation.</E> Community owned water or waste disposal systems may provide service through individual installations or small clusters of users within the applicant's service area. When individual installations or small clusters are proposed, the loan approval official should consider items such as: quantity and quality of the individual installations that may be developed; cost effectiveness of the individual facility compared with the initial and long term user cost on a central system; health and pollution problems attributable to individual facilities; operational or management problems peculiar to individual installations; and permit and regulatory agency requirements.</P>
                <P>(i) Applicants providing service through individual facilities must meet the eligibility requirements in § 1942.17(b).</P>
                <P>(ii) Rural Development must approve the form of agreement between the owner and individual users for the installation, operation and payment for individual facilities.</P>
                <P>(iii) If taxes or assessments are not pledged as security, owners providing service through individual facilities must obtain security as necessary to assure collection of any sum the individual user is obligated to pay the owner.</P>

                <P>(11) <E T="03">Funds from other sources.</E> Rural Development loan funds may be used along with or in connection with funds provided by the applicant or from other sources. Since “matching funds” is not a requirement for Rural Development loans, shared revenues may be used with Rural Development funds for project construction.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Other Federal, State, and local requirements.</E> Each application shall contain the comments, necessary certifications and recommendations of appropriate regulatory or other agency or institution having expertise in the planning, operation, and management of similar facilities.

                <P>(3) <E T="03">State Pollution Control or Environmental Protection Agency Standards.</E> Water and waste disposal facilities will be designed, installed, and operated in such a manner that they will not result in the pollution of water in the State in excess of established standards and that any effluent will conform with appropriate State and Federal Water Pollution Control Standards. A certification from the appropriate State and Federal agencies for water pollution control standards will be obtained showing that established standards are met.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Consistency with other development plans.</E> Rural Development financed facilities will not be inconsistent with any development plans of State, multijurisdictional areas, counties, or municipalities in which the proposed project is located.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">State agency regulating water rights.</E> Each Rural Development financed facility will be in compliance with appropriate State agency regulations which have control of the appropriation, diversion, storage and use of water and disposal of excess water. All of the rights of any landowners, appropriators, or users of water from any source will be fully honored in all respects as they may be affected by facilities to be installed.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Civil Rights Act of 1964.</E> All borrowers are subject to, and facilities must be operated in accordance with, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and subpart E of part 1901 of this chapter, particularly as it relates to conducting and reporting of compliance reviews.

The State Director will provide guidance and technical assistance to carry out the intent of this paragraph.</P>
                <P>(8) <E T="03">Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</E> Under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794), no handicapped individual in the United States shall, solely by reason of their handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Agency financial assistance.</P>
                <P>(9) <E T="03">Age Discrimination Act of 1975.</E> This Act provides that no person in the United States shall on the basis of age, <PRTPAGE P="70"/>be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. This Act also applies to programs or activities funded under the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972 (31 U.S.C. 1221 et. seq.). This Act does not apply to: (i) age distinctions contained in Federal, State or local statutes or ordinances adopted by an elected, general purpose legislative body which provide benefits or assistance based on age; (ii) establish criteria for participation in age-related terms; (iii) describe intended beneficiaries or target groups in age-related terms; and, (iv) any employment practice of any employer, employment agency, labor organization, or any labor-management joint apprenticeship training program except for any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance for public service employment under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1974 (CETA) (29 U.S.C. 801 <E T="03">et. seq.</E>).</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Professional services and contracts related to the facility</E>—(1) <E T="03">Professional services.</E> Applicants will be responsible for providing the services necessary to plan projects including design of facilities, preparation of cost and income estimates, development of proposals for organization and financing, and overall operation and maintenance of the facility. Professional services of the following may be necessary: Engineer, architect, attorney, bond counsel, accountant, auditor, appraiser, and financial advisory or fiscal agent (if desired by applicant). Contracts or other forms of agreement between the applicant and its professional and technical representatives are required and are subject to Agency concurrence. Form RD 1942-19, “Agreement for Engineering Services,” may be used when appropriate. Guide 20, “Agreement for Engineering Services (Agency/EPA—Jointly Funded Projects)” may be used on projects jointly funded by RD and EPA. Guide 14 may be used in the preparation of the legal services agreement.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Bond counsel.</E> Unless otherwise provided by § 1942.19(b), public bodies are required to obtain the service of recognized bond counsel in the preparation of evidence of indebtedness.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Contracts for other services.</E> Contracts or other forms of agreements for other services including management, operation, and maintenance will be developed by the applicant and presented to the Agency for review and approval. Management agreements should provide at least those items in guide 24.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Fees.</E> Fees provided for in contracts or agreements shall be reasonable. They shall be considered to be reasonable if not in excess of those ordinarily charged by the profession for similar work when the Agency financing is not involved.</P>
                <P>(m) <E T="03">Applying for the Agency loans</E>—(1) <E T="03">Preapplication.</E> Applicants desiring loans will file SF 424.2 and comments from the appropriate A-95 clearinghouse agency normally with the appropriate Agency County Office. The County Supervisor will immediately forward all documents to the District Office. The District Director has prime responsibility for all community program loan making and servicing activities within the District.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Preapplication review.</E> Upon receipt of the preapplication, RD will tentatively determine eligibility including the likelihood of credit elsewhere at reasonable rates and terms and availability of agency loan funds. The determination as to availability of other credit will be made after considering present rates and terms available for similar proposals (not necessarily based upon rates and terms available from Rural Development); the repayment potential of the applicant; long-term cost to the applicant; and average user or other charges. In those cases where Rural Development determines that loans at reasonable rates and terms should be available from commercial sources, Rural Development will notify the applicant so that it may apply for such financial assistance. Such applicants may be reconsidered for Rural Development loans upon their presenting satisfactory evidence of inability to obtain commercial financing at reasonable rates and terms.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Incurring obligations.</E> Applicants should not proceed with planning nor obligate themselves for expenditures until authorized by Rural Development.<PRTPAGE P="71"/>
                </P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Results of preapplication review.</E> After Rural Development has reviewed the preapplication material and any additional material that may be requested, Form AD-622 will be sent to the applicant. Ordinarily the review will not exceed 45 days.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Application conference.</E> Before starting to assemble the application and after the applicant selects its professional and technical representatives, it should arrange with Rural Development for an application conference to provide a basis for orderly application assembly. Rural Development will provide applicants with a list of documents necessary to complete the application. Guide 15 may be used for this purpose. Applications will be filed with the District Office.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Application completion and assembling.</E> This is the responsibility of the applicant with guidance from Rural Development. The applicant may utilize their professional and technical representatives or other competent sources.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Review of decision.</E> If an application is rejected, the applicant may request a review of this decision under subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(n) <E T="03">Actions prior to loan closing and start of construction</E>—(1) <E T="03">Excess Rural Development loan and grant funds.</E> If there is a significant reduction in project cost, the applicant's funding needs will be reassessed before loan closing or the start of construction, whichever occurs first. In such cases applicable Rural Development forms, the letter of conditions, and other items will be revised. Decreases in Rural Development funds will be based on revised project costs and current number of users, however, other factors including Rural Development regulations used at the time of loan/grant approval will remain the same. Obligated loan or grant funds not needed to complete the proposed project will be deobligated.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Loan resolutions.</E> Loan resolutions will be adopted by both public and other-than-public bodies using Form RD 1942-47, “Loan Resolution (Public Bodies),” or Form RD 1942-9, “Loan Resolution (Security Agreement).” These resolutions supplement other provisions in this subpart. The applicant will agree:</P>
                <P>(i) To indemnify the Government for any payments made or losses suffered by the Government on behalf of the association. Such indemnification shall be payable from the same source of funds pledged to pay the bonds or any other legally permissible source.</P>
                <P>(ii) To comply with applicable local, State and Federal laws, regulations, and ordinances.</P>
                <P>(iii) To provide for the receipt of adequate revenues to meet the requirements of debt service, operation and maintenance, establishment of adequate reserves, and to continually operate and maintain the facility in good condition. Except for utility-type facilities, free service use may be permitted. If free services are extended no distinctions will be made in the extension of those services because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, marital status, or physical or mental handicap.</P>
                <P>(iv) To acquire and maintain such insurance coverage including fidelity bonds, as may be required by the Government.</P>
                <P>(v) To establish and maintain such books and records relating to the operation of the facility and its financial affairs and to provide for required audit thereof in such a manner as may be required by the Government and to provide the Government without its request, a copy of each such audit and to make and forward to the Government such additional information and reports as it may, from time to time, require.</P>
                <P>(vi) To provide the Government at all reasonable times, access to all books and records relating to the facility and access to the property of the system so that the Government may ascertain that the association is complying with the provisions hereof and of the instruments incident to the making or insuring of the loan.</P>

                <P>(vii) To provide adequate service to all persons within the service area who can feasibly and legally be served and to obtain Rural Development's concurrence prior to refusing new or adequate services to such persons. Upon failure of the applicant to provide services <PRTPAGE P="72"/>which are feasible and legal, such person shall have a direct right of action against the applicant organization.</P>
                <P>(viii) To have prepared on its behalf and to adopt an ordinance or resolution for the issuance of its bonds or notes or other debt instruments or other such items and in such forms as are required by State statutes and as are agreeable and acceptable to the Government.</P>
                <P>(ix) To refinance the unpaid balance, in whole or in part, of its debt upon the request of the Government if at any time it should appear to the Government that the association is able to refinance its bonds by obtaining a loan for such purposes from responsible cooperative or private sources at reasonable rates and terms.</P>
                <P>(x) To provide for, execute, and comply with Form RD 400-4, “Assurance Agreement,” and Form RD 400-1, “Equal Opportunity Agreement,” including an “Equal Opportunity Clause,” which is to be incorporated in or attached as a rider to each construction contract and subcontract in excess of $10,000.</P>
                <P>(xi)(A) To place the proceeds of the loan on deposit in a manner approved by the Government. Funds must be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible. Funds must be maintained in interest bearing accounts, unless the following apply:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The borrower receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The best reasonably available interest-bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $500 per year on Federal cash balances;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources; and,</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) A foreign government or banking system prohibits or precludes interest bearing accounts.</P>
                <P>(B) Interest earned on Federal payments deposited in interest-bearing accounts must be remitted annually to the Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management System, Rockville, MD 20852. Interest amounts up to $500 per year may be retained by the non-Federal entity for administrative expense.</P>
                <P>(xii) Not to sell, transfer, lease, or otherwise encumber the facility or any portion thereof or interest therein, and not to permit others to do so, without the prior written consent of the Government.</P>
                <P>(xiii) Not to borrow any money from any source, enter into any contract or agreement, or incur any other liabilities in connection with making enlargements, improvements or extensions to, or for any other purpose in connection with the facility (exclusive of normal maintenance) without the prior written consent of the Government if such undertaking would involve the source of funds pledged to repay the debt to Rural Development.</P>
                <P>(xiv) That upon default in the payments of any principal and accrued interest on the bonds or in the performance of any covenant or agreement contained herein or in the instruments incident to making or insuring the loan, the Government, at its option, may:</P>
                <P>(A) Declare the entire principal amount then outstanding and accrued interest, due and payable;</P>
                <P>(B) For the account of the association (payable from the source of funds pledged to pay the bonds or notes or any other legally permissiable source), incur and pay reasonable expenses for repair, maintenance and operation of the facility and such other reasonable expenses as may be necessary to cure the cause of default; and/or</P>
                <P>(C) Take possession of the facility, repair, maintain and operate, or otherwise dispose of the facility. Default under the provisions of the resolution or any instrument incident to the making or insuring of the loan may be construed by the Government to constitute default under any other instrument held by the Government and executed or assumed by the association and default under any such instrument may be construed by the Government to constitute default hereunder.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Interim financing.</E> In all loans exceeding $50,000, where funds can be borrowed at reasonable interest rates on an interim basis from commercial sources for the construction period, such interim financing will be obtained so as to preclude the necessity for multiple advances of Rural Development <PRTPAGE P="73"/>funds. Guide 1 or guide 1a, as appropriate, may be used to inform the private lender of Rural Development's commitment. When interim commercial financing is used, the application will be processed, including obtaining construction bids, to the stage where the Rural Development loan would normally be closed, that is immediately prior to the start of construction. The Rural Development loan should be closed as soon as possible after the disbursal of all interim funds. Interim financing may be for a fixed term provided the fixed term does not extend beyond the time projected for completion of construction. For this purpose, a fixed term is when the interim lender cannot be repaid prior to the end of the stipulated term of the interim instruments. When a Rural Development Water and Waste Disposal grant is included, any interim financing involving a fixed term must be for the total Rural Development loan amount. Multiple advances may be used in conjunction with interim commercial financing when the applicant is unable to obtain sufficient funds through interim commercial financing in an amount equal to the loan. The Rural Development loan proceeds (including advances) will be used to retire the interim commercial indebtedness. Before the Rural Development loan is closed, the applicant will be required to provide Rural Development with statements from the contractor, engineer, architect, and attorney that they have been paid to date in accordance with their contracts or other agreements and, in the case of the contractor, that any suppliers and subcontractors have been paid. If such statements cannot be obtained, the loan may be closed provided:</P>
                <P>(i) Statements to the extent possible are obtained;</P>
                <P>(ii) The interest of Rural Development can be adequately protected and its security position is not impaired; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Adequate provisions are made for handling the unpaid accounts by withholding or escrowing sufficient funds to pay such claims.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Obtaining closing instructions.</E> After loan approval, the completed docket will be reviewed by the State Director. The information required by OGC will be transmitted to OGC with request for closing instructions. Upon receipt of the closing instructions from OGC, the State Director will forward them along with any appropriate instructions to the District Director. Upon receipt of closing instructions, the District Director will discuss with the applicant and its architect or engineer, attorney, and other appropriate representatives, the requirements contained therein and any actions necessary to proceed with closing.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Applicant contribution.</E> An applicant contributing funds toward the project cost shall deposit these funds in its construction account on or before loan closing or start of construction, whichever occurs first. Project costs paid prior to the required deposit time with applicant funds shall be appropriately accounted for.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Evidence of and disbursement of other funds.</E> Applicants expecting funds from other sources for use in completing projects being partially financed with Rural Development funds will present evidence of the commitment of these funds from such other sources. This evidence will be available before loan closing, or the start of construction, whichever occurs first. Ordinarily, the funds provided by the applicant or from other sources will be disbursed prior to the use of Rural Development loan funds. If this is not possible, funds will be disbursed on a pro rata basis. Rural Development funds will not be used to pre-finance funds committed to the project from other sources.</P>
                <P>(o) <E T="03">Loan closing</E>—(1) <E T="03">Closing instructions.</E> Loans will be closed in accordance with the closing instructions issued by OGC.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Obtaining insurance and fidelity bonds.</E> Required property insurance policies, liability insurance policies, and fidelity bonds will be obtained by the time of loan closing or start of construction, whichever occurs first.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Distribution of recorded documents.</E> The originals of the recorded deeds, easements, permits, certificates of water rights, leases, or other contracts and similar documents which are not to be held by Rural Development will <PRTPAGE P="74"/>be returned to the borrower. The original mortgage(s) and water stock certificates, if any, if not required by the recorder's office will be retained by Rural Development.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Review of loan closing.</E> In order to determine that the loan has been properly closed the loan docket will be reviewed by the State Director and OGC.</P>
                <P>(p) <E T="03">Project monitoring and fund delivery during construction</E>—(1) <E T="03">Coordination of funding sources.</E> When a project is jointly financed, the State Director will reach any needed agreement or understanding with the representatives of the other source of funds on distribution of responsibilities for handling various aspects of the project. These responsibilities will include supervision of construction, inspections and determinations of compliance with appropriate regulations concerning equal employment opportunities, wage rates, nondiscrimination in making services or benefits available, and environmental compliance. If any problems develop which cannot be resolved locally, complete information should be sent to the National Office for advice.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Multiple advances.</E> In the event interim commercial financing is not legally permissible or not available, multiple advances of Rural Development loan funds are required. An exception to this requirement may be granted by the National Office when a single advance is necessitated by State law or public exigency. Multiple advances will be used only for loans in excess of $50,000. Advances will be made only as needed to cover disbursements required by the borrower over a 30-day period. Advances should not exceed 24 in number nor extend longer than two years beyond loan closing. Normally, the retained percentage withheld from the contractor to assure construction completion will be included in the last advance.</P>
                <P>(i) Section 1942.19 contains instructions for making multiple advances to public bodies.</P>
                <P>(ii) Advances will be requested by the borrower in writing. The request should be in sufficient amounts to pay cost of construction, rights-of-way and land, legal, engineering, interest, and other expenses as needed. The applicant may use Form RD 440-11, “Estimate of Funds Needed for 30 Day Period Commencing ___,” to show the amount of funds needed during the 30-day period.</P>
                <P>(iii) Rural Development loan funds obligated for a specific purpose, such as the paying of interest, but not needed at the time of loan closing will remain in the Finance Office until needed unless State statutes require all funds to be delivered to the borrower at the time of closing. Loan funds may be advanced to prepay costs under paragraph (d)(1)(iv)(G) of this section. If all funds must be delivered to the borrower at the time of closing to comply with State statutes, funds not needed at loan closing will be handled as follows:</P>
                <P>(A) Deposited in an appropriate borrower account, such as the debt service account, or</P>
                <P>(B) Deposited in a supervised bank account under paragraph (p)(3)(i) of this section.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Use and accountability of funds</E>—(i) <E T="03">Supervised bank account.</E> Rural Development loan funds and any funds furnished by the applicant/borrower to supplement the loan including contributions to purchase major items of equipment, machinery, and furnishings may be deposited in a supervised bank account if determined necessary as provided in subpart A of part 1902 of this chapter. When Rural Development has a Memorandum of Understanding with another agency that provides for the use of supervised bank accounts, or when Rural Development is the primary source of funds for a project and has determined that the use of a supervised bank account is necessary, project funds from other sources may also be deposited in the supervised bank account. Rural Development shall not be accountable to the source of the other funds nor shall Rural Development undertake responsibility to administer the funding program of the other entity. Supervised bank accounts should not be used for funds advanced by an interim lender.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Other than supervised bank account.</E> If a supervised bank account is not used, arrangements will be agreed upon for the prior concurrence by Rural Development of the bills or vouchers upon which warrants will be <PRTPAGE P="75"/>drawn, so that the payments from loan funds can be controlled and Rural Development records kept current. If a supervised bank account is not used, use Rural Development 402-2, “Statement of Deposits and Withdrawals,” or similar form to monitor funds. Periodic reviews of nonsupervised accounts shall be made by Rural Development at the times and in the manner as Rural Development prescribes in the conditions of loan approval. State laws regulating the depositories to be used shall be complied with.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Use of minority owned banks.</E> Applicants are encouraged to use minority banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by minority group members) for the deposit and disbursement of funds. A list of minority owned banks can be obtained from the Office of Minority Business Enterprise, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230 and is also available in all Rural Development offices.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Development inspections.</E> The District Director will be responsible for monitoring the construction of all projects being financed, wholly or in part, with Rural DevelopmentFmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 funds. Technical assistance will be provided by the State Director's staff. Project monitoring will include construction inspections and a review of each project inspection report, each change order and each partial payment estimate and other invoices such as payment for engineering/architectural and legal fees and other materials determined necessary to effectively monitor each project. These activities will not be performed on behalf of the applicant/borrower, but are solely for the benefit of Rural Development and in no way are intended to relieve the applicant/borrower of corresponding obligations to conduct similar monitoring and inspection activities. Project monitoring will include periodic inspections to review partial payment estimates prior to their approval and to review project development in accordance with plans and specifications. Each inspection will be recorded using Form RD 1924-12, “Inspection Report.” The original Form RD 1924-12 will be filed in the project case folder and a copy furnished to the State Director. The State Director will review inspection reports and will determine that the project is being effectively monitored. The District Director is authorized to review and accept partial payment estimates prepared by the contractor and approved by the borrower, provided the consulting engineer or architect, if one is being utilized for the project, has approved the estimate and certified that all material purchased or work performed is in accordance with the plans and specifications, or if a consulting engineer or architect is not being utilized, the District Director has determined that the funds requested are for authorized purposes. If there is any indication that construction is not being completed in accordance with the plans and specifications or that any other problems exist, the District Director should notify the State Director immediately and withhold all payments on the contract.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Payment for construction.</E> Each payment for project costs must be approved by the borrower's governing body. Payment for construction must be for amounts shown on payment estimate forms. Form RD 1924-18, “Partial Payment Estimate,” may be used for this purpose or other similar forms may be used with the prior approval of the State Director or designee. However, the State Director or designee cannot require a greater reporting burden than is required by Form RD 1924-18. Advances for contract retainage will not be made until such retainage is due and payable under the terms of the contract. The review and acceptance of project costs, including construction partial payment estimates by the Agency, does not attest to the correctness of the amounts, the quantities shown, or that the work has been performed under the terms of agreements or contracts.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Use of remaining funds.</E> Funds remaining after all costs incident to the basic project have been paid or provided for will not include applicant contributions. Applicant contributions will be considered as funds initially expended for the project. Funds remaining, with exception of applicant contributions, may be considered in direct proportion to the amount obtained <PRTPAGE P="76"/>from each source. Remaining funds will be handled as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Agency loan and/or grant funds.</E> Remaining funds may be used for purposes authorized by paragraph (d) of this section, provided the use will not result in major changes to the facility design or project and that the purposes of the loan and/or grant remains the same.</P>
                <P>(A) On projects that only involve an agency loan and no agency grant, funds that are not needed will be applied as an extra payment on the RD indebtedness unless other disposition is required by the bond ordinance, resolution, or State statute.</P>
                <P>(B) On projects that involve an agency grant, all remaining agency funds will be considered to be grant funds up to the full amount of the grant. Grant funds not expended under paragraph (p)(6)(i) of this section will be deobligated.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Funds from other sources.</E> Funds remaining from other sources will be handled according to rules, regulations and/or the agreement governing their participation in the project.</P>
                <P>(q) <E T="03">Borrower accounting methods, management reporting and audits.</E> (1) <E T="03">Annual financial statements.</E> Borrowers are required to provide the Agency with annual financial statements for the life of the loan as outlined in the Letter of Conditions issued by the Agency. The financial statements are the responsibility of the borrower's governing body. The type of statement required is dependent on the amount of Federal financial assistance received during the borrower's fiscal year. Federal financial assistance includes Federal assistance that a non-Federal entity received or administered during the entity's fiscal year in the form of grants, loans, and loan guarantees. A Federal award is Federal financial assistance a non-Federal entity received directly from Federal awarding agencies or indirectly from pass-through entities. Federal awards expended generally pertain to events that require the non-Federal entity to comply with Federal Statues, regulations, and terms and conditions of federal awards, such as: expenditure/expense transactions associated with grants, cost-reimbursement contracts, cooperative agreements, and direct appropriations; the disbursement of funds passed through to sub-recipients; the use of loan proceeds under loan and loan guarantee programs; the receipt of property; the receipt of surplus property; the receipt or use of program income; the distribution or consumption of food commodities; the disbursement of amounts entitling the non-Federal entity to an interest subsidy; and, the period when insurance is in force.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Method of accounting and preparation of financial statements.</E> Annual organization-wide financial statements must be prepared on the accrual basis of accounting, in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), unless State statute, tribal law or regulatory agencies provide otherwise, or an exception is granted by the Agency. An organization may maintain its accounting records on a basis other than accrual accounting, and make the necessary adjustments so that annual financial statements are presented on the accrual basis.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Record retention.</E> Each Applicant will retain all records, books, and supporting material for 3 years after the issuance of the audit or management reports, or for a time period required by other agencies or common business practice, whichever is longer. Upon request, this material will be made available to Rural Development, OIG, USDA, the Comptroller General, or to their assignees.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Audits.</E> Any applicant that expends $750,000 or more in Federal financial assistance during their fiscal year must submit an audit report conducted in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, “Audit Requirements.” Applicants expending less than $750,000 in Federal financial assistance per fiscal year are exempt from 2 CFR part 200 audit requirements. All audits are to be performed in accordance with the latest revision of the Generally Accepted Government Accounting Standards (GAGAS), developed by the Comptroller General of the United States. Further guidance on preparing an acceptable audit can be obtained from any Agency office. It is not intended that audits required by this part be separate and apart from audits performed in accordance with State and local laws. To the extent feasible, the <PRTPAGE P="77"/>audit work should be done in conjunction with those audits. Audits should be supplied to the Processing Official within the timeframes stated in paragraph (f) of this section. OMB Circulars and Agency Compliance Supplements are available in any USDA/Agency office or OMB's Web site. Any state, local government, or Indian tribe that is required by constitution or state statute, in effect on January 1, 1987, to undergo its audits less frequently than annually, is permitted to undergo its audits biennially, pursuant to 2 CFR 200.504(a). This requirement must still be in effect for the biennial period. Any nonprofit organization that had biennial audits for all biennial periods ending between July 1, 1992, and January 1, 1995, is permitted to undergo its audits biennially, pursuant to 2 CFR 200.504(b). All biennial audits must cover both years within the biennial period.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Exemption from audits.</E> Except as noted in 2 CFR 200.503, Relation to other audit requirement, public bodies or nonprofits expending less than $750,000 in Federal awards during its fiscal year, whose payments are current, and are having no signs of operational or financial difficulty may submit a management report. A management report, at a minimum, will include a balance sheet and income and expense statement. Financial information may be reported on Form RD 442-2, “Statement of Budget, Income and Equity” and RD Form 442-3, “Balance Sheet”, or similar. The following management data will be submitted by the borrower to the servicing office. Records must be available for review or audit by appropriate officials of the Federal agency, pass-through entity, and Government Accountability Office (GAO).</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Annual management reports.</E> Thirty days prior to the beginning of each fiscal year the following will be submitted to the Servicing Official:</P>
                <P>(A) One copy of the proposed annual budget. The borrower will submit two copies of Form RD 442-2, or equivalent, Statement of Budget, Income and Equity, Schedule 1, page 1; and Schedule 2, Projected Cash Flow. The only data required at this time is Schedule 1, page 1, Column 3, annual budget, and all of Schedule 2, Projected Cash Flow.</P>
                <P>(B) An annual audit report may be submitted in lieu of Forms RD 442-2 and 442-3.</P>
                <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Deadlines for submitting audits and management reports.</E> In accordance with 2 CFR part 200, audits must be submitted no later than 9 months after the end of the fiscal year or 30 days after the borrower's receipt of the auditor's reports, whichever is earlier. Management reports must be submitted no later than 2 months after the end of the borrower's fiscal year.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Additional information to be submitted with audits and management reports.</E> (i) <E T="03">Insurance.</E> Agency borrowers will maintain adequate insurance coverage as required by the loan resolution and § 1942.17(j)(3). The servicing official is required to monitor insurance annually after the initial insurance verification.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Reserve account(s).</E> Borrowers will provide documentation that the Agency required reserve account(s) is properly funded;</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Property tax information.</E> If applicable, documentation that property taxes have been paid and are current.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">A list of directors and officers.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(8) <E T="03">Quarterly reports.</E> A quarterly management report will be required for the first full year of operations for new borrowers, and existing borrowers operating a new facility, starting a new type of operation or proposing a significant expansion of an existing facility.

                <P>(16) <E T="03">Metering devices.</E> Water facilities financed by Rural Development will have metering devices for each connection. An exception to this requirement may be granted by the Rural Development's State Director when the owner demonstrates that installation of metering devices would be a significant economic detriment and that environmental consideration would not be adversely affected by not installing such devices.</P>
                <P>(17) <E T="03">Seismic safety.</E> (i) All new building construction shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the seismic provisions of one of the following model building codes or the latest edition of that code providing an equivalent level of safety to that contained in latest edition of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program's (NEHRP) Recommended Provisions for the Development of Seismic Regulations for New Building (NEHRP Provisions):</P>
                <P>(A) 1991 International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO) Uniform Building Code;</P>
                <P>(B) 1993 Building Officials and Code Administrators International, Inc. (BOCA) National Building Code; or</P>
                <P>(C) 1992 Amendments to the Southern Building Code Congress International (SBCCI) Standard Building Code.</P>
                <P>(ii) The date, signature, and seal of a registered architect or engineer and the identification and date of the model building code on the plans and specifications will be evidence of compliance with the seismic requirements of the appropriate building code.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Construction contracts.</E> Contract documents must be sufficiently descriptive and legally binding in order to accomplish the work as economically and expeditiously as possible.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Standard construction contract documents</E> are available from Rural Development. When Rural Development's standard construction contract documents are used, it will normally not be necessary for the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) to perform a detailed legal review. If the construction contract documents utilized are not in the format of guide forms previously approved by Rural Development, OGC's review of the construction contract <PRTPAGE P="80"/>documents will be obtained prior to their use.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Contract review and approval.</E> The owner's attorney will review the executed contract documents, including performance and payment bonds, and will certify that they are adequate, and that the persons executing these documents have been properly authorized to do so. The contract documents, bids bonds, and bid tabulation sheets will be forwarded to Rural Development for approval prior to awarding. All contracts will contain a provision that they are not in full force and effect until they have been approved by Rural Development. The Rural Development State Director or designee is responsible for approving construction contracts with the legal advice and guidance of the OGC when necessary.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Separate contracts.</E> Arrangements which split responsibility of contractors (separate contracts for labor and material, extensive subcontracting and multiplicity of small contracts on the same job), should be avoided whenever it is practical to do so. Contracts may be awarded to suppliers or manufacturers for furnishing and installing certain items which have been designed by the manufacturer and delivered to the job site in a finished or semifinished state such as perfabricated buildings and lift stations. Contracts may also be awarded for material delivered to the job site and installed by a patented process or method.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Utility purchase contracts.</E> Applicants proposing to purchase water or other utility service from private or public sources shall have written contracts for supply or service which are reviewed and approved by the Rural Development State Director or designee. To the extent practical, Rural Development review and approval of such contracts should take place prior to their execution by the owner. Form RD 442-30, “Water Purchase Contract,” may be used when appropriate. If the Rural Development loan will be repaid from system revenues, the contract will be pledged to Rural Development as part of the security for the loan. Such contracts will:</P>
                <P>(1) Include a commitment by the supplier to furnish, at a specified point, an adequate quantity of water or other service and provide that, in case of shortages, all of the supplier's users will proportionately share shortages. If it is impossible to obtain a firm commitment for either an adequate quantity or sharing shortages proportionately, a contract may be executed and approved provided adequate evidence is furnished to enable Rural Development to make a determination that the supplier has adequate supply and/or treatment facilities to furnish its other users and the applicant for the foreseeable future; and</P>
                <P>(i) The supplier is subject to regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or other Federal or State agency whose jurisdiction can be expected to prevent unwarranted curtailment of supply; or</P>
                <P>(ii) A suitable alternative supply could be arranged within the repayment ability of the borrower if it should become necessary; or</P>
                <P>(iii) Prior approval is obtained from the National Office. The following information should be submitted to the National Office:</P>
                <P>(A) Transmittal memorandum including:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Alternative supplies considered; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Recommendations and comments; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Any other necessary supporting information.</P>
                <P>(B) Copies of the following:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Proposed letter of conditions; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Form RD 442-7, “Operating Budget”; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Form RD 442-3, “Balance Sheet”; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Preliminary Engineering Report; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Proposed Contract.</P>
                <P>(C) Owner and Rural Development engineer's comments and recommendations.</P>
                <P>(D) Documentation and statement from the supplier that it has an adequate supply and treatment facilities available to meet the needs of its users and the owner for the foreseeable future.</P>

                <P>(2) Set out the ownership and maintenance responsibilities of the respective parties including the master meter if a meter is installed at the point of delivery.<PRTPAGE P="81"/>
                </P>
                <P>(3) Specify the initial rates and provide some kind of escalator clause which will permit rates for the association to be raised or lowered proportionately as certain specified rates for the supplier's regular customers are raised or lowered. Provisions may be made for altering rates in accordance with the decisions of the appropriate State agency which may have regulatory authority.</P>
                <P>(4) Run for a period of time which is at least equal to the repayment period of the loan. State Directors may approve contracts for shorter periods of time if the supplier cannot legally contract for such period, or if the owner and supplier find it impossible or impractical to negotiate a contract for the maximum period permissible under State law, provided:</P>
                <P>(i) The supplier is subject to regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or other Federal or State agency whose jurisdiction can be expected to prevent unwarranted curtailment of supply; or</P>
                <P>(ii) The contract contains adequate provisions for renewal; or</P>
                <P>(iii) A determination is made that in the event the contract is terminated, there are or will be other adequate sources available to the owner that can feasibly be developed or purchased.</P>
                <P>(5) Set out in detail the amount of connection or demand charges, if any, to be made by the supplier as a condition to making the service available to the owner. However, the payment of such charges from loan funds shall not be approved unless Rural Development determines that it is more feasible and economical for the owner to pay such a connection charge than it is for the owner to provide the necessary supply by other means.</P>
                <P>(6) Provide for a pledge of the contract to Rural Development as part of the security for the loan.</P>
                <P>(7) Not contain provisions for:</P>
                <P>(i) Construction of facilities which will be owned by the supplier. This does not preclude the use of money paid as a connection charge for construction to be done by the supplier.</P>
                <P>(ii) Options for the future sale or transfer. This does not preclude an agreement recognizing that the supplier and owner may at some future date agree to a sale of all or a portion of the facility.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Sewage treatment and bulk water sales contracts.</E> Owners entering into agreements with private or public parties to treat sewage or supply bulk water shall have written contracts for such service and all such contracts shall be subject to Rural Development concurrence. Paragraph (f) of this section should be used as a guide to prepare such contracts.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Performing construction.</E> Owners are encouraged to accomplish construction through contracts with recognized contractors. Owners may accomplish construction by using their own personnel and equipment provided the owners possess the necessary skills, abilities and resources to perform the work and provided a licensed engineer or architect prepares design drawings and specifications and inspects construction and furnishes inspection reports as required by paragraph (o) of this section. For other than utility-type facilities, inspection services may be provided by individuals as approved by the Rural Development State Director. In either case, the requirements of paragraph (j) of this section apply. Payments for construction will be handled under § 1942.17(p)(5) of this part.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Owner's contractual responsibility.</E> This subpart does not relieve the owner of any contractual responsibilities under its contract. The owner is responsible for the settlement of all contractural and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in support of a loan or grant. These include, but are not limited to: source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims. Matters concerning violation of laws are to be referred to the local, State, or Federal authority as may have jurisdiction.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Owner's procurement regulations.</E> Owner's procurement regulations must comply with the following standards:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Code of conduct.</E> Owners shall maintain a written code or standards of conduct which shall govern the performance of their officers, employees or agents engaged in the award and administration of contracts supported by Rural Development funds. No employee, officer or agent of the owner shall participate in the selection, <PRTPAGE P="82"/>award, or administration of a contract supported by Rural Development funds if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be involved. Examples of such conflicts would arise when: the employee, officer or agent; any member of their immediate family; their partner; or an organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of the above; has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for the award.</P>
                <P>(i) The owner's officers, employees or agents shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties of subagreements.</P>
                <P>(ii) To the extent permitted by State or local law or regulations, the owner's standards of conduct shall provide for penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of such standards by the owner's officers, employees, agents, or by contractors or their agents.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Maximum open and free competition.</E> All procurement transactions, regardless of whether by sealed bids or by negotiation and without regard to dollar value, shall be conducted in a manner that provides maximum open and free competition. Procurement procedures shall not restrict or eliminate competition. Examples of what are considered to be restrictive of competition include, but are not limited to: Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to qualify to do business; noncompetitive practices between firms; organizational conflicts of interest; and unnecessary experience and bonding requirements. In specifying material(s), the owner and its consultant will consider all materials normally suitable for the project commensurate with sound engineering practices and project requirements. For a water or waste disposal facility, Rural Development shall consider fully any recommendation made by the loan applicant or borrower concerning the technical design and choice of materials to be used for such a facility. If Rural Development determines that a design or material, other than those that were recommended should be considered by including them in the procurement process as an acceptable design or material in the water or waste disposal facility, Rural Development shall provide such applicant or borrower with a comprehensive justification for such a determination. The justification will be documented in writing.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Owner's review.</E> Proposed procurement actions shall be reviewed by the owner's officials to avoid the purchase of unnecessary or duplicate items. Consideration should be given to consolidation or separation of procurement items to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an analysis shall be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any other appropriate analysis to determine which approach would be the most economical. To foster greater economy and efficiency, owners are encouraged to enter into State and local intergovernmental agreements for procurement or use of common goods and services.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Solicitation of offers,</E> whether by competitive sealed bids or competitive negotiation, shall:</P>
                <P>(i) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. The description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service to be procured, and when necessary shall set forth those minimum essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications should be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a “brand name or equal” description may be used to define the performance or other salient requirements of a procurement. The specific features of the named brands which must be met by offerors shall be clearly stated.</P>

                <P>(ii) Clearly specify all requirements which offerors must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.<PRTPAGE P="83"/>
                </P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Small, minority, and women's businesses and labor surplus area firms.</E> (i) affirmative steps should be taken to assure that small and minority businesses are utilized when possible as sources of supplies, equipment, construction and services. Affirmative steps shall include the following:</P>
                <P>(A) Include qualified small and minority businesses on solicitation lists.</P>
                <P>(B) Assure that small and minority businesses are solicited whenever they are potential sources.</P>
                <P>(C) When economically feasible, divide total requirements into smaller tasks or quantities so as to permit maximum small and minority business participation.</P>
                <P>(D) Where the requirement permits, establish delivery schedules which will encourage participation by small and minority businesses.</P>
                <P>(E) Use the services and assistance of the Small Business Administration and the Office of Minority Business Enterprise of the Department of Commerce.</P>
                <P>(F) If any subcontracts are to be let, require the prime contractor to take the affirmative steps in paragraphs (j)(5)(i) (A) through (E) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) Owners shall take similar appropriate affirmative action in support of women's businesses.</P>
                <P>(iii) Owners are encouraged to procure goods and services from labor surplus areas.</P>
                <P>(iv) Owners shall submit a written statement or other evidence to Rural Development of the steps taken to comply with paragraphs (j)(5)(i) (A) through (F), (j)(5)(ii), and (j)(5)(iii) of this section.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Contract pricing.</E> Cost plus a percentage of cost method of contracting shall not be used.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Unacceptable bidders.</E> The following will not be allowed to bid on, or negotiate for, a contract or subcontract related to the construction of the project:</P>
                <P>(i) An engineer or architect as an individual or firm who has prepared plans and specifications or who will be responsible for monitoring the construction;</P>
                <P>(ii) Any firm or corporation in which the owner's architect or engineer is an officer, employee, or holds or controls a substantial interest;</P>
                <P>(iii) The governing body's officers, employees, or agents;</P>
                <P>(iv) Any member of the immediate family or partners in paragraphs (j)(7)(i), (j)(7)(ii), or (j)(7)(iii) of this section; or</P>
                <P>(v) An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any person in paragraph (j)(7)(i), (j)(7)(ii), (j)(7)(iii) or (j)(7)(iv) of this section.</P>
                <P>(8) <E T="03">Contract award.</E> Contracts shall be made only with responsible parties possessing the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration shall include but not be limited to matters such as integrity, record of past performance, financial and technical resources, and accessibility to other necessary resources. Contracts shall not be made with parties who are suspended or debarred.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Procurement methods.</E> Procurement shall be made by one of the following methods: small purchase procedures; competitive sealed bids (formal advertising); competitive negotiation; or noncompetitive negotiation. Competitive sealed bids (formal advertising) is the preferred procurement method for construction contracts.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Small purchase procedures.</E> Small purchase procedures are those relatively simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies or other property, costing in the aggregate not more than the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. If small purchase procedures are used for a procurement, written price or rate quotations shall be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Competitive sealed bids.</E> In competitive sealed bids (formal advertising), sealed bids are publicly solicited and a firm-fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is lowest, price and other factors considered. When using this method the following shall apply:</P>

                <P>(i) At a sufficient time prior to the date set for opening of bids, bids shall be solicited from an adequate number of qualified sources. In addition, the invitation shall be publicly advertised.<PRTPAGE P="84"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) The invitation for bids, including specifications and perinent attachments, shall clearly define the items or services needed in order for the bidders to properly respond to the invitation under paragraph (j)(4) of this section.</P>
                <P>(iii) All bids shall be opened publicly at the time and place stated in the invitation for bids.</P>
                <P>(iv) A firm-fixed-price contract award shall be made by written notice to that responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the invitation for bids, is lowest. When specified in the bidding documents, factors such as discounts and transportation costs shall be considered in determining which bid is lowest.</P>
                <P>(v) Any or all bids may be rejected by the owner when it is in their best interest.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Competitive negotiation.</E> In competitive negotiations, proposals are requested from a number of sources and the Request for Proposal is publicized. Negotiations are normally conducted with more than one of the sources submitting offers. Competitive negotiation may be used if conditions are not appropriate for the use of formal advertising and where discussions and bargaining with a view to reaching agreement on the technical quality, price, other terms of the proposed contract and specifications may be necessary. If competitive negotiation is used for a procurement, the following requirements shall apply:</P>
                <P>(i) Proposals shall be solicited from an adequate number of qualified sources to permit reasonable competition consistent with the nature and requirements of the procurement. The Request for Proposal shall be publicized and reasonable requests by other sources to compete shall be honored to the maximum extent practicable.</P>
                <P>(ii) The Request for Proposal shall identify all significant evaluation factors, including price or cost where required, and their relative importance.</P>
                <P>(iii) The owner shall provide mechanisms for technical evaluation of the proposals received, determination of responsible offerors for the purpose of written or oral discussions, and selection for contract award.</P>
                <P>(iv) Award may be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal will be most advantageous to the owner, price and other factors considered. Unsuccessful offerors should be promptly notified.</P>
                <P>(v) Owners may utilize competitive negotiation procedures for procurement of architectural/engineering and other professional services, whereby competitors' qualifications are evaluated and the most qualified competitor is selected, subject to negotiations of fair and reasonable compensation.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Noncompetitive negotiation.</E> Noncompetitive negotiation is procurement through solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or after solicitation of a number of sources competition is determined inadequate. Noncompetitive negotiation may be used when the award of a contract is not feasible under small purchase, competitive sealed bids (formal advertising) or competitive negotiation procedures. Circumstances under which a contract may be awarded by noncompetitive negotiations are limited to the following:</P>
                <P>(i) The item is available only from a single source; or</P>
                <P>(ii) There exists a public exigency or emergency and the urgency for the requirement will not permit a delay incident to competitive solicitation; or</P>
                <P>(iii) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate; or</P>
                <P>(iv) No acceptable bids have been received after formal advertising; or</P>
                <P>(v) The procurement of architectural/engineering and other professional services.</P>
                <P>(vi) The aggregate amount does not exceed $50,000.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Additional procurement methods.</E> Additional innovative procurement methods may be used by the owner with prior written approval of the Rural Development National Office.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Alternate contracting methods.</E> The services of the consulting engineer or architect and the general construction contractor shall normally be procured from unrelated sources in accordance with paragraph (j)(7) of this section. Alternate contracting methods which combine or rearrange design, inspection or construction services (such as <PRTPAGE P="85"/>design/build or construction management/constructor) may be used with Rural Development written approval.</P>
                <P>(1) The owner will request Rural Development approval by providing the following information to the State Office for review and approval by the State Architect:</P>
                <P>(i) The owner's written request to use an unconventional contracting method with a description of the proposed method.</P>
                <P>(ii) A proposed scope of work describing in clear, concise terms the technical requirements for the contract. This would include a nontechnical statement summarizing the work to be performed by the contractor, the expected results, the sequence in which the work is to be performed, and a proposed construction schedule.</P>
                <P>(iii) A proposed firm-fixed-price contract for the entire project which provides that the contractor shall be responsible for any extra cost which may result from errors or omissions in the services provided under the contract and compliance with all Federal, State, and local requirements effective on the contract execution date.</P>
                <P>(iv) An evaluation of the contractor's performance on previous similar projects in which the contractor acted in a similar capacity.</P>
                <P>(v) A detailed listing and cost estimate of equipment and supplies not included in the construction contract but which are necessary to properly operate the facility.</P>
                <P>(vi) Evidence that a qualified construction inspector who is independent of the contractor has or will be hired.</P>
                <P>(vii) Preliminary plans and outline specifications. However, final plans and specifications must be completed and reviewed by Rural Development prior to the start of construction.</P>
                <P>(viii) The owner's attorney's opinion and comments regarding the legal adequacy of the proposed contract documents and evidence that the owner has the legal authority to enter into and fulfill the contract.</P>
                <P>(2) The State Office may approve design/build or construction management/constructor projects if the contract amount is equal to or less than $250,000.</P>
                <P>(3) If the contract amount exceeds $250,000, National Office prior concurrence must be obtained in accordance with § 1942.9(b) of this subpart. Additional information, such as plans and specifications, may be requested by the National Office.</P>
                <P>(4) The Design/Build method of construction is one in which the architectural and engineering services, normally provided by an independent consultant to the owner, are combined with those of the General Contractor under a single source contract. These services are commonly provided by a Design/Build firm, a joint venture between an architectural firm and a construction firm, or a company providing pre-engineered buildings and design services.</P>
                <P>(5) The Construction Management/constructor (CMc), acts in the capacity of a General Contractor and is actually responsible for the construction. This type of construction management is also referred to as Construction Manager “At Risk.” The construction contract is between the owner and the CMc. The CMc, in turn, may subcontract for some or all of the work.</P>
                <P>(6) The National Office may approve other alternative contact methods, such as Construction Management/advisor (CMa), with a recommendation from the State Office. The recommendation shall indicate the circumstances which prove this method advantageous to the applicant and the Government. A CMa acts in an advisory capacity to the owner, and the actual contract for construction is between the owner and a prime contractor or multiple prime contractors. When a contract for an architect and a CMa are being provided, it is important to make sure that separate professionals are not being paid to provide similar services. Further, paragraph (e)(3) of this section discourages separate contracts for construction.</P>

                <P>(7) All alternate contracting method projects must comply with the requirements for “maximum open and free competition” in paragraph (j)(2) of this section. Choosing an alternate contracting method is not a way to avoid competition. Further information on procurement methods, which must be <PRTPAGE P="86"/>followed, is provided in paragraph (k) of this section.</P>
                <P>(m) <E T="03">Contracts awarded prior to preapplications.</E> Owners awarding construction or other procurement contracts prior to filing a pre-application with Rural Development must comply with the following:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Evidence.</E> Provide conclusive evidence that the contract was entered into without intent to circumvent the requirements of Rural Development regulations. The evidence will consist of at least the following:</P>
                <P>(i) The lapse of a reasonable period of time between the date of contract award and the date of filing the preapplication which clearly indicates an irreconcilable failure of previous financial arrangements; or</P>
                <P>(ii) A written statement explaining initial plans for financing the project and reasons for failure to obtain the planned credit.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Modifications.</E> Modify the outstanding contract to conform with the provisions of this subpart. Where this is not possible, modifications will be made to the extent practicable and, as a minimum, the contract must comply with all State and local laws and regulations as well as statutory requirements and executive orders related to the Rural Development financing. When all construction is complete and it is impracticable to modify the contracts, the owner must provide the certification required by paragraph (m)(4) of this section.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Consultant's certification.</E> Provide a certification by an engineer or architect that any construction performed complies fully with the plans and specifications.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Owner's certification.</E> Provide a certification by the owner that the contractor has complied with all statutory and executive requirements related to Rural Development financing for construction already performed even though the requirements may not have been included in the contract documents.</P>
                <P>(n) <E T="03">Contract provisions.</E> In addition to provisions defining a sound and complete contract, any recipient of Rural Development funds shall include the following contract provisions or conditions in all contracts:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Remedies.</E> Contracts other than small purchases shall contain provisions or conditions which will allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate. A realistic liquidated damage provision should also be included.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Termination.</E> All contracts exceeding $10,000, shall contain provisions for termination by the owner including the manner by which it will be affected and the basis for settlement. In addition, such contracts shall describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions when the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Surety.</E> In all contracts for construction or facility improvements awarded exceeding $100,000, the owner shall require bonds, a bank letter of credit or cash deposit in escrow assuring performance and payment, each in the amount of 100 percent of the contract cost. The surety will normally be in the form of performance bonds and payment bonds; however, when other methods of surety may be necessary, bid documents must contain provisions for such alternative types of surety. The use of surety other than performance bonds and payment bonds requires concurrence by the National Office after submission of a justification by the State Director together with the proposed form of escrow agreement or letter of credit. For contracts of lesser amounts, the owner may require surety. When a surety is not provided, contractors will furnish evidence of payment in full for all materials, labor, and any other items procured under the contract. Form RD 1924-10, “Release by Claimants,” and Form RD 1924-9, “Certificate of Contractor's Release,” may be obtained at the local Rural Development office and used for this purpose. The United States, acting through Rural Development, will be named as co-obligee on all surety unless prohibited by State law. Companies providing performance bonds and payment bonds must hold a certificate of authority as an acceptable surety on <PRTPAGE P="87"/>Federal bonds as listed in Treasury Circular 570 as amended and be legally doing business in the State where the facility is located.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Equal Employment Opportunity.</E> All contracts awarded in excess of $10,000 by owners shall contain a provision requiring compliance with Executive Order 11246, entitled, “Equal Employment Opportunity,” as amended by Executive Order 11375, and as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations 41 CFR part 60.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Anti-kickback.</E> All contracts for construction shall include a provision for compliance with the Copeland “Anti-Kickback” Act (18 U.S.C. 874). This Act provides that each contractor shall be prohibited from inducing, by any means, any person employed in the construction, completion, or repair of public work, to give up any part of the compensation to which they are otherwise entitled. The owner shall report all suspected or reported violations to Rural Development.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Records.</E> All negotiated contracts (except those of $2,500 or less) awarded by owners shall include a provision to the effect that the owner, Rural Development, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers, and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to a specific Federal loan program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts, and transcriptions. Owners shall require contractors to maintain all required records for three years after owners make final payments and all other pending matters are closed.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">State Energy Conservation Plan.</E> Contracts shall recognize mandatory standards and policies relating to energy efficiency which are contained in the State energy conservation plan issued in compliance with the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (Pub. L. 94-163).</P>
                <P>(8) <E T="03">Change orders.</E> The construction contract shall require that all contract change orders be approved in writing by Rural Development.</P>
                <P>(9) <E T="03">Rural Development concurrence.</E> All contracts must contain a provision that they shall not be effective unless and until the Rural Development State Director or designee concurs in writing.</P>
                <P>(10) <E T="03">Retainage.</E> All construction contracts shall contain adequate provisions for retainage. No payments will be made that would deplete the retainage nor place in escrow any funds that are required for retainage nor invest the retainage for the benefit of the contractor. The retainage shall not be less than an amount equal to 10 percent of an approved partial payment estimate until 50 percent of the work has been completed. If the job is proceeding satisfactory at 50 percent completion, further partial payments may be made in full, however, previously retained amounts shall not be paid until construction is substantially complete. Additional amounts may be retained if the job is not proceeding satisfactorily, but in no event shall the total retainage be more than 10 percent of the value of the work completed.</P>
                <P>(11) <E T="03">Other compliance requirements.</E> Contracts in excess of $100,000 shall contain a provision which requires compliance with all applicable standards, orders, or requirements issued under section 306 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 1857(h)), section 508 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1368), Executive Order 11738, and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations 40 CFR part 15, which prohibit the use under non-exempt Federal contracts, grants or loans of facilities included on the EPA List of Violating Facilities. The provision shall require reporting of violations to Rural Development and to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Assistant Administrator for Enforcement. Solicitations and contract provisions shall include the requirements of 40 CFR part 15.4(c) as set forth in guide 18 of this subpart which is available in all Rural Development offices.</P>
                <P>(o) <E T="03">Contract administration.</E> Owners shall be responsible for maintaining a contract administration system to monitor the contractors' performance and compliance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of the contracts.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Preconstruction conference.</E> Prior to beginning construction, the owner will schedule a preconstruction conference where Rural Development will review <PRTPAGE P="88"/>the planned development with the owner, its architect or engineer, resident inspector, attorney, contractor(s), and other interested parties. The conference will thoroughly cover applicable items included in Form RD 1924-16, “Record of Preconstruction Conference,” and the discussion and agreements will be documented. Form RD 1924-16 may be used for this purpose.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Monitoring reports.</E> Each owner will be required to monitor and provide reports to Rural Development on actual performance during construction for each project financed, or to be financed, in whole or in part with Rural Development funds to include:</P>
                <P>(i) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the construction schedule established for the period. The partial payment estimate may be used for this purpose.</P>
                <P>(ii) A narrative statement giving full explanation of the following:</P>

                <P>(iii) If events occur between reports which have a significant impact upon the project, the owner will notify Rural Development as soon as any of the following conditions are met:</P>
                <P>(A) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially affect the ability to attain program objectives or prevent the meeting of project work units by established time periods. This disclosure shall be accompanied by a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any Federal assistance needed to resolve the situation.</P>
                <P>(B) Favorable developments or events which enable meeting time schedules and goals sooner than anticipated or producing more work units than originally projected or which will result in cost underruns or lower unit costs than originally planned and which may result in less Rural Development assistance.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Inspection.</E> Full-time resident inspection is required for all construction unless a written exception is made by Rural Development upon written request of the owner. Unless otherwise agreed, the resident inspector will be provided by the consulting architect/engineer. Prior to the preconstruction conference, the architect/engineer will submit a resume of qualifications of the resident inspector to the owner and to Rural Development for acceptance in writing. If the owner provides the resident inspector, it must submit a resume of the inspector's qualifications to the project architect/engineer and Rural Development for acceptance in writing prior to the preconstruction conference. The resident inspector will work under the general supervision of the project architect/engineer. A guide format for preparing daily inspection reports (Guide 11 of this subpart) and Form RD 1924-18, “Partial Payment Estimate,” are available on request from Rural Development.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Inspector's daily diary.</E> The resident inspector will maintain a record of the daily construction progress in the form of a daily diary and daily inspection reports as follows:</P>

                <P>(ii) All entries shall be legible and shall be made in ink.</P>
                <P>(iii) Daily entries shall include but not be limited to the date, weather conditions, number and classification of personnel working on the site, equipment being used to perform the work, persons visiting the site, accounts of substantive discussions, instructions given to the contractors, directions received, all significant or unusual happenings involving the work, any delays, and daily work accomplished.</P>
                <P>(iv) The daily entries shall be made available to Rural Development personnel and will be reviewed during project inspections.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Prefinal inspections.</E> A prefinal inspection will be made by the owner, resident inspector, project architect or engineer, representatives of other agencies involved, the District Director and a Rural Development State Office staff representative, preferably the State Staff architect or engineer. Prefinal inspections may be made without Rural Development State Office staff participation if the State Director or a designee determines that <PRTPAGE P="89"/>the facility does not utilize complicated construction techniques, materials or equipment for facilities such as small fire stations, storage buildings or minor utility extensions, and that an experienced District Office staff representative will be present. The inspection results will be recorded on Form RD 1924-12, “Inspection Report,” and a copy provided to all appropriate parties.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Final inspection.</E> A final inspection will be made by Rural Development before final payment is made.</P>

                <P>(A) Funds are available to cover any additional costs; and</P>
                <P>(B) The change is for an authorized loan purpose; and</P>
                <P>(C) It will not adversely affect the soundness of the facility operation or Rural Development's security; and</P>
                <P>(D) The change is within the scope of the contract.</P>
                <P>(ii) Changes will be recorded on Form RD 1924-7, “Contract Change Order,” or, other similar forms may be used with the prior approval of the State Director or designee. Regardless of the form, change orders must be approved by the Rural Development State Director or a designated representative.</P>
                <P>(iii) Changes should be accomplished only after Rural Development approval on all changes which affect the work and shall be authorized only by means of contract change order. The change order will include items such as:</P>
                <P>(A) Any changes in labor and material and their respective cost.</P>
                <P>(B) Changes in facility design.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 1942.19</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Information pertaining to preparation of notes or bonds and bond transcript documents for public body applicants.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This section includes information for use by public body applicants in the preparation and issuance of evidence of debt (bonds, notes, or debt instruments, herein referred to as bonds). This section is made available to applicants as appropriate for application processing and loan docket preparation.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Policies related to use of bond counsel.</E> Preparation of the bonds and the bond transcript documents will be the responsibility of the applicant. Public body applicants will obtain the services and opinion of recognized bond counsel with respect to the validity of a bond issue, except as provided in (b) (1) through (3) below. The applicant normally will be represented by a local attorney who will obtain the assistance of a recognized bond counsel firm which has experience in municipal financing with such investors as investment dealers, banks, and insurance companies.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Issues of $250,000 or less.</E> At the option of the applicant for issues of $250,000 or less, bond counsel may be used for the issuance of a final opinion only and not for the preparation of the bond transcript and other documents when the applicant, Rural Development, and bond counsel have agreed in advance as to the method of preparation of the bond transcript documents. Under such circumstances the applicant will be responsible for the preparation of the bond transcript documents.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Issues of $50,000 or less.</E> At the option of the applicant and with the prior approval of the Rural Development State Director, the applicant need not use bond counsel if:<PRTPAGE P="90"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) The amount of the issue does not exceed $50,000 and the applicant recognizes and accepts the fact that processing the application may require additional legal and administrative time.</P>
                <P>(ii) There is a significant cost saving to the applicant particularly with reference to total legal fees after determining what bond counsel would charge as compared with what the local attorney will charge without bond counsel.</P>
                <P>(iii) The local attorney is able and experienced in handling this type of legal work.</P>
                <P>(iv) The applicant understands that, if it is required by Rural Development to refinance its loan pursuant to the statutory refinancing requirements, it will probably have to obtain at its expense a bond counsel's opinion at that time.</P>
                <P>(v) All bonds will be prepared in accordance with this regulation and will conform as nearly as possible to the preferred methods of preparation stated in paragraph (e) of this section but still be consistent with State law.</P>
                <P>(vi) Many matters necessary to comply with Rural Development requirements such as land rights, easements, and organizational documents will be handled by the applicant's local attorney. Specific closing instructions will be issued by the Office of the General Counsel of the U.S. Department of Agriculture for the guidance of Rural Development.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">For loans of less than $500,000.</E> The applicant shall not be required to use bond counsel in a straight mortgage-note situation where competitive bidding is not required for the sale of the debt instrument, unless a complicated financial situation exists with the applicant. In addition, if there is a known backlog in a particular OGC regional office the applicant will be advised of such backlog and it will be suggested to the applicant that the appointment of bond counsel may be more expeditious. However, it will be the decision of the applicant whether or not to appoint bond counsel. The applicant must comply with (b)(2) (iii) through (vi) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Bond transcript documents.</E> Any questions with respect to Rural Development requirements should be discussed with the Rural Development representatives. The bond counsel (or local counsel where no bond counsel is involved) is required to furnish at least two complete sets of the following to the applicant, who will furnish one complete set to Rural Development:</P>
                <P>(1) Copies of all organizational documents.</P>
                <P>(2) Copies of general incumbency certificate.</P>
                <P>(3) Certified copies of minutes or excerpts therefrom of all meetings of the applicant's governing body at which action was taken in connection with the authorization and issuance of the bonds.</P>
                <P>(4) Certified copies of documents evidencing that the applicant has complied fully with all statutory requirements incident to calling and holding of a favorable bond election, if such an election is necessary in connection with bond issuance.</P>
                <P>(5) Certified copies of the resolution or ordinances or other documents, such as the bond authorizing resolutions or ordinance and any resolution establishing rates and regulating the use of the improvement, if such documents are not included in the minutes furnished.</P>
                <P>(6) Copies of official Notice of Sale and affidavit of publication of Notice of Sale where a public sale is required by State statute.</P>
                <P>(7) Specimen bond, with any attached coupons.</P>
                <P>(8) Attorney's no-litigation certificate.</P>
                <P>(9) Certified copies of resolutions or other documents pertaining to the bond award.</P>
                <P>(10) Any additional or supporting documents required by bond counsel.</P>

                <P>(11) For loans involving multiple advances of Rural Development loan funds a preliminary approving opinion of bond counsel (or local counsel if no bond counsel is involved) if a final unqualified opinion cannot be obtained until all funds are advanced. The preliminary opinion for the entire issue shall be delivered on or before the first advance of loan funds and state that the applicant has the legal authority to issue the bonds, construct, operate and maintain the facility, and repay the loan subject only to changes during <PRTPAGE P="91"/>the advance of funds such as litigation resulting from the failure to advance loan funds, and receipt of closing certrificates.</P>
                <P>(12) Preliminary approving opinion, if any, and final unqualified approving opinion of recognized bond counsel (or local counsel if no bond counsel is involved) including opinion regarding interest on bonds being exempt from Federal and any State income taxes. On approval of the Administrator, a final opinion may be qualified to the extent that litigation is pending relating to Indian claims that may affect title to land or validity of the obligation. It is permissible for such opinions to contain language referring to the last sentence of section 306(a)(1) or to section 309A(h) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act [7 U.S.C. 1926(a)(1) or 1929a(h)], and providing that if the bonds evidencing the indebtedness in question are required by the Federal Government and sold on an insured basis from the Agriculture Credit Insurance Fund, or the Rural Development Insurance Fund, the interest on such bonds will be included in gross income for the purpose of the Federal income tax statutes.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Interim financing from commercial sources during construction period for loans of $50,000 or more.</E> In all cases where it is possible for funds to be borrowed at current market interest rates on an interim basis from commercial sources, such interim financing will be obtained so as to preclude the necessity for multiple advances of Rural Development funds.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Permanent instruments for Rural Development loans to repay interim commercial financing.</E> Rural Development loans will be evidenced by the following types of instruments chosen in accordance with the following order of preference:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">First preference—Form RD 440-22, “Promissory Note (Association or Organization)”.</E> If legally permissible use Form RD 440-22 for insured loans.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Second preference—single instruments with amortized installments.</E> If Form RD 440.22 is not legally permissible, use a single instrument providing for amortized installments. Show the full amount of the loan on the face of the document and provide for entering the date and amount of each Rural Development advance on the reverse thereof or on an attachment to the instrument. Form RD 440-22 should be followed to the extent possible. When principal payment is deferred, no attempt should be made to compute in dollar terms the amount of interest due on these installment dates. Rather the instrument should provide that “interest only” is due on these dates. The appropriate amortized installment computed as follows will be shown due on the installment date thereafter.</P>
                <P>(i) Annual payments—Subtract the due date of the <E T="03">last annual interest only</E> installment from the due date of the final installment to determine the number of annual payments applicable. When there are no interest only installments, the number of annual payments will equal the number of years over which the loan is amortized. Then multiply the amount of the note by the applicable amortization factor shown in Rural Development Amortization Tables and round to the next higher dollar.

                <P>(iii) Monthly payments—Multiply by twelve the number of years between the due date of the <E T="03">last annual interest only</E> installment and the final installment to determine the number of monthly payments applicable.

                <P>(3) <E T="03">Third preference—single instrument with installments of principal plus interest.</E> If a single instrument with amortized installments is not legally permissible, use a single instrument providing for installments of principal plus interest accrued on the unmatured principal balance. The principal should be in an amount best adapted to making principal retirement and interest payments which closely approximate equal installments of combined interest and principal as required by the first two preferences.</P>
                <P>(i) The repayment terms concerning interest only installments described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, “Second perference” applies.</P>
                <P>(ii) The instrument shall contain in substance the following provisions:</P>
                <P>(A) A statement of principal maturities and due dates.</P>
                <P>(B) Payments made on indebtedness evidenced by this instrument shall be applied to the interest due through the next installment due date and the balance to principal in accordance with the terms of the bond. Payments on delinquent accounts will be applied in the following sequence:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Billed delinquent interest,</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Past due interest installments,</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Past due principal installments,</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Interest installment due, and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Principal installment due.</P>
                <FP>Extra payments and payments made from security depleting sources shall be applied to the principal last to come due or as specified in the bond instrument.</FP>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Fourth preference—serial bonds with installments of principal plus interest.</E> If instruments described under the first, second, and third preferences are not legally permissible, <E T="03">use serial bonds with a bond or bonds delivered in the amount of each advance. Bonds will be delivered in the order of their numbers.</E> Such bonds will conform with the minimum requirements of paragraph (h) of this section. Rules for application of payments on serial bonds will be the same as those for principal installment single bonds as set out in the preceding paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Multiple advances of Rural Development funds using permanent instruments.</E> Where interim financing from commercial sources is not available, Rural Development loan proceeds will be disbursed on an “as needed by borrower” basis in amounts not to exceed the amount needed during 30-day periods.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Multiple advances of Rural Development funds using temporary debt instrument.</E> When none of the instruments described in paragraph (e) of this section are legally permissible or practical, a bond anticipation note or similar temporary debt instrument may be used. The debt instrument will provide for multiple advance of Rural Development loan funds and will be for the full amount of the Rural Development loan. The instrument will be prepared by bond counsel (or local counsel if bond counsel is not involved) and approved by the State Director and OGC. At the same time Rural Development delivers the last advance, the borrower <PRTPAGE P="93"/>will deliver the permanent bond instrument and the canceled temporary instrument will be returned to the borrower. The approved debt instrument will show at least the following:</P>
                <P>(1) The date from which each advance will bear interest.</P>
                <P>(2) The interest rate.</P>
                <P>(3) A payment schedule providing for interest on outstanding principal at least annually.</P>
                <P>(4) A maturity date which shall be no earlier than the anticipated issuance date of the permanent instrument(s).</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Minimum bond specifications.</E> The provisions of this paragraph are minimum specifications only, and must be followed to the extent legally permissible.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Type and denominations.</E> Bond resolutions or ordinances will provide that the instrument(s) be either a bond representing the total amount of the indebtedness or serial bonds in denominations customarily accepted in municipal financing (ordinarily in multiples of not less than $1000). Single bonds may provide for repayment of principal plus interest or amortized installments; amortized installments are preferable from the standpoint of Rural Development. Coupon bonds will not be used unless required by State statute.</P>
                <P>(i) To compute the value of each coupon when the bond denomination is consistent:</P>
                <P>(A) Multiply the amount of the loan or advance by the interest rate and divide the product by 365 days.</P>
                <P>(B) Multiply the daily accrual factor determined in (A) by the number of days from the date of advance or last installment date to the next installment date.</P>
                <P>(C) Divide the interest computed in (B) by the number of bonds securing the advance; this is the individual coupon amount.</P>
                <P>(ii) to compute the value of each coupon when the bond denomination varies:</P>
                <P>(A) Multiply the denomination of the bond by the interest rate and divide the product by 365 days.</P>
                <P>(B) Multiply the daily accrual factor determined in (A) by the number of days from the date of advance or last installment date to the next installment due date; this is the individual coupon amount.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Bond registration.</E> Bonds will contain provisions permitting registration as to both principal and interest. Bonds purchased by Rural Development will be registered in the name of “United States of America, Rural Development,” and will remain so registered at all times while the bonds are held or insured by the United States. The address of Rural Development for registration purposes will be that of the appropriate Rural Development State Office.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Size and quality.</E> Size of bonds and coupons should conform to standard practice. Paper must be of sufficient quality to prevent deterioration through ordinary handling over the life of the loan.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Date of bond.</E> Bonds will preferably be dated as of the day of delivery, however, may be dated another date at the option of the borrower and subject to approval by Rural Development. If the date of delivery is other than the date of the bond, the date of delivery will be stated in the bond. In all cases, interest will accrue from the date of delivery of the funds.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Payment date.</E> Loan payments will be scheduled to coincide with income availability and be in accordance with State law. If consistent with the foregoing, monthly payments will be required and will be enumerated in the bond, other evidence of indebtedness, or other supplemental agreement. However, if State law only permits principal plus interest (P&amp;I) type bonds, annual or semiannual P&amp;I bonds will be used. Insofar as practical monthly payments will be scheduled one full month following the date of loan closing; or semiannual or annual payments will be scheduled six or twelve full months, respectively, following the date of loan closing or any deferment period. Due dates falling on the 29th, 30th or 31st day of the month will be avoided.</P>
                <P>(6) [Reserved]</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Redemptions.</E> Bonds should contain customary redemption provisions, subject, however, to unlimited right of redemption without premium of any <PRTPAGE P="94"/>bonds held by Rural Development except to the extent limited by the provisions under the “Third Preference” and “Fourth Preference” in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(8) <E T="03">Additional revenue bonds.</E> Parity bonds may be issued to complete the project. Otherwise, parity bonds may not be issued unless the net revenues (that is, unless otherwise defined by the State statute, gross revenues less essential operation and maintenance expense) for the fiscal year preceding the year in which such parity bonds are to be issued, were 120 percent of the average annual debt service requirements on all bonds then outstanding and those to be issued; provided, that this limitation may be waived or modified by the written consent of bondholders representing 75 percent of the then outstanding principal indebtedness. Junior and subordinate bonds may be issued in accordance with the loan agreement.</P>
                <P>(9) <E T="03">Scheduling of Rural Development payments when joint financing is involved.</E> In all cases in which Rural Development is participating with another lender in the joint financing of the project to supply funds required by one applicant, the Rural Development payments of principal and interest should approximate amortized installments.</P>
                <P>(10) <E T="03">Precautions.</E> The following types of provisions in debt instruments should be avoided.</P>
                <P>(i) Provisions for the holder to manually post each payment to the instrument.</P>
                <P>(ii) Provisions for returning the permanent or temporary debt instrument to the borrower in order that it, rather than Rural Development, may post the date and amount of each advance or repayment on the instrument.</P>
                <P>(iii) Defeasance provisions in loan or bond resolutions. When a bond issue is defeased, a new issue is sold which supersedes the contractual provisions of the prior issue, including the refinancing requirement and any lien on revenues. Since defeasance in effect precludes Rural Development from requiring graduation before the final maturity date, it represents a violation of the statutory refinancing requirement, therefore it is disallowed.</P>
                <P>(iv) Provisions that amend convenants contained in Forms RD 1942-47, “Loan Resolution (Public Bodies),” or FmHA 1942-9, “Loan Resolution Security Agreement.”</P>
                <P>(11) <E T="03">Multiple Loan Instruments.</E> The following will be adhered to when preparing debt instruments:</P>
                <P>(i) When more than one loan type is used in financing a project, each type of loan will be evidenced by a separate debt instrument or series of debt instruments.</P>
                <P>(ii) Loan funds obligated in different fiscal years and those obligated with different interest rates or terms in the same fiscal year will be evidenced by separate debt instruments.</P>
                <P>(iii) Loan funds obligated for the same loan type in the same fiscal year at the same interest rate and term may be combined in the same debt instrument; provided the borrower has been notified on Form RD 1940-1, “Request for Obligation of Funds”, of the action.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Bidding by Rural Development.</E> Bonds offered for public sale shall be offered in accordance with State law, in such a manner to encourage public bidding. Rural Development will not submit a bid at the advertised sale unless required by State law, nor will reference to Rural Development's rates and terms be included. If no acceptable bid is received, Rural Development will negotiate the purchase of the bonds.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Prospective applicants should request assistance by filing SF 424.2, “Application for Federal Assistance (For Construction),” with the Local or Area Rural Development Office. When practical, approval officials should meet with prospective applicants before an application is filed to discuss eligibility and Rural Development requirements and processing procedures. Throughout loan processing, Rural Development should confer with applicant officials as needed to ensure that applicant officials understand the current status of the processing of their application, what steps and determinations are necessary, and what is required from them. Rural Development should assist the applicant as needed and generally try to develop and maintain a cooperative working relationship with the applicant.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Unfavorable decision.</E> If, at any time prior to loan approval, it is decided that favorable action will not be taken on an application, the approval official will notify the applicant, in writing, of the reasons why the request was not favorably considered. The notification to the applicant will state that a review of this decision by Rural Development may be requested by the applicant in accordance with subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter. The following statement will also be made on all notifications of adverse action:

                <P>(ii) The purchase of existing facilities when it is necessary either to improve or to prevent a loss of service.</P>
                <P>(iii) The construction or development of an essential community facility requisite to the beneficial and orderly development of a community operated on a nonprofit basis in accordance with § 1942.17(d) of this subpart. This subpart includes those projects meeting the definition of a small community facility project.</P>
                <P>(2) To pay the following expenses, but only when such expenses are a necessary part of a loan to finance facilities authorized in paragraph (a)(1) of this section:</P>
                <P>(i) Reasonable fees and costs such as legal, engineering, architectural, fiscal advisory, recording, environmental impact analyses, archaeological surveys and possible salvage or other mitigation measures, planning, establishing or acquiring rights.</P>
                <P>(ii) Interest on loans until the facility is self-supporting but not for more than 3 years unless a longer period is approved by the National Office; interest on loans secured by general obligation bonds until tax revenues are available for payment, but not for more than 2 years unless a longer period is approved by the National Office; and interest on interim financing, including interest charges on interim financing from sources other than RD.</P>
                <P>(iii) Costs of acquiring interest in land, rights such as water rights, leases, permits, rights-of-way, and other evidence of land or water control necessary for development of the facility.</P>
                <P>(iv) Purchasing or renting equipment necessary to install, maintain, extend, protect, operate, or utilize facilities.</P>
                <P>(v) Initial operating expenses for a period ordinarily not exceeding 1 year when the borrower is unable to pay such expenses.</P>
                <P>(vi) Refinancing debts incurred by, or on behalf of, a community when all of the following conditions exist:</P>
                <P>(A) The debts being refinanced are a secondary part of the total loan;</P>
                <P>(B) The debts are incurred for the facility or service being financed or any part thereof; and</P>

                <P>(C) Arrangements cannot be made with the creditors to extend or modify <PRTPAGE P="102"/>the terms of the debts so that a sound basis will exist for making a loan.</P>
                <P>(3) To pay obligations for construction or procurement incurred before loan approval. Construction work or procurement actions should not be started and obligations for such work or materials should not be incurred before the loan is approved. However, if there are compelling reasons for proceeding with construction or procurement before loan approval, applicants may request Agency approval to pay such obligations. Such requests may be approved if RD determines that:</P>
                <P>(i) Compelling reasons exist for incurring obligations before loan approval; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The obligations will be incurred for authorized loan purposes; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Contract documents have been approved by RD; and</P>
                <P>(iv) All environmental requirements applicable to RD and the applicant have been met; and</P>
                <P>(v) The applicant has the legal authority to incur the obligations at the time proposed, and payment of the debts will remove any basis for any mechanic, material or other liens that may attach to the security property. RD may authorize payment of such obligations at the time of loan closing. RD's authorization to pay such obligations, however, is on the condition that it is not committed to make the loan; it assumes no responsibility for any obligations incurred by the applicant; and the applicant must subsequently meet all loan approval requirements. The applicant's request and Agency authorization for paying such obligations shall be in writing. If construction or procurement is started without Agency approval, post approval in accordance with this section may be considered.</P>
                <P>(b) Funds may not be used to finance:</P>
                <P>(1) Facilities which are not modest in size, design, and cost.</P>
                <P>(2) Loan finder's fees.</P>

Upon receipt of closing instructions, the District Director will discuss with the applicant and its architect or engineer, attorney, and other appropriate representatives, the requirements contained therein and any actions necessary to proceed with closing.</P>
                <P>(2) Loans will be closed in accordance with the closing instructions issued by OGC and § 1942.19 of subpart A of this part 1942.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Organizations other than public bodies and Indian tribes.</E> District Directors are authorized to close loans to organizations other than public bodies and Indian tribes without closing instructions from OGC. State Directors, in consultation with OGC, should develop standard closing procedures and forms as needed. Assistance with loan closing and a certification regarding the validity of the note and mortgage or other debt instruments should be provided by the applicant's attorney. Appropriate title opinion or title insurance is required as provided in § 1942.17 (j)(4)(i)(B) of subpart A of this part 1942.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Authority to execute, file, and record legal instruments.</E> District Office employees are authorized to execute and file or record any legal instruments necessary to obtain or preserve security for loans. This includes, as appropriate, mortgages and other lien instruments, as well as affidavits, acknowledgements, and other certificates.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Mortgages.</E> Unless otherwise required by State law or unless an exception is approved by the State Director with advice of the OGC, only one mortgage will be taken even though the indebtedness is to be evidenced by more than one instrument. The real estate or chattel mortgages or security instruments will be delivered to the recording office for recordation or filing, as appropriate. A copy of such instruments will be delivered to the borrower. The original instrument, if returnable after recording or filing, will <PRTPAGE P="105"/>be retained in the borrower's case folder.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Notes and bonds.</E> When the debt instrument is a note or single instrument bond fully registered as to principal and interest a conformed copy will be sent to the Finance Office immediately after loan closing and the original instrument will be stored in the District Office.

                <P>(h) <E T="03">Multiple advances.</E> When temporary paper, such as bond anticipation notes or interim receipts, is used to conform with the multiple advance requirement, the original temporary paper will be forwarded to the Finance Office after each advance is made to the borrower. The borrower's case number will be entered in the upper right-hand corner of such paper by the Distict Office. The permanent debt instrument(s) should be forwarded to the Finance Office as soon as possible after the last advance is made, except that for notes and single instrument bonds fully registered as to principal and interest the original will be retained in the District Office and a copy will be forwarded to the Finance Office. The following actions will be taken prior to issuance of the permanent instruments:</P>
                <P>(1) The Finance Office will be notified of the anticipated date for the retirement of the interim instruments and the issuance of permanent instruments of debt.</P>
                <P>(2) The Office of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer will prepare a statement of account including accrued interest through the proposed date of retirement and also show the daily interest accrual. The statement of account and the interim financing instruments will be forwarded to the Rural Development Manager.</P>
                <P>(3) The Rural Development Manager will collect interest through the actual date of the retirement and obtain the permanent instrument(s) of debt in exchange for the interim financing instruments. The permanent instruments and the cash collection will be forwarded to the Office of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer immediately, except that for notes and single instrument bonds fully registered as to principal and interest the original will be retained in the Area Office and a copy will be forwarded to the Office of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer. In developing the permanent instruments, the sequence of preference set out § 1942.19(e) of Subpart A of Part 1942 of this chapter will be followed.</P>

The State Director will review the documents and the Rural Development Manager's statement to determine whether the transaction was closed properly. For loans to public bodies or Indian tribes the State Director will forward all documents, along with a statement that all administrative requirements have been met, to the Regional Attorney. The Regional Attorney will review the submitted material to determine whether all legal requirements have been met. The Regional Attorney should review Rural Development standard forms only for proper execution, unless the State Director brings attention to specific questions. Facility development should not be <PRTPAGE P="106"/>held up pending receipt of the Regional Attorney opinion. When the review of the State Director has been completed, and for public bodies and Indian tribes the Regional Attorney's opinion has been received, the State Director must advise the Rural Development Manager of any deficiencies that must be corrected and return all material that was submitted for review.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Planning, bidding, contracting, constructing, procuring.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This section provides procedures and requirements for planning, bidding, contracting, constructing and procuring facilities financed under this subpart. These procedures do not relieve the owner of contractual obligations that arise from procurement of services.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Technical services.</E> Owners are responsible for providing the engineering or architectural services necessary for planning, designing, bidding, contracting, inspecting and constructing their facilities. Services may be provided by the owner's “in-house” engineer or architect or through contract, subject to Agency concurrence. Architects and engineers must be licensed in the State where the facility is to be located.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Preliminary reports.</E> A preliminary architectural or engineering report conforming with customary professional standards is required for all construction, except that RD may waive the requirement for a preliminary architectural/engineering report or accept a brief report if the cost of the construction does not exceed $100,000. Guide 6 to subpart A of this part 1942 (available in any RD office) may be used.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Final reports.</E> Detailed final plans and specifications are required for all construction and must receive Agency concurrence. When negotiated procurement is used for construction costing not more than $100,000 the final plans and specifications may be provided by the contractor who submits the successful proposal. The plans and specifications must be prepared by or under the supervision of an architect or engineer who is licensed in the State where the facility is to be located and should include all materials and work to be provided under the contract. Some work and material may be omitted from the contract provided the owner furnishes detailed cost estimates for whatever is needed to fully complete the facility and will complete the facility in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and the small purchase procedures set out in § 1942.18(k)(1) of subpart A of this part 1942. In such cases, RD may determine that it is not necessary to require the applicant to hire a consulting architect/engineer; however, if a second contract that does not qualify for small purchase procedures is needed to complete the facility, the owner must provide for an architect/engineer to design the entire facility. When the contractor provides the plans and specifications, the contract will be considered a design/build procurement method under § 1942.18(1) of subpart A of this part 1942.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Major equipment.</E> An architect/engineer is not required for major equipment if RD determines the owner has the ability to develop an adequate request for proposal and evaluate the proposals received or can obtain adequate assistance from other sources, such as State or Federal agencies or trade associations.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Design policies.</E> Facilities financed by RD must be designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering and architectural practices, and must meet the requirements of Federal, State and local agencies. All facilities intended for or accessible to the public or in which physically handicapped persons may be employed or reside must be developed in compliance with the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (Pub. L. 90-480) as implemented by the General Services Administration regulations 41 CFR 101-19.6 and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-112) as implemented by 7 CFR parts 15 and 15b.<PRTPAGE P="107"/>
                </P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Construction contracts.</E> Contract documents must be sufficiently descriptive and legally binding to accomplish the work as economically and expeditiously as possible.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Standard construction contract documents.</E> When standard construction contract documents available from RD are used, or when the amount of the contract does not exceed $100,000, it will normally not be necessary for the Regional Attorney to perform a detailed legal review. If construction contract documents used are not in the format of guide forms approved by RD, and the contract amount exceeds $100,000, the Regonal Attorney must review the documents before their use.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Contract review and approval.</E> The owner's attorney will review executed contract documents, including performance and payment bonds, and certify that they are adequate, legal and binding, and that the persons executing the documents have been authorized to do so. The contract documents, bid bonds, and bid tabulation sheets will be forwarded to RD for approval prior to awarding. All contracts will contain a provision that they are not in full force and effect until they have been approved by RD. The Agency District Director is responsible for approving construction contracts with advice and guidance of the State Director and Regional Attorney when necessary.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Separate contracts.</E> Arrangements which split responsibility of contractors (separate contracts for labor and material, extensive subcontracting and multiplicity of small contracts on the same job) should be avoided whenever it is practical to do so. Contracts may be awarded to suppliers or manufacturers for furnishing and installing certain items which have been designed by the manufacturer and delivered to the job site in a finished or semifinished state such as prefabricated buildings. Contracts may also be awarded for material delivered to the job site and installed by a patented process or method.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Performing construction.</E> Owners are encouraged to accomplish construction through contracts with recognized contractors. Owners may accomplish construction by using their own personnel and equipment provided the owners possess the necessary skills, abilities and resources to perform the work and provided a licensed engineer or architect prepares design drawings and specifications and inspection is provided in accordance with paragraph (l)(3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Owner's contractual responsibility.</E> Loans under this subpart are subject to the provisions of § 1942.18(i) of subpart A of this part 1942.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Owner's procurement regulations.</E> Loans under this subpart are subject to the provisions of § 1942.18(j) of subpart A of this part 1942.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Procurement methods.</E> Unless the Agency National Office gives prior written approval of another method, procurement must be made by one of the following methods:</P>
                <P>(1) Small purchase procedures as provided in § 1942.18(k)(1) of subpart A of this part 1942.</P>
                <P>(2) Competitive sealed bids as provided in § 1942.18(k)(2) of subpart A of this part 1942. Competitive sealed bids is the preferred procurement method of construction projects, except for buildings costing $100,000 or less when the owner desires to use a “preengineered” or “packaged” building.</P>
                <P>(3) Competitive negotiation as provided in § 1942.18(k)(3) of subpart A of this part 1942. Competitive negotiation is the preferred procurement method of buildings not exceeding $100,000 in cost when the owner desires to use a “pre-engineered” or “packaged” building and for major equipment.</P>
                <P>(4) Noncompetitive negotiation as provided in § 1942.18(k)(4) of subpart A of this part 1942.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Contracting methods.</E> Loans under this subpart are subject to the provisions of § 1942.18(1) of subpart A of this part 1942.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Contracts awarded prior to preapplications.</E> Loans under this subpart are subject to the provisions of § 1942.18(m) of subpart A of this part 1942.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Construction contract provisions.</E> Construction contracts for loans under this subpart are subject to the provisions of § 1942.18(n) of subpart A of this part 1942. Construction contracts for loans under this subpart are also subject to the provisions of § 1901.205 of subpart E of part 1901 of this chapter, <PRTPAGE P="108"/>regarding nondiscrimination in construction, except that guides 18 and 17 or 19 to subpart A of this part 1942 of this chapter will normally be used instead of Form RD 1924-5, “Invitation for Bid (Construction Contract),” and Form RD 1924-6, “Construction Contract.” When guide 18 is used with a design/build type contract, section 4, “Conflict of Interest,” may need revision.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Construction contract administration.</E> Owners shall be responsible for maintaining a contract administration system to monitor the contractors' performance and compliance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of the contracts.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Preconstruction conference.</E> Prior to beginning construction the owner will schedule a preconstruction conference where RD will review the planned development with the owner, its architect or engineer, project inspector, attorney, contractor(s), and other interested parties. The conference will thoroughly cover applicable items included in Form RD 1924-16, “Record of Preconstruction Conference,” and the discussions and agreements will be documented. Form RD 1924-16 may be used for this purpose.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Monitoring reports.</E> Each owner will be required to monitor and provide reports to RD on actual performance during construction for each project financed, or to be financed, in whole or in part with Agency funds. The reports are to include:</P>
                <P>(i) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the construction schedule established for the period. The partial payment estimate may be used for this purpose.</P>
                <P>(ii) A narrative statement giving full explanation of the following:</P>
                <P>(A) Reasons why established goals were not met.</P>
                <P>(B) Analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs and how payment is to be made for the same.</P>
                <P>(iii) If events occur between reports which have a significant impact upon the project, the owner will notify RD as soon as any of the following conditions are known:</P>
                <P>(A) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially affect the ability to attain program objectives or prevent the meeting of project work units by established time periods. This disclosure shall be accompanied by a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any Federal assistance needed to resolve the situation.</P>
                <P>(B) Favorable developments or events which enable meeting time schedules and goals sooner than anticipated or producing more work units than originally projected or which will result in cost underruns or lower unit costs than originally planned and which may result in less Agency assistance.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Inspection.</E> The borrower must provide for inspection of all construction. When the borrower enters into an agreement for technical services with an engineer/architect, the agreement should provide for general engineering/architectural inspection of the construction work. When no such agreement exists, or RD or the borrower determines the inspection services of the engineer/architect may not be sufficient, the owner must provide a project inspector. Prior to the preconstruction conference, the borrower must submit a résumé of qualifications of the project inspector to RD for acceptance in writing. The project inspector will be responsible for making inspections necessary to protect the borrower's interest and for providing written inspection reports to the borrower with copies to the Agency District Director. Guide 11 of subpart A of this part 1942 (available in any Rural Development office) may be used as a guide format for inspection reports. For new buildings, additions to existing buildings, and rehabilitation of existing buildings, the project inspector should make inspections at the following stages of construction and at other stages of construction as determined by the District Director and the borrower. Inspections by RD are solely for its benefit as lender.</P>

                <P>(i) An initial inspection should be made just prior to or during the placement of concrete footings or monolithic footings and floor slabs. At this point, foundation excavations are complete, forms or trenches and steel are ready for concrete placement and the subsurface installation is roughed in. If the building design does not include concrete footings the initial inspection <PRTPAGE P="109"/>should be made just after or during the placement of poles or other foundation materials.</P>
                <P>(ii) An inspection should be made when the building is enclosed, structural members are still exposed, roughing in for heating, plumbing and electrical work is in place and visible, and wall insulation and vapor barriers are installed.</P>
                <P>(iii) A final inspection should be made when all development of the structure has been completed and the structrure is ready for its intended use.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Prefinal inspections.</E> A prefinal inspection will be made by the owner, project inspector, owner's architect or engineer, representatives of other agencies involved, and the District Director. The inspection results will be recorded on Form RD 1924-12, “Inspection Report,” and a copy provided to all interested parties, including the Agency State Director.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Final inspection.</E> A final inspection will be made by RD before final payment is made.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Changes in development plans.</E> (i) Changes in development plans may be approved by RD when requested by owners, provided:</P>
                <P>(A) Funds are available to cover any additional costs; and</P>
                <P>(B) The change is for an authorized loan purpose; and</P>
                <P>(C) It will not adversely affect the soundness of the facility operation or RD's security; and</P>
                <P>(D) The change is within the scope of the contract; and</P>
                <P>(E) Any applicable requirements of 7 CFR part 1970 have been met.</P>
                <P>(ii) Changes will be recorded on Form RD 1924-7, “Contract Change Order,” or other similar forms may be used with the prior approval of the District Director. Regardless of the form, change orders must be approved by the Agency District Director.</P>
                <P>(iii) Changes should be accomplished only after Agency approval on all changes which affect the work and shall be authorized only by means of contract change order. The change order will include items such as:</P>
                <P>(A) Any changes in labor and material and their respective cost.</P>
                <P>(B) Changes in facility design.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Project monitoring and fund delivery.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Coordination of funding sources.</E> When a project is jointly financed, the District Director will reach any needed agreement or understanding with the representatives of the other source of funds on distribution of responsibilities for handling various aspects of the project. These responsibilities will include supervision of construction, inspections and determination of compliance with appropriate regulations concerning equal employment opportunities, wage rates, nondiscrimination in making services or benefits available, and environmental compliance. If any problems develop which cannot be resolved locally, complete information should be sent to the State Office for advice.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Multiple advances.</E> Loans under this subpart are subject to the provisions of § 1942.17 (p)(2) of subpart A of this part 1942.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Use and accountability of funds.</E> Loans under this subpart are subject to the provisions of § 1942.17 (p)(3) of subpart A of this part 1942.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Development inspections.</E> Loans under this subpart are subject to the provisions of § 1942.17(p)(4) of subpart A of this part 1942.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Payment for project costs.</E> Each payment for project costs must be approved by the borrower's governing body.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Construction.</E> Payment for construction must be for amounts shown on payment estimate forms. Form RD 1924-18, “Partial Payment Estimate,” may be used for this purpose or other similar forms may be used with the prior approval of the District Director. <PRTPAGE P="110"/>However, the District Director cannot require more reporting burden than is required by Form RD 1924-18. Advances for contract retainage will not be made until such retainage is due and payable under the terms of the contract. The review and acceptance of project cost, including construction partial payment estimates, by RD does not attest to the correctness of the amounts, the quantities shown, or that the work has been performed under the terms of agreements or contracts.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Major equipment.</E> Payment for major equipment should generally coincide with delivery of the usable equipment, along with any necessary title or certifications, to the borrower. Borrowers may not use Agency loan funds to make deposits on equipment not ready for delivery. If a borrower purchases a truck chassis from one supplier and another supplier will complete the development of a fire or rescue vehicle, RD may release funds to pay for the chassis when title to the chassis is transferred to the borrower.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Use of remaining funds.</E> Loans under this subpart are subject to the provisions of § 1942.17 (p)(6) of subpart A of this part 1942.</P>

                <P>(b) Borrowers with annual incomes not exceeding $100,000 may, with concurrence of the District Director, use Form RD 1942-53, “Cash Flow Report,” instead of page one of schedule one and schedule two of Form RD 442-2, “Statement of Budget, Income, and Equity.” When used for budgeting, the cash statement should be projected for the upcoming fiscal year. When used for quarterly or annual reports, the cash flow report should include current year projections and actual data for the prior year, the quarter just ended, and the current year to date.</P>

State supplements shall not contain any requirements pertaining to bids, contract awards, and materials more restrictive than those in this subpart.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">State guides.</E> State Directors may develop guides for use by applicants if the guides to this subpart and subpart A of part 1942 are not adequate. State Directors may prepare guides for items needed for the application; items necessary for the docket; and items required prior to loan closing or construction starts.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Objective.</SUBJECT>
                <P>This subpart states the policies and procedures for making grants under section 509 of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1479). Grants reimburse eligible organizations for part or all of the costs of conducting, administering, and coordinating an effective housing application packaging program in colonias and designated counties. Eligible organizations will aid very low- and low-income individuals and families in obtaining benefits from Federal, State, and local housing programs. The targeted groups are very low- and low-income families without adequate housing who will receive priority for recruitment and participation and nonprofit organizations able to propose rental or housing rehabilitation assistance benefitting such families. These funds are available only in the areas defined in exhibit D of this subpart. Participants will assist very low- and low-income families in solving their housing needs. One way of assisting is to package single family housing applications for families wishing to buy, build, or repair houses for their own use. Another way is to package applications for organizations wishing to develop rental units for lower income families. The intent is to make Rural Development housing assistance programs available to very low- and low-income rural residents in colonias and designated counties. Rural Development will reimburse eligible organizations packaging loan/grant applications without discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, familial status, or handicap if such an organization has authority to contract.</P>

Likewise, a grantee would not be reimbursed for submitting a package for a section 504 loan/grant when the adjusted family income exceeds the very low-income limits of Appendix 9 of HB-1-3550 (available in any Rural Development office) or when the applicant does not own and occupy his/her property, or for a section 504 grant when the applicant is not 62 years of age or older.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The requirements of this subpart augment the requirements of section 802 of the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (approved November 28, 1990, Public Law 101-625) (42 U.S.C. 8011), (hereinafter, section 802), as amended by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-550, approved October 28, 1992), which authorizes the Congregate Housing Services Program (hereinafter, CHSP or Program).</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 1944.252</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
                <P>In addition to the definitions in section 802(k), the following definitions apply to CHSP:</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Activity of Daily Living (ADL)</E> means an activity regularly necessary for personal care.</P>
                <P>(1) The minimum requirements of ADLs include:</P>
                <P>(i) Eating (may need assistance with cooking, preparing or serving food, but must be able to feed self);</P>
                <P>(ii) Dressing (must be able to dress self, but may need occasional assistance);</P>
                <P>(iii) Bathing (may need assistance in getting in and out of the shower or tub, but must be able to wash self);</P>
                <P>(iv) Grooming (may need assistance in washing hair, but must be able to take care of personal appearance);</P>

                <P>(v) Getting in and out of bed and chairs, walking, going outdoors, using the toilet; and<PRTPAGE P="124"/>
                </P>
                <P>(vi) Household management activities (may need assistance in doing housework, grocery shopping or laundry, or getting to and from one location to another for activities such as going to the doctor and shopping, but must be mobile. The mobility requirement does not exclude persons in wheelchairs or those requiring mobility devices.)</P>

                <P>(2) Each of the Activities of Daily Living noted in paragraph (1) of this definition includes a requirement that a person must be able to perform at a specified minimal level (e.g., to satisfy the eating ADL, the person must be able to feed himself or herself). The determination of whether a person meets this minimal level of performance must include consideration of those services that will be performed by a person's spouse, relatives or other attendants to be provided by the individual. For example, if a person requires assistance with cooking, preparing or serving food plus assistance in feeding himself or herself, the individual would meet the minimal performance level and thus satisfy the eating ADL, if a spouse, relative or attendant provides assistance with feeding the person. Should such assistance become unavailable at any time, the owner is not obligated at any time to provide individualized services beyond those offered to the resident population in general. The Activities of Daily Living analysis is relevant only with regard to determination of a person's eligibility to receive <E T="03">supportive services</E> paid for by CHSP and is not a determination of eligibility for occupancy;</P>

The service coordinator then will refer to the professional assessment committee (PAC) those individuals who appear eligible for CHSP;</P>
                <P>(2) Establish professional relationships with all agencies and service providers in the community, and develop a directory of providers for use by program staff and program participants;</P>

                <P>(4) Serve as staff to the PAC;</P>
                <P>(5) Complete, for the PAC, all paperwork necessary for the assessment, referral, case monitoring and reassessment processes;</P>
                <P>(6) Implement any case plan developed by the PAC and agreed to by the program participant;</P>
                <P>(7) Maintain necessary case files on each program participant, containing such information and kept in such form as HUD and RHS shall require;</P>
                <P>(8) Provide the necessary case files to PAC members upon request, in connection with PAC duties;</P>

                <P>(9) Monitor the ongoing provision of services from community agencies and keep the PAC and the agency providing <PRTPAGE P="128"/>the supportive service informed of the progress of the participant;</P>
                <P>(10) Educate grant recipient's program participants on such issues as benefits application procedures (e.g. SSI, food stamps, Medicaid), service availability, and program participant options and responsibilities;</P>
                <P>(11) Establish volunteer support programs with service organizations in the community;</P>
                <P>(12) Assist the grant recipient in building informal support networks with neighbors, friends and family; and</P>
                <P>(13) Educate other project management staff on issues related to “aging-in-place” and services coordination, to help them to work with and assist other persons receiving housing assistance through the grantee.</P>
                <P>(e) The service coordinator shall tailor each participant's case plan to the individual's particular needs. The service coordinator shall work with community agencies, the grantee and third party service providers to ensure that the services are provided on a regular, ongoing, and satisfactory basis, in accordance with the case plan approved by the PAC and the participant.</P>
                <P>(f) Service coordinators shall not serve as members of the PAC.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Professional assessment committee.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) A professional assessment committee (PAC), as described in this section, shall recommend services appropriate to the functional abilities and needs of each eligible project resident. The PAC shall be either a voluntary committee appointed by the project management or an agency in the community which provides assessment services and conforms to section 802(e)(3)(A) and (B). PAC members are subject to the conflict of interest provisions in section 1944.175(b).</P>
                <P>(2) The PAC shall utilize procedures that ensure that the process of determining eligibility of individuals for congregate services affords individuals fair treatment, due process, and a right of appeal of the determination of eligibility, and shall ensure the confidentiality of personal and medical records.</P>
                <P>(3) The dollar value of PAC members' time spent on regular assessments after initial approval of program participants may be counted as match. If a community agency discharges the duties of the PAC, staff time is counted as its imputed value, and if the members are volunteers, their time is counted as volunteer time, according to sections 1944.145(c)(2) (ii) and (iv).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Duties of the PAC.</E> The PAC is required to:</P>

                <P>(1) Perform a formal assessment of each potential elderly program participant to determine if the individual is frail. To qualify as frail, the PAC must determine if the elderly person is deficient in at least three ADLs, as defined in section 1944.105. This assessment shall be based upon the screening done by the service coordinator, and shall include a review of the adequacy of the informal support network (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, family and friends available to the potential participant to assist in meeting the ADL needs of that individual), and may include a more in-depth medical evaluation, if necessary;</P>
                <P>(2) Determine if non-elderly disabled individuals qualify under the definition of person with disabilities under section 1944.105. If they do qualify, this is the acceptance criterion for them for CHSP. Persons with disabilities do not require an assessment by the PAC;</P>
                <P>(3) Perform a regular assessment and updating of the case plan of all participants;</P>
                <P>(4) Obtain and retain information in participant files, containing such information and maintained in such form, as HUD or RHS shall require;</P>
                <P>(5) Replace any members of the PAC within 30 days after a member resigns. A PAC shall not do formal assessments if its membership drops below three, or if the qualified medical professional leaves the PAC and has not been replaced.</P>
                <P>(6) Notify the grantee or eligible owner and the program participants of any proposed modifications to PAC procedures, and provide these parties with a process and reasonable time period in which to review and comment, before adoption of a modification;</P>

                <P>(7) Provide assurance of nondiscrimination in selection of CHSP participants, with respect to race, religion, color, sex, national origin, familial status or type of disability;<PRTPAGE P="129"/>
                </P>
                <P>(8) Provide complete confidentiality of information related to any individual examined, in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974;</P>
                <P>(9) Provide all formal information and reports in writing.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Prohibitions relating to the PAC.</E> (1) At least one PAC member shall not have any direct or indirect relationship to the grantee.</P>
                <P>(2) No PAC member may be affiliated with organizations providing services under the grant.</P>
                <P>(3) Individuals or staff of third party organizations that act as PAC members may not be paid with CHSP grant funds.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Eligibility and admissions.</E> (1) Before selecting potential program participants, each grantee (with PAC assistance) shall develop a CHSP application form. The information in the individual's application is crucial to the PAC's ability to determine the need for further physical or psychological evaluation.</P>
                <P>(2) The PAC, upon completion of a potential program participant's initial assessment, must make a recommendation to the service coordinator for that individual's acceptance or denial into CHSP.</P>
                <P>(3) Once a program participant is accepted into CHSP, the PAC must provide a supportive services case plan for each participant. In developing this plan, the PAC must take into consideration the participant's needs and wants. The case plan must provide the minimum supportive services necessary to maintain independence.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Transition-out procedures.</E> The grantee or PAC must develop procedures for providing for an individual's transition out of CHSP to another setting. Transition out is based upon the degree of supportive services needed by an individual to continue to live independently. If a program participant leaves the program, but wishes to retain supportive services, he or she may do so, as long as he or she continues to live in an eligible project, pays the full cost of services provided, and management agrees (section 802(e)(4) and (5)). A participant can be moved out of CHSP if he or she:</P>
                <P>(1) Gains physical and mental health and is able to function without supportive services, even if only for a short time (in which case readmission, based upon reassessment to determine the degree of frailty or the disability, is acceptable);</P>
                <P>(2) Requires a higher level of care than that which can be provided under CHSP; or</P>
                <P>(3) Fails to pay services fees.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Procedural rights of participants.</E> (1) The PAC must provide an informal process that recognizes the right to due process of individuals receiving assistance. This process, at a minimum, must consist of:</P>
                <P>(i) Serving the participant with a written notice containing a clear statement of the reasons for termination;</P>
                <P>(ii) A review of the decision, in which the participant is given the opportunity to present written or oral objections before a person other than the person (or a subordinate of that person) who made or approved the termination decision; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Prompt written notification of the final decision to the participant.</P>
                <P>(2) Procedures must ensure that any potential or current program participant, at the time of initial or regular assessment, has the option of refusing offered services and requesting other supportive services as part of the case planning process.</P>
                <P>(3) In situations where an individual requests additional services, not initially recommended by the PAC, the PAC must make a determination of whether the request is legitimately a needs-based service that can be covered under CHSP subsidy. Individuals can pay for services other than those recommended by the PAC as long as the additional services do not interfere with the efficient operation of the program.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Participatory agreement.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Before actual acceptance into CHSP, potential participants must work with the PAC and the service coordinator in developing supportive services case plans. A participant has the option of accepting any of the services under the case plan.</P>

                <P>(b) Once the plan is approved by the PAC and the program participant, the participant must sign a participatory agreement governing the utilization of <PRTPAGE P="130"/>the plan's supportive services and the payment of supportive services fees. The grantee annually must renegotiate the agreement with the participant.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Grantees, the Secretary concerned, and participants shall all contribute to the cost of providing supportive services according to section 802(i)(A)(i). Grantees must contribute at least 50 percent of program cost, participants must contribute fees that in total are at least 10 percent of program cost, and the Secretary concerned will provide funds in an amount not to exceed 40 percent.</P>
                <P>(2) Section 802(i)(1)(B)(ii) creates a cost-sharing provision between grantee and the Secretary concerned if total participant fees collected over a year are less than 10 percent of total program cost. This provision is subject to availability of appropriated grant funds. If funds are not available, the grantee must assume the funding shortfall.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Prohibition on substitution of funds and maintenance of existing supportive services.</E> Grantees shall maintain existing funding for and provision of supportive services prior to the application date, as set forth in section 802(i)(1)(D). The grantee shall ensure that the activities provided to the project under a CHSP grant will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, these previously existing services. The value of these services do not qualify as matching funds. Such services must be maintained either for the time the participant remains in CHSP, or for the duration of CHSP grant. The grantee shall certify compliance with this paragraph to the Secretary concerned.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Eligible matching funds.</E> (1) All sources of matching funds must be directly related to the types of supportive services prescribed by the PAC or used for administration of CHSP.</P>
                <P>(2) Matching funds may include:</P>
                <P>(i) Cash (which may include funds from Federal, State and local governments, third party contributions, available payments authorized under Medicaid for specific individuals in CHSP, Community Development Block Grants or Community Services Block Grants, Older American Act programs or excess residual funds with the approval of the Secretary concerned),</P>
                <P>(ii) The imputed dollar value of other agency or third party-provided direct services or staff who will work with or provide services to program participants; these services must be justified in the application to assure that they are the new or expanded services of CHSP necessary to keep the program participants independent. If services are provided by the state, Indian tribe, unit of general local government, or local nonprofit housing sponsor, IHA, PHA, or for-profit or not-for-profit owner, any salary paid to staff from governmental sources to carry out the program of the grantee and any funds paid to residents employed by the Program (other than from amounts under a contract under section 1944.155) is allowable match.</P>
                <P>(iii) In-kind items (these are limited to 10 percent of the 50 percent matching amount), such as the current market value of donated common or office space, utility costs, furniture, material, supplies, equipment and food used in direct provision of services. The applicant must provide an explanation for the estimated donated value of any item listed.</P>
                <P>(iv) The value of services performed by volunteers to CHSP, at the rate of $5.00 an hour.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Limitation.</E> (1) The following are not eligible for use as matching funds:</P>
                <P>(i) PHA operating funds;</P>
                <P>(ii) CHSP funds;</P>
                <P>(iii) Section 8 funds other than excess residual receipts;</P>
                <P>(iv) Funds under section 14 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, unless used for service coordination or case management; and</P>
                <P>(v) Comprehensive grant funds unless used for service coordination or case management;</P>
                <P>(2) Local government contributions are limited by section 802(i)(1)(E).</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Annual review of match.</E> The Secretary concerned will review the infusion of matching funds annually, as part of the program or budget review. If there are insufficient matching funds available to meet program requirements at any point after grant start-up, or at any time during the term of the grant (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, if matching funds from <PRTPAGE P="131"/>sources other than program participant fees drop below 50 percent of total supportive services cost), the Secretary concerned may decrease the federal grant share of supportive services funds accordingly.</P>

Consistent with section 802(d)(7)(A), the Secretary concerned shall provide for the waiver of fees for individuals who are without sufficient income to provide for any payment.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Fees shall include:</E> (1) Cash contributions of the program participant;</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Older Americans Act programs.</E> No fee may be charged for any meals or supportive services under CHSP if that service is funded under an Older Americans Act Program.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Meals fees:</E> (1) For full meal services, the fees for residents receiving more than one meal per day, seven days per week, shall be reasonable and shall equal between 10 and 20 percent of the adjusted income of the project resident, or the cost of providing the services, whichever is less.</P>
                <P>(2) The fees for residents receiving meal services less frequently than as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be in an amount equal to 10 percent of the adjusted income of the project resident, or the cost of providing the services, whichever is less.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Other service fees.</E> The grantee may also establish fees for other supportive services so that the total fees collected from all participants for meals and other services is at least 10 percent of the total cost of CHSP. However, no program participants may be required to pay more than 20 percent of their adjusted incomes for any combination of services.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Other residents and nonresidents.</E> Fees shall be established for residents of eligible housing projects (other than eligible project residents) and for nonresidents who receive meals and other services from CHSP under section 1944.125(a). These fees shall be in an amount equal to the cost of providing the services.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Objective.</SUBJECT>
                <P>This subpart sets forth the policies and procedures and delegates authority for providing Technical Assistance (TA) funds to eligible applicants to finance programs of technical and supervisory assistance for self-help housing, as authorized under section 523 of the Housing Act of 1949. Any processing or servicing activity conducted pursuant to this subpart involving authorized assistance to Rural Development employees, members of their families, known close relatives, or business or close personal associates, is subject to the provisions of subpart D of part 1900 of this chapter. Applicants for this assistance are required to identify any known relationship or association with a Rural Development employee. This financial assistance may pay part or all of the cost of developing, administering, or coordinating programs of technical and supervisory assistance to aid needy very low- and low-income families in carrying out self-help housing efforts in rural areas. Very low-income families must receive a priority for recruitment and participation and may not comprise less than the percentage stated in subpart L of part 1940 of this chapter of those assisted in any grant. The primary purpose is to fund organizations that are willing to locate and work with families that otherwise do not qualify as homeowners. Generally, these are families below 50 percent of median incomes, living in substandard housing, and/or lacking the skills to be good homeowners. Grantees will comply with the nondiscrimination regulation subpart E of part 1901 of this chapter which states that no person in the United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, national origin, sex, religion, marital status, mental or physical handicap, or age, be excluded from participating in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination in connection with the use of grant funds and all provisions of the Fair Housing Act of 1988.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 1944.403</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Agreement.</E> The Self-Help Technical Assistance Agreement, which is a document signed by Rural Development and the grantee, sets forth the terms and conditions under which TA funds will be made available. (Exhibit A of this subpart).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Agreement period (or grant period).</E> The period of time for which an agreement is in force. Generally, the period will not exceed 24 months.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Date of completion.</E> The date when all work under a grant is completed or the date in the TA grant agreement, or any supplement or amendment to it, when Federal assistance ends.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Direct costs.</E> Those costs that are specifically identified with a particular project or activity. Grantees receiving funds from a single grant source would consider all costs as direct costs.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Disallowed costs.</E> Those charges to a grant which Rural Development determines cannot be authorized.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Equivalent units.</E> Equivalent units represent the “theoretical number of units” arrived at by adding the equivalent percentage of completion figure for each family in the self-help program (pre-construction and actual construction) together at any given date during program operations. The sum of the percentage of completion figures for all participant families represent the total number of “theoretical units” completed at any point in time. Equivalent units are useful in measuring progress during the period of the grant and are not a measurement of actual accomplishments. The number of equivalent units for any group can never exceed the number of planned or completed houses for that group.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Equivalent value of a modest house.</E> The equivalent value of a modest house is the typical cost of a recent contractor-built Rural Development financed home in the area plus the actual or projected costs of an acceptable site and site development. If Rural Development has not financed a contractor-built house during the last twelve months, the value will be established by use of the Marshall and Swift cost handbook or a similar type of handbook. Equivalent value of a modest house is established by Rural Development.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Indirect costs.</E> Those costs that are incurred for common or joint objectives and therefore, cannot be readily and specifically identified with a particular project or activity, e.g., self-help.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Mutual self-help.</E> The construction method by which participating families organized in groups generally of 4 to 10 families utilize their own labor to reduce the total construction cost of their homes. Participating families complete construction work on their homes by an exchange of labor with one another. The mutual self-help method must be used for new construction.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Organization.</E> (1) A State, political subdivision, or public nonprofit corporation (including Indian tribes or Tribal corporations); or</P>
                <P>(2) A private nonprofit corporation that is owned and controlled by private persons or interests and is organized and operated for purposes other than making gains or profits for the corporation and is legally precluded from distributing any gains or profits to its members.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Participating family.</E> Individuals and/or their families who agree to build homes by the mutual self-help method and rehabilitate homes by the self-help method. Participants are families with very low- or low-incomes who have the ability to furnish their share of the required labor input regardless of the handicap, age, race, color, national origin, religion, family status, or sex of the head of household. The participating family must be approved for a section 502 RH loan or similar loans from other Federal, state, and private lenders that uses income guidelines substantially similar to the Department of Housing and Urban Development before the start of construction, <PRTPAGE P="135"/>have sufficient time available to assist in building their own homes, and show a desire to work with other families. Each family in the group must contribute labor on each other's homes to accomplish the 65 percent of the total 100 percent of tasks listed in exhibit B-2 of this subpart. A participating family may use a substitute to perform the labor with prior approval of the Grantee and the Rural Development State Director. A substitute is only permitted when the participating family is incapacitated.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Self-help.</E> The construction method by which an individual family utilizes their labor to reduce the construction cost of their home without an exchange of labor between participating families. Unless otherwise authorized by the District Director, this method is only funded for repair and rehabilitation type construction.</P>
                <P>(m) <E T="03">Sponsor.</E> An existing entity that is willing and able to assist an applicant, with or without charge, in applying for a grant and in carrying out responsibilities under the agreement. Examples of sponsors are local rural electric cooperatives, institutions of higher education, community action agencies and other self-help grantees. Also, when available, regional technical and management assistance contractors may qualify to serve as a sponsor at no charge.</P>
                <P>(n) <E T="03">Technical assistance.</E> The organizing and supervising of groups of families in the construction of their own homes including:</P>
                <P>(1) Recruiting families who are interested in sharing labor in the construction of each other's homes and assisting such families in obtaining housing loans.</P>
                <P>(2) Conducting meetings of the families to explain the self-help program and subjects related to home ownership, such as loan payments, taxes, insurance, maintenance, and upkeep of the property.</P>
                <P>(3) Helping families in planning and developing activities that lead to the acquisition and development of suitable building sites.</P>
                <P>(4) Assisting families in selecting or developing house plans for homes which will meet their needs and which they can afford.</P>
                <P>(5) Assisting families in obtaining cost estimates for construction materials and any contracting that may be required.</P>
                <P>(6) Providing assistance in the preparation of loan applications.</P>
                <P>(7) Providing construction supervision and training for families while they construct their homes.</P>
                <P>(8) Providing financial supervision to individual families with section 502 Rural Housing (RH) loans which will minimize the time and effort required by Rural Development in processing borrower expenditures for materials and contract services.</P>
                <P>(9) Assisting families in solving other housing problems.</P>
                <P>(o) <E T="03">Termination of a grant.</E> The cancellation of Federal assistance, in whole or in part, at any time before the date of completion.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Authorized use of grant funds.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Payment of salaries of personnel as authorized in the Agreement.</P>
                <P>(b) Payment of necessary and reasonable office expenses such as office rental, office utilities, and office equipment rental. The purchase of office equipment is permissible when the grantee determines it to be more economical than renting. As a general rule, these types of expenses would be classified as indirect costs in multiple funded organizations.</P>
                <P>(c) Purchase of office supplies such as paper, pens, pencils, and trade magazines.</P>
                <P>(d) Payment of necessary employee benefit costs including but not limited to items such as Worker's Compensation, employer's share of social security, health benefits, and a reasonable tax deferred pension plan for permanent employees.</P>
                <P>(e) Purchase, lease, or maintenance of power or specialty tools such as a power saw, electric drill, sabre saw, ladders, and scaffolds, which are needed by the participating families. The participating families, however, are expected to provide their own hand tools such as hammers and handsaws.</P>
                <P>(f) Payment of liability insurance and special purpose audit costs associated with self-help activities. These would be considered direct costs, even though the grantee's general liability insurance cost and the cost of audits for the organization are generally indirect costs.</P>
                <P>(g) Payment of reasonable fees for training of grantee personnel including board members. This may include the cost of travel and per diem to attend in or out-of-State training as authorized by the board of directors and, when necessary, for the employee to do the current job. These costs are generally direct costs.</P>
                <P>(h) Payment of services rendered by a sponsor or other organization after the grant is closed and when it is determined the sponsor can provide the necessary services which will result in an overall reduction in the cost of assistance. Typically, this will be limited to new grantees and an existing grantee for the period of time that its size or activity does not justify a full staff. A full staff is a full or part-time director, project worker, secretary-bookkeeper, and a construction supervisor. This type of cost is generally direct.</P>
                <P>(i) Payment of certain consulting and legal costs required in the administration of the grant if such service is not available without cost. This does not include legal expenses for claims against the Federal Government. (Legal costs that may be incurred by the organization for the benefit of the participating families may be paid with prior approval of the State Director).</P>
                <P>(j) Payments of the cost of an accountant to set up an accounting system and perform audits that may be required. Generally, these costs are indirect.</P>
                <P>(k) Payments of reasonable expenses of board members for attending regular or special board meetings. These costs are indirect.</P>

                <P>The amount of the TA grant depends on the experience and capability of the <PRTPAGE P="137"/>applicant and must be justified based on the number of families to be assisted. As a guide, the maximum grant amounts for any grant period will be limited to:</P>
                <P>(a) An average TA cost per equivalent unit of no more than 15 percent of the cost of equivalent value of modest homes built in the area. (Upon request, the County Supervisor will provide the grantee the average cost of modest homes for the area); or</P>
                <P>(b) An average TA cost per equivalent unit that does not exceed the difference between the equivalent value of modest homes in the area and the average mortgage of the participating families minus $1,000; or</P>
                <P>(c) A TA per equivalent unit cost that does not exceed an amount established by the State Director. The State Director may authorize a greater TA cost than paragraph (a) or (b) of this section when needed to accomplish a particular objective, such as requiring the grantee to serve very low-income families, remote areas, or similar situations; or</P>
                <P>(d) A negotiated amount for repair and rehabilitation type proposals. At a minimum, applicants applying for repair and rehabilitation grants must include information on the proximity of the houses in a project, the typical needed repairs, and the cost savings between self-help and contractor rehabilitation and repair.</P>

                <P>(3) A current (no more than 12 months old) dated and signed financial statement showing the amounts and specific nature of assets and liabilities together with information on the repayment schedule and status of any debt owed by the applicant. If the applicant is being sponsored by another <PRTPAGE P="138"/>organization, the same type of financial statement also must be provided by the applicant's sponsor.</P>
                <P>(4) A narrative statement which includes information about the amount of the grant funds being requested, area(s) to be served, need for self-help housing in the area(s), the number of self-help units proposed to be built, rehabilitated or repaired during the agreement period, housing conditions of low-income families in the area and reasons why families need self-help assistance. Evidence should be provided that the communities support the activity and that there are low-income families willing to contribute their labor in order to obtain adequate housing. Evidence of community support may be letters of support from local officials, individuals and community organizations. The pre-application may contain information such as census materials, local planning studies, surveys, or other readily available information which indicates a need in the area for housing of the type and cost to be provided by the proposed self-help TA program.</P>
                <P>(5) A plan of how the organization proposes to reach very low-income families living in houses that are deteriorated, dilapidated, overcrowded, and/or lacking plumbing facilities.</P>

If multi-funded, its cost allocation plan or indirect cost rate must be part of the pre-application.</P>
                <P>(9) Whether assistance under paragraph (d) of this section is requested and a brief narrative identifying the need, amount of funds needed, and projected time period.</P>
                <P>(10) If a project is planned for five or more housing lots or units, an Affirmative Fair Marketing Plan is required. The plan will be in effect until the completion of the project.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Preapplication review.</E> (1) The District Director, within 30 days of receipt of the preapplication, Form SF-424, and all other required information and material will complete a thorough review for completeness, accuracy, and conformance to program policy and regulations. Incomplete preapplications will be returned to the applicant for completion. The applicant should be given the name of the regional technical assistance contractor. The County Supervisor in the prospective county will be contacted as to the need for the program in the proposed area and if the necessary resources are available to the grantee. This will include a discussion of the number of 502 and 504 units that will need to be committed to the grantee and the potential work impact on the office during the grant period. If it is determined that the County Office lacks the resources (either personnel or funds) to process all loan requests in a timely manner, the District Director must communicate this need to the State Director along with a recommended solution. (Lack of resources at the county level are not grounds to deny a request). After the District Director has determined that the preapplication is complete and accurate, the District Director will assemble the material in an applicant case file and forward it to the State Director. The case file, as a minimum, must contain the following:</P>
                <P>(i) Form SF-424,</P>
                <P>(ii) Documentation required in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970.</P>

                </P>
                <P>(2) The State Director may, if needed, submit the organizational documents with any comments or questions to the Office of General Counsel (OGC) for a preliminary opinion as to whether the applicant is or will be a legal organization of the type required by these regulations and for advice on any other aspects of the preapplication.</P>
                <P>(3) The State Director, if unable to determine eligibility or qualifications with the advice of the OGC, may submit the preapplication to the National Office for review. The preapplication will contain all memoranda from OGC giving the results of its review. The State Director will identify in the transmittal memorandum to the National Office the specific problem and will recommend possible solutions and any information about the applicant which would be helpful to the National Office in reaching a decision.</P>
                <P>(4) After an eligibility determination has been made, which should be completed within 30 days unless OGC is involved, the State Director will:</P>
                <P>(i) If the applicant is eligible, contact the National Office as to the availability of funds or submit the proposal to the National Office for authorization if the requested amount exceeds the State Director's approval authority. If funds are available, the final review officer, either the State Director or the Assistant Administrator, Housing will issue a letter of conditions that the applicant must meet and direct the District Director to issue Form AD-622, “Notice of Preapplication Review Action.”</P>
                <P>(ii) If the applicant is determined not eligible, the State Director will direct the District Director to issue Form AD-622.</P>

                <P>(3) If the applicant is eligible and no grant or loan funds are available, the State Director will return the preapplication information to the District Director who will, within 10 days, notify the applicant on Form AD-622. The notification will explain the facts concerning the lack of funding and that Rural Development will notify them when funding will be available. This is not an appealable decision.</P>

Exhibit D of this subpart will be used for this purpose. Existing grantees proposing to operate in an area different from the area that they are currently funded to operate are eligible for this grant. However, this grant is available only once for a defined area. This grant is available only after the letter of conditions has been issued.

                <SUBJECT>Servicing actions after grant closing.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Rural Development has a responsibility to help the grantee be successful and help the grantee avoid cases of fraud and abuse. Servicing actions also include correlating activities between the grantee and Rural Development to the benefit of the participating families. The amount of servicing actions needed will vary in accordance with the experience of the grantee, but as minimum the following actions are required:</P>
                <P>(a) Monthly, the grantee will provide the District Director with a request for additional funds on Form SF-270, “Request for Advance or Reimbursement.” This request need only show the amount of funds used during the previous month, amount of unspent funds, projected need for the next 30 days, and written justification if the request exceeds the projected need for the next 30 days. This request must be in the District Director's office fifteen days prior to the beginning of the month. Upon receipt of the grantee's request, the District Director will:</P>
                <P>(1) If the request appears to be in order, process Form RD 440-57 so that delivery of the check will be possible on the first of the next month.</P>
                <P>(2) If the request does not appear to be in order, immediately contact the grantee to resolve the problem. After the contact:</P>
                <P>(i) If the explanation is acceptable, process Form RD 440-57 so delivery may be possible by the first of the next month, or</P>
                <P>(ii) If the explanation is not acceptable, immediately notify the grantee and request the amount of funds that appear reasonable for the next 30 days on Form RD 440-57, so that delivery may be possible by the first of the next month. Unapproved funds that are later approved will be added to the next month's request.</P>
                <P>(b) Quarterly, the grantee will submit exhibit B of this subpart in an original and three copies to the County Supervisor on or before January 15, April 15, July 15, and October 15 which will verify its progress toward meeting the objectives stated in the Agreement and the application. The County Supervisor will immediately complete the County Office review part and forward the report to the District Office. After exhibit B is received in the District Office, a meeting should be scheduled between the grantee, District Director, and the County supervisor since this is an opportune time for both the grantee and Rural Development to review progress to date and make necessary adjustments for the future. This meeting is required if the grantee was previously identified as a problem grantee or will be identified as a problem grantee at this time. Regardless of whether a meeting will be held, the following will be done:</P>
                <P>(1) Exhibit B and other information will be evaluated to determine progress made to date. The District Director will comment on exhibit B as to whether the grantee is ahead or behind schedule in each of the following areas:</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Assisting the projected number of families.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Serving very low-income applicants.</E> Is the grantee reaching a minimum of very low-income families as required in exhibit A, attachment 2 to subpart L of <PRTPAGE P="143"/>part 1940 of this chapter (available in any Rural Development office).</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Equivalent units (EUs).</E> Is the number of EUs completed representative of lapse in time of the grant? For example, if 25 percent of the grant period has elapsed, are 25 percent of the number of EUs completed?</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Labor contributions by the family.</E> Are the families working together and are they completing the labor tasks as established on exhibit B-2?</P>
                <P>(2) The District Director will submit exhibit B to the State Director who will evaluate the quarterly report along with the District Director's comments. If the State Director determines the grantee is progressing satisfactorily, the State Director will sign and forward exhibit B to the National Office. However, if the State Director determines the grantee is not performing as expected, the State Director will notify the grantee that it has been classified a “High Risk” grantee. The notice will specify the deficiencies and inform the grantee of proposed remedies for noncompliance. The notice will advise the grantee that Rural Development is available to assist and provide the name and address of an organization that is under contract with Rural Development to assist them. The State Director will forward a copy of exhibit B, District Directors comments, and the reasons for classifying them as “High Risk” to the National Office, Single Family Housing, Special Programs Branch. When the period of time provided for corrective action has expired, an assessment will be made of the progress by the grantee toward correcting the situation. If the State Director determines:</P>
                <P>(i) The situation has been corrected or reasonable progress has been made toward correcting the situation, the “High Risk” status will be lifted and the grantee so notified.</P>
                <P>(ii) The situation has not been corrected but it is correctable if additional time is granted, an extension will be issued.</P>
                <P>(iii) The situation has not been corrected and it is unlikely to be corrected if given additional time, the grant will be terminated under § 1944.426(b)(1) of this subpart.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Final grantee evaluation.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Near the end of the grant period but prior to the last month, an evaluation of the grantee will be conducted by Rural Development. The State Director may use Rural Development employees or an organization under contract to Rural Development to provide the evaluation. The evaluation is to determine how successful the grantee was in meeting goals and objectives as defined in the agreement, application, this regulation, and any amendments.</P>
                <P>(a) This is a quantitative evaluation of the grantee to determine if it met its goals in:</P>
                <P>(1) Assisting the project number of families in obtaining adequate housing.</P>
                <P>(2) Meeting the goal of assisting very low-income families.</P>
                <P>(3) Meeting the family labor requirement in § 1944.411(h) and exhibit B-2 of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(4) Keeping costs within the guides set in § 1944.407.</P>
                <P>(5) Meeting order objectives in the Agreement.</P>
                <P>(b) The evaluation is a narrative addressed to the State Director with a copy of the National Office, Single Family Housing Processing Division. It will be in 3 parts, namely; findings, recommendations, and an overall rating. The rating will be either unacceptable, acceptable, or outstanding, as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) Outstanding if the grantee met or exceeded all of the goals in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) Acceptable if the grantee met or exceeded all of the goals as defined in paragraph (a) except two.</P>
                <P>(3) Unacceptable if the grantee failed to obtain an acceptable rating.</P>

                <P>(c) After the State Director has reviewed the evaluation, a copy will be mailed to the grantee. The grantee may request a review of the evaluation with the District Director. This review is for clarification of the material and to dispute the findings if they are known to be wrong. The rating is not <PRTPAGE P="144"/>open for discussion except to the extent it can be proven that the findings do not support the rating. If this is the case, the District Director will file an amendment to the State Director.</P>

                <P>The State Director may authorize the District Director to execute on behalf of the Government, exhibit C of this subpart, at any time during the grant period provided:</P>
                <P>(a) The extension period is for no more than one year from the final date of the existing Agreement.</P>
                <P>(b) The need for the extension is clearly justified.</P>
                <P>(c) If additional funds are needed, a revised budget is submitted with complete justification, and</P>
                <P>(d) The grantee is within the guidelines in § 1944.407 of this subpart or the State Director determines that the best interest of the Government will be served by the extension.</P>

                <P>Grantees wishing to continue with self-help efforts after the end of the current grant plus any extensions should file Form SF-424, in accordance with § 1944.410(e). It is recommended that it be filed at least 6 months before the end of the current grant period. Funds from the existing grant may be used to meet the conditions of a new grant to serve the same or redefined geographic area. If the grantee is targeting a different geographic area, a new preapplication must be submitted in accordance with § 1944.410 and the grantee may apply for a predevelopment grant in accordance with § 1944.410(d). In addition to meeting the conditions of an applicant as defined in § 1944.411 of this subpart, the grantee must also have received or will receive an acceptable rating on its current grant unless an exception is granted by the State Director. The State Director may grant an exception to the rating if it is determined that the reasons causing the previous unacceptable rating have been removed or will be removed with the approval of this grant.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Audit and other report requirements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The grantee must submit an audit to the appropriate Rural Development District Office annually (or biennially if a State or local government with authority to do a less frequent audit requests it) and the earlier of 30 calendar days after receipt of the auditor's report or nine months after the end of the grantee's audit period. The audit, conducted by the grantee's auditors, is to be performed in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS), using the publication “Standards for Audit of Governmental Organizations, Programs, Activities and Functions” developed by the Comptroller General of the United States in 1981, and any subsequent revisions. In addition, the audits are also to be performed in accordance with 2 CFR part 200 as adopted by USDA through 2 CFR part 400 and Rural Development requirements as specified in this subpart. Audits of borrower loan funds will be required. The number of borrower accounts audited will be determined by the auditor. In incidences where it is difficult to determine the appropriate number of accounts to be audited, auditors should be authorized by the State Director to audit the lesser of 10 loans or 10 percent of total loans.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Nonprofit organizations and others.</E> If determined necessary, these organizations are to be audited in accordance with Rural Development requirements in accordance with 2 CFR part 200 as adopted by USDA through 2 CFR part 400. These requirements also apply to public hospitals, public colleges, and universities if they are excluded from the audit requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) An audit conducted by the grantee's auditor shall be supplied to the Rural Development District Director as soon as possible but in no case later than ninety (90) days following the period covered by the grant agreement.</P>

                <P>(2) Auditors shall promptly notify United States Department of Agriculture's Office of the Inspector General Regional Inspector General and the Rural Development District Office, in writing, of any indication of fraud, abuse, or illegal acts in grantees use of <PRTPAGE P="145"/>grant funds or in the handling of borrowers accounts.</P>
                <P>(3) Nonprofit organizations that receive less than $25,000 a year in Federal financial assistance need not be audited.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">State and local governments and Indian tribes.</E> These organizations are to be audited in accordance with this subpart and 2 CFR part 200 as adopted by USDA through 2 CFR part 400. The grantee will forward completed audits to the appropriate Federal Cognizant agency and a copy to the Rural Development District Director. “Cognizant agency” for audits is defined at 2 CFR 200.18 as the Federal agency designated to carry out the responsibilities described in § 200.513 Responsibilities, paragraph (a). The cognizant agency for audit is not necessarily the same as the cognizant agency for indirect costs. A list of cognizant agencies for audit may be found at the FAC Web site. Within USDA, the OIG shall fulfill cognizant agency responsibilities. Smaller grantees not assigned a cognizant agency by OMB should contact the Federal agency that provided the most funds. When USDA is designated as the cognizant agency or when it has been determined by the borrower that Rural Development provided the major portion of Federal financial assistance, the State Director will contact the appropriate USDA OIG Regional Inspector General. Rural Development and the borrower shall coordinate all proposed audit plans with the appropriate USDA OIG.</P>
                <P>(1) State and local governments and Indian tribes that receive $25,000 or more a year in Federal financial assistance shall have an audit made in accordance with 2 CFR part 200 as adopted by USDA through 2 CFR part 400.</P>
                <P>(2) State and local and Indian tribes that receive less than $25,000 a year in Federal financial assistance shall be exempt from 2 CFR part 200 as adopted by USDA through 2 CFR part 400.</P>
                <P>(3) Public hospitals and public colleges and universities may be excluded by the State Director from OMB Circular A-128 audit requirements. If such entities are excluded, audits shall be made in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

                <P>A grantee is required to assist 502 RH applicants in submitting their application for a RH loan. Loan packaging will be performed in accordance with 7 CFR part 3550; therefore, it is important that the grantee be trained at an early date in the packaging of RH loans. Typically, this training should take place before the first applications are submitted to the County Office and before the grant is closed. A grantee should become very knowledgeable of Rural Development's eligibility requirements but must understand that only Rural Development can approve or deny an applicant assistance. Grantee must work cooperatively with Rural Development in the 502 loan approval process and must work within the regulations for the 502 program and recognize Rural Development's ultimate decision making authority to approve or deny loans. However, the grantee may ask for clarification that may be helpful in working with future applicants. Grant funds may not be used to pay any expense in connection with an appeal that the applicant may file or pursue.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Grant purposes not completed</E>—(1) <E T="03">Notification of termination.</E> The State Director will promptly notify the grantee and the National Office in writing of the termination action including the specific reasons for the decision and the effective date of the termination. The notification to the grantee will specify that if the grantee believes the reason for the proposed termination can be resolved, the grantee should, within 15 calendar days of the date of this notification, contact the State Director in writing requesting a meeting for further consideration. The meeting will be an informal proceeding at which the grantee will be given the opportunity to provide whatever additional information it believes should be considered in reaching a decision concerning the case. The grantee may have an attorney or any other person present at the meeting if desired. Within 7 calendar days of the meeting, the State Director will determine what action to take.</P>
                <P>(i) If the State Director determines that termination is not necessary, the grantee will be informed by letter along with the District Director.</P>

                <P>A. Equivalent units are used to measure progress at any time during the period of the grant. It is necessary because self-help grantees have several groups of families in various stages of progress during the period of the grant. The following formula has been developed to provide a more accurate method of determining progress.</P>

                <P>B. Using the Description of Phase Breakdown as a guide, the project staff selects the total percentage pertinent to the stage the self-help group is in and multiplies that percentage by the number of families (units) in the group. The result is the equivalent number of units completed. No credit may be given for Phase I, if the application is rejected. When this computation has been completed for each group that falls within Phases I-III, the total number of equivalent units is divided into the total grant funds expended to that date. The result is the TA cost per unit at that stage of the program's progress.</P>
                <P>C. The definition of pre-construction and construction phases described are follows:</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Pre-Construction</HD>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Phase I:</E> Hold community meetings; conduct interviews; obtain house plans; prepare cost estimates; begin search for land; submit family applications to the lender; lender runs credit check; applications. Lender either approves or rejects.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Phase II:</E> Organize an association of section 502 Rural Housing eligible families; association conducts weekly meetings at which required lender forms are discussed and completed; house plans and land sites are selected; outside speakers explain and discuss taxes, insurance, how to keep a checking account, how interest is computed, home maintenance, decorating, and landscaping; etc.; completed loan dockets for each family are submitted to the lender. Family loan dockets are reviewed and recommendations made as to the loan amounts requested; the lender reviews family loan dockets; preliminary title search of each proposed building site is begun; requests loan check from Finance Office; when check arrives, final title search is made, loan closed, checking accounts opened, and construction begun.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Construction:</E> The grantee will utilize exhibit B-2 which outlines 27 construction tasks to determine the percentage of completed construction activities.</P>
                <P>D. The computation of equivalent units and TA costs will be computed as follows:</P>
                <P>Exhibit C will be used for recording the following information and construction in this example which starts January 1.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Step 1</HD>

                <P>Both the grantee and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 review the FmHA or its successor agency <PRTPAGE P="155"/>under Public Law 103-354 loan application records to determine the percentage of completion for each family in the pre-construction phase of the program. These are Phases I-III. Total these percentages to find the number of “equivalent units” (EUs) completed at that date during pre-construction. For example, if there are eight families in Group #2 and all have completed the 20 percent phase of pre-construction, then there would be 1.6 EUs in the pre-construction phase of the program as of that date. Each phase must be completed before it is considered in the calculation.</P>

                <P>Refer to the records of construction progress for families in the construction Phase III. As of that date, the director totals the percentage of completion figures for each family as follows:</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Exhibit F to Subpart I of Part 1944—Site Option Loan to Technical Assistance Grantees</HD>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Objectives</HD>

                <P>The objective of a Site Option (SO) loan under Section 523(b)(1)(B) of Title V of the Housing Act of 1949 is to enable technical assistance (TA) grantees to establish revolving fund accounts to obtain options on land needed to make sites available to families that will build their own homes by the self-help method. An SO loan will be considered only when sites cannot be made available by <PRTPAGE P="158"/>other means including a regular Rural Housing Site (RHS) loan.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Eligibility Requirements</HD>
                <P>To be eligible for an SO loan, the applicant must be a TA grantee that is currently operating in a satisfactory manner under a TA grant agreement. If the SO loan applicant has applied for TA funds but is not already a TA grantee and it appears that the TA grant will be made, the SO loan may be approved but not closed until the TA grant is closed.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Loan Purposes</HD>
                <P>Loans may be made only as necessary to enable eligible applicants to establish revolving accounts with which to obtain options on land that will be needed as building sites by self-help families participating in the TA self-help housing program. Loans will not be made to pay the full purchase price of land but only for the minimum amounts necessary to obtain an option from the seller. The option should be for as long as necessary but in no case should the option be for less than 90 days.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Limitations</HD>
                <P>(A) If the amount of an SO loan will exceed $10,000, the prior consent of the National Office shall be obtained before approval.</P>
                <P>(B) The amount of the SO loan should not exceed 15 percent of the purchase price of the land expected to be under option at any one time, unless a higher percent is authorized by the State Director when other land in not available or the particular area requires more down payment than elsewhere or similar circumstances exist.</P>
                <P>(C) Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 440-34, “Option to Purchase Real Property,” will be used without modification in all cases for obtaining options under this subpart.</P>
                <P>(D) The limitations of § 1822.266(b) (1) and (2) of subpart F of part 1822 of this chapter (FmHA Instruction 444.8, paragraphs VI B (1) and (2)) concerning land purchase will apply to options purchased under this subpart.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Rates and Terms</HD>
                <P>(A) <E T="03">Interest.</E> Loans will be made at an interest rate of 3 percent.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Repayment period.</E> Each SO loan will be repaid in one installment which will include the entire principal balance and accrued interest. The maximum repayment period for each SO loan will be the applicant's remaining TA grant funding period.</P>
                <P>(1) A shorter repayment period will be established if SO funds will not be needed for the entire TA grant funding period.</P>
                <P>(2) If a regular RHS loan is to be processed, the SO loan should be scheduled for repayment when RHS loan funds will be available to purchase the land and repay the amount of SO funds advanced on the option, unless SO loan funds will still be needed to purchase other options. Under no circumstances, however, will the repayment period exceed the applicant's remaining TA grant funding period.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Processing Application</HD>
                <P>(A) <E T="03">Form of application:</E> The application for assistance will be in the form of a letter to the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 County Supervisor having jurisdiction over the area of the proposed site to be optioned. The letter will be signed by the applicant or its authorized representative and contain, as a minimum, the following information:</P>
                <P>(1) A copy of the proposed option that shows a legal description of the land, option price, purchase price, and terms of the option. If more than one site is to be purchased, a schedule of the proposed options should be included.</P>
                <P>(2) Information to verify that a regular RHS loan cannot be processed in time to secure the option.</P>

                <P>(1) Determine whether the applicant is eligible. If the applicant is not eligible, or the loan cannot be made for other reasons, the application may be rejected by the County Supervisor with the concurrence of the District Director. The reasons for the rejection should be clearly stated and provided, in writing to the applicant. The applicant will have the right to have the decision reviewed following the procedure established in subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter.</P>

                <P>(4) Indicate whether or not it appears that, considering the location and cost of development, adequate building sites can be provided at reasonable costs.</P>

                <P>(5) If the option is for a tract of land on which 5 or more sites are proposed, the County Supervisor will forward to the District Director with recommendations as defined in § 1924.119 of subpart C of part 1924 of this chapter.<PRTPAGE P="159"/>
                </P>

                <P>The State Director is authorized to approve SO loans developed in accordance with this exhibit. The approval or disapproval of the loan will be handled in the same manner as provided in § 1822.272 of subpart F of part 1822 of this chapter (FmHA Instruction 444.8, paragraph XII). SO loans will be established in Automated Multiple Housing Accounting System (AMAS) using Form RD 3560-51, “Multiple Family Housing Obligation Fund Analysis”. The Issue loan/Grant checks transaction will be used to request a check for SO loans.</P>

                <P>(i) The Finance Office will notify the State Office by telephone when funds are reserved and of the date of obligation. If funds cannot be reserved for a project, the Finance Office will notify the State Office that funds are not available. The obligation date will be the date the request for obligation is processed.</P>
                <P>(ii) The Finance Office will terminally process telephone obligation requests. Those requests received prior to 2:30 p.m. Central Time will be processed on the date of the request. Those requests received after 2:30 p.m., to the extent possible, will be processed on the day received; however, there may be instances where the obligation will be processed on the next working day.</P>
                <P>(iii) The Finance Office will mail Form RD 440-57, “Acknowledgement of Obligated Funds/Check Request,” to the State Director, confirming the reservation of funds with the obligation date inserted as required by Item 9 on the Forms Manual Insert (FMI) for Form RD 440-57.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Part C—Grantee agrees:</HD>

                <P>(1) To comply with property management standards for expendable and nonexpendable personal property established by Attachment N of OMB Circular A-102 or Attachment N of 2 CFR part 200 as adopted by USDA through <PRTPAGE P="176"/>2 CFR part 400 for State and local governments or nonprofit organizations respectively. “Personal property” means property of any kind except real property. It may be tangible—having physical existence—or intangible-having no physical existence, such as patents, inventions, and copyrights. “Nonexpendable personal property” means tangible personal property having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $300 or more per unit. A Grantee may use its own definition of nonexpendable personal property provided that such definition would at least include all tangible personal property as defined above. “Expendable personal property” refers to all tangible personal property other than nonexpendable personal property. When nonexpendable tangible personal property is acquired by a Grantee with project funds, title shall not be taken by the Federal Government but shall vest in the Grantee subject to the following conditions:</P>
                <P>(a) Right to transfer title. For items of nonexpendable personal property having a unit acquisition cost of $1,000 or more, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 may reserve the right to transfer title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by the Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such reservation shall be subject to the following standards:</P>
                <P>(i) The property shall be appropriately identified in the grant or otherwise made known to the Grantee in writing.</P>
                <P>(ii) FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the project for which it was acquired. If FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the Grantee shall apply the standards of paragraph 1(c) below.</P>
                <P>(iii) When FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 exercises its right to take title, the personal property shall be subject to the provisions for federally owned nonexpendable property discussed in paragraph 1(a)(iv) below.</P>
                <P>(iv) When title is transferred either to the Federal Government or to a third party and the Grantee is instructed to ship the property elsewhere, the Grantee shall be reimbursed by the benefitting Federal agency with an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the Grantee participation in the cost of the original grant project or program to the current fair market value of the property, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred.</P>
                <P>(b) Use of other tangible nonexpendable property for which the Grantee has title.</P>
                <P>(i) The Grantee shall use the property in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds. When it is no longer needed for the original project or program, the Grantee shall use the property in connection with its other federally sponsored activities, in the following order of priority:</P>
                <P>(A) Activities sponsored by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</P>
                <P>(B) Activities sponsored by other Federal agencies.</P>
                <P>(ii) Shared use. During the time that nonexpendable personal property is held for use on the project or program for which it was acquired, the Grantee shall make it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the property was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other projects or programs sponsored by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354; second preference shall be given to projects or programs sponsored by other Federal agencies. If the property is owned by the Federal Government, use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. User charges should be considered if appropriate.</P>
                <P>(c) Disposition of other nonexpendable property. When the Grantee no longer needs the property, the property may be used for other activities in accordance with the following standards:</P>
                <P>(i) Nonexpendable property with a unit acquisition cost of less than $1,000. The Grantee may use the property for other activities without reimbursement to the Federal Government or sell the property and retain the proceeds.</P>

                <P>(ii) Nonexpendable personal property with a unit acquisition cost of $1,000 or more. The Grantee may retain the property for other use provided that compensation is made to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the property.

                <P>(B) If the Grantee is instructed to dispose of the property other than as described in paragraph 1(a)(iv) above, the Grantee shall be reimbursed by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for such costs incurred in its disposition.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Exhibit B to Subpart K of Part 1944—Administrative Instructions for State Offices Regarding Their Responsibilities in the Administration of the Technical and Supervisory Assistance Grant Program</HD>
                <P>A. The State Office will maintain for distribution to potential applicants, upon request, a supply of preapplication packets consisting of:</P>
                <P>1. SF 424.1.</P>
                <P>2. Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 400-1, “Equal Opportunity Agreement.”</P>
                <P>3. Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 400-4, “Assurance Agreement.”</P>
                <P>4. Environmental review documentation in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970.</P>
                <P>5. Subpart K of part 1944 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>B. The State Office should inform all potential applicants, at the time they pick up forms, that:</P>
                <P>1. The preapplication must be submitted to the District Office serving the area in which the applicant proposes to operate the Technical and Supervisory Assistance (TSA) program.</P>
                <P>2. The State Office will refer all requests for assistance in completing the preapplication to the appropriate District Office.</P>
                <P>C. Beyond the responsibilities of the State Office in the selection of grantees and the administration of the program, and as stated in § 1944.502 of this subpart, the TSA program provides an opportunity for the State Director to give priority to applicants serving the rural areas of greatest need as well as use the program cooperatively with other Federal and State agencies in addressing the housing needs of the residents of a proposed TSA service area. Therefore, the State Office should be prepared, before receipt of preapplications, to advise the District Directors, potential applicants and other Federal and State agencies which part(s) of the State has the greatest need for the TSA program. The State Director should identify target areas in a similar manner to the process used by the Administrator pursuant to § 1944.525 of this subpart. Proposals which are clearly inappropriate and do not meet the basic priorities of § 1944.529 (a) of this subpart should not be encouraged due to the complexity of the preapplication submission.</P>
                <P>D. In addition to the instructions of § 1944.526 of this subpart, the State Office should follow the procedures outlined below:</P>
                <P>1. Review preapplications for completeness and adequacy and make assessments required by § 1944.526(c)(1) of this subpart.</P>
                <P>2. Request clarifications from the District Office if necessary.</P>
                <P>3. Evaluate the proposals in light of § 1944.529 of this subpart and select the proposal(s) which best meets the priorities established under the project selection criteria in § 1944.529 (a), (b) and (c) of this subpart.</P>
                <P>4. The State Office must provide written comments to be attached to the preapplication(s) justifying the selection(s) and addressing the items in § 1944.529 of this subpart.</P>

                <P>5. The State Office will forward the original SF 424.1 and accompanying documents of the selected preapplication(s) as quickly as possible to the National Office, Attention: Special Authorities Division, Multi-Family Housing. In no case should the State Office forward their selected TSA preapplication(s) <PRTPAGE P="180"/>later than thirty (30) days after the closing date for receipt of preapplications.</P>
                <P>6. Preapplications not selected by the State Office will be returned to the applicants through the appropriate District Offices with notice of appeal rights.</P>
                <P>7. In accordance with § 1944.525 of this subpart, State Offices will be advised of the number of preapplications to be submitted from each state to the National Office.</P>
                <P>E. Sections 1944.531 and 1944.533 of this subpart detail the responsibilities of the State Office after tentative selection or concurrence of the TSA grantees by the National Office. Those preapplicants not selected will be promptly notified and their preapplication returned with notice of appeal rights. Form AD-622, “Notice of Preapplication Review Action,” will be mailed from the State Office to the applicants. District Offices will receive a copy from the State Office.</P>
                <P>F. After execution of the grant agreement, the State Office will work closely with the District Office and the grantee to obtain additional resources from other Federal and State agencies to meet the needs of the TSA service area. The State Office should closely review the quarterly project performance reports and assist the District Director, as appropriate, in resolving any problems or taking advantage of favorable funding or program opportunities.</P>

                <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) This subpart sets forth the policies and procedures for making grants under section 533 of the Housing Act of 1949, 42 U.S.C. 1490(m), to provide funds to eligible applicants (hereafter also referred to as grantee(s)) to conduct housing preservation programs benefiting very low- and low-income rural residents. Program funds cover part or all of the grantee's cost of providing loans, grants, interest reduction payments or other assistance to eligible homeowners, owners of single or multiple unit rental properties or for the benefit of owners (as occupants) of consumer cooperative housing projects (hereafter also referred to as co-ops). Such assistance will be used to reduce the cost of repair and rehabilitation, to <PRTPAGE P="182"/>remove or correct health or safety hazards, to comply with applicable development standards or codes, or to make needed repairs to improve the general living conditions of the resident(s), including improved accessibility by handicapped persons. Such assistance will be used to reduce the cost of repair and rehabilitation, to remove or correct health or safety hazards, to comply with applicable development standards or codes, or to make needed repairs to improve the general living conditions of the residents, including improved accessibility by persons with a disability. Individual housing that is owner occupied may qualify for replacement housing when it is determined by the grantee that the housing is not economically feasible for repair or rehabilitation.</P>
                <P>(b) The Rural Housing Service (RHS) will provide Housing Preservation Grant (HPG) assistance to grantees who are responsible for providing assistance to eligible persons without discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, familial status, or disability.</P>
                <P>(c) The preapplication must only address a proposal to finance repairs and rehabilitation activities to individual housing or rental properties or co-ops. Any combination proposal will not be accepted.</P>
                <P>(d) Any processing or servicing activity conducted pursuant to this subpart involving authorized assistance to RHS employees, members of their families, known close relatives, or business or close personal associates, is subject to the provisions of subpart D of part 1900 of this chapter. Applicants for this assistance are required to identify any known relationship or association with an RHS employee.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The policy of RHS is to provide HPG's to grantees to operate a program which finances repair and rehabilitation activities to individual housing, rental properties, or co-ops for very low- and low-income persons. Individual housing that is owner occupied may qualify for replacement housing when it is determined by the grantee that the housing is not economically feasible for repair or rehabilitation. Grantees are expected to:</P>
                <P>(1) Coordinate and leverage funding for repair and rehabilitation activities, as well as replacement housing, with housing and community development organizations or activities operating in the same geographic area; and</P>
                <P>(2) Focus the program on rural areas and smaller communities so that it serves very low and low-income persons.</P>
                <P>(b) RHS intends to permit grantees considerable latitude in program design and administration. The forms or types of assistance must provide the greatest long-term benefit to the greatest number of persons residing in individual housing, rental properties, or co-ops needing repair and rehabilitation or replacement of individual housing.</P>
                <P>(c) Repairs and rehabilitation or replacement activities affecting properties on or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places will be accomplished in a manner that supports national historic preservation objectives as specified in § 1944.673.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Objective.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The objective of the HPG program is to repair or rehabilitate individual housing, rental properties, or co-ops owned and/or occupied by very low- and low-income rural persons. Grantees will provide eligible homeowners, owners of rental properties, and owners of co-ops with financial assistance through loans, grants, interest reduction payments or other comparable financial assistance for necessary repairs and rehabilitation. Further, individual housing that is owner occupied may qualify for replacement housing when it is determined by the grantee that the housing is not economically feasible for repair or rehabilitation, except as specified in § 1944.659.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Debarment and suspension—drug-free workplace.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) For purposes of this subpart, exhibit A of RD Instruction 1940-M <PRTPAGE P="183"/>(available in any Agency office) requires all Rural Development applicants; for an HPG to sign and submit with their preapplication, Form AD-1047, “Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, and Other Responsibility Matters—Primary Covered Transactions,” which basically states that the applicant has not been debarred or suspended from Government assistance. Further, all grantees after receiving a HPG must obtain a signed certification (Form AD-1048, “Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion—Lower Tier Covered Transactions”) from all persons or entities (excluding homeowner recipients) that the grantee does business with as a result of the HPG. Grantees are responsible for informing these persons or entities of the provisions of exhibit A of RD Instruction 1940-M (available in any Agency office) and of maintaining Form AD-1048 in the grantee's office.</P>
                <P>(b) Grantees must also be made aware of the Drug-free Workplace Act of 1988 requirements found in exhibit A of RD Instruction 1940-M (available in any Rural Development office). For this subpart, a grantee is defined as any organization who applies for or receives a direct grant from Rural Development. All preapplications must include a signed Form AD-1049, “Certification Regarding Drug-free Workplace Requirements (Grants) Alternative I—Grants Other Than Individuals.”</P>

                <P>(4) Must be able to afford the replacement housing on terms set forth by the HPG grantee.</P>
                <P>(c) The existing home:</P>

                <SUBJECT>Individual homeowners—eligibility for HPG assistance.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The individual homeowners assisted must have income that meets the very low- or low-income definitions, be the owner of an individual dwelling at least 1 year prior to the time of assistance, and be the intended occupant of the dwelling subsequent to the time of assistance. The dwelling must be located in a rural area and be in need of housing preservation assistance. Each homeowner is required to submit evidence of income and ownership for retention in the grantee's files.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Income.</E> Determination of income will be made in accordance with 7 CFR 3550.54(c). All members of the household, as defined in § 1944.656 of this subpart, must be included when determining income. Grantees must use certifications, may require additional information from the homeowner, and should seek advice from their attorney.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Ownership.</E> Evidence of ownership may be a photostatic copy of the instrument evidencing ownership. Methods for assuring the intention of the homeowner to continue to occupy the unit after assistance will be established by the grantee. Any of the following will satisfy or fulfill this requirement of ownership:</P>
                <P>(1) Full marketable title.</P>
                <P>(2) An undivided or divided interest in the property to be repaired, rehabilitated, or replaced when not all of the owners are occupying the property. HPG assistance may be made in such cases when:</P>
                <P>(i) The occupant has been living in the house for at least 1 year prior to the date of requesting assistance;</P>
                <P>(ii) The grantee has no reason to believe the occupant's position of owner/occupant will be jeopardized as a result of the improvements to be made with HPG funds; and</P>
                <P>(iii) In the case of a loan, and to the extent possible, the co-owner(s) should also sign the security instrument.</P>
                <P>(3) A leasehold interest in the property to be repaired, rehabilitated, or replaced. When the potential HPG recipient's “ownership” interest in the property is based on a leasehold interest, the lease must be in writing and a copy must be included in the grantee's file. The unexpired portion of the lease must not be less than 5 years and must permit the recipient to make modifications to the structure without increasing the recipient's lease cost.</P>
                <P>(4) A life estate, with the right of present possession, control, and beneficial use of the property.</P>
                <P>(5) Land assignments may be accepted as evidence of ownership only for American Indians living on a reservation, when historically the permits have been used by the tribe and have had the comparable effect of a life estate.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Other evidence of ownership.</E> The following items may be accepted as evidence of ownership if a recorded deed cannot be provided:</P>
                <P>(1) Any legal instrument, whether or not recorded, which is commonly considered evidence of ownership.</P>
                <P>(2) Evidence that the person(s) receiving assistance from the HPG grantee is listed as the owner of the property by the local taxing authority and is responsible for any real estate taxes.</P>
                <P>(3) Affidavits by others in the community that the person(s) receiving assistance from the HPG grantee has occupied the property as the apparent owner for a period of not less than 10 years, and is generally believed to be the owner.</P>

The HPG grantee is responsible for preparing, executing, and monitoring for compliance, the ownership agreement with the owner(s) of the rental property or the co-op. The rental property owner(s) or the co-ops are required to enter into an ownership agreement with the grantee to assure compliance with the requirements of this section.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Ownership agreement.</E> At a minimum, the ownership agreement must include the following clauses:</P>

                <P>(2) The owner(s) agrees to pass on to the tenants any reduction in the debt service payments resulting from the HPG assistance provided by the HPG grantee to the owner(s).</P>
                <P>(3) The owner(s) of rental properties agrees not to convert the units to condominium ownership.

The interest rate shall be that as determined by Rural Development at the time of infraction taking into account the average yield on outstanding marketable long-term obligations of the United States during the month preceding the date on which the assistance was initially made available.</P>
                <P>(8) The owner(s) agrees that, notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the HPG assistance provided to the owner(s) shall constitute a debt which is payable in the case of any failure of this section and shall be secured by a security instrument provided by the owner(s) or co-op to the grantee, that provides for Rural Development to take such action upon incapacity or dissolution of the grantee.</P>
                <P>(9) The owner(s) agrees and certifies that the assistance is being made available in conformity with Public Law 88-352, the “Civil Rights Act of 1964,” and Public Law 90-284, the “Civil Rights Act of 1968.”</P>

                <P>(4) That, for multi-units not considered eligible as a result of paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, the grantee and owner(s) shall agree on a method, if any is needed, of determining the prorata share of repairs and rehabilitation activities to the dwelling, based on a percentage of the ineligible units to the total dwelling.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Fair housing.</E> The Fair Housing Act prohibits any person or entity whose business includes engaging in residential real estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person in making loans, grants, or other financial assistance for a unit or dwelling, or which will be secured by a unit or dwelling, because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, familial status, or handicap/disability. Prohibited practices under this section include:</P>
                <P>(1) Failing to provide any person in connection with a residential real estate-related transaction, information regarding the availability of loans, grants, or other financial assistance, or providing information that is inaccurate or different from that provided others; and</P>
                <P>(2) The term <E T="03">residential and real estate-related transaction</E> includes the making or purchasing of loans, grants, or other financial assistance for purchasing, constructing, improving, repairing, or rehabilitating a unit or dwelling, as well as for replacement housing for individual homeowners.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Outreach.</E> In addition, the HPG grantee is required to address an outreach effort in their program. The amount of outreach should sufficiently reach the entire service area. As a measure of compliance, the percentages of the individuals served by the HPG grantee should be in proportion to the percentages of the population of the service area by race/national origin. If the percentages are not proportional, then adequate justification is to be made. Exhibit E-1 of this subpart (available in any Rural Development office) will be used to monitor these requirements. (Further explanation and guidance of exhibit E-1 can be found in exhibit E-2 of this subpart which is available in any Rural Development office). A separate file will be maintained by the grantee that will include the following outreach activities:</P>
                <P>(1) Community contacts to community organizations, community leaders, including minority leaders, by name, race, and date contacted;</P>

                <P>(2) Copies of all advertising in local newspapers, and through other media. Any advertising must reach the entire service area. Rural Development encourages the use of minority-owned radio stations and other types of media, if available, in the service area. <PRTPAGE P="193"/>The grantee's file shall also include the name of the media used, and the percentage of its patronage by race/national origin; and</P>
                <P>(3) Copies of any other advertising or other printed material, including the application form used. The application form shall include the nondiscrimination slogan: “This is an equal opportunity program. Discrimination is prohibited by Federal Law.”</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Additional requirements.</E> In order to meet the Fair Housing requirements and the nondiscrimination requirements of Title VI of the Civil rights Act of 1964, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, the HPG grantee will need to adhere to the recommendations of exhibit H of this subpart (available in any Rural Development office).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Environmental review requirements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Grants made under this subpart must comply with the environmental review requirements in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970.</P>
                <P>(a) The approval of an HPG grant for the repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of dwellings is classified as a Categorical Exclusion, pursuant to § 1970.53. As part of their pre-application materials, applicants shall submit environmental documentation in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970, for the geographical areas proposed to be served by the program. The applicant shall refer to Part 1944 Subpart N Exhibit F-1.</P>
                <P>(b) The use of HPG funds by the grantee to repair, rehabilitate, or replace on the same site, specific dwellings is generally exempt from an RHS environmental review. However, if such dwellings are located in a floodplain, wetland, or the proposed work is not concurred in by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation under the requirements of § 1944.673, an RHS environmental review is required. Dwellings within the Coastal Barrier Resources System are not eligible for HPG assistance. Applicants must include in their preapplication a process for identifying dwellings that may receive housing preservation or replacement housing assistance that will require an environmental assessment. This may be accomplished through use of exhibit F-2 of this subpart (available in any Rural Development State or District Office) or another process supplying similar information acceptable to RHS.</P>
                <P>(c) If a specific dwelling is not located in a floodplain, wetland, or the proposed work is concurred in by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation under the requirements of § 1944.673 of this subpart, no environmental review is required by Rural Development. The grantee only needs to indicate its review and compliance with this subpart, indicating such in each recipient's file in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) When an HPG proposal does not qualify as a categorical exclusion under § 1970.53 and may require either an environmental report under § 1970.54 or an environmental assessment, the applicant will immediately contact the RHS office designated to service the HPG grant. Prior to approval of HPG assistance to the recipient by the applicant, RHS must complete the environmental review process in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970, with the assistance of the applicant, as necessary.</P>
                <P>(e) If Rural Development is required to make an environmental assessment, the grantee will be provided with a copy of the assessment which will be made part of the recipient's file. The grantee must also include in each recipient's file:</P>
                <P>(1) Documentation on how the process for historic preservation review under § 1944.673 of this subpart has been complied with, including all relevant reviews and correspondence; and</P>
                <P>(2) Determination as to whether the unit is located in a 100-year floodplain or a wetland.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Documentation of this review.</E> Suggested language is: “We have considered this dwelling under Rural Development's environmental and historic preservation requirements for a HPG (§§ 1944.672 and 1944.673 of this subpart) and an environmental assessment is not required. The review was completed in accordance with the process to identify properties requiring a Rural <PRTPAGE P="194"/>Development environmental assessment approved with our statement of activities.”</P>
                <P>(f) Proposed use of funds by an applicant to use monies for additions under § 1944.664 (c)(11) of this subpart must be addressed in the statement of activities.</P>
                <P>(g) Grantees must contact Rural Development prior to actual usage of funds by the grantees under § 1944.664 (c)(11) of this subpart. Rural Development must complete the appropriate level of environmental review in accordance with part 1970 of this chapter.</P>

                <P>(a) Rural Development has entered into a Programmatic Memorandum of Agreement (PMOA) with the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers (SHPO) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in order to implement the specific requirements regarding historic preservation contained in section 533 of the Housing Act of 1949, 42 U.S.C. 1490(m) of the enabling legislation. The PMOA, with attachments, can be found in RD Instruction 2000-FF (available in any Rural Development office). A copy of the PMOA will be provided to each applicant for a HPG as part of the preapplication package specified in paragraph II of exhibit C of this subpart (available in any Rural Development office).</P>
                <P>(b) Each applicant for an HPG grant will provide, as part of its preapplication documentation submitted to RHS, a description of its proposed process for assisting very low-and low-income persons owning historic properties needing rehabilitation, repair, or replacement. “Historic properties” are defined as properties that are listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Each HPG proposal shall comply with the provisions of Stipulation I, A-G of the PMOA (RD Instruction 2000-FF), available in any Rural Development State or District Office. Should RHS be required to assume responsibility for compliance with 36 CFR part 800 in accordance with Stipulation III of the PMOA, the grantee will assist RHS in preparing an environmental assessment. RHS will work with the grantee to develop alternative actions or mitigation measures, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(c) Such assumption of responsibility by Rural Development on a particular property shall not preclude the grantee from carrying out the requirements of 36 CFR part 800 on other properties as though it were a Federal agency, but no work may be commenced on any unit or dwelling in controversy until and unless so advised by Rural Development.</P>

                <P>(c) The HPG program is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. These requirements are set forth in U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, and RD Instruction 1970-I, ‘Intergovernmental Review,’ available in any Agency office or on the Agency's Web site. <PRTPAGE P="195"/>Prospective applicants for HPG grants must submit its statement of activities to the State single point of contact prior to submitting their preapplication to Rural Development.

                <SUBJECT>Project selection criteria.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Applicants must meet all of the following threshold criteria:</P>

                <P>(1) Provide a financially feasible program of housing preservation assistance. <E T="03">Financially feasible</E> is defined as proposed assistance which will be affordable to the intended recipient or result in affordable housing for very low- and low-income persons;</P>
                <P>(2) Serve eligible rural areas with a concentration of substandard housing for households with very low- and low-income;</P>
                <P>(3) Be an eligible applicant entity as defined in § 1944.658 of this subpart;</P>
                <P>(4) Meet the requirements of consultation and public comment in accordance with § 1944.674 of this subpart; and</P>
                <P>(5) Submit a complete preapplication as outlined in § 1944.676 of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(b) For applicants meeting all of the requirements listed in paragraph (a) of this section, Rural Development will use the weighted criteria in this paragraph (b) in the selection of grant recipients. Each preapplication and its accompanying statement of activities will be evaluated and, based solely on the information contained in the preapplication, the applicant's proposal will be numerically rated on each criteria within the range provided. The highest ranking applicant(s) will be selected based on allocation of funds available to the State. Exhibit D of this subpart (available in any Rural Development office) will be used to document the rating.</P>

                <P>(1) Points are awarded based on the percentage of very low-income persons that the applicant proposes to assist, using the following scale:<PRTPAGE P="198"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) More than 80%: 20 points.</P>
                <P>(ii) 61% to 80%: 15 points.</P>
                <P>(iii) 41% to 60%: 10 points.</P>
                <P>(iv) 20% to 40%: 5 points.</P>
                <P>(v) Less than 20%: 0 points.</P>
                <P>(2) The applicant's proposal may be expected to result in the following percentage of HPG fund use (excluding administrative costs) to total cost of unit preservation. This percentage reflects maximum repair or rehabilitation with the least possible HPG funds due to leveraging, innovative financial assistance, owner's contribution or other specified approaches. Points are awarded based on the following percentage of HPG funds (excluding administrative costs) to total funds:</P>
                <P>(i) 50% or less: 20 points.</P>
                <P>(ii) 51% to 65%: 15 points.</P>
                <P>(iii) 66% to 80%: 10 points.</P>
                <P>(iv) 81% to 95%: 5 points.</P>
                <P>(v) 96% to 100%: 0 points.</P>
                <P>(3) The applicant has demonstrated its administrative capacity in assisting very low- and low-income persons to obtain adequate housing based on the following:</P>
                <P>(i) The organization or a member of its staff has at least one or more years experience successfully managing and operating a rehabilitation or weatherization type program: 10 points.</P>
                <P>(ii) The organization or a member of its staff has at least one or more years experience successfully managing and operating a program assisting very low- and low-income persons obtain housing assistance: 10 points.</P>
                <P>(iii) If the organization has administered grant programs, there are no outstanding or unresolved audit or investigative findings which might impair carrying out the proposal: 10 points.</P>

                <P>(4) The proposed program will be undertaken entirely in rural areas outside MSAs identified by Rural Development as having populations below 10,000 <E T="03">or</E> in remote parts of other rural areas (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, rural areas contained in MSAs with less than 5,000 population) as defined in § 1944.656 of this subpart: 10 points.</P>
                <P>(5) The program will use less than 20 percent of HPG funds for administration purposes:</P>
                <P>(i) More than 20%: Not Eligible.</P>
                <P>(ii) 20%: 0 points.</P>
                <P>(iii) 19%: 1 point.</P>
                <P>(iv) 18%: 2 points.</P>
                <P>(v) 17%: 3 points.</P>
                <P>(vi) 16%: 4 points.</P>
                <P>(vii) 15% or less: 5 points.</P>
                <P>(6) The proposed program contains a component for alleviating overcrowding as defined in § 1944.656 of this subpart: 5 points.</P>
                <P>(c) In the event more than one preapplication receives the same amount of points, those preapplications will then be ranked based on the actual percentage figure used for determining the points under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Further, in the event that preapplications are still tied, then those preapplications still tied will be ranked based on the percentage figures used (low to high) in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Further, for applications where assistance to rental properties or co-ops is proposed, those still tied will be further ranked based on the number of years the units are available for occupancy under the program (a minimum of 5 years is required). For this part, ranking will be based from most to least number of years. Finally, if there is still a tie, then a “lottery” System will be used.</P>

                <P>The Rural Development offices processing HPG preapplications/applications will review the preapplications and applications submitted. Further review and actions will be taken by Rural Development personnel in accordance with exhibit C of this subpart (available in any Rural Development office). Exhibit G of this subpart (available in any Rural Development office) will be used by the State Office to notify the National Office of preapplications received, eligibility, ranking, number of proposed units, amount requested by applicants, and amount recommended by State Office. Preapplications determined not eligible and/or not meeting the selection criteria will be notified in the manner prescribed in exhibit C of this subpart (available in any Rural Development office). In addition, Rural Development will document its findings and advise the applicant of its review rights or appeal rights (if applicable) under subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter. Applications determined not eligible will be handled in the same manner. The preapplications or applications determined incomplete will be notified in the manner prescribed in exhibit C of this subpart (available in any Rural Development office) and will not be given appeal rights. The State Director is authorized to approve an HPG in accordance with this subpart and subpart A of part 1901 of this chapter. The State Director may delegate this authority in writing to designated State Office personnel and District Directors. Further:</P>
                <P>(a) Grant approval is the process by which Rural Development determines that all applicable administrative and legal conditions for making a grant have been met, the grant agreement is signed, and funds have been obligated for the HPG project. If acceptable, the approval official will inform the applicant of approval, having the applicant sign Form RD 1940-1, “Request for Obligation of Funds,” and exhibit A of this subpart (available in any Rural Development office). The applicant will be sent a copy of the executed grant agreement and Form RD 1940-1. Should any conditions be attached to the grant agreement that must be satisfied prior to the applicant receiving any HPG funds, the grant agreement and the conditions will be returned to the applicant for acceptance and acknowledgement on the grant agreement prior to execution by the approval official.</P>
                <P>(b) The application may be disapproved before execution of the grant agreement if the applicant is no longer eligible, the proposal is no longer feasible, or the applicant requests cancellation of its project. Except when the applicant requests cancellation, Rural Development will document its findings and advise the applicant of its appeal rights under subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(c) With the executed grant agreement and Form RD 1940-1, Rural Development will send the approved applicant (now the “grantee”) copies of SF-270, “Request for Advance or Reimbursement”. The grantee must submit an original and two copies of SF-270 to the Rural Development office servicing the project. In addition, the grantee must submit SF-272, “Federal Cash Transactions Report,” each time an advance of funds is made. This report shall be used by Rural Development to monitor cash advances made to the grantee. Advances or reimbursements must be in accordance with the grantee's budget and statement of activities, including any amendments, prior approved by Rural Development. Requests for reimbursement or advances must be at least 30 calendar days apart.</P>
                <P>(d) If the grantee fails to submit required reports pursuant to § 1944.683 of this subpart or is in violation of the grant agreement, Rural Development may suspend HPG reimbursements and advances or terminate the grant in accordance with § 1944.688 of this subpart and the grant agreement.</P>

                <P>(5) Reasons why, if established objectives are not met.</P>
                <P>(6) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially affect attainment of the HPG grant objectives, prevent the meeting of time schedules or objectives, or preclude the attainment of program work elements during established time periods. This disclosure shall be accompanied by a statement of the action taken or contemplated and any Federal or other assistance needed to relieve the situation.</P>
                <P>(7) Objectives established for the next reporting period, sufficiently detailed to identify the type of assistance to be provided, the number and type of households to be assisted, etc.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Part C—Grantee agrees</HD>

                <P>1. To comply with property management standards for expendable and nonexpendable personal property established by Attachment N of OMB Circular A-102 or Attachment N of OMB Circular A-110 for State and local governments or nonprofit organizations respectively. <E T="03">Personal property</E> means property of any kind except real property. It may be tangible—having physical existence—or intangible—having no physical existence, such as patents, inventions, and copyrights. <E T="03">Nonexpendable personal property</E> means tangible personal property having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $300 or more per unit. A grantee may use its own definitions of nonexpendable personal property provided that such definition would at least include all tangible personal property as defined above. <E T="03">Expendable personal property</E> refers to all tangible personal property other than nonexpendable personal property. When nonexpendable tangible personal property is acquired by a grantee with project funds, title shall not be taken by the Federal Government but shall vest in the grantee subject to the following conditions:</P>
                <P>(a) Right to transfer title. For items of nonexpendable personal property having a unit acquisition cost of $1,000 or more, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 may reserve the right to transfer title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by the Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such reservation shall be subject to the following standards:</P>
                <P>(i) The property shall be appropriately identified in the grant or otherwise made known to the grantee in writing.</P>
                <P>(ii) FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the project for which it was acquired. If FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the grantee shall apply the standards of paragraph 1(c) below.</P>
                <P>(iii) When FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 exercises its right to take title, the personal property shall be subject to the provisions for federally owned nonexpendable property discussed in paragraph 1(a)(iv) below.</P>
                <P>(iv) When title is transferred either to the Federal Government or to a third party and the grantee is instructed to ship the property elsewhere, the grantee shall be reimbursed by the benefitting Federal agency with an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the grantee participation in the cost of the original grant project or program to the current fair market value of the property, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred.</P>
                <P>(b) Use of other tangible nonexpendable property for which the grantee has title.</P>
                <P>(i) The grantee shall use the property in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds. When it is no longer needed for the original project or program, the grantee shall use the property in connection with its other federally sponsored activities, in the following order of priority:</P>
                <P>(A) Activities sponsored by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</P>
                <P>(B) Activities sponsored by other Federal agencies.</P>
                <P>(ii) Shared use. During the time that nonexpendable personal property is held for use on the project or program for which it was acquired, the grantee shall make it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the property was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other projects or programs sponsored by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354; second preference shall be given to projects or programs sponsored by other Federal agencies. If the property is owned by the Federal Government, use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. User charges should be considered if appropriate.</P>
                <P>(c) Disposition of other nonexpendable property. When the grantee no longer needs the property, the property may be used for other activities in accordance with the following standards:</P>
                <P>(i) Nonexpendable property with a unit acquisition cost of less than $1,000. The grantee may use the property for other activities without reimbursement to the Federal Government or sell the property and retain the proceeds.</P>

                <P>(ii) Nonexpendable personal property with a unit acquisition cost of $1,000 or more. The grantee may retain the property for other use provided that compensation is made to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the property. If the grantee has no need for the property and the property has further use value, the grantee shall request disposition instructions from the original Grantor agency. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall determine whether the property can be used to meet the agency's <PRTPAGE P="207"/>requirements. If no requirement exists within that agency, the availability of the property shall be reported, in accordance with the guidelines of the Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR) to the General Services Administration by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to determine whether a requirement for the property exists in other Federal agencies. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall issue instructions to the grantee no later than 120 calendar days after the grantee request and the following procedures shall govern:</P>
                <P>(A) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the grantee's request, the grantee shall sell the property and reimburse FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 an amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. However, the grantee shall be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal shares $100 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is greater, for the grantee's selling and handling expenses.</P>
                <P>(B) If the grantee is instructed to dispose of the property other than as described in paragraph 1(a)(iv) above, the grantee shall be reimbursed by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for such costs incurred in its disposition.</P>
                <P>(C) The grantee's property management standards for nonexpendable personal property shall include the following procedural requirements:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Property records shall be maintained accurately and shall include:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) A description of the property.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, national stock number, or other identification number.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) Sources of the property including grant or other agreement number.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">d</E>) Whether title vests in the grantee or the Federal Government.</P>

                <P>(<E T="03">f</E>) Percentage (at the end of the budget year) of Federal participation in the cost of the project or program for which the property was acquired. (Not applicable to property furnished by the Federal Government).</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">g</E>) Location, use, and condition of the property and the date the information was reported.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">h</E>) Unit acquisition cost.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales price or the method used to determine current fair market value when a grantee compensates the Federal agency for its share.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Property owned by the Federal Government must be marked to indicate Federal ownership.</P>

                <P>(b) The Governor will define the geographic area of a designated area consistent with the nature of the impact and the socio-economic integration of the area.</P>
                <P>(c) The Governor may designate an area as an energy impacted area based on the criteria contained in this subpart.</P>
              </SECTION>
              <SECTION>
                <SECTNO>§ 1948.68</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Criteria for designation.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) An area designated by the Governor must have the following characteristics:</P>
                <P>(1) During the most recent calendar year, the eligible employment in coal or uranium development activities within the area has increased by eight percent or more from the preceding year, or such employment (as projected by generally acceptable estimates) will increase by eight percent (of the eligible employment in the year of the designation) or more per year during each of the next three calendar years.</P>
                <P>(2) Because of increased employment in coal or uranium development activities, a shortage of housing, inadequate public facilities, or services exists or will exist in the area. Such shortages or inadequacies may be demonstrated by: Housing shortage statistics; higher occupancy rates of substandard houses than has historically occurred within the area; an increase (for which data or projected data is available) in eligible employment from the year of the designation of at least 100 workers and one-half of one percent of the designated area's population; or data showing that available public facilities and services in the area are below generally accepted standards due to the increased demand resulting from coal and uranium development activities.</P>

                <P>(3) Available State and local financial resources are inadequate to meet the public need for housing or public facilities and services at present or in the next three years. In making this <PRTPAGE P="217"/>determination the Governor should consider the following:</P>
                <P>(i) State revenue increases resulting from coal and uranium development activity based on existing tax laws;</P>
                <P>(ii) Federal funds transferred to the State for impact assistance;</P>
                <P>(iii) Local revenue increases resulting from coal or uranium development activities based on existing tax laws;</P>
                <P>(iv) Other federal financial assistance to which the area may have access;</P>
                <P>(v) All other available State and local sources of funding;</P>
                <P>(vi) The time during which the resources will be available;</P>
                <P>(vii) Existing laws committing increases in State and local revenues and Federal transfers to purposes other than impact assistance; and</P>
                <P>(viii) The estimated cost of development based on the best available informed judgment.</P>
                <P>(b) Designations submitted to the Secretary of Energy for approval must have the following attached:</P>
                <P>(1) A list of all counties and parts of counties covered by the designation;</P>
                <P>(2) If the area is smaller than a county, a map showing the boundary of the area and the approximate location of all eligible employment facilities in the area and nearby;</P>
                <P>(3) A written justification for the inclusion of an area if the area is smaller than a county;</P>
                <P>(4) The level of eligible employment within the designated area for each of the two most recent calendar years. This data should be obtained from a single source for the entire State, if possible; special surveys may be used when the Governor determines that these more accurately reflect employment conditions within the designated area, or in cases where data from other sources for the most recent calendar year is unavailable at the time of designation. Reference should be made to the data sources used if it is a Federal source; if a non-Federal sources is used, a copy of the source and a brief description of the procedures used for justification should be included. If projections of eligible employment are to be considered, projections of such employment for the next three years must be attached; identification of data sources and methodology used in developing those projections and a copy of any survey data used should be included.</P>
                <P>(c) In areas where the impacted area covers counties or parts of counties located in more than one State, the Governors of the affected States may jointly designate such area and submit the designation to the Secretary of Energy for approval.</P>
                <P>(d) After examining these factors and determining that the area meets the criteria of (a) above, the Governor may so certify in a letter bearing his or her signature and submit the letter of certification with all data and estimates upon which the designation is based to the Secretary of Energy for approval.</P>
                <P>(e) Each designation submitted should have the name and phone number of a contact person in the Governor's designating office.</P>
                <P>(f) An original and one copy of the designation should be submitted to the Secretary of Energy, Department of Energy, Mail Stop 8G-031, Forrestal Building, Washington, DC 20585.</P>
                <P>(g) Two copies of all designations submitted for approval shall be submitted to the appropriate Rural Development State Director. The Rural Development State Director shall forward one copy to the Office of Area Development Assistance in the Rural Development National Office.</P>
                <P>(h) The Governor should designate all areas expected to be considered in fiscal year 1979 allocations of funds before July 1, 1979.</P>

                <FP SOURCE="FP-1">(Address),(Grantee) and the United States of America acting through the Farmers Home Administration (Grantor or FmHA) or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. Grantee has determined to undertake certain growth management and housing planning for energy impacted areas at an estimated cost of $_____ and has duly authorized such planning. The Grantor agrees to grant to Grantee a sum not to exceed $_____ subject to the terms and conditions established by the Grantor; provided, however, that any grant funds actually advanced and not needed for grant purposes shall be returned immediately to the Grantor. The Grantor may terminate the grant in whole, or in part, at any time before the date of completion, whenever it is determined that the Grantee has failed to comply with the conditions of the grant. In consideration of said grant by Grantor to Grantee, to be made pursuant to Section 601 of the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-620) for the purpose only of defraying the planning costs as permitted by applicable Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 regulations:</FP>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Part A</HD>
                <FP>Grantor and Grantee agree:</FP>

                <P>3. (a) Use of grant funds for travel which is determined as being necessary to the program for which the grant is established may be subject to the travel policies of the Grantee institution if they are uniformly applied regardless of the source of funds in determining the amounts and types of reimbursable travel expenses of Grantee staff and consultants. Where the Grantee institution does not have such specific policies uniformly applied, the Federal Travel Regulations shall apply in determining the amount charged to the grant. Grantee may purchase furniture and office equipment only if specifically approved in the scope of work. Approval will be given only when Grantee demonstrates that purchase is necessary and would result in less cost to the Government in providing Federal-share funds or to the Grantee in providing its contributions. Commercial purchase under these circumstances will be approved only after consideration of Federal supply sources.</P>
                <P>(b) Expenses and Purchases Excluded:</P>
                <P>(i) In no event shall the Grantee expend or request reimbursement from Federal-share funds for obligations entered into or for costs incurred or accrued prior to the effective date of this grant.</P>
                <P>(ii) Funds budgeted under this grant may not be used for entertainment expenses.</P>

                <P>(iii) Funds budgeted under this grant may not be used to pay for capital assets, the purchase of real estate or vehicles, improvement <PRTPAGE P="230"/>and renovation of space, and repair and maintenance of privately-owned vehicles.</P>
                <P>(c) Grant funds shall not be used to replace any financial support previously provided or assured from any other source. The Grantee agrees that the general level of expenditure by the Grantee for the benefit of program area and/or program covered by this agreement shall be maintained and not reduced as a result of the Federal share funds received under this grant.</P>
                <P>4. (a) In accordance with Treasury Circular 1075, grant funds will be disbursed by the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 as cash advances on an as-needed basis not to exceed one advance every 30 days. The financial management system of the recipient organization shall provide for effective control over and accountability for all Federal funds as stated in OMB Circular A-102 revised for State and local governments.</P>
                <P>(b) Cash advances to the Grantee shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and shall be timed to be in accord only with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the Grantee in carrying out the purpose of the planning project.</P>
                <P>(c) The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program costs.</P>
                <P>(d) Federal funds should be promptly refunded to the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and redrawn when needed if the funds are erroneously drawn in excess of immediate disbursement needs. The only exceptions to the requirement for prompt refunding are when the funds involved:</P>
                <P>(i) Will be disbursed by the recipient organization within seven calendar days, or</P>
                <P>(ii) Are less than $10,000 and will be disbursed within 30 calendar days.</P>
                <P>(e) Grantee shall provide satisfactory evidence to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 that all officers of Grantee organization authorized to receive and/or disburse Federal funds are covered by such bonding and/or insurance requirements as are normally required by the Grantee.</P>
                <P>(f) Grant funds will be placed in a bank account(s). If for any reason grant funds are invested, income earned on such investment shall be identified as interest income on grant funds and forwarded to the Finance Office, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, St. Louis, Missouri, unless the Grantee is a State. “State” includes instrumentalities of a State but not political subdivisions of a State. A State Grantee is not accountable for interest earned on grant funds.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Part B</HD>
                <FP>Grantee agrees:</FP>
                

                <P>1. To comply with property management standards established by Attachment N of OMB Circular A-102 for expendable and nonexpendable personal property <E T="03">Personal property</E> means property of any kind except real property. It may be tangible—having physical existence—or intangible—having no physical existence, such as patents, inventions, and copyrights. <E T="03">Nonexpendable personal property</E> means tangible personal property having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $300 or more per unit. A Grantee may use its own definition of nonexpendable personal property provided that such definition would at least include all tangible personal property as defined above. “Expendable personal property” refers to all tangible personal property other than nonexpendable property. When nonexpendable tangible property is acquired by a Grantee with project funds, title shall not be taken by the Federal Government but shall vest in the Grantee subject to the following conditions:</P>
                <P>(a) Right to transfer title. For items of nonexpendable personal property having a unit acquisition cost of $1,000 or more, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 may reserve the right to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by the Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such reservation shall be subject to the following standards:</P>
                <P>(1) The property shall be appropriately identified in the grant or otherwise made known to the Grantee in writing.</P>

                <P>(2) FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the project for which it was acquired. If FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 fails <PRTPAGE P="232"/>to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the Grantee shall apply the standards of paragraph (4) below.</P>
                <P>(3) When FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 exercises its right to take title, the personal property shall be subject to the provisions for federally owned nonexpendable property discussed in paragraph (4), below.</P>
                <P>(4) When title is transferred either to the Federal Government or to a third party and the Grantee is instructed to ship the property elsewhere, the Grantee shall be reimbursed by the benefiting Federal agency with an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the Grantee participation in the cost of the original grant project or program to the current fair market value of the property, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred.</P>
                <P>(b) Use of other nontangible expendable property for which the Grantee has title.</P>
                <P>(1) The Grantee shall use the property in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds. When it is no longer needed for the original project or program, the Grantee shall use the property in connection with its other Federally sponsored activities, in the following order of priority:</P>
                <P>(a) Activities sponsored by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</P>
                <P>(b) Activities sponsored by other Federal agencies.</P>
                <P>(2) Shared use. During the time that nonexpendable personal property is held for use on the project or program for which it was acquired, the Grantee shall make it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the property was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other projects or programs sponsored by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354; second preference shall be given to projects or programs sponsored by other Federal agencies. If the property is owned by the Federal Government, use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissable if authorized by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. User charges should be considered if appropriate.</P>
                <P>(c) Disposition of other nonexpendable property. When the Grantee no longer needs the property as provided in 1(a)(4) above, the property may be used for other activities in accordance with the following standards:</P>
                <P>(1) Nonexpendable property with a unit acquisition cost of less than $1,000. The Grantee may use the property for other activities without reimbursement to the Federal Government or sell the property and retain the proceeds.</P>
                <P>(2) Nonexpendable personal property with a unit acquisition cost of $1,000 or more. The Grantee may retain the property for other use provided that compensation is made to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the property. If the Grantee has no need for the property and the property has further use value, the Grantee shall request disposition instructions from the original Grantor agency.</P>
                <P>FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall determine whether the property can be used to meet the agency's requirements. If no requirement exists within that agency, the availability of the property shall be reported, in accordance with the guidelines of the Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR), to the General Services Administration by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to determine whether a requirement for the property exists in other Federal agencies. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 shall issue instructions to the Grantee no later than 120 days after the Grantee request and the following procedures shall govern:</P>
                <P>(a) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the Grantee's request, the Grantee shall sell the property and reimburse FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 an amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. However, the Grantee shall be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal share $100 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is greater, for the Grantee's selling and handling expenses.</P>
                <P>(b) If the Grantee is instructed to dispose of the property other than as described in (1)(a)(4) above, the Grantee shall be reimbursed by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for such costs incurred in its disposition.</P>
                <P>(c) Property management standards for nonexpendable property. The Grantee's property management standards for nonexpendable personal property shall include the following procedural requirements:</P>
                <P>(1) Property records shall be maintained accurately and shall include:</P>
                <P>(a) A description of the property.</P>
                <P>(b) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, national stock number, or other identification number.</P>
                <P>(c) Sources of the property including grant or other agreement number.</P>

                <P>(d) Whether title vests in the Grantee or the Federal Government.<PRTPAGE P="233"/>
                </P>
                <P>(e) Acquisition date (or date received, if the property was furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.</P>
                <P>(f) Percentage (at the end of the budget year) of Federal participation in the cost of the project or program for which the property was acquired. (Not applicable to property furnished by the Federal Government.)</P>
                <P>(g) Location, use and condition of the property and the date the information was reported.</P>
                <P>(h) Unit acquisition cost.</P>
                <P>(i) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales price or the method used to determine current fair market value where a Grantee compensates the Federal agency for its share.</P>
                <P>(2) Property owned by the Federal Government must be marked to indicate Federal ownership.</P>
                <P>(3) A physical inventory of property shall be taken and the results reconciled with the property records at least once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in the accounting records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The Grantee shall, in connection with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the property.</P>
                <P>(4) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property. Any loss, damage, or theft of nonexpendable property shall be investigated and fully documented; if the property was owned by the Federal Government, the Grantee shall promptly notify FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.</P>
                <P>(5) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the property in good condition.</P>
