      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

Moreover, an application or a request for service made in the name of a person otherwise eligible for service under the regulations may be rejected, or the benefits of the service may be otherwise denied to, or withdrawn from, such a person (<E T="03">a</E>) in case the service is or would be performed at an establishment operated (<E T="03">1</E>) by a corporation, partnership, or other person from whom the benefits of the service are currently being withheld under this paragraph, or (<E T="03">2</E>) by a corporation, partnership, or other person having an officer, director, partner, or substantial investor from whom the benefits of the service are currently being withheld and who has any authority with respect to the establishment where service is or would be performed, or (<E T="03">b</E>) in case the service is or would be performed with respect to any livestock in which any corporation, partnership, or other person within paragraph (a)(1)(vii)(<E T="03">a</E>)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section has a contract or other financial interest.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> All cases arising under this paragraph shall be conducted in accordance with the Rules of Practice Governing Formal Adjudicatory Proceedings Instituted by the Secretary Under Various Statutes set forth in §§ 1.130 through 1.151 of this title and the Supplemental Rules of Practice in part 50 of this chapter.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">For miscellaneous reasons.</E> An application or a request for service may be rejected, or the benefits of the service may be otherwise denied to, or withdrawn from, any person, without a hearing, by the official in charge of the appropriate market news office with <PRTPAGE P="11"/>the concurrence of the Director or Chief: (1) For administrative reasons such as the nonavailability of personnel to perform the service; (2) for the failure to pay for service; (3) for other noncompliance with the conditions on which service is available as provided in the regulations, except matters covered by paragraph (a) of this section; or (4) in case the person is a partnership, corporation, or other person from whom the benefits of the service are currently being withheld under paragraph (a) of this section. Notice of such denial or withdrawal, and the reasons therefor, shall promptly be given to the person involved.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Filing of records.</E> The final orders in formal proceedings under paragraph (a) of this section to deny or withdraw the service under the regulations (except orders required for good cause to be held confidential and not cited as precedents) and other records in such proceedings (except those required for good cause to be held confidential) shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk and shall be available for inspection by persons having a proper interest therein.</P>

                  <SECTNO>§ 53.18</SECTNO>
                  <SUBJECT>Fees and other charges for service.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>Fees and other charges equal as nearly as may be to the cost of the services rendered shall be assessed and collected from applicants in accordance with the following provisions unless otherwise provided in the cooperative agreement under which the services are furnished, or as provided in § 53.8.</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Fees based on hourly rates.</E> Except as otherwise provided in this section, fees for service shall be based on the time required to render the service, calculated to the nearest 15-minute period, including time required for the preparation of certificates and travel of the official grader in connection <PRTPAGE P="12"/>with the performance of service. A minimum charge for 1 hour shall be made for service pursuant to each request notwithstanding that the time required to perform service may be less than 60 minutes. The base hourly rate shall be $29.40 per hour for work performed between the hours of 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, except on legal holidays; $32.80 per hour for work performed before 6 a.m. or after 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, and anytime Saturday or Sunday except on legal holidays; and $58.80 per hour for all work performed on legal holidays.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Travel charges.</E> When service is requested at a place so distant from an official grader's headquarters, or place of prior assignment on a circuitous routing that a total of one-half hour or more is required for the grader to travel to such place and back to the headquarters, or to the next place of assignment on a circuitous routing, the charge for such service shall include a mileage charge administratively determined by the Chief, and travel tolls, if applicable, for such travel prorated against all the applicants furnished the service involved on an equitable basis, or where the travel is made by public transportation (including hired vehicle), a fee equal to the actual cost thereof. However, the applicant will not be charged a new mileage rate without notification before the service is rendered.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Per diem charges.</E> When service is requested at a place away from the official grader's headquarters, the fee for such service shall include a per diem charge if the employee performing the service is paid per diem in accordance with existing travel regulations. Per diem charges to applicants will cover the same period of time for which the grader receives per diem reimbursement. The per diem rate will be administratively determined by the Chief. However, the applicant will not be charged a new per diem rate without notification before the service is rendered.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Fees for extra copies of certificates.</E> In addition to copies of certificates furnished under § 53.16, any financially interested person may obtain not to exceed three copies of any such certificate within 1 year from its date of issuance upon payment of a fee of $1.00, and not to exceed three copies of any such certificate at any time thereafter, while a copy of such certificate is on file in the Department, upon payment of a fee of $5.00.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Other charges.</E> When costs, other than costs specified in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section, are involved in providing the services, the applicant will be charged for these costs. The amount of these charges will be determined administratively by the Chief. However, the applicant will not be charged for such cost without notification before the service is rendered of the charge for such item of expense.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>How to obtain service.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Application.</E> Any person may apply to the Director or Chief for service under the regulations with respect to products in which the applicant is financially interested. The application shall be made on a form approved by the Director. In any case in which the service is intended to be furnished at an establishment not operated by the applicant, the application shall be approved by the operator of such establishment and such approval shall constitute an authorization for any employees of the Department to enter the establishment for the purpose of performing their functions under the regulations. The application shall state:</P>

                  <P>(1) The name and address of the establishment at which service is desired; (2) the name and post office address of the applicant; (3) the financial interest of the applicant in the products, except where application is made by an official of a Government agency in his official capacity; and (4) the signature of <PRTPAGE P="18"/>the applicant (or the signature and title of his representative). The application shall indicate the legal status of the applicant as an individual, partnership, corporation, or other form of legal entity. Any change in such status, at any time while service is being received, shall be promptly reported to the Director or Chief by the person receiving the service.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of eligibility for service.</E> The applicant for service at any establishment will be notified whether his application is approved.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Request by applicant for service</E>—(1) <E T="03">Noncommitment.</E> Upon notification of the approval on an application for service, the applicant may, from time to time as desired, make oral or written requests for service under the regulations with respect to specific products for which the service is to be furnished under such application. Such requests shall be made at an office for grading either directly or through any employee of the Agricultural Marketing Service who may be designated for such purposes.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Commitment.</E> If desired, the applicant may request to enter into an agreement with the Agricultural Marketing Service for the furnishing of service on a weekly commitment basis, whereby the applicant agrees to pay for 8 hours of service per day, 5 days per week, Monday through Friday, excluding Federal legal holidays occurring Monday through Friday on which no grading and certification services are performed, as provided in § 54.27, and the Agricultural Marketing Service agrees to make an official grader available to perform such service for the applicant. However, the Agricultural Marketing Service reserves the right to use any grader assigned to a plant under such a commitment to perform service for other applicants when, in the opinion of the Chief, the grader is not needed to perform service for the commitment applicant. An applicant who terminates a commitment, and within 1 year after cancellation is granted a new commitment at his request, shall pay for the moving costs actually incurred by the Agricultural Marketing Service to cover the transfer of the grader who will service the applicant's new commitment. If more than one applicant is involved in the reapplication for a canceled meat grading and certification commitment requiring the transfer of the grader, the moving costs will be prorated among the applicants according to each applicant's committed portion of the grader's services. However, the moving costs will be charged only to those applicants who were parties to the previously canceled commitment. An applicant may, for periods of 3 months or less, enter into an agreement by memorandum with the Agricultural Marketing Service for the furnishing of service on a weekly basis. In the latter case, transfer of graders would not be involved and charges will be made in accordance with § 54.27.</P>

Meat that is presented in a frozen condition shall not be eligible for a grade determination. Meat of all eligible species shall be graded only in the establishment where the animal was slaughtered or initially chilled (except for veal and calf carcasses, which shall be graded only after the hide is removed and only in the establishment where such removal occurs). The Director may grant prior approval for grading at a location other than the establishment of slaughter or initial chill upon notification to the Division if the Branch was unable to provide grading service in a timely manner and that the meat can be identified in conformance with the standards.</P>

                  <P>(a) Appeal service is a redetermination of the class, grade, other quality, or compliance of product when the applicant for the appeal service formally challenges the correctness of the original determination. Only a person who has title to, or is a party to a contract for the sale of, a product may request appeal service with respect to such product and if the original determination of class, grade, other quality or compliance is found on appeal to have been in error all incorrect marks of class, grade, other quality and compliance will be removed from the product, and if the person having title to the product so requests, correct marks as determined on the appeal will be applied to the product. Examination requested to determine the class, grade, other quality, or compliance of a product which has been altered or has undergone a material change since the original service, or examination of product requested for the purpose of obtaining an up-to-date certificate and not involving any question as to the correctness of the original service for the product involved shall be considered equivalent to original service and not appeal service.</P>
                  <P>(b) Grade determinations cannot be appealed for any lot or product consisting of less than 10 similar units. Moreover, appeal service will not be furnished with respect to product that has been altered or has undergone any material change since the original service.</P>

A request for appeal service shall be filed with the Chief, directly or through the official grader who performed the original service or the official in charge of the office of grading to which such grader was assigned at the time of the service, or through the nearest office of grading. The request shall state the reasons therefor and may be accompanied by a copy of any previous certificate or report, or any other information which the applicant may have received regarding the product at the time of the original service. Such request may be made orally (including by telephone) or in writing (including by telegram). If made orally, the person receiving the <PRTPAGE P="30"/>request may require that it be confirmed in writing. Requests for appeal service received through an official grader or an office of grading shall be transmitted promptly to the Chief for instructions.</P>

                  <P>(a) Fees and other charges equal as nearly as may be to the cost of the services rendered shall be assessed and collected from applicants in accordance with the following provisions unless otherwise provided in the cooperative agreement under which the services are furnished, or as provided in § 54.6. For each calendar year, AMS will calculate the rate for inspection, grading, or certification services, per hour per program employee using the following formulas:</P>
                  <P>(1) <E T="03">Regular rate.</E> The total AMS grading, inspection, or certification program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase, plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Overtime rate.</E> The total AMS grading, inspection, or certification program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of <PRTPAGE P="31"/>living increase and then multiplied by 1.5 plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Holiday rate.</E> The total AMS grading, inspection, or certification program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 2, plus benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.</P>
                  <P>(b)(1) For each calendar year, based on previous fiscal year/historical actual costs, AMS will calculate the benefits, operating, and allowance for bad debt components of the regular, overtime and holiday rates as follows:</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Benefits rate.</E> The total AMS grading, inspection, or certification program direct benefits costs divided by the total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the next calendar year's percentage cost of living increase. Some examples of direct benefits are health insurance, retirement, life insurance, and Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement basic and matching contributions.</P>
                  <P>(ii) <E T="03">Operating rate.</E> The total AMS grading, inspection, or certification program operating costs divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the percentage of inflation.</P>
                  <P>(iii) <E T="03">Allowance for bad debt rate.</E> Total AMS grading, inspection, or certification program allowance for bad debt divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked.</P>
                  <P>(2) The calendar year cost of living expenses and percentage of inflation factors used in the formulas in this section are based on the most recent Office of Management and Budget's Presidential Economic Assumptions.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Fees for service on commitment basis.</E> Minimum fees for service performed under a commitment agreement or an agreement by memorandum shall be on the basis of 8 hours per day, Monday through Friday, excluding Federal legal holidays occurring Monday through Friday on which no grading and certification services are performed. Fees will be based on the formulas in this section. The Agency reserves the right under such a commitment agreement or agreement by memorandum to use any grader assigned to the plant on a commitment basis to perform service for other applicants, as provided in § 54.6(c), crediting the commitment applicant with the number of hours charged to the other applicant, provided the allowable credit hours plus hours actually worked for the applicants do not exceed 8 hours on any day, Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Fees for appeal service.</E> Fees for appeal service shall be determined on the basis of the time of two official graders required to render the service, including the time required for the preparation of certificates and travel of such graders in connection with the performance of the service. <E T="03">Provided,</E> that when on appeal it is found that there was error in the original determination equal to or exceeding ten percent of the total number of similar units of the products involved, no charge will be made for the appeal service unless a special agreement therefor was made with the applicant in advance.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Fees for extra copies of certificates.</E> In addition to copies of certificates furnished under § 54.14, any financially interested person may obtain not to exceed three copies of any such certificate within one year from its date of issuance upon payment of a fee, and not to exceed three copies of any such certificate at any time thereafter, while a copy of such certificate is on file in the Department. The fee for copies of certificates will be determined using the formulas in this section.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Noncontinuous grading service.</E> This type of service is performed when an applicant requests grading of a particular lot of shell eggs. Requests are made not on a regular basis. Charges or fees are based on the time, travel, and expenses needed to perform the work. This service also may be called the fee grading service. Shell eggs graded under fee grading service are not eligible to be identified with the official grademarks shown in § 56.36.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Continuous grading service on a resident basis and continuous grading service on a nonresident basis.</E> Service on a resident basis has a scheduled tour of duty, while service on a nonresident basis has a nonscheduled tour of duty. Both of these services are performed when an applicant requests that a USDA licensed grader be stationed in the applicant's processing plant and grade shell eggs in accordance with U.S. Standards. The applicant agrees to comply with the facility, operating, and sanitary requirements of resident service. The charges for resident grading services are based on the hours of the regular tour of duty and the volume of shell eggs received into the plant, while nonscheduled service is based on the cumulative time required to perform the work and an administrative service charge. Shell eggs graded under resident grading service are only eligible to be identified with the official grademarks shown in § 56.36 when processed and graded under the supervision of a grader or quality assurance inspector as provided in § 56.39.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Temporary grading service.</E> This type of service is performed when an applicant requests resident grading on a fee basis. The applicant must meet all of the facility, operating, and sanitary requirements of resident service. Charges or fees are based on the time and expenses needed to perform the work. Shell eggs graded under temporary grading service are only eligible to be identified with the official grademarks when they are processed and graded under the supervision of a grader or quality assurance inspector as provided in § 56.39.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Auditing service.</E> This type of service is performed when an applicant requests independent verification of written quality assurance and value added standards for production, processing, and distribution of shell eggs. Charges or fees are based on time, travel, and expenses needed to perform the work.</P>

                  <P>(1) Failure to maintain grading facilities and equipment in a satisfactory state of repair, sanitation, or cleanliness;</P>
                  <P>(2) The use of operating procedures which are not in accordance with the regulations in this part; or</P>
                  <P>(3) Alterations of grading facilities or equipment which have not been approved in accordance with the regulations in this part.</P>
                  <P>(b) Whenever it is feasible to do so, written notice in advance of a suspension shall be given to the person concerned and shall specify a reasonable period of time in which corrective action must be taken. If advance written notice is not given, the suspension action shall be promptly confirmed in writing and the reasons therefor shall be stated, except in instances where the person has already corrected the deficiency. Such service, after appropriate corrective action is taken, will be restored immediately, or as soon thereafter as a grader can be made available. During such period of suspension, grading service shall not be rendered. However, the other provisions of the regulations pertaining to providing grading service on a resident basis will remain in effect unless such service is terminated in accordance with the provisions of this part.</P>

                  <P>(c) If the grading facilities or methods of operation are not brought into compliance within a reasonable period <PRTPAGE P="51"/>of time as specified by the Administrator, the Administrator shall initiate withdrawal action pursuant to the Rules of Practice Governing Formal Adjudicatory Proceedings (7 CFR part 1, subpart H), and the operator shall be afforded an opportunity for an oral hearing upon written request in accordance with such Rules of Practice, with respect to the merits or validity of the withdrawal action, but any suspension shall continue in effect pending the outcome of such hearing unless otherwise ordered by the Administrator. Upon withdrawal of grading service in an official plant, the plant approval shall also become terminated and all labels, seals, tags, or packaging material bearing official identification shall, under the supervision of a person designated by the AMS, either be destroyed or the official identification completely obliterated or sealed in a manner acceptable to the AMS.</P>
                  <P>(d) In any case where grading service is withdrawn under this section, the person concerned may thereafter apply for grading service as provided in §§ 56.20 through 56.29 of these regulations.</P>

The use of finished labels must be approved as prescribed by the Administrator. A grader may apply official identification stamps to shipping containers if they do not bear any statement that is false or misleading. If the label is printed or otherwise applied directly to the container, the principal display panels of such container shall for this purpose be considered as the label. The label shall contain the name, address, and ZIP Code of the packer or distributor of the product, the name of the product, a statement of the net contents of the container, and the U.S. grademark.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Nutritional labeling.</E> Nutrition information must be included on the labeling of each unit container of consumer packaged shell eggs in accordance with the provisions of title 21, chapter I, part 101, Regulations for the Enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act.

                  <P>(a) Unless otherwise provided in this part, the fees to be charged and collected for any service performed, in accordance with this part, on a fee basis shall be based on the applicable formulas specified in this section. For each calendar year or crop year, AMS will calculate the rate for grading or audit services, per hour per program employee using the following formulas:</P>
                  <P>(1) <E T="03">Regular rate.</E> The total AMS grading or audit program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase, plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Overtime rate.</E> The total AMS grading or audit program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 1.5 plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Holiday rate.</E> The total AMS grading or audit program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 2, plus benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.</P>
                  <P>(b)(1) For each calendar year, based on previous fiscal year/historical actual costs, AMS will calculate the benefits, operating, and allowance for bad debt components of the regular, overtime and holiday rates as follows:</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Benefits rate.</E> The total AMS grading or audit program direct benefits costs divided by the total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the next calendar year's percentage cost of living increase. Some examples of direct benefits are health insurance, retirement, life insurance, and Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement basic and matching contributions.</P>
                  <P>(ii) <E T="03">Operating rate.</E> The total AMS grading or audit program operating costs divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the percentage of inflation.</P>
                  <P>(iii) <E T="03">Allowance for bad debt rate.</E> Total AMS grading or audit program allowance for bad debt divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked.</P>
                  <P>(2) The calendar year cost of living expenses and percentage of inflation factors used in the formulas in this section are based on the most recent Office of Management and Budget's Presidential Economic Assumptions.</P>
                  <P>(c) Fees for grading services will be based on the time required to perform the services. The hourly charges shall include the time actually required to perform the grading, waiting time, travel time, and any clerical costs involved in issuing a certificate.</P>
                  <P>(d) Fees for audit services will be based on the time and expenses required to perform the audit. The hourly charge shall include the time actually required to perform the audit, waiting time, travel time, and any clerical costs involved in issuing an audit report.</P>

                  <P>Fees to be charged and collected for any grading service, other than for an appeal grading, on a resident grading basis, shall be calculated as described in this part. The fees to be charged for any appeal grading shall be as provided in § 56.47.</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Charges.</E> The charges for the grading of shell eggs shall be paid by the applicant for the service and shall include items listed in this section as are applicable. Payment for the full cost of the grading service rendered to the applicant shall be made by the applicant to AMS. Such full costs shall comprise such of the items listed in this section as are due and included in the bill or bills covering the period or periods during which the grading service was rendered. Bills will be rendered by the 10th day following the end of the period in which the service was rendered and are payable upon receipt.</P>
                  <P>(1) When a signed application for service has been received, the State supervisor or the supervisor's assistant shall complete a plant survey pursuant to § 56.30. The costs for completing the plant survey shall be borne by the applicant on a fee basis as described in § 56.46. No charges will be assessed when the application is required because of a change in name or ownership. If service is not installed within 6 months from the date the application is filed, or if service is inactive due to an approved request for removal of a grader(s) for a period of 6 months, the application will be considered terminated, but a new application may be filed at any time. In addition there will be a charge of $300 if the application is terminated at the request of the applicant for reasons other than for a change in location, within 12 months from the date of the inauguration of service.</P>
                  <P>(2) Charges for the cost of each grader assigned to a plant will be calculated as described in § 56.46, except that no charge will be assessed when the assigned grader is temporarily reassigned by AMS to perform grading service for other than the applicant. Base salary rates will be determined on a national average for all official plants operating in States under a Federal Trust Fund Agreement where Federal graders, State graders, or a combination of Federal and State graders are used, by averaging the salary rates paid to each Federal or State grader assigned to such plants. Charges to plants are as follows:</P>
                  <P>(i) For all regular hours of work scheduled and approved as an established tour of duty for a plant, the regular rate charge will be made. The regular rate charge will be determined by adding an amount to the base salary rate to cover the costs to AMS for such items as the Employer's Tax imposed under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.) for Old Age and Survivor's Benefits under the Social Security System, retirement benefits, group life insurance, severance pay, sick leave, annual leave, additional salary and travel costs for relief grading service, accident payments, certain moving costs, and related servicing costs.</P>
                  <P>(ii) All hours worked by an assigned grader or another grader in excess of the approved tour of duty, or worked on a nonscheduled workday, or actually worked on a holiday in excess of the tour of duty, will be considered as overtime. The charge for such overtime will be 150 percent of the grader's base salary rate.</P>
                  <P>(iii) For work performed on a holiday which is within the established tour of duty approved for a plant, the added charge will be the same as the grader's base rate.</P>

                  <P>(iv) For work performed between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m., night differential charges (for regular, overtime, or holiday hours worked during this period) will be at the applicable rates established plus 10 percent of the base rate.<PRTPAGE P="57"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(v) For work performed on Sunday, Sunday differential charges (for regular, overtime, or holiday hours worked on Sunday) will be at the applicable rates established plus 25 percent of the base rate.</P>
                  <P>(vi) For all hours of work performed in a plant without an approved tour of duty, the charge will be one of the applicable hourly rates in § 56.46.</P>
                  <P>(3) A charge at the hourly rates specified in § 56.46, plus actual travel expenses incurred by AMS for intermediate surveys to firms without grading service in effect.</P>
                  <P>(4) An administrative service charge based upon the aggregate number of 30-dozen cases of all shell eggs handled in the plant per billing period multiplied by $0.055 beginning March 30, 2008, and $0.058 on or after January 25, 2009, except that the minimum charge per billing period shall be $275 and the maximum charge shall be $3,150 beginning March 30, 2008, and $3,225 on or after January 25, 2009. The minimum charge also applies where an approved application is in effect and no product is handled.</P>

                  <P>(2) AMS will provide, as available, an adequate number of graders to perform the grading service. The number of graders required will be determined by AMS based on the expected demand for service.</P>
                  <P>(3) The grading service shall be provided at the designated plant and shall be continued until the service is suspended, withdrawn, or terminated by:</P>
                  <P>(i) Mutual consent;</P>
                  <P>(ii) Thirty (30) days' written notice, by either the applicant or AMS specifying the date of suspension, withdrawal, or termination;</P>

Eggs shall not be allowed to stand or soak in water. Immersion-type washers shall not be used.</P>
                  <P>(10) Prewetting shell eggs prior to washing may be accomplished by spraying a continuous flow of water over the eggs in a manner which permits the water to drain away or other methods which may be approved by the Administrator. The temperature of the water shall be the same as prescribed in this section.</P>
                  <P>(11) Washed eggs shall be spray-rinsed with water having a temperature equal to, or warmer than, the temperature of the wash water. The spray-rinse water shall contain a sanitizer that has been determined acceptable for the intended use by the national supervisor and of not less than 100 p/m nor more than 200 p/m of available chlorine or its equivalent. Alternate procedures, in lieu of a sanitizer rinse, may be approved by the national supervisor.</P>
                  <P>(12) Test kits shall be provided and used to determine the strength of the sanitizing solution.</P>
                  <P>(13) During non-processing periods, eggs shall be removed from the washing and rinsing area of the egg washer and from the scanning area whenever there is a buildup of heat that may diminish the quality of the egg.</P>

                  <P>(2) Eggs that are to be officially identified with the grademark shall be packed only in new or good used packing material and new packaging materials that are clean, free of mold, mustiness and off odors, and must be of sufficient strength and durability to adequately protect the eggs during normal distribution. When packed in other than fiber packing material, the containers must be of sound construction and maintained in a reasonably clean manner.</P>
                  <P>(h) <E T="03">Use of approved chemicals and compounds.</E> (1) All egg washing and equipment cleaning compounds, defoamers, destainers, sanitizers, inks, oils, lubricants, or any other compound that comes into contact with the shell eggs shall be approved by the national supervisor for their specified use and handled in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</P>
                  <P>(2) All pesticides, insecticides, and rodenticides shall be approved for their specified use and handled in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</P>

                  <P>(1) The Administrator gives notice of an apparent violation of the Act or the regulations issued thereunder by such person and affords such person an opportunity for a hearing regarding the matter as provided by the Act;</P>
                  <P>(2) Such person expressly waives hearing and agrees to a specified order including an agreement to pay a specified civil penalty within a designated time; and</P>
                  <P>(3) The Administrator agrees to accept the specified civil penalty in settlement of the particular matter involved if it is paid within the designated time.</P>

                  <P>(4) If the specified penalty is not paid within the time designated in such stipulation, the amount of the stipulated penalty shall not be relevant in any respect to the penalty that may be assessed after the institution of a formal administrative proceeding pursuant to the Uniform Rules of Practice, <PRTPAGE P="80"/>Subpart H, Part 1, Title 7, Code of Federal Regulations.</P>

                  <P>(1) <E T="03">Regular rate.</E> The total AMS grading, certification, or inspection program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase, plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Overtime rate.</E> The total AMS grading, certification, or inspection program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 1.5 plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Holiday rate.</E> The total AMS grading, certification, or inspection program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 2, plus benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.</P>
                  <P>(b) For each calendar year, based on previous fiscal year/historical actual costs, AMS will calculate the benefits, operating, and allowance for bad debt components of the regular, overtime and holiday rates as follows:</P>
                  <P>(1) <E T="03">Benefits rate.</E> The total AMS grading, certification, or inspection program direct benefits costs divided by the total hours (regular, overtime, and <PRTPAGE P="93"/>holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the next calendar year's percentage cost of living increase. Some examples of direct benefits are health insurance, retirement, life insurance, and Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement basic and matching contributions.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Operating rate.</E> The total AMS grading, certification, or inspection program operating costs divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the percentage of inflation.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Allowance for bad debt rate.</E> Total AMS grading, certification, or inspection program allowance for bad debt divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked.</P>
                  <P>(c) The calendar year cost of living expenses and percentage of inflation factors used in the formulas in this section are based on the most recent Office of Management and Budget's Presidential Economic Assumptions.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Appearance and odor.</E> The appearance of acceptable raw milk shall be normal and free of excessive coarse sediment when examined visually or by an acceptable test procedure. The milk shall not show any abnormal condition (including, but not limited to, curdled, ropy, bloody or mastitic condition), as indicated by sight or other test procedures. The odor shall be fresh and sweet. The milk shall be free from objectionable feed and other off-odors that adversely affect the finished product.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Somatic cell count.</E> (1) A laboratory examination to determine the level of somatic cells shall be made at least four times in each 6-month period at irregular intervals on milk received from each patron.</P>

                  <P>(2) A screening test may be conducted on goat herd milk. When a goat <PRTPAGE P="109"/>herd screening sample test exceeds either of the following results, a confirmatory test identified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall be conducted.</P>
                  <P>(3) Milk shall be tested for somatic cell content by using one of the following procedures or by any other method approved by Standard Methods for the Examination of Dairy Products (confirmatory test for somatic cells in goat milk):</P>
                  <P>(i) Direct Microscopic Somatic Cell Count (Single Strip Procedure). Pyronin Y-methyl green stain or “New York” modification shall be used as the confirmatory test for goat's milk.</P>

                  <P>(iii) Electronic Somatic Cell Count (fluorescent dye).</P>
                  <P>(4) The somatic cell test identified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall be considered as the official results.</P>
                  <P>(5) Whenever the official test indicates the presence of more than 750,000 somatic cells per ml. (1,500,000 per ml. for goat milk), the following procedures shall be applied:</P>
                  <P>(i) The producer shall be notified with a warning of the excessive somatic cell count.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Whenever two out of the last four consecutive somatic cell counts exceed 750,000 per ml. (1,500,000 per ml. for goat milk), the appropriate State regulatory authority shall be notified and a written notice given to the producer. This notice shall be in effect as long as two of the last four consecutive samples exceed 750,000 per ml. (1,500,000 per ml. for goat milk).</P>
                  <P>(6) An additional sample shall be taken after a lapse of 3 days but within 21 days of the notice required in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. If this sample also exceeds 750,000 per ml. (1,500,000 per ml. for goat milk), subsequent milkings shall not be accepted for market until satisfactory compliance is obtained. Shipment may be resumed and a temporary status assigned to the producer by the appropriate State regulatory agency when an additional sample of herd milk is tested and found satisfactory. The producer may be assigned a full reinstatement status when three out of four consecutive somatic cell count tests do not exceed 750,000 per ml. (1,500,000 per ml. for goat milk). The samples shall be taken at a rate of not more than two per week on separate days within a 3-week period.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Drug residue level.</E> (1) USDA-approved plants shall not accept for processing any milk testing positive for drug residue. All milk received at USDA-approved plants shall be sampled and tested prior to processing for beta lactam drug residue. When directed by the regulatory agency, additional testing for other drug residues shall be performed. Samples shall be analyzed for beta lactams and other drug residues by methods that have been independently evaluated or evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and that have been accepted by the (FDA) as effective to detect drug residues at current safe or tolerance levels. Safe and tolerance levels for particular drugs are established by the FDA and can be obtained from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 200 C Street SW., Washington, DC 20204.</P>
                  <P>(2) Individual producer milk samples for beta lactam drug residue testing shall be obtained from each milk shipment as follows:</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Milk in farm bulk tanks.</E> A sample shall be taken at each farm and shall include milk from each farm bulk tank.</P>
                  <P>(ii) <E T="03">Milk in cans.</E> A sample shall be formed separately at the receiving plant for each can milk producer included in a delivery, and shall be representative of all milk received from the producer.</P>
                  <P>(3) Load milk samples for beta lactam drug residue testing shall be obtained from each milk shipment as follows:</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Milk in bulk milk pickup tankers.</E> A sample shall be taken from the bulk milk pickup tanker after its arrival at the plant and prior to further commingling.</P>
                  <P>(ii) <E T="03">Milk in cans.</E> A sample representing all of the milk received on a shipment shall be formed at the plant, using a sampling procedure that includes milk from every can on the vehicle.<PRTPAGE P="110"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(4) <E T="03">Follow-up to positive-testing samples.</E> (i) When a load sample tests positive for drug residue, the appropriate State regulatory agency shall be notified immediately of the positive test result and of the intended disposition of the shipment of milk containing the drug residue.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Each individual producer sample represented in the positive-testing load sample shall be singly tested to determine the producer of the milk sample testing positive for drug residue. Identification of the producer responsible for producing the milk testing positive for drug residue, and details of the final disposition of the shipment of milk containing the drug residue, shall be reported immediately to the appropriate agency.</P>
                  <P>(iii) Milk shipment from the producer identified as the source of milk testing positive for drug residue shall cease immediately and may resume only after a sample from a subsequent milking does not test positive for drug residue.</P>

                <P>(a) Ice cream shall contain at least 1.6 pounds of total solids to the gallon, weigh not less than 4.5 pounds to the gallon, and contain not less than 20 percent total milk solids, constitued of not less than 10 percent milkfat. In no case shall the content of milk solids not fat be less than 6 percent. Whey shall not, by weight, be more than 25 percent of the milk solids not fat.</P>
                <P>(b) When one or more of the bulky optional ingredients, as approved by the Food and Drug Administration, are used, the weights of milk fat and total milk solids (excusive of such fat and solids in any malted milk used) are not less than 10 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of the remainder obtained by subtracting the weight of such optional ingredients, from the weight of the finished ice cream; but in no case is the weight of milk fat or total milk solids less than 8 percent and 16 percent, respectively, of the weight of the finished ice cream. In calculating the reduction of milk fat and total milk solids from the use of bulky optional ingredients, chocolate and cocoa solids used shall be considered the bulky ingredients. In order to make allowance for additional sweetening ingredients needed when bulky ingredients are used, the weight of chocolate or cocoa solids may be multiplied by 2.5; the weight of fruit or nuts used may be multiplied by 1.4; and the weight of partially or wholly dried fruits or fruit juices may be multiplied by appropriate factors to obtain the original weights before drying and this weight multiplied by 1.4 The finished ice cream contains not less than 1.6 pounds to the gallon; except that when the optional ingredient microcrystalline cellulose is used, the finished ice cream contains not less than 1.6 pounds of total solids to the gallon and weighs not less than 4.5 pounds to the gallon exclusive, in both cases, of the weight of the microcrystalline cellulose.</P>
                <P>(c) Optional characterizing ingredients, optional sweetening ingredients, stabilizers, and emulsifiers as approved by the Food and Drug Administration may be used.</P>

                  <P>(a) Country of origin declarations and method of production (wild and/or <PRTPAGE P="175"/>farm-raised) designations can either be in the form of a placard, sign, label, sticker, band, twist tie, pin tag, or other format that provides country of origin and method of production information. The country of origin declaration and method of production (wild and/or farm-raised) designation may be combined or made separately. Except as provided in § 60.200(g) and 60.200(h) of this regulation, the declaration of the country(ies) of origin of a product shall be listed according to applicable Federal legal requirements. Country of origin declarations may be in the form of a check box provided it is in conformance with other Federal legal requirements. Various forms of the production designation are acceptable, including “wild caught”, “wild”, “farm-raised”, “farmed”, or a combination of these terms for blended products that contain both wild and farm-raised fish or shellfish, provided it can be readily understood by the consumer and is in conformance with other Federal labeling laws. Designations such as “ocean caught”, “caught at sea”, “line caught”, “cultivated”, or “cultured” are not acceptable substitutes. Alternatively, method of production (wild and/or farm-raised) designations may be in the form of a check box.</P>

                  <P>(c) The declaration of the country(ies) of origin and the method(s) of production (wild and/or farm-raised) may be typed, printed, or handwritten provided it is in conformance with other Federal labeling laws and does not obscure other labeling information required by other Federal regulations.</P>
                  <P>(d) A bulk container (e.g., display case, shipper, bin, carton, and barrel), used at the retail level to present product to consumers, may contain a covered commodity from more than one country of origin and/or more than one method of production (wild and farm-raised) provided all possible origins and/or methods of production are listed.</P>
                  <P>(e) In general, country abbreviations are not acceptable. Only those abbreviations approved for use under CBP rules, regulations, and policies, such as “U.K.” for “The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland”, “Luxemb” for Luxembourg, and “U.S. or USA” for the “United States” are acceptable. The adjectival form of the name of a country may be used as proper notification of the country(ies) of origin of imported commodities provided the adjectival form of the name does not appear with other words so as to refer to a kind or species of product. Symbols or flags alone may not be used to denote country of origin.</P>
                  <P>(f) State or regional label designations are not acceptable in lieu of country of origin labeling.</P>

                  <SECTNO>§ 60.400</SECTNO>
                  <SUBJECT>Recordkeeping requirements.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) All records must be legible and may be maintained in either electronic or hard copy formats. Due to the variation in inventory and accounting documentary systems, various forms of documentation and records will be acceptable.</P>
                  <P>(2) Upon request by USDA representatives, suppliers and retailers subject to this subpart shall make available to USDA representatives, records maintained in the normal course of business that verify an origin claim and method of production (wild and/or farm-raised). Such records shall be provided within 5 business days of the request and may be maintained in any location.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Responsibilities of suppliers.</E> (1) Any person engaged in the business of supplying a covered commodity to a retailer, whether directly or indirectly, must make available information to the buyer about the country(ies) of origin and method(s) of production (wild and/or farm-raised), of the covered commodity. This information may be provided either on the product itself, on the master shipping container, or in a document that accompanies the product through retail sale provided that it identifies the product and its country(ies) of origin and method(s) of production. In addition, the supplier of a <PRTPAGE P="176"/>covered commodity that is responsible for initiating a country(ies) of origin and method(s) of production (wild and/or farm-raised) claim must possess records that are necessary to substantiate that claim for a period of 1 year from the date of the transaction. Producer affidavits shall also be considered acceptable records that suppliers may utilize to initiate origin claims, provided it is made by someone having first-hand knowledge of the origin of the covered commodity and identifies the covered commodity unique to the transaction.</P>
                  <P>(2) Any intermediary supplier handling a covered commodity that is found to be designated incorrectly as to the country of origin and/or method of production (wild and/or farm-raised) shall not be held liable for a violation of the Act by reason of the conduct of another if the intermediary supplier relied on the designation provided by the initiating supplier or other intermediary supplier, unless the intermediary supplier willfully disregarded information establishing that the country of origin and/or method of production (wild and/or farm-raised) declaration was false.</P>
                  <P>(3) Any person engaged in the business of supplying a covered commodity to a retailer, whether directly or indirectly (i.e., including but not limited to harvesters, producers, distributors, handlers, and processors), must maintain records to establish and identify the immediate previous source (if applicable) and immediate subsequent recipient of a covered commodity for a period of 1 year from the date of the transaction.</P>
                  <P>(4) For an imported covered commodity (as defined in § 60.200(f)), the importer of record as determined by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, must ensure that records: provide clear product tracking from the port of entry into the United States to the immediate subsequent recipient and accurately reflect the country of origin and method of production (wild and/or farm-raised) of the item as identified in relevant CBP entry documents and information systems; and must maintain such records for a period of 1 year from the date of the transaction.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Responsibilities of retailers.</E> (1) In providing the country of origin and method of production (wild and/or farm-raised) notification for a covered commodity, in general, retailers are to convey the origin and method of production information provided to them by their suppliers. Only if the retailer physically commingles a covered commodity of different origins and/or methods of production in preparation for retail sale, whether in a consumer-ready package or in a bulk display (and not discretely packaged) (i.e., full service fish case), can the retailer initiate a multiple country of origin and/or method of production designation that reflects the actual countries of origin and method of production for the resulting covered commodity.</P>
                  <P>(2) Records and other documentary evidence relied upon at the point of sale to establish a covered commodity's country(ies) of origin and designation of wild and/or farm-raised must either be maintained at the retail facility or at another location for as long as the product is on hand and provided to any duly authorized representative of USDA in accordance with § 60.400(a)(2). For pre-labeled products, the label itself is sufficient information on which the retailer may rely to establish the product's origin and method(s) of production (wild and/or farm-raised) and no additional records documenting origin and method of production information are necessary.</P>
                  <P>(3) Records that identify the covered commodity, the retail supplier, and for products that are not pre-labeled, the country of origin information and the method(s) of production (wild and/or farm-raised) must be maintained for a period of 1 year from the date the declaration is made at retail.</P>
                  <P>(4) Any retailer handling a covered commodity that is found to be designated incorrectly as to the country of origin and/or the method of production (wild and/or farm-raised) shall not be held liable for a violation of the Act by reason of the conduct of another if the retailer relied on the designation provided by the supplier, unless the retailer willfully disregarded information establishing that the country of origin and/or method of production declaration was false.</P>

                  <P>In case of dispute in which a review is desired of the grading of any official sample of cottonseed covered by a valid certificate issued by a licensed cottonseed chemist, application therefor shall be filed with or mailed to a supervisor of cottonseed inspection within ten days after the date of the original certificate, whereupon the licensed chemist issuing the certificate shall immediately surrender to such supervisor the retained portion of the original sample, together with such records as may be required, for the determination of the true grade. The supervisor shall assign to such retained portion an identification number, shall divide such retained portion into two parts <PRTPAGE P="180"/>and submit the parts to two other licensed cottonseed chemists for reanalysis. Should the supervisor determine that such reanalyses indicate a grade differing from the original by not more than plus or minus one full grade, the original grade shall be considered the true grade. Should he find that such reanalyses indicate a grade differing more than plus or minus one full grade from the original, he shall determine the true grade. In any case, the supervisor shall issue over his name an appeal cottonseed grade certificate showing the true grade as determined in accordance with this section, which shall supersede the licensed chemists' certificates relating to the grade of such seed. Where due solely to errors in calculation or clerical error a grade certificated by a licensed cottonseed chemist is not the true grade, the supervisor shall direct the licensee to cancel the original and to issue a correct certificate. Should such error be found after an application for review has been filed, the supervisor shall nevertheless issue an appeal cottonseed grade certificate showing the true grade of the cottonseed involved.</P>

                  <P>(a) For each calendar year, AMS will calculate the rate for quality systems verification services, per hour per program employee using the following formulas:</P>
                  <P>(1) <E T="03">Regular rate.</E> The total AMS quality systems verification program (QSVP) personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase, plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Overtime rate.</E> The total AMS QSVP personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 1.5 plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt.

                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Holiday rate.</E> The total AMS QSVP personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 2, plus benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt.

                  <P>(b)(1) For each calendar year, based on previous fiscal year/historical actual costs, AMS will calculate the benefits, operating, and allowance for bad debt components of the regular, overtime and holiday rates as follows:</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Benefits rate.</E> The total AMS QSVP direct benefits costs divided by the total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the next calendar year's percentage cost of living increase.

                  <P>(ii) <E T="03">Operating rate.</E> The total AMS QSVP operating costs divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the percentage of inflation.</P>
                  <P>(iii) <E T="03">Allowance for bad debt rate.</E> Total AMS QSVP allowance for bad debt divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked.</P>
                  <P>(2) The calendar year cost of living expenses and percentage of inflation factors used in the formulas in this section are based on the most recent Office of Management and Budget's Presidential Economic Assumptions.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Labeling.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) Country of origin declarations can either be in the form of a placard, sign, label, sticker, band, twist tie, pin tag, or other format that allows consumers to identify the country of origin. The declaration of the country of origin of a product may be in the form of a statement such as “Product of USA,” “Produce of the USA”, or “Grown in Mexico,” may only contain the name of the country such as “USA” or “Mexico,” or may be in the form of a check box provided it is in conformance with other Federal labeling laws.</P>
                  <P>(b) The declaration of the country of origin (e.g., placard, sign, label, sticker, band, twist tie, pin tag, or other display) must be legible and placed in a conspicuous location, so as to render it likely to be read and understood by a customer under normal conditions of purchase.</P>
                  <P>(c) The declaration of country of origin may be typed, printed, or handwritten provided it is in conformance with other Federal labeling laws and does not obscure other labeling information required by other Federal regulations.</P>
                  <P>(d) A bulk container (e.g., display case, shipper, bin, carton, and barrel) used at the retail level to present product to consumers, may contain a covered commodity from more than one country of origin provided all possible origins are listed.</P>

                  <P>(e) In general, country abbreviations are not acceptable. Only those abbreviations approved for use under Customs and Border Protection rules, regulations, and policies, such as “U.K.” for “The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland”, “Luxemb” for Luxembourg, and “U.S. or USA” for the “United States of America” are acceptable. The adjectival form of the name of a country <PRTPAGE P="199"/>may be used as proper notification of the country of origin of imported commodities provided the adjectival form of the name does not appear with other words so as to refer to a kind or species of product. Symbols or flags alone may not be used to denote country of origin.</P>
                  <P>(f) Domestic and imported perishable agricultural commodities, peanuts, pecans, macadamia nuts, and ginseng may use State, regional, or locality label designations in lieu of country of origin labeling. Abbreviations may be used for state, regional, or locality label designations for these commodities whether domestically harvested or imported using official United States Postal Service abbreviations or other abbreviations approved by CBP.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Recordkeeping requirements.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) All records must be legible and may be maintained in either electronic or hard copy formats. Due to the variation in inventory and accounting documentary systems, various forms of documentation and records will be acceptable.</P>
                  <P>(2) Upon request by USDA representatives, suppliers and retailers subject to this subpart shall make available to USDA representatives, records maintained in the normal course of business that verify an origin claim. Such records shall be provided within 5 business days of the request and may be maintained in any location.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Responsibilities of suppliers.</E> (1) Any person engaged in the business of supplying a covered commodity to a retailer, whether directly or indirectly, must make available information to the buyer about the country(ies) of origin of the covered commodity. This information may be provided either on the product itself, on the master shipping container, or in a document that accompanies the product through retail sale. In addition, the supplier of a covered commodity that is responsible for initiating a country(ies) of origin claim, which in the case of lamb, chicken, and goat, is the slaughter facility, must possess records that are necessary to substantiate that claim for a period of 1 year from the date of the transaction. For that purpose, packers that slaughter animals that are tagged with an 840 Animal Identification Number device without the presence of any additional accompanying marking (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> “CAN” or “M”) may use that information as a basis for a U.S. origin claim. Packers that slaughter animals that are part of another country's recognized official system (<E T="03">e.g.</E> Canadian official system, Mexico official system) may also rely on the presence of an official ear tag or other approved device on which to base their origin claims. Producer affidavits shall also be considered acceptable records that suppliers may utilize to initiate origin claims, provided it is made by someone having first-hand knowledge of the origin of the covered commodity and identifies the covered commodity unique to the transaction.</P>
                  <P>(2) Any intermediary supplier handling a covered commodity that is found to be designated incorrectly as to the country of origin shall not be held liable for a violation of the Act by reason of the conduct of another if the intermediary supplier relied on the designation provided by the initiating supplier or other intermediary supplier, unless the intermediary supplier willfully disregarded information establishing that the country of origin declaration was false.</P>
                  <P>(3) Any person engaged in the business of supplying a covered commodity to a retailer, whether directly or indirectly (i.e., including but not limited to growers, distributors, handlers, packers, and processors), must maintain records to establish and identify the immediate previous source (if applicable) and immediate subsequent recipient of a covered commodity for a period of 1 year from the date of the transaction.</P>

                  <P>(4) For an imported covered commodity (as defined in § 65.300(f)), the importer of record as determined by CBP, must ensure that records: provide clear product tracking from the port of entry into the United States to the immediate subsequent recipient and accurately reflect the country of origin of the item as identified in relevant CBP entry documents and information systems; and must maintain such records for a period of 1 year from the date of the transaction.<PRTPAGE P="200"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Responsibilities of retailers.</E> (1) In providing the country of origin notification for a covered commodity, in general, retailers are to convey the origin information provided by their suppliers. Only if the retailer physically commingles a covered commodity of different origins in preparation for retail sale, whether in a consumer-ready package or in a bulk display (and not discretely packaged) (i.e., full service meat case), can the retailer initiate a multiple country of origin designation that reflects the actual countries of origin for the resulting covered commodity.</P>
                  <P>(2) Records and other documentary evidence relied upon at the point of sale to establish a covered commodity's country(ies) of origin must either be maintained at the retail facility or at another location for as long as the product is on hand and provided to any duly authorized representative of USDA in accordance with § 65.500(a)(2). For pre-labeled products, the label itself is sufficient information on which the retailer may rely to establish the product's origin and no additional records documenting origin information are necessary.</P>
                  <P>(3) Any retailer handling a covered commodity that is found to be designated incorrectly as to the country of origin shall not be held liable for a violation of the Act by reason of the conduct of another if the retailer relied on the designation provided by the supplier, unless the retailer willfully disregarded information establishing that the country of origin declaration was false.</P>
                  <P>(4) Records that identify the covered commodity, the retail supplier, and for products that are not pre-labeled, the country of origin information must be maintained for a period of 1 year from the date the origin declaration is made at retail.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>On a fee basis.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>Unless otherwise provided in this part, the fees to be charged and collected for any grading or audit service performed in accordance with this part, on a fee basis shall be based on the applicable formulas specified in this section.</P>
                  <P>(a) For each calendar year, AMS will calculate the rate for grading and audit services, per hour per program employee using the following formulas:</P>
                  <P>(1) <E T="03">Regular rate.</E> The total AMS grading or audit program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase, plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Overtime rate.</E> The total AMS grading or audit program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 1.5 plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Holiday rate.</E> The total AMS grading or audit program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 2, plus benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.</P>
                  <P>(b)(1) For each calendar year, based on previous fiscal year/historical actual costs, AMS will calculate the benefits, operating, and allowance for bad debt components of the regular, overtime and holiday rates as follows:</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Benefits rate.</E> The total AMS grading or audit program direct benefits costs divided by the total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the next calendar year's percentage cost of living increase. Some examples of direct benefits are health insurance, retirement, life insurance, and Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement basic and matching contributions.</P>
                  <P>(ii) <E T="03">Operating rate.</E> The AMS grading or audit program total operating costs divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the percentage of inflation.</P>
                  <P>(iii) <E T="03">Allowance for bad debt rate.</E> Total AMS grading or audit program allowance for bad debt divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked.</P>
                  <P>(2) The calendar year cost of living expenses and percentage of inflation factors used in the formulas in this section are based on the most recent Office of Management and Budget's Presidential Economic Assumptions.</P>
                  <P>(c) Fees for grading services will be based on the time required to perform the services. The hourly charges shall include the time actually required to perform the grading, waiting time, travel time, and any clerical costs involved in issuing a certificate.</P>
                  <P>(d) Fees for audit services will be based on the time and expenses required to perform the audit. The hourly charge shall include the time actually required to perform the audit, waiting time, travel time, and any clerical costs involved in issuing an audit report.</P>

Payment for the full cost of the grading service rendered to the applicant shall be made by the applicant to the AMS. Such full costs shall comprise such of the items listed in this section as are due and included in the bill or bills covering the period or periods during which the grading service was rendered. Bills will be rendered by the 10th day following the end of the billing period in which the service was rendered and are payable upon receipt.</P>
                  <P>(1) A charge for the salary and other costs, based on § 70.71, for each grader while assigned to a plant, except that no charge will be made when the assigned grader is temporarily reassigned by AMS to perform grading service for other than the applicant. Base salary rates will be determined on a national average for all official plants operating in States under a Federal Trust Fund Agreement where Federal graders, State graders, or a combination of Federal and State graders are used, by averaging the salary rates paid to each Federal or State grader assigned to such plants. Charges to plants are as follows:</P>
                  <P>(i) For all regular hours of work scheduled and approved as an established tour of duty for a plant, the regular rate charge will be made. The regular rate charge will be determined by adding an amount to the base salary rate to cover the costs to AMS for such items as the Employer's Tax imposed under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.) for Old Age and Survivor's Benefits under the Social Security System, retirement benefits, group life insurance, severance pay, sick leave, annual leave, additional salary and travel costs for relief grading service, accident payments, certain moving costs, and related servicing costs.</P>
                  <P>(ii) All hours worked by an assigned grader or another grader in excess of the approved tour of duty, or worked on a nonscheduled workday, or actually worked on a holiday in excess of the tour of duty, will be considered as overtime. The charge for such overtime will be 150 percent of the grader's base salary rate.</P>
                  <P>(iii) For work performed on a holiday which is within the established tour of duty approved for a plant, the added charge will be the same as the grader's base rate.</P>
                  <P>(iv) For work performed between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m., night differential charges (for regular, overtime, or holiday hours worked during this period) will be at the applicable rates established plus 10 percent of the base rate.</P>
                  <P>(v) For work performed on Sunday, Sunday differential charges (for regular, overtime, or holiday hours worked on Sunday) will be at the applicable rates established plus 25 percent of the base rate.</P>
                  <P>(vi) For all hours of work performed in a plant without an approved tour of duty, the charge will be one of the applicable hourly rates in § 70.71.</P>
                  <P>(2) An administrative service charge equal to 25 percent of the grader's total salary costs. A minimum charge of $275 will be made each billing period. The minimum charge also applies where an approved application is in effect and no product is handled.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Other provisions.</E> (1) The applicant shall designate in writing the employees of the applicant who will be required and authorized to furnish each grader with such information as may be necessary for the performance of the grading service.</P>

                  <P>(2) AMS will provide, as available, an adequate number of graders to perform the grading service. The number of graders required will be determined by <PRTPAGE P="227"/>AMS based on the expected demand for service.</P>
                  <P>(3) The grading service shall be provided at designated locations and shall be continued until the service is suspended, withdrawn, or terminated by:</P>
                  <P>(i) Mutual consent;</P>
                  <P>(ii) Thirty (30) days' written notice by either the applicant or AMS specifying the date of suspension, withdrawal or termination;</P>
                  <P>(iii) One (1) day's written notice by AMS to the applicant if the applicant fails to honor any invoice within thirty (30) days after date of invoice covering the cost of the grading service; or</P>
                  <P>(iv) Action taken by AMS pursuant to the provisions of § 70.38 or § 70.40.</P>

                  <P>(4) Graders will be required to confine their activities to those duties necessary in the rendering of grading service and such closely related activities as may be approved by AMS: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That in no instance may the graders assume the duties of management.</P>
                  <P>(5) When similar nonresident grading services are furnished to the same applicant under part 55 or part 56 of this chapter, the charges listed in this section shall not be repeated.</P>

                  <P>(iv) Action taken by AMS pursuant to the provisions of § 70.38 through § 70.40.</P>

                  <P>(4) Graders will be required to confine their activities to those duties necessary in the rendering of grading service and such closely related activities as may be approved by AMS: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That in no instance may the graders assume the duties of management.</P>

                <P>(2) <E T="03">Overtime rate.</E> The total AMS inspection or certification program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 1.5 plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Holiday rate.</E> The total AMS inspection or certification program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 2, plus benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.</P>
                <P>(b) For each calendar year, based on previous fiscal year/historical actual costs, AMS will calculate the benefits, operating, and allowance for bad debt components of the regular, overtime and holiday rates as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Benefits rate.</E> The total AMS inspection or certification program direct benefits costs divided by the total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the next calendar year's percentage cost of living increase.

                <P>(2) <E T="03">Operating rate.</E> The total AMS inspection or certification program operating costs divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the percentage of inflation.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Allowance for bad debt rate.</E> Total AMS inspection or certification program allowance for bad debt divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked.</P>

              <P>(e) As previously indicated, if the number of trees to be removed in such applications, multiplied by $8.50 per tree, exceeds the amount of funds available for the diversion program, each grower's application will be considered in the order in which they are received at the Committee office. AMS may reject any application for any reason, and its decisions are final.</P>

              <P>(f) After the application reviews and confirmation of eligible trees are completed, the Committee shall notify the applicant, in writing, as to whether or not the application has been approved and the number of trees approved for payment after removal. If an application is not approved, the notification <PRTPAGE P="242"/>shall specify the reason(s) for disapproval. AMS shall be the final arbiter of which applications may be approved or rejected, and the final arbiter of any appeal.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) To be eligible for this program, the trees to be removed must be fruit-bearing and have been planted after the 1987 and before the 2003 calendar years. Abandoned orchards and dead trees will not qualify. The block of trees for removal must be easily definable by separations from other blocks of eligible trees and contain at least 1,000 eligible trees or an entire orchard. Clingstone peach tree removal shall not take place until the grower has been informed in writing that the grower's application has been approved.</P>
              <P>(b) Any grower participating in this program must agree not to replant clingstone peach trees on the land cleared under this program through June 1, 2016. Participants bear responsibility for ensuring that trees are not replanted, whether by themselves, by successors to the land, or by any other person, until after June 1, 2016. If trees are replanted before June 1, 2016, by any persons, participants must refund all USDA payments, with interest, made in connection with this tree removal program.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Standard hourly fee rate for laboratory testing, analysis, and other services.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) For each fiscal year, AMS will calculate the rate for laboratory testing, analysis, and other services, per hour per program employee using the following formulas:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Regular rate.</E> The total AMS laboratory service program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase, plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Overtime rate.</E> The total AMS laboratory service program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 1.5 plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Holiday rate.</E> The total AMS laboratory service program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 2, plus benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.</P>

                <P>(b)(1) For each calendar year, based on previous fiscal year/historical actual costs, AMS will calculate the benefits, operating, and allowance for bad <PRTPAGE P="261"/>debt components of the regular, overtime and holiday rates as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Benefits rate.</E> The total AMS laboratory service program direct benefits costs divided by the total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the next calendar year's percentage cost of living increase. Some examples of direct benefits are health insurance, retirement, life insurance, and Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement basic and matching contributions.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Operating rate.</E> The total AMS laboratory service program operating costs divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the percentage of inflation.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Allowance for bad debt rate.</E> Total AMS laboratory service program allowance for bad debt divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked.</P>
                <P>(2) The calendar year cost of living expenses and percentage of inflation factors used in the formulas in this section are based on the most recent Office of Management and Budget's Presidential Economic Assumptions.</P>
                <P>(c) When a laboratory test service is provided for AMS by a commercial or State government laboratory, the applicant will be assessed a fee which covers the costs to the Science and Technology program for the service provided.</P>
                <P>(d) When Science and Technology staff provides applied and developmental research and training activities for microbiological, physical, chemical, and biomolecular analyses on agricultural commodities the applicant will be charged a fee on a reimbursable cost to AMS basis.</P>

Suitability will be determined by the Commissioner on the basis of the administrative and technical competence, and agreement of the depository to comply with the terms and conditions applicable to deposits for plant variety protection purposes. The Commissioner may seek the advice of impartial consultants on the suitability of a depository. The depository must:</P>
                <P>(i) Have a continuous existence;</P>
                <P>(ii) Exist independent of the control of the depositor;</P>
                <P>(iii) Possess the staff and facilities sufficient to examine the viability and quantity of a deposit, and store the deposit in a manner which ensures that it is kept viable and uncontaminated;</P>

                <P>(viii) Promptly notify the Office of low viability or low quantity of the sample.</P>
                <P>(3) A depository seeking status under paragraph (c)(2) of this section must direct a communication to the Commissioner which shall:</P>
                <P>(i) Indicate the name and address of the depository to which the communication relates;</P>
                <P>(ii) Contain detailed information as to the capacity of the depository to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, including information on its legal status, scientific standing, staff, and facilities;</P>

                <P>(iv) Where the depository intends to accept for deposit only certain kinds of biological material, specify such kinds; and</P>
                <P>(v) Indicate the amount of any fees that the depository will, upon acquiring the status of suitable depository under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, charge for storage, viability statements and furnishings of samples of the deposit.</P>
                <P>(4) A depository having status under paragraph (c)(2) of this section limited to certain kinds of biological material may extend such status to additional kinds of biological material by directing a communication to the Commissioner in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section. If a previous communication under paragraph (c)(3) of this section is of record, items in common with the previous communication may be incorporated by reference.</P>
                <P>(5) Once a depository is recognized to be suitable by the Commissioner or has defaulted or discontinued its performance under this section, notice thereof will be published in the Official Journal of the Plant Variety Protection Office or by other methods typically used for dissemination of information related to the procedures of the Office.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Time of making an original deposit.</E> An original deposit of materials for seed-reproduced plants shall be made within three months of the filing date of the application or prior to issuance of the certificate, whichever occurs first. A waiver may be granted for good cause, such as delays in obtaining a phytosanitary certificate for the importation of voucher sample materials. When the original deposit is made, the applicant must promptly submit a statement from a person in a position to corroborate the fact, stating that the voucher specimen material which is deposited is the variety specifically identified in the application as filed. Such statement must be filed in the application and must contain the identifying information listed in paragraph (b) of this section and:</P>
                <P>(1) The name and address of the depository;</P>

                <P>(4) A statement that the deposit is capable of reproduction.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Replacement or supplement of deposit.</E> If the depository possessing a deposit determines either that the sample viability is low or that the sample quantity is low, and if this finding is made during the pendency of an application or during the term of protection of the certificate, the Office shall notify the depositor of the need for making a replacement or supplemental deposit. Such deposits will be governed by the same considerations governing the need for making an original deposit under the provisions set forth in § 97.7(d). Notification to the Office concerning deposit of the replacement or supplemental sample shall contain a statement from a person in a position to corroborate the fact, stating that the replacement or supplemental deposit is of a biological material which is identical to that originally deposited.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Term of deposit.</E> A voucher specimen deposit made in support of an application for plant variety protection shall be made for a term of at least twenty (20) years. In any case, samples must be stored under agreements that would make them available to the Office during the enforceable life of the certificate for which the deposit was made.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Viability of deposit.</E> A deposit of biological material that is capable of self-replication either directly or indirectly must be viable at the time of deposit and during the term of deposit. Viability may be tested by the depository periodically. The test must conclude only that the deposited material is capable of reproduction. No evidence necessarily is required regarding the ability of the deposited material to perform any function described in the application. If a viability test indicates that the deposit is not viable upon receipt or that the quantity of material is insufficient, the examiner shall proceed as if no deposit was made. The examiner will accept the conclusion set forth in a viability statement issued by a depository recognized under paragraph 97.7(c).</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Furnishing of samples.</E> A deposit must be made under conditions that assure that:</P>
                <P>(1) Public access to the deposit will not be available during pendency of the application or during the term of protection, and</P>
                <P>(2) All restrictions on the availability to the public of the deposited material will be irrevocably removed upon the abandonment, cancellation, expiration, or withdrawal of the certificate.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Examination procedures.</E> The examiner shall determine, prior to issuance of the certificate, in each application if a voucher sample deposit actually made is acceptable for plant variety protection purposes.</P>

              <P>(1) The date of issuance of the notice of violation;</P>
              <P>(2) The nature of the proceeding;</P>
              <P>(3) The identification of the complainant and respondent;</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Answer.</E> Within 30 days after the service of the notice of violation, the respondent shall file with the Presiding Officer an answer signed by the respondent or by the attorney of record in the proceeding. The answer shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Admit, deny, or explain each of the allegations in the notice of violation and set forth any defense asserted by the respondent; or</P>
              <P>(2) State that the respondent admits all the facts alleged in the notice of violation; or</P>
              <P>(3) State that the respondent admits the jurisdictional allegations in the notice of violation and neither admits nor denies the remaining allegations and consents to the issuance of an order without further procedure.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Default.</E> Failure to file an answer within 30 days after service of the notice of violation shall be deemed, for purposes of the proceeding, an admission of the allegations in the notice of violation, and failure to deny or otherwise respond to an allegation in the notice of violation shall be deemed, for purposes of the proceeding, an admission of the allegation, unless the complainant and respondent have agreed to a consent decision pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Amendment of notice of violation or answer.</E> At any time prior to the filing of a motion for a hearing, the notice of violation or answer may be amended with the consent of the complainant and respondent or as authorized by the Presiding Officer upon a showing of good cause.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Consent decision.</E> At any time before the Presiding Officer files the decision, the complainant and respondent may agree to the entry of a consent decision. The agreement shall be in the form of a decision signed by the complainant and respondent with appropriate space for signature by the Presiding Officer, and shall contain an admission of at least the jurisdictional facts, consent to the issuance of the agreed decision without further procedure, and such other admissions or statements as may be agreed to by the complainant and respondent. The Presiding Officer shall enter such decision without further procedure, unless an error is apparent on the face of the document. The consent decision shall have the same force and effect as a decision issued after a full hearing, shall become final upon issuance, and shall become effective in accordance with the terms of the decision.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Procedure upon failure to file an answer or admission of facts.</E> The failure to file an answer with the Presiding Officer, or the admission by the answer of all the material allegations of fact contained in the notice of violation, shall constitute a waiver of hearing. Upon such admission or failure to submit an answer, complainant shall file with the Presiding Officer a proposed decision, along with a motion for the adoption of the proposed decision both of which shall be served upon the respondent by the Presiding Officer. Within 20 days after service of the motion and proposed decision, the respondent may file with the Presiding Officer objections to the motion and proposed decision. If the Presiding Officer finds that meritorious objections have been filed, <PRTPAGE P="298"/>complainant's motion shall be denied with supporting reasons. If meritorious objections are not filed, the Presiding Officer shall issue a decision without further procedure or hearing. Copies of the decision or denial of complainant's motion shall be served by the Presiding Officer upon the respondent and the complainant and may be appealed pursuant to paragraph (l) of this section. Where the decision as proposed by complainant is entered, such decision shall become final and effective without further proceedings 35 days after the date of service of the decision upon the respondent, unless there is an appeal to the Administrator by the complainant or respondent, pursuant to paragraph (l) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Conferences.</E> (1) Upon motion of the complainant or respondent, the Presiding Officer may direct the complainant and respondent or their counsel to attend a conference at any reasonable time, prior to or during the course of the hearing, when the Presiding Officer finds that the proceeding would be expedited by a conference. Reasonable notice of the time and place of the conference shall be given. The Presiding Officer may order the complainant or respondent to furnish at or subsequent to the conference any or all of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) An outline of the case or defense;</P>
              <P>(ii) The legal theories upon which the party will rely;</P>
              <P>(iii) A list of documents which the party anticipates introducing at the hearing; and</P>
              <P>(iv) A list of anticipated witnesses who will testify on behalf of the party. At the discretion of the party furnishing such list of witnesses, the names of the witnesses need not be furnished if they are otherwise identified in some meaningful way such as a short statement of the type of evidence they will offer.</P>
              <P>(2) The Presiding Officer shall not order a party to furnish the information or documents listed in paragraph (g)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section if the party can show that providing the particular information or document is inappropriate or unwarranted under the circumstances of the particular case.</P>
              <P>(3) At the conference, the following matters may be considered:</P>
              <P>(i) The simplification of issues;</P>
              <P>(ii) The necessity of amendments to the notice of violation or answer;</P>
              <P>(iii) The possibility of obtaining stipulations of facts and of the authenticity, accuracy, and admissibility of documents, which will avoid unnecessary proof;</P>
              <P>(iv) The limitation of the number of expert or other witnesses;</P>
              <P>(v) Negotiation, compromise, or settlement of issues;</P>
              <P>(vi) The exchange of copies of proposed exhibits;</P>
              <P>(vii) The identification of documents or matters of which official notice may be requested;</P>
              <P>(viii) A schedule to be followed by the parties for completion of the actions decided at the conference; and</P>
              <P>(ix) Such other matters as may expedite and aid in the disposition of the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(4) A conference will not be stenographically reported unless so directed by the Presiding Officer.</P>
              <P>(5) In the event the Presiding Officer concludes that personal attendance by the Presiding Officer and the parties or counsel at a conference is unwarranted or impractical, but determines that a conference would expedite the proceeding, the Presiding Officer may conduct the conference by telephone or correspondence.</P>
              <P>(6) Actions taken as a result of a conference shall be reduced to a written appropriate order, unless the Presiding Officer concludes that a stenographic report shall suffice, or, the Presiding Officer elects to make a statement on the record at the hearing summarizing the actions taken.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Procedure for hearing</E>—(1) <E T="03">Request for hearing.</E> The complainant or respondent may request a hearing on the facts by including such a request in the notice of violation or answer, or by a separate request, in writing, filed with the Presiding Officer within the time in which an answer may be filed. Failure to request a hearing within the time allowed for the filing of the answer shall constitute a waiver of a hearing. In the event the respondent denies any material fact and fails to file a timely request for a hearing, the <PRTPAGE P="299"/>matter may be set down for hearing on motion of the complainant filed with the Presiding Officer or upon the Presiding Officer's own motion.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Time and place.</E> If any material issue of fact is joined by the pleading, the Presiding Officer, upon motion of any of the parties stating that the matter is at issue and is ready for hearing, shall set a time and place for hearing as soon as feasible with due regard for the public interest and the convenience and necessity of the parties. The Presiding Officer shall issue a notice stating the time and place of hearing. If any change in the time or place of the hearing is made, the Presiding Officer shall issue a notice of this change, which notice shall be served upon the complainant and respondent, unless it is made during the course of an oral hearing and made a part of the transcript, or actual notice is given to the parties.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Appearances.</E> The parties may appear in person or by attorney of record in the proceeding. Any individual who appears as an attorney must conform to the standard of ethical conduct required of practitioners before the courts of the United States.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Debarment of attorney.</E> Whenever a Presiding Officer finds that an individual acting as attorney for any party to the proceeding is guilty of unethical or contumacious conduct, in or in connection with a proceeding, the Presiding Officer may order that the individual be precluded from further acting as attorney in the proceeding. An appeal to the Administrator may be taken from any such order, but no proceeding shall be delayed or suspended pending disposition of the appeal: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the Presiding Officer shall suspend the proceeding for a reasonable time for the purpose of enabling the party to obtain another attorney.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Failure to appear.</E> A respondent who, after being duly notified, fails to appear at the hearing without good cause, shall be deemed to have waived the right to an oral hearing in the proceeding and to have admitted any facts which may be presented at the hearing. The failure by the respondent to appear at the hearing shall also constitute an admission of all the material allegations of fact contained in the notice of violation. The complainant shall have an election whether to follow the procedure set forth in paragraph (f) of this section or whether to present evidence, in whole or in part, in the form of affidavits, exhibits, or by oral testimony before the Presiding Officer. Failure to appear at a hearing shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the right to be served with a copy of the Presiding Officer's decision and to appeal to the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (l) of this section.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Order of proceeding.</E> Except as may be determined otherwise by the Presiding Officer, the complainant shall proceed first at the hearing.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Evidence.</E> (i) The testimony of witnesses at a hearing shall be on oath or affirmation and subject to cross-examination.</P>
              <P>(ii) Upon a finding of good cause, the Presiding Officer may order that any witness be examined separately and apart from all other witnesses except those who are parties to the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(iii) Evidence which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not of the sort upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely, shall be excluded insofar as practicable.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Objections.</E> (i) If a party objects to the admission of any evidence or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or cross-examination or to any other ruling of the Presiding Officer, the party shall state briefly the grounds of such objection, whereupon an automatic exception will follow if the objection is overruled by the Presiding Officer.</P>
              <P>(ii) Only objections made before the Presiding Officer may subsequently be relied upon in the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Exhibits.</E> Unless the Presiding Officer finds that the furnishing of copies is impracticable, four copies of each exhibit shall be filed with the Presiding Officer: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That, where there are more than two parties in the proceeding, an additional copy shall be filed for each additional party. A true copy of an exhibit may be substituted for the original.<PRTPAGE P="300"/>
              </P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Official records or documents.</E> An official government record or document or entry in such a record or document, if admissible for any purpose, shall be admissible in evidence without the production of the individual who made or prepared the same, and shall be prima facie evidence of the relevant facts stated in the record or document. Such record or document shall be evidenced by an official publication of the record or document or by a copy certified by an individual having legal authority to make such certification.</P>
              <P>(11) <E T="03">Official notice.</E> Official notice shall be taken of such matters as are judicially noticed by the courts of the United States and of any other matter of technical, scientific, or commercial fact of established character: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the parties shall be given adequate notice of matters so noticed, and shall be given adequate opportunity to show that such facts are erroneously noticed.</P>
              <P>(12) <E T="03">Offer of proof.</E> Whenever evidence is excluded by the Presiding Officer, the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be included in the transcript. The offer of proof shall consist of a brief statement describing the evidence excluded. If the evidence consists of a brief oral statement, the statement shall be included in the transcript in its entirety. If the evidence consists of an exhibit, it shall be marked for identification and inserted in the hearing record. In either event, the evidence shall be considered a part of the transcript and hearing record if the Administrator, upon appeal, decides the Presiding Officer's ruling excluding the evidence was erroneous and prejudicial.

                <P>Except as provided in § 160.15, rosin is the vitreous, well-strained, transparent, solid resin which (a) remains after the volatile terpene oils are distilled from (1) the oleoresin collected from living trees or (2) the oleoresin extracted from wood; or (b) remains after distillation of the fatty acids from tall oil recovered from wood in the course of its chemical disintegration to produce cellulose. In addition to the free resin acids, rosin may contain relatively small proportions of fatty acids, resin esters and other esters, unsaponifiable resenes, and non-resinous foreign matter naturally occurring therein.</P>

                <P>Samples of rosin for grading shall be approximately cubical in shape, and shall be seven-eighths inch thick in the direction through which they are viewed or graded. Samples may be taken by any of the following methods:</P>
                <P>(a) By cutting or cleaving the same from a lump of the rosin removed from the solid mass in the barrel or drum, the top side of which lump shall come from not less than 4 inches below the surface of the rosin.</P>

                <P>(b) By placing a tin mold of suitable design inside the barrel or drum through an opening in the side, the center of which opening is approximately 9 inches from the top or 12 inches from the bottom so that when the container is filled, the rosin within the mold will have come from a position not less than 4 inches below the surface of the rosin. The mold thus <PRTPAGE P="309"/>placed must be entirely within the barrel or drum and completely encased in the rosin.</P>
                <P>(c) By suspending in the barrel or drum of molten rosin a clean tinplate mold, <FR>7/8</FR> inch square (inside) and 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches or more in length, in such a manner that it will be in a horizontal position at least 2 inches below the surface of the rosin after it has thoroughly cooled. Such sample shall not be spiked from the barrel or drum until it is completely cooled.</P>

                <P>(d) By withdrawing a quantity of molten rosin from a full container of 150 pounds content or less, pouring the rosin into a suitable mold, and allowing it to cool and solidify slowly: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That samples taken to represent a single batch or charge made by intermittent distillation of oleoresin shall be taken from not less than two containers, one of which shall be selected when one fourth of the batch has been placed in the containers, and the other shall be from the last container filled.</P>

                <P>(e) By withdrawing a quantity of molten rosin from a full drum that has been filled after a preliminary cooling period, pouring the rosin into a suitable mold, and allowing it to cool and solidify slowly: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That such sample shall not be taken until at least one hour has elapsed after the drum was filled: <E T="03">And provided further,</E> That the selection of drums to be sampled shall be in accordance with the method of selecting small containers as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. Rosin in drums sampled in this manner will be graded and certified only when the sampling is performed by an official inspector. Rosin in open head barrels shall not be sampled by this method.</P>

                <P>(f) By collecting in a suitable vessel a quantity of molten rosin from each successive batch or charge as it is delivered into a tank car, pouring the respective quantities of rosin into suitable molds, and allowing them to cool and solidify: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That any darkening of the rosin subsequent to such sampling will not be recognized as affecting the correctness of the grades assigned to the rosin at the time it was loaded in the car. Rosin so sampled while in process of being placed in a tank car will be graded and certified only when the sampling is performed by an official inspector.</P>

                <P>(a) Any license to inspect, grade, and certify naval stores may be suspended or revoked for repeated failure by the licensee correctly to inspect, grade, classify, or certify naval stores, or upon the persistence of any condition which renders him unfit to perform the duties of a licensed inspector, or for other continued non-conformance with any provision of the act or the provisions in this part.

In all other cases, prior to the institution of proceedings for the suspension or revocation of a license, such authorized official shall cause to be served upon the licensee, in person or by registered mail, a statement of the facts which appear to warrant such suspension or revocation, specifying a reasonable time, depending upon the circumstances in each case, within which the licensee may demonstrate or achieve compliance with the act, and the provisions in this part. The licensee may demonstrate compliance by the presentation of evidence in writing or, in the discretion of such authorized official, at an oral hearing. If, at the end of the time allowed for the licensee to demonstrate or achieve compliance, such authorized official finds he is in compliance, his license shall not be suspended or revoked. If such authorized official finds the licensee is not in compliance, the license may be suspended or revoked after service upon the licensee, in person or by registered mail, of a notice that such action is under consideration for reasons specified in the statement of facts previously served upon him and after reasonable opportunity is given the licensee to present further evidence in his behalf. Within 7 days after receipt of notice of the suspension or revocation of his license, the inspector by letter may appeal to the Administrator for its reinstatement and may attach to such letter any evidence he may wish to submit.</P>

              <SUBJECT>To which farmers markets does this rule apply?</SUBJECT>
              <P>This rule applies only to the USDA Farmers Market at headquarters on the corner of 12th Street &amp; Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Is the USDA Farmers Market a producer-only market?</SUBJECT>
              <P>Yes. A producer-only market is one that does not offer agricultural products that are commercially made, created, or produced, and only allows agricultural products that are grown by a principal farmer. A producer-only market offers raw agricultural products such as fruits, vegetables, flowers, bedding plants, and potted plants. The USDA Farmers Market is a producer-only market since only farmers who may sell products that they grow or produce will be selected for participation. It also allows the sale of value-added products and other specialized non-produce items.</P>

              <P>Products that may be sold at the market include, but are not limited to, fresh, high-quality fruits, vegetables, herbs, honey, jams and jellies, cheese, vinegars, cider, maple syrup, fish, flowers, bedding plants, and potted plants. USDA inspected meats and poultry items also may be sold.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Who may participate in the USDA Farmers Market?</SUBJECT>
              <P>Members of three groups may participate in the USDA Farmers Markets:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Principal farmers or producers who sell their own agricultural products.</E> The principal farmer must be in full control and supervision of the individual steps of production of crops including tilling, planting, cultivating, fertilizer and pesticide applications (if applicable), harvesting and post-harvest handling on its own farm with its own machinery and labor.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Principal farmer or producers who sell their own value-added agricultural products.</E> Value-added products may include agricultural products that have been enhanced through a modification of the product, such as braiding, weaving, hulling, extracting, handcrafting, and the like. It also may result from growing the product in a way that is acknowledged as safer. Farmers and vendors selling these types of products must prepare them predominately with material they have grown or gathered.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Nonproduce vendors.</E> A limited number of non-produce vendors may be selected by market management to sell specialized products that enhance the market atmosphere and historically attract customers to a farmers market. These specialized vendors, such as bakers, may be exempted from the reselling restrictions that apply to the farmers and vendors described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 170.11</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>How are farmers and vendors selected for participation in the USDA Farmers Market?</SUBJECT>
              <P>USDA reviews all applications and selects participants based primarily on the type of farmer or vendor (i.e., fruit, vegetable, herb, baker) and secondly, on the specific types of products to be sold. The selection of the participants is conducted by the market management to ensure a balanced product mix of fruits, vegetables, herbs, value-added products, and baked goods.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 170.12</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>What are the selection criteria for participation in the USDA Farmers Market?</SUBJECT>
              <P>The selection criteria are designed to ensure a consistently high level of quality and diverse products are available at the market, while operating in the constraints of space available at the market site. The criteria are:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Member of one of the three participant groups specified in § 170.4 of this part.</E> The participant must be a producer-only farmer or producer, seller of value-added products, or specialized non-produce vendor.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Participant offers a product that adds to a product mix.</E> Market management will ensure that a balanced mix of fresh fruits and vegetables will be maintained throughout the season. Final selection of fruit and vegetable producers will be made based on their ability to ensure a wide range of fresh farm products throughout the season.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Willingness to Glean.</E> Participants should commit to supporting the USDA food gleaning/food recovery initiative. <PRTPAGE P="324"/>This commitment requires farmers and vendors to donate surplus food and food products at the end of each market day to a local nonprofit organization identified by USDA. Questions about tax deductions for gleaning should be referred to the Internal Revenue Service or a tax advisor. Receipts for donated foods may be obtained from the receiving nonprofit organization.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Commitment to market.</E> Participants must commit to the entire market season and be willing to participate on a regular basis.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Grandfather provision.</E> Market management reserves the right to select several farmers or vendors based on previous participation in the program, consistency in providing quality products, and compliance with operating guidelines.</P>

Selling will not begin before 10 a.m. and will end promptly at 2 p.m. each market day. All participants must be in place, setup and ready to sell by 10 a.m. Due to space restrictions at the site, late arrivals will be located at market management's discretion. All vehicles must vacate the market site no later than 3 p.m.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Notification of Attendance.</E> Each participant must call USDA within 48 hours of a market day if they cannot attend. Failure to provide proper and timely notification may result in termination of participation in the market.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Participant Space.</E> One vehicle is permitted per space; all other vehicles must be removed from the immediate market premises. One space is 16w × 17d feet, and all trucks must fit within that area. There is only room for 15 spaces.</P>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Cooperative Marketing.</E> Participants are permitted to share space with another participant or sell another's products if the arrangement is deemed by market management as beneficial to the market. A co-op must be pre-approved by market management and will not be accepted if similar products are already sold by existing farmers or vendors.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Farm/Business Visits.</E> Market management may visit farm/business locations to verify compliance with market criteria and guidelines. Participants should submit a map and directions to their farm/businesses with their market applications.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 170.14</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>What circumstances will prevent participation in the USDA Farmers Market?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Efforts will be made to accommodate all who apply to participate in the market. However, market management may deny participation in the market because of insufficient space or excess supply of the products to sell, failure to meet the stated criteria, or the participant's noncompliance with the operating guidelines or regulations.</P>
              <P>(b) Participants who sell before the 10 a.m. opening time will be restricted from participating in the market following their second violation. A written warning will be given to the participant for the first violation of this guideline. After the second violation occurs, a letter of reprimand will be given to the participant restricting their participation for the next immediate market day.</P>
              <P>(c) Participants who arrive after the 10 a.m. opening time may be restricted from participating in the market following their second violation. A written warning may be given to the participant for the first violation of this guideline. After the second violation occurs, a letter of reprimand may be given to the participant restricting their participation for the next immediate market day.</P>

Reasonable precautions in labeling ryegrass seed as to kind shall include making or obtaining the results of a fluorescence test unless (1) the shortness of the time interval between receipt of the seed lot and the shipment of the seed in interstate commerce, or (2) dormancy of the seeds in the lot, or (3) other circumstances beyond the control of the shipper prevent such action before the shipment is made. Reasonable precautions in labeling ryegrass seed as to kind shall also include keeping separate each lot labeled on the basis of a separate grower's declaration, invoice, or other documents.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Name of kind.</E> The name of each kind of agricultural or vegetable seed is the name listed in § 201.2 (h) or (i), respectively, except that a name which has become synonymous through broad general usage may be substituted therefor, provided the name does not apply to more than one kind and is not misleading.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Hybrid designation.</E> Seed shall not be designated in labeling as “hybrid” seed unless it comes within the definition of “hybrid” in § 201.2(y).</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Name of variety.</E> The name of each variety of agricultural or vegetable seed is the name determined in accordance with the following considerations:</P>
                <P>(1) The variety name shall represent a subdivision of a kind, which is characterized by growth, plant, fruit, seed, or other characters by which it can be differentiated from other sorts of the same kind.</P>
                <P>(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the name of a new variety shall be the name given by the originator or discoverer of the variety, except that in the event the originator or discoverer of a new unnamed variety, at the time seed of the variety is first introduced into channels of commerce of the United States for sale to the public, cannot or chooses not to name the variety, the name of the variety shall be the first name under which the seed is introduced into such commerce. However, if the variety name so provided is in a language not using the Roman alphabet, the variety shall be given a name by the person authorized under this paragraph to name the variety, in a language using the Roman alphabet.</P>
                <P>(3) The variety name shall not be misleading. The same variety name shall not be assigned to more than one variety of the same kind of seed.</P>
                <P>(4) The status under the Federal Seed Act of a variety name is not modified by the registration of such name as a trademark.</P>
                <P>(5) Names of varieties which through broad general usage prior to July 28, 1956 were recognized variety names, except for hybrid seed corn, shall be considered variety names without regard to the principles stated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>

                <P>(6) The variety name for any variety of hybrid seed corn first introduced into commercial channels in the United States for sale prior to October 20, 1951, shall be any name used for such variety in such channels prior to that date. The variety name for any variety of hybrid seed corn first introduced into commercial channels in the United States for sale on or after October 20, 1951, shall be the name assigned in accordance with paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="343"/>

                <P>(a) The representation of the name of a kind or kind and variety of seed in any advertisement subject to the act shall be confined to the name of the kind or kind and variety determined in accordance with § 201.34. The name shall not have associated therewith words or terms that create a misleading impression as to the history or characteristics of the kind or kind and variety. Descriptive terms and firm names may be used in kind or variety names provided the descriptive terms or firm names are a part of the name or variety of seed; for example, Stringless Green Pod, Detroit Dark Red, Black Seeded Simpson and Henderson Bush Lima. Seed shall not be designated as hybrid seed in any advertisement subject to the act unless it comes within the definition of “hybrid” in § 201.2(y).</P>
                <P>(b) Terms descriptive as to color, shape, size, habit of growth, disease-resistance, or other characteristics of the kind or variety may be associated with the name of the kind or variety provided it is done in a manner which clearly indicates the descriptive term is not a part of the name of the kind or variety; for example, Oshkosh pepper (yellow), Copenhagen Market (round head) cabbage, and Kentucky Wonder (pole) garden bean.</P>

                <P>(c) Terms descriptive of quality or origin and terms descriptive of the basis for representations made may be associated with the name of the kind or variety: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the terms are clearly identified as being other than part of the name of the kind or variety; for example, Fancy quality redtop, Idaho origin alfalfa, and Grower's affidavit of variety Atlas sorghum.</P>
                <P>(d) Terms descriptive of the manner or method of production or processing the seed (for example, certified, registered, delinted, scarified, treated, and hulled), may be associated with the name of the kind or variety of seed, providing such terms are not misleading.</P>

                <P>(e) Brand names and terms taken from trademarks may be associated with the name of the kind or variety of seed as an indication of source: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the terms are clearly identified as being other than a part of the name of the kind or variety; for example, Ox Brand Golden Cross sweet corn. Seed shall not be advertised under a trademark or brand name in any manner that may create the impression that the trademark or brand name is a variety name. If seed advertised under a trademark or brand name is a mixture of varieties and if the variety names are not stated in the advertising, a description similar to a varietal description or a comparison with a named variety shall not be used if it creates the impression that the seed is of a single variety.</P>

                <SUBJECT>General procedure.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) In order to secure a representative sample, equal portions shall be taken from evenly distributed parts of the quantity of seed or screenings to be sampled. Access shall be had to all parts of that quantity. When more than one trierful of seed is drawn from a bag, different paths shall be followed. When more than one handful is taken <PRTPAGE P="345"/>from a bag, the handfuls shall be taken from well-separated points.</P>
                <P>(b) For free-flowing seed in bags or bulk, a probe or trier shall be used. For small free-flowing seed in bags a probe or trier long enough to sample all portions of the bag should be used.</P>
                <P>(c) Non-free-flowing seed, such as certain grass seed, uncleaned seed, or screenings, difficult to sample with a proble or trier, shall be sampled by thrusting the hand into the bulk and withdrawing representative portions. The hand is inserted in an open position and the fingers are held closely together while the hand is being inserted and the portion withdrawn.</P>
                <P>(d) As the seed or screenings are sampled, each portion shall be examined. If there appears to be a lack of uniformity, the portions shall not be combined into a composite sample but shall be retained as separate samples or combined to form individual-container samples to determine such lack of uniformity as may exist.</P>
                <P>(e) When the portions appear to be uniform, they shall be combined to form a composite sample.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Separation.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The working sample shall be weighed in grams to four significant figures and shall then be separated into four parts: (1) Kind or variety to be considered pure seed, (2) other crop seed, (3) weed seed, and (4) inert matter. The components shall be weighed in grams to the same number of decimal places as the working sample. The percentage of each part shall be determined to two decimal places.</P>
                <P>(b) Aids for the classification of pure seed, other crop seed, weed seed, and inert matter may include visual examination, use of transmitted light (diaphanoscope), or specific gravity (seed blowers). Specific instructions for classification of the various components are given in §§ 201.47a to 201.51, inclusive.</P>
                <P>(c) The components shall be weighed and percentages calculated as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) For sample sizes less than 25 grams, all four components shall be weighed; the percentages shall be based on the sum of these weights and not on the original weight. The sum of these weights shall be compared with the original weight of the working sample as a check against the loss of material, or other errors.</P>
                <P>(2) For sample sizes of 25 grams or more, the components—other crop seed, weed seed, and inert matter—shall be weighed separately and their percentages determined by dividing these weights by the original weight of the working sample. The pure seed need not be weighed; its percentage may be determined by subtracting the sum of the percentages of the other three components from 100.</P>

                <P>(3) When rounding off the calculated percentages of each component to the second decimal place, round down if the third decimal place is 4 or less and round up if the third decimal place is 5 or more, except that if any component is determined to be present in any amount calculated to be less than 0.015 percent, then that component shall be <PRTPAGE P="350"/>reported as 0.01 percent. If any component is not found in the purity analysis, then that component shall be reported as 0.00 percent.</P>
                <P>(4) The total percentage of all components shall be 100.00 percent. If the total does not equal 100.00 percent (e.g. 99.99 percent or 100.01 percent), then add to or subtract from the component with the largest value (usually the pure seed component).</P>
                <P>(d) When the working sample consists of two or more similar kinds or varieties which would be difficult to separate in the entire sample, it is permissible to weigh the similar kinds or varieties together as one component and make the separation on a reduced portion of the sample. At least 400 seeds or an equivalent weight shall be taken indiscriminately from the pure seed component and the separation made on this portion. The proportion of each kind present shall then be determined by weight and from this the percentage in the entire sample shall be calculated.</P>

The sample to be blown shall be divided into four approximately equal parts and each blown separately. The 1.157 factor is restricted to the General-type seed blower.</P>
                <P>(iv) The blowing point for side-oats grama shall be a factor of 1.480 of the blowing point determined for Kentucky bluegrass. Before blowing, extraneous material that will interfere with the blowing process shall be removed. The sample to be blown shall be divided into four approximately equal parts and each part blown separately. The 1.480 factor is restricted to the General-type seed blower.</P>
                <P>(3) Calibration samples and instructions are available on loan through the Seed Regulatory and Testing Branch, LS, AMS, Building 306, Room 213, Beltsville, Maryland 20705.</P>
                <P>(4) The calibration samples shall be used to establish a blowing point prior to proceeding with the separation of pure seed and inert matter for these kinds. After completing the blowing procedure, remove all weed and other crop seeds from the light portion and add these to the weed or other crop separation, as appropriate. The remainder of the light portion shall be considered inert matter. Remove all weed and other crop seeds and other inert matter (stems, leaves, dirt) from the heavy portion and add these to the weed seed, other crop seed, or inert matter separations, as appropriate. The remainder of the heavy portion shall be considered pure seed.</P>

                  <P>To find the maximum tolerated range, compute the average percentage of all 100 seed replicates of a given test, rounding off the result to the nearest whole number. The germination is found in the first two columns of the table. When the differences between highest and lowest replicates do not exceed the corresponding values found in the “4 replicates” column, no additional testing is required. However, if the differences exceed the values in the “4 replicates” column, retesting is necessary.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Moisture and aeration of substratum.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The substratum must be moist enough to supply the needed moisture to the seeds at all times. Excessive moisture which will restrict aeration of the seeds should be avoided. Except as provided for those kinds of seeds requiring high moisture levels of the germination media, the substrata should never be so wet that a film of water is formed around the seeds. For most kinds of seeds blotters or other paper substrata should not be so wet that by pressing, a film of water forms around the finger.</P>
                <P>(b) The following formula may be used as a guide in the preparation of sand for germination tests:</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">[118.3 cc. (1 gill) sand/Its weight in grams] × 20.2−8.0 = The number of cc. of water to add to each 100 grams of air-dry sand.</HD>
                <P>(c) The amount of water provided by this formula is satisfactory for seeds the size of clovers and will have to be modified slightly, depending on the kind of seed being tested and the kind of sand used. For example, slightly more moisture should be added when the larger seeds are to be tested.</P>
                <P>(d) In preparing soil tests water should be added to the soil until it can be formed into a ball when squeezed in the palm of the hand but will break freely when pressed between two fingers. After the soil has been moistened it should be rubbed through a sieve and put in the seed containers without packing.</P>

                <P>(e) The addition of water subsequent to placing the seed in test will depend on the evaporation from the substrata in the germination chambers. Since the rate of evaporation will depend upon the relative humidity of the air, it is desirable to keep water in the germination chambers or to provide other means of supplying a relative humidity <PRTPAGE P="358"/>of approximately 95 percent.

                <P>(a) A seed shall be considered to have germinated when it has developed those essential structures which, for the kind of seed under consideration, are indicative of its ability to produce a normal plant under favorable conditions. In general, the following are considered to be essential structures necessary for the continued development of the seedling (although some structures may not be visible in all kinds at the time of seedling evaluation). Seedlings possessing these essential structures are referred to as normal seedlings: Root system (consisting of primary, secondary, seminal, or adventitious roots); hypocotyl; epicotyl; cotyledon(s); terminal bud; primary leaves; and coleoptile and mesocotyl (in the grass family). Abnormal seedlings consist of those with defects to these structures, as described in the abnormal seedling descriptions, and are judged to be incapable of continued growth. The seedling descriptions assume that test conditions were adequate to allow proper assessment of the essential seedling structures.</P>
                <P>(b) Sand and/or soil tests may be used as a guide in determining the classification of questionable seedlings and the evaluation of germination tests made on approved artificial media. This is intended to provide a method of checking the reliability of tests made on artificial substrata when there may be doubt as to the proper evaluation of such tests.</P>
                <P>(c) Seedlings infected with fungi or bacteria should be regarded as normal if all essential structures are present. A seedling that has been seriously damaged by bacteria or fungi from any source other than the specific seed should be regarded as normal if it is determined that all essential structures were present before the injury or damage occurred. Germination counts should be made on samples where contamination and decay are present at approximately 2-day intervals between the usual first count and the final count. During the progress of the germination test, seeds which are obviously dead and moldy and which may be a source of contamination of healthy seeds should be removed at each count and the number of such dead seeds should be recorded. When symptoms of certain diseases develop which can be readily recognized and identified, their presence should be noted.</P>
                <P>(d) Seed units containing more than one seed or embryo, such as New Zealand spinach seed, Beta seed, double fruits of the carrot family (Umbelliferae), multiple seeds of burnet, and seed units of grasses consisting of multiple florets, shall be tested as a single seed and shall be regarded as having germinated if they produce one or more normal seedlings.</P>
                <P>(e) Standard guides for seedling interpretation shall include the following descriptions for specific kinds and groups. The “General Description” for each group of crop kinds describes a seedling without defects. While such a seedling is clearly normal, seedlings with some defects may also be classified as normal, provided the defects do not impair the functioning of the structure. The “Abnormal seedling description” is to be followed when judging the severity of defects.</P>

                <P>(5) Seedling: Frequent counts should be made on multigerm beet since the growing seedlings will separate from <PRTPAGE P="359"/>the cluster making it difficult to identify the source.

Toxic substances from the clusters of beet and Swiss chard may cause discoloring of the hypocotyl and/or root. Seedlings which are slightly discolored are to be classified as normal; however, if there is excessive discoloration, retest by the method in § 201.58(b)(3).</P>

                <P>(iv) Root system: A long primary root. Secondary or adventitious roots may develop within the test period. In certain kinds (e.g. bermudagrass) the primary root may not be readily visible because it is coiled inside the tightly fitting lemma and palea. At the time of evaluation, the glumes should be removed and the root observed. Such seedlings are classified as normal if the primary root has developed. For Kentucky bluegrass, a primary root <FR>1/16</FR> inch (1.6 mm) or more in length is classified as normal.</P>

                <P>(D) Less than one primary leaf.</P>
                <P>(E) Primary leaves too small in proportion to the rest of the seedling, usually associated with visible defects of, or damage to, the main stem of the epicotyl.</P>
                <P>(F) Terminal bud missing or damaged. (If a few seedlings with total or partial decay to the epicotyl are found, they may be classified as normal, provided the hypocotyl and root are normal. The epicotyl on such seedlings usually does not decay when grown in a fairly dry environment and exposed to light. A retest, preferably in soil or sand, will aid in interpretation of such seedlings.)</P>

                <P>(A) Deep open cracks extending into the conducting tissue. (A healed break, sometimes referred to as a “knee,” is considered normal.)</P>
                <P>(B) Malformed, such as markedly shortened, curled, or thickened. (Hypocotyl stunting or curling may be caused by seedling orientation or constriction on or in the substratum.) (Hypocotyl collar rot is the breakdown of hypocotyl tissue initially characterized by a watery appearance and collapse of the hypocotyl below the cotyledonary node. The area later becomes discolored, shrivelled, and necrotic. The condition is caused by insufficient calcium available to the seedling. If hypocotyl collar rot is observed on seedlings of garden bean, the sample involved shall be retested in accordance with § 201.58(b)(12).)</P>

                <P>(A) One or more essential structures impaired as the result of decay from primary infection. (Secondary infection is common in towel and blotter tests. Some pathogens, such as <E T="03">Fusarium, Phomopsis,</E> and <E T="03">Rhizoctonia,</E> can spread through the substratum and infect seedlings some distance away from the primary source.

                <P>(iii) Shoot system: The epicotyl elongates and carries the terminal bud and primary leaves above the soil surface. The stem bears one or more scale leaves and, prior to emergence, is arched near the apex, causing the terminal bud to be pulled through the soil; after emergence, the stem straightens. For practical purposes, the hypocotyl is not discernible and is not an evaluation factor. Buds in the axils of each cotyledon and scale leaf usually remain dormant unless the terminal bud is seriously damaged. In this case, one or more axillary buds may start to develop into a shoot. If the axillary shoot is well-developed, it may be considered normal.</P>

(If a few seedlings with partial decay of the epicotyl are found, they may be classified as normal, provided the hypocotyl and root are normal. The epicotyl on such seedlings usually does not decay when grown in a fairly dry environment and is exposed to light. A retest, preferably in soil or sand, will aid in interpretation of such seedlings.)</P>
                <P>(iii) Hypocotyl:</P>
                <P>(A) Deep open cracks extending into the conducting tissue. (Adventitious roots may occur at the site of injury, particularly on the hypocotyl and near the base of the cotyledons. The seedling is classified as normal if the injury is healed over and other essential structures are normal.)</P>
                <P>(B) Malformed, such as markedly shortened, curled, or thickened. (Hypocotyl development is slow until the roots start functioning. Caution should be exercised to ensure slow seedlings are not classified as abnormal. Hypocotyl stunting or curling also may be caused by seedling orientation or constriction on or in the substratum.)</P>
                <P>(iv) Root:</P>
                <P>(A) None.</P>
                <P>(B) Weak, stubby, or missing primary root with weak secondary or adventitious roots. (Roots of seedlings on “Kimpak” with insufficient moisture may not become established and hypocotyl elongation may appear to be abnormal. There may be curling of the root and hypocotyl. When a number of seedlings are observed with this condition, the sample should be retested.)</P>
                <P>(v) Seedlings:</P>

                <P>(iii) Shoot system: The cotyledons are carried to the soil surface by the hypocotyl which is very thick, narrowing abruptly at the root. Elongation of the hypocotyl stops when the epicotyl is exposed to light at the soil <PRTPAGE P="366"/>surface. The primary leaves are compound and usually expand during the test period.</P>

                <P>(A) Deep open cracks extending into the conducting tissue.</P>
                <P>(B) Malformed, such as markedly shortened or curled. (Hypocotyls remain somewhat thickened and may appear to be stunted. Light, depth of planting, and substratum moisture all contribute to the length of the hypocotyl. Hypocotyl stunting or curling may be caused by seedling orientation or constriction in the substratum. Seedlings planted in a soil test with the radicle too close to the surface may send roots above the soil and appear to exhibit negative geotropism and a distorted, U-shaped hypocotyl.</P>

                <P>(iii) Shoot system: The hypocotyl elongates and carries the cotyledons above the soil surface. The epicotyl usually does not show any development within the test period.</P>
                <P>(iv) Root system: A long, tapering primary root, usually with root hairs. Secondary roots may or may not develop within the test period, depending on the kind.</P>

                <P>(i) Cotyledons:</P>
                <P>(A) Less than half of the original cotyledon tissue remaining attached. (Breaks at the point of attachment of the cotyledons to the hypocotyl are common in seeds which have been mechanically damaged. It is important that seedlings not be removed during preliminary counts unless development is sufficient to allow the conditions of the cotyledons to be determined.

                <P>(iii) Cotyledon: A single cylindrical cotyledon; following germination, all but the basal end remains embedded in the endosperm to absorb nutrients.</P>
                <P>(iv) Shoot system: The epicotyl elongates and carries the terminal bud above the soil surface. The epicotyl may bear several small scale leaves. A short hypocotyl is barely distinguishable, joining the root to the basal end of the cotyledon. More than one shoot may arise simultaneously, and the seedling may be considered normal if at least one shoot is well- developed and has a terminal growing point, provided other essential structures are normal.</P>

                <P>(iii) Cotyledon: A single cylindrical cotyledon. The cotyledon emerges with the seed coat and endosperm attached to the tip. A sharp bend known as the “knee” forms; continued elongation of the cotyledon on each side of this knee pushes it above the soil surface. The cotyledon tip is pulled from the soil and straightens except for a slight kink which remains at the site of the knee.</P>
                <P>(iv) Shoot system: The first foliage leaf emerges through a slit near the base of the cotyledon, but this does not usually occur during the test period. The hypocotyl is a very short transitional zone between the primary root and the cotyledon, and is not distinguishable for purposes of seedling evaluation.</P>
                <P>(v) Root system: A long slender primary root with adventitious roots developing from the hypocotyl. The primary root does not develop secondary roots.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Substrata, temperature, duration of test, and certain other specific directions for testing for germination and hard seed.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Specific germination requirements are set forth in table 2 to which the following paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) are applicable.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions and explainations applicable to table 2</E>—(1) <E T="03">Duration of tests.</E> The following deviations are permitted from the specified duration of tests: Any test may be terminated prior to the number of days listed under “Final count” if the miximum germination of the sample has then been determined. The number of days stated for the first count is approximate and a deviatioon of 1 to 3 days is permitted. If at the time of the prescribed test period the seedlings are not sufficiently developed for positive evaluation, it is possible to extend the time of the test period two additional days. (Also, see paragraph (a)(5) of this section and 201.57.)</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Light.</E> Cool white fluorescent light shall be provided where light is required in table 2. The light intensity shall be 75 to 125 foot-candles (750-1,250 lux). (The light intensity for nondormant seed and during seedling development may be as low as 25 foot-candles to enable the essential structures to be evaluated with greater certainty.) The <PRTPAGE P="371"/>seeds shall be illuminated for at least 8 hours every 24 hours except when transferred to a low temperature germinator during the weekend. When seeds are germinated at alternating temperatures they shall be illuminated during high temperature periods. Seeds for which light is prescribed shall be germinated on top of the substratum except for ryegrass fluorescence tests.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Moisture-on-dry-side.</E> This term means that the moistened substratum should be pressed against a dry absorbent surface such as a dry paper towel or blotter to remove excess moisture. The moisture content thus obtained should be maintained throughout the germination test period.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Potassium nitrate</E> (KNO<E T="52">3</E>). These terms mean a two-tenths (0.2) percent solution of potassium nitrate (KNO<E T="52">3</E>) shall be used in moistening the substratum. Such solution is prepared by dissolving 2 grams of KNO<E T="52">3</E> in 1,000 ml. of distilled water. The grade of the potassium nitrate shall meet A.C.S. specifications.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Prechill.</E> The term “prechill” means a cold, moist treatment applied to seeds to overcome dormancy prior to the germination test. The prechill method varies among kinds, but is usually performed by holding imbibed seeds at a low temperature for a specified period of time. The prechill period is not included in the duration of tests given in table 2, unless otherwise specified.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Predry.</E> The term “predry” means to place the seed in a shallow layer at a temperature of 35° to 40 °C. for a period of 5 to 7 days, with provisions for circulation of the air.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Substrata</E> (<E T="03">Kinds</E>). The symbols used for substrata are:

                <P>(8) <E T="03">Temperature.</E> A single numeral indicates a constant temperature. Two numerals separated by a dash indicate an alternation of temperature, the test to be held at the first temperature for approximately 16 hours and at the second temperature for approximately 8 hours per day. The temperature shall be determined at the substratum level and shall be as uniform as possible throughout the germination chamber. (A sharp alternation of temperature, such as obtained by hand transfer, may be beneficial in breaking dormancy.) If tests are not subjected to alternating temperatures over weekends and on holidays, they are to be held at the first-mentioned temperature during this time. In cases where two temperatures are indicated (separated by a semicolon) the first temperature shall be regarded as the regular method and the second as an alternate method.</P>
                <P>(9) Paper substrata must be free of chemicals toxic to germinating seed and seedling growth. If root injury occurs from toxicity of a paper substratum or from the use of potassium nitrate, retests shall be made on soil or on a substratum moistened with water.</P>
                <P>(10) <E T="03">Ethephon.</E> This term means a 29 parts per million (0.0029 percent) solution of ethephon [(2-chloroethyl) phosphonic acid] which shall be used to moisten the substratum. This solution is prepared by mixing 0.6 ml of a stock solution with 5,000 ml of distilled water. The stock solution contains 24 grams of active material per 100 ml of propylene glycol or two pounds of active material per gallon. A solution which is five times this concentration (5 × 29 ppm) may be used for extremely dormant seeds, provided seeds are transferred to substratum moistened with water after 1 to 3 days.</P>
                <P>(11) <E T="03">Ethylene.</E> This term means that five (5) ml of ethylene gas per cubic foot (176.57 ml/m<SU>3</SU>) of germinator space <PRTPAGE P="372"/>is injected into a germinator in which peanut seeds in moist rolled towels have been placed. Following injection of the ethylene, the germinator is kept closed until the first count (5 days). If the germinator door is opened for the purpose of checking or rewetting the samples, another injection of ethylene at the same rate shall be made.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Special procedures and alternate methods for germination referred to in table 2</E>—(1) <E T="03">Alyceclover; swollen seeds.</E> At the conclusion of the 21-day test period, carefully pierce the seed coat with a sharp instrument and continue the test for 5 additional days. Alternate method: The swollen seeds may be placed at 20 °C for 48 hours and then at 35 °C for 3 additional days.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Bahiagrass; removal of glumes.</E> On all varieties except “Pensacola,” remove the enclosing structures (glumes, lemma, and palea) from the caryopsis with the aid of a sharp scalpel. If the seed is fresh or dormant, lightly scratch the surface of the caryopsis.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Beet, Swiss chard; preparation of seed for test.</E> Before the seeds are placed on the germination substratum, they shall be soaked in water for 2 hours, using at least 250 ml of water per 100 seeds, then washed in running water and the excess water blotted off. The temperature of the soaking and washing water should be no lower than 20 °C. Samples producing excessive discoloration of the hypocotyl or root should be retested in soil or by washing in running water for 3 hours and testing on “Kimpak,” keeping the seed covered with slightly moist blotters. Sugar beets may require 16 hours soaking in water at 25 °C, followed by rinsing and then drying for 2 hours at room temperature.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Buffelgrass; alternate method for dormant seed.</E> The caryopses shall be removed from the fascicles and placed on blotters moistened with a 0.2 percent solution of KNO<E T="52">3</E>, in petri dishes. The seeds from a fascicle should be arranged so they will not be confused with seeds from other fascicles during the test. The seeds are then prechilled at 5 °C for 7 days and tested at 30 °C in light for 21 additional days. Firm ungerminated seeds remaining at the conclusion of the test should be scratched lightly and left in test for 7 additional days.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Cotton (Gossypium spp.); dormant samples.</E> Samples of cottonseed which do not respond to the usual method should be placed in a closed container with water and shaken until the lint is thoroughly wet. The excess moisture should then be blotted off.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Endive (Cichorium endivia); dormant samples.</E> Add about <FR>1/8</FR> inch of tap water at the beginning of the test and remove excess water after 24 hours.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Green needlegrass</E>; two test methods as prescribed in table 2 shall be used on each sample:</P>

                <P>(i) For method 1, acid scarify 400 seeds for 10 minutes in concentrated sulfuric acid (95 to 98 percent H<E T="52">2</E> SO<E T="52">4</E>). Rinse seeds and dry on blotters for 16 hours, then place seeds on blotters moistened with a solution of 0.055 percent (500 ppm gibberellic acid GA<E T="52">3</E>) and 0.46 percent (3,000 ppm) thiram and germinate 14 days.</P>

                <P>(ii) For method 2, plant 400 seeds on blotters moistened with a 0.2 percent solution of KNO<E T="52">3</E> and germinate 14 days. Refer to § 201.57a(c).</P>
                <P>(iii) Report the results of method 2 as the percentage germination. If the number in method 2 is less than method 1, subtract the results of method 2 from method 1 and report the difference as dormant seed.</P>
                <P>(8) <E T="03">Rescue grass</E> (<E T="03">Bromus catharticus</E>)<E T="03">; dormant samples.</E> Wash for 48 hours in running water, or soak for 48 hours, changing the water and rinsing each morning and night.</P>
                <P>(9) <E T="03">Rice</E> (<E T="03">Oryza sativa</E>)—<E T="03">Alternate method.</E> Plant the seeds in moist sand. On the seventh day of the test add water to a depth of one-fourth inch above the sand level and leave for the remainder of the test. Only a final count is made. Dormant seeds: Presoak 24 to 48 hours in 40 °C. water. For deeply dormant seeds, presoak 24 hours in 1,000 p.p.m. ethylene chlorohydrin or 5 percent solution of sodium hypochlorite (clorox at bottle strength).</P>
                <P>(10) <E T="03">Ryegrass; fluorescence test.</E> The germination test for fluorescence of ryegrass shall be conducted in light [not to exceed 100 foot candles (1,076 lux)] with white filter paper as the substratum. The white filter paper should be nontoxic to the roots of ryegrass <PRTPAGE P="373"/>and of a texture that will resist penetration of ryegrass roots. Distilled or deionized water shall be used to moisten the filter paper. The test shall be conducted in a manner that will prevent the contact of roots of different seedlings. Roots of some seedlings produce fluorescent lines on white filter paper when viewed under ultraviolet light. First counts shall not be made before the eighth day; at that time remove only normal fluorescent seedlings. Evaluation of fluorescence shall be made under F15T8-BLB or comparable ultraviolet tubes in an area where light from other sources is excluded. If there are over 75 percent normal fluorescent seedlings present at the time of the first count, break the contact of the roots of the nonfluorescent seedlings from the substratum and reread the fluorescence at the time of the final count. At the final count, lift each remaining seedling, observing the path of each root since sometimes faint fluorescence will show on the substratum as the root is lifted. Abnormal seedlings and dead seeds are not evaluated for fluorescence. See § 201.58a(a).</P>
                <P>(11) <E T="03">Trifolium, Medicago, Melilotus, and Vicia faba; temperature requirements.</E> A temperature of 18 °C. is desirable for <E T="03">Trifolium</E> spp., <E T="03">Medicago</E> spp., <E T="03">Melilotus</E> spp., and <E T="03">Vicia faba.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(12) <E T="03">Garden bean; use of calcium nitrate.</E> If hypocotyl collar rot is observed on seedlings, the sample involved shall be retested using a 0.3 to 0.6 percent solution of calcium nitrate (CaNO<E T="52">3</E>) to moisten the substratum.</P>
                <P>(13) <E T="03">Fourwing Saltbush (Atriplex canscens); preparation of seed for test.</E> DE-wing seeds and soak for 2 hours in 3 leters of water after which rince with approximately 3 leters of distilled water. Remove excess water, air dry for 7 days at room temperature, then test for germination as indicated in Table 2.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedures for coated seed.</E> (1) Germination tests on coated seed shall be conducted in accordance with methods in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. However, kinds for which soaking or washing is specified in paragraph (b) shall not be soaked or washed in the case of coated seed.</P>
                <P>(i) Coated seed units shall be placed on the substratum in the condition in which they are received without rinsing, soaking, or any other pretreatment.</P>
                <P>(ii) Coated seed units in mixtures which are color coded or can otherwise be separated by kinds shall be germinated as separate kinds without removing the coating material.</P>
                <P>(iii) Coated seed units in mixtures which cannot be separated by kinds without removing the coating material shall be de-coated and germinated as separate kinds. The coating material shall be removed in a manner that will not affect the germination capacity of the seeds.</P>
                <P>(2) The moisture level of the substratum is important. It may depend on the water-absorbing capacity of the coating material. A retest may be necessary before satisfactory germination of the sample is achieved.</P>
                <P>(3) Phytotoxic symptoms may be evident when germinating coated seeds in paper substrata. In such cases a retest in sand or soil may be necessary.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Ryegrass.</E> In determining the pure seed percentage of perennial ryegrass and annual ryegrass, 400 seeds shall be grown on white filter paper and the number of fluorescent seedlings determined under ultraviolet light at the end of the germination period (see § 201.58(b)(10)).</P>
                <P>(1) Fluorescence results are to be determined as test fluorescence level (TFL) to two decimal places as follows:</P>

                <P>(3) Using results from the above formula, the percentage of annual ryegrass is calculated as follows:
                </P>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">% Annual Ryegrass = % Pure Ryegrass−% Perennial Ryegrass</FP>
                
                <P>(4) If the test fluorescence level (TFL) of a perennial ryegrass is equal to or less than the variety fluorescence level (VFL) described for the variety, all pure ryegrass is considered to be perennial ryegrass and the formula is not applied.</P>
                <P>(5) If the test fluorescence level (TFL) of an annual ryegrass is equal to or greater than the variety fluorescence level (VFL) described for the variety, all pure ryegrass is considered to be annual ryegrass and the formula is not applied.</P>

                <P>(6) A list of variety fluorescence level (VFL) descriptions for perennial ryegrass varieties which are more than 0 percent fluorescent and annual ryegrass varieties which are less than 100 percent fluorescent is maintained and <PRTPAGE P="382"/>published by the National Grass Variety Review Board of the Association of Official Seed Certifying Agencies (AOSCA). If the variety being tested is not stated or the fluorescence level has not been described, the fluorescence level shall be considered to be 0 percent for perennial ryegrass and 100 percent for annual ryegrass. Both VFL (annual) and VFL (perennial) values must always be entered in the formula. If a perennial ryegrass variety is being tested, the VFL (annual) value is 100 percent. If an annual ryegrass variety is being tested, the VFL (perennial) value is 0 percent. For blends the fluorescence level shall be interpolated according to the portion of each variety claimed to be present.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Sweetclover.</E> To determine the presence of yellow sweetclover in samples of white sweetclover, at least 400 seeds shall be subjected to the chemical test as follows:</P>

                <P>(1) Preparation of test solution: Add 3 grams of cupric sulfate (CuSO<E T="52">4</E>) to 30 ml of household ammonia (NH<E T="52">4</E> OH, approximately 4.8 percent) in a stoppered bottle to form tetraamminecopper sulfate ([Cu(NH<E T="52">3</E>)<E T="52">4</E>]SO<E T="52">4</E>) solution used for this test. After mixing, a light blue precipitate of cupric hydroxide (Cu(OH)<E T="52">2</E>) should form. If no precipitate forms, add additional CuSO<E T="52">4</E> until a precipitate appears. Since the strength of household ammonia can vary, formation of a precipitate indicates that a complete reaction has taken place between CuSO<E T="52">4</E> and NH<E T="52">4</E> OH; otherwise fumes from excess ammonium hydroxide may cause eye irritation.</P>
                <P>(2) Preparation of seeds: To insure imbibition, scratch, prick, or otherwise scarify the seed coats of the sweetclover seeds being tested. Soak seeds in water for 2 to 5 hours in a glass container.</P>
                <P>(3) Chemical reaction: When seeds have imbibed, remove excess water and add enough test solution to cover the seeds. Seeds coats of yellow sweetclover will begin to stain dark brown to black; seed coats of white sweetclover will be olive or yellow-green. Make the separation within 20 minutes, since the seed coats of white sweetclover will eventually turn black also.</P>
                <P>(4) Calculation of results: Count the number of seeds which stain dark brown or black and divide by the total number of seeds tested; multiply by the pure seed percentage for Melilotus spp.; the result is the percentage of yellow sweetclover in the sample. The percentage of white sweetclover is found by subtracting the percentage of yellow sweetclover from the percentage of Melilotus spp. pure seed.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Wheat.</E> In determining varietal purity, the phenol test may be used. From the pure seed sample count four replicates of 100 seeds each. Soak the seed in distilled water for 16 hours; then flush with tap water and remove the excess water from the surface of the seeds. Place two layers of filter paper in a container and moisten with a 1 percent phenol (C<E T="52">6</E> H<E T="52">5</E> OH) solution. Place the seed, palea side down, on the two layers of filter paper and cover the container. A preliminary observation may be made at 2 hours. At 4 hours, record the number of seeds in each of the following color categories:</P>
                <P>(1) Ivory.</P>
                <P>(2) Fawn.</P>
                <P>(3) Light Brown.</P>
                <P>(4) Brown.</P>
                <P>(5) Brown Black.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Soybean.</E> In determining the varietal purity, the peroxidase test may be used. Remove and place the dry seed coat from seeds into individual test tubes or suitable containers. Add 10 drops (0.5-1.0 ml) of 0.5 percent guaiacol (C<E T="52">7</E> H<E T="52">8</E> O<E T="52">2</E>) to each test tube. After waiting 10 minutes add one drop (about 0.1 ml) of 0.1 percent hydrogen peroxide (H<E T="52">2</E> O<E T="52">2</E>). One minute after adding hydrogen peroxide, record the seed coat as peroxidase positive (high peroxidase activity) indicated by a reddish-brown solution or peroxidase negative (low peroxidase activity) indicated by a colorless solution in the test tube. Various sample sizes may be used for this test. Test results shall include the sample size tested.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Oat.</E> In determining the varietal purity, the fluorescence test may be used. Place at least 400 seeds on a black background under a F15T8-BLB or comparable ultraviolet tube(s) in an area where light from other sources is excluded. Seeds are considered fluorescent if the lemma or palea fluoresce or <PRTPAGE P="383"/>appear light in color. “Partially fluorescent” seeds shall be considered fluorescent. Seeds are considered nonfluorescent if the lemma and palea do not fluoresce and appear dark in color under the ultraviolet light.</P>

                <P>A fungal endophyte test may be used to determine the amount of fungal endophyte (<E T="03">Acremonium</E> spp.) in certain grasses.</P>
                <P>(a) Method of preparation of aniline blue stain for use in testing grass seed and plant material for the presence of fungal endophyte:</P>
                <P>(1) Prepare a 1 percent aqueous aniline blue solution by dissolving 1 gram aniline blue in 100 ml distilled water.</P>

                <P>(2) Prepare the endophyte staining solution of one part of 1 percent aniline blue solution with 2 parts of 85 percent lactic acid (C<E T="52">3</E> H<E T="52">6</E> O<E T="52">3</E>).</P>
                <P>(3) Use stain as-is or dilute with water if staining is too dark.</P>
                <P>(b) Procedure for determining levels of fungal endophyte in grass seed:</P>
                <P>(1) Take a sub-sample of seed (1 gram is sufficient) from the pure seed portion of the kind under consideration.</P>
                <P>(2) Digest seed at room temperature for 12-16 hours in a 5 percent sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution or other temperature/time combination resulting in adequate seed softening.</P>
                <P>(3) Rinse thoroughly in running tap water.</P>
                <P>(4) De-glume seeds and place on a microscope slide in a drop of endophyte staining solution. Slightly crush the seeds. Use caution to prevent carryover hyphae of fungal endophyte from one seed to another.</P>
                <P>(5) Place coverglass on seed and apply gentle pressure.</P>
                <P>(6) Examine with compound microscope at 100-400x magnification, scoring a seed as positive if any identifiable hyphae are present.</P>
                <P>(7) Various sample sizes may be used for this test. Precision changes with sample size; therefore, the test results must include the sample size tested.</P>
                <P>(c) Procedure for determining levels of fungal endophyte in seedlings from seed samples suspected to contain fungal endophyte:</P>
                <P>(1) Select seeds at random and germinate.</P>
                <P>(2) Examine seedlings from the sample germinated after growing for a minimum of 48 days.</P>
                <P>(3) Remove the outermost sheath from the seedling. Tissue should have no obvious discoloration from saprophytes and should have as little chlorophyll as possible.</P>
                <P>(4) Isolate a longitudinal section of leaf sheath approximately 3-5 mm in width.</P>
                <P>(5) Place the section on a microscope slide with the epidermis side down.</P>
                <P>(6) Stain immediately with the endophyte staining solution as prepared in paragraph (a) (2) and (3) of this section. Allow dye to remain at least 15 seconds but no more than one minute.</P>
                <P>(7) Blot off the excess dye with tissue paper. Sections should remain on the slide, but may adhere to the tissue paper; if so, remove and place in proper position on the slide.</P>
                <P>(8) Place a coverglass on the sections and flood with water.</P>
                <P>(9) Proceed with evaluation as described in paragraph (b) (6) and (7) of this section.</P>

Rates per pound or ounce must be converted to the equivalent number of seeds found in § 201.46, Table 1, Minimum weight for noxious-weed seed examination (grams). Some tolerances are listed in the following table. The number found as represented by the label or test (Column X) will be considered within tolerance if not more than the corresponding numbers in Column Y are found by analysis in the administration of the Act. For numbers of seed greater than those in the table, a tolerance based on a degree of certainty of 5 percent (P = 0.05) can be calculated by the formula, Y = X + 1.65√X + 0.03, where X is the number of seeds represented by the label or test and Y is the maximum number within tolerance.</P>

                <P>(ii) Temperature level, ventilation, and air circulation suitable to the species; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Reduction of potential for livestock injury;</P>
                <P>(5) The use of yards, feeding pads, feedlots and laneways that shall be well-drained, kept in good condition (including frequent removal of wastes), and managed to prevent runoff of wastes and contaminated waters to adjoining or nearby surface water and across property boundaries.</P>
                <P>(b) The producer of an organic livestock operation may provide temporary confinement or shelter for an animal because of:</P>
                <P>(1) Inclement weather;</P>
                <P>(2) The animal's stage of life: Except, that lactation is not a stage of life that would exempt ruminants from any of the mandates set forth in this regulation;</P>

                <P>(8) 4-H, Future Farmers of America and other youth projects, for no more than one week prior to a fair or other demonstration, through the event and up to 24 hours after the animals have arrived home at the conclusion of the event. These animals must have been maintained under continuous organic management, including organic feed, during the extent of their allowed confinement for the event.</P>

                <P>(c) The producer of an organic livestock operation may, in addition to the <PRTPAGE P="418"/>times permitted under § 205.239(b), temporarily deny a ruminant animal pasture or outdoor access under the following conditions:</P>
                <P>(1) One week at the end of a lactation for dry off (for denial of access to pasture only), three weeks prior to parturition (birthing), parturition, and up to one week after parturition;</P>

                <P>(2) In the case of newborn dairy cattle for up to six months, after which they must be on pasture during the grazing season and may no longer be individually housed: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That, an animal shall not be confined or tethered in a way that prevents the animal from lying down, standing up, fully extending its limbs, and moving about freely;</P>

                <P>(4) In the case of dairy animals, for short periods daily for milking. Milking must be scheduled in a manner to ensure sufficient grazing time to provide each animal with an average of at least 30 percent DMI from grazing throughout the grazing season. Milking frequencies or duration practices cannot be used to deny dairy animals pasture.</P>
                <P>(d) Ruminant slaughter stock, typically grain finished, shall be maintained on pasture for each day that the finishing period corresponds with the grazing season for the geographical location: Except, that, yards, feeding pads, or feedlots may be used to provide finish feeding rations. During the finishing period, ruminant slaughter stock shall be exempt from the minimum 30 percent DMI requirement from grazing. Yards, feeding pads, or feedlots used to provide finish feeding rations shall be large enough to allow all ruminant slaughter stock occupying the yard, feeding pad, or feed lot to feed simultaneously without crowding and without competition for food. The finishing period shall not exceed one-fifth (<FR>1/5</FR>) of the animal's total life or 120 days, whichever is shorter.</P>
                <P>(e) The producer of an organic livestock operation must manage manure in a manner that does not contribute to contamination of crops, soil, or water by plant nutrients, heavy metals, or pathogenic organisms and optimizes recycling of nutrients and must manage pastures and other outdoor access areas in a manner that does not put soil or water quality at risk.</P>

                <P>(e) An applicant for certification who has received a written notification of noncompliance or a written notice of denial of certification may apply for certification again at any time with any certifying agent, in accordance with §§ 205.401 and 205.405(e). When such applicant submits a new application to a certifying agent other than the agent who issued the notification of noncompliance or notice of denial of certification, the applicant for certification must include a copy of the notification of noncompliance or notice of denial of certification and a description of the actions taken, with supporting documentation, to correct the noncompliances noted in the notification of noncompliance.</P>
